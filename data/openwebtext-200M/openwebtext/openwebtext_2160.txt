Wal - Mart Stores Inc. is about to change one of the most familiar logos in corporate America .
Part of Wal - Mart 's continuing effort to update its once - dowdy image , the new logo for signs and building facades includes white letters on a burnt - orange background followed by a white starburst , according to an artist 's rendering that the company filed recently with planning officials in Memphis , Tenn .
In a change , the name will appear as one word : Walmart .
When the company first started in 1962 , the name was hyphenated by a dash .
But in the past decade , the dash has been replaced by a star on stores and the corporate letterhead .
Initially , the store logo included white letters on a brown brick exterior .
About 20 years ago , Wal - Mart moved to a sign that affixed white letters onto a battleship blue / gray background , bordered by red strips .
Wal - Mart has n't officially unveiled the new design , and the company did n't return repeated calls for comment .

Ahhhhh the 70’s … the decade where the first Star Wars movie was released , where afro haircuts where all the rage , and where the first digital camera came into existence .
Yep , you read that right !
In 1975 , Kodak released the world ’s first digital camera prototype , a clunky - looking device that used casette tapes as the medium to store pictures .
Each photo took 23 seconds to snap , producing a 100 - line black and white image that could only be displayed on a television set .
No wonder why it never became popular .

He also said that he would like to negotiate a peace accord with Beijing officials someday that would end hostilities across the Taiwan Strait , using a diplomatic framework in which each side would acknowledge each other ’s existence without resolving less tractable issues of sovereignty .

Chinese government officials still had no response to the election results by Sunday morning , but had made little secret of their hope that Mr. Ma would win .
“ China has a love - hate relationship with Ma  when I visited China last November , they criticized Ma a lot , and then asked me to vote for Ma , ” said Yen Chen - Shen , a political scientist at National Chengchi University .
American officials have been deeply frustrated with President Chen Shui-bian , also of the Democratic Progressive Party , and have sought to reduce tensions between Taiwan and the mainland while preserving the status quo .
Mr. Chen is stepping down after two four - year terms .
But the Bush administration has also been irritated by the reluctance of Nationalists in the legislature to vote for purchases of American weapon systems .
Many in Taiwan have preferred to spend money on social programs while relying on the United States military to deter aggression by the mainland , prompting bitter jokes among American military personnel that if mainland military forces ever land on Taiwan , the Taiwanese will fight them to the last American .
Cheng Ta-chen , a Nationalist aide to Mr. Ma on security policy , said that the Nationalists had not been given enough information by President Chen to understand and approve military purchases .
President Bush , in a statement , congratulated Mr. Ma on the victory and called it a step toward better relations with the mainland .
“ I believe the election provides a fresh opportunity for both sides to reach out and engage one another in peacefully resolving their differences , ” he said .
After his inauguration , scheduled for May 20 , Mr. Ma will have almost complete political power to pursue his agenda .
His party and two tiny affiliated parties together took three - quarters of the legislature in January elections .
Nationalists also serve as the magistrates , a position akin to mayor , in 15 of Taiwan ’s 25 largest cities .
The extent of Nationalist control made some voters nervous on Saturday .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
With gas , grain , and dairy prices exploding , you 'd think the biggest seller of corn flakes and Cocoa Puffs would be getting hit by rising food costs .
But Wal - Mart has temporarily rolled back prices on hundreds of food items by as much as 30 % this year .
How ?
By pressuring vendors to take costs out of the supply chain .
" When our grocery suppliers bring price increases , we do n't just accept them , " says Pamela Kohn , Wal - Mart 's general merchandise manager for perishables .
To be sure , Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) is n't the only retailer working to cut fat from the food chain , but as the largest grocer - Wal - Mart 's food and consumables revenue is nearly $ 100 billion - it has a disproportionate amount of leverage .
Here 's how the retailer is throwing its weight around .
Shrink the goods .
Ever wonder why that cereal box is only two - thirds full ?
Foodmakers love big boxes because they serve as billboards on store shelves .
Wal - Mart has been working to change that by promising suppliers that their shelf space wo n't shrink even if their boxes do .
As a result , some of its vendors have reengineered their packaging .
General Mills ' ( GIS , Fortune 500 ) Hamburger Helper is now made with denser pasta shapes , allowing the same amount of food to fit into a 20 % smaller box at the same price .
The change has saved 890,000 pounds of paper fiber and eliminated 500 trucks from the road , giving General Mills a cushion to absorb some of the rising costs .
Cut out the middleman .
Wal - Mart typically buys its brand - name coffee from a supplier , which buys from a cooperative of growers , which works with a roaster - which means " there are a whole bunch of people muddled in the middle , " says Wal - Mart spokeswoman Tara Raddohl .
In April the chain began buying directly from a cooperative of Brazilian coffee farmers for its Sam's Choice brand , cutting three or four steps out of the supply chain .
Go locovore .
Wal - Mart has been going green , but not entirely for the reasons you might think .
By sourcing more produce locally - it now sells Wisconsin - grown yellow corn in 56 stores in or near Wisconsin - it is able to cut shipping costs .
" We are looking at how to reduce the number of miles our suppliers ' trucks travel , " says Kohn .
Marc Turner , whose Bushwick Potato Co. supplies Wal - Mart stores in the Northeast , says the cost of shipping one truck of spuds from his farm in Maine to local Wal - Mart stores costs less than $ 1,000 , compared with several thousand dollars for a big rig from Idaho .
Last year his shipments to Wal - Mart grew 13 % .
In fact , it 's the small suppliers that are feeling the pain from Wal - Mart 's pushback the most .
Bushwick has seen its costs rise 10 % over the past year , but has passed only half that amount on to Wal - Mart and its other retailers .
For consumers who are having a hard time paying $ 3.80 for a gallon of milk , however , without those measures that sticker shock would be a lot worse .
Slouching over a desk is certainly not recommended Sitting up straight is not the best position for office workers , a study has suggested .
Scottish and Canadian researchers used a new form of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to show it places an unnecessary strain on your back .
They told the Radiological Society of North America that the best position in which to sit at your desk is leaning back , at about 135 degrees .
Experts said sitting was known to contribute to lower back pain .
Data from the British Chiropractic Association says 32 % of the population spends more than 10 hours a day seated .
Half do not leave their desks , even to have lunch .
Two thirds of people also sit down at home when they get home from work .
Spinal angles
The research was carried out at Woodend Hospital in Aberdeen .
Twenty two volunteers with healthy backs were scanned using a positional MRI machine , which allows patients the freedom to move - so they can sit or stand - during the test .
Our bodies are not designed to be so sedentary
Rishi Loatey , British Chiropractic Association Traditional scanners mean patients have to lie flat , which may mask causes of pain that stem from different movements or postures .
In this study , the patients assumed three different sitting positions : a slouching position , in which the body is hunched forward as if they were leaning over a desk or a video game console , an upright 90 - degree sitting position ; and a " relaxed " position where they leaned back at 135 degrees while their feet remained on the floor .
The researchers then took measurements of spinal angles and spinal disk height and movement across the different positions .
Spinal disk movement occurs when weight - bearing strain is placed on the spine , causing the disk to move out of place .
Disk movement was found to be most pronounced with a 90 - degree upright sitting posture .
It was least pronounced with the 135 - degree posture , suggesting less strain is placed on the spinal disks and associated muscles and tendons in a more relaxed sitting position .
The " slouch " position revealed a reduction in spinal disk height , signifying a high rate of wear and tear on the lowest two spinal levels .
When they looked at all test results , the researchers said the 135 - degree position was the best for backs , and say this is how people should sit .
' Tendency to slide ' Dr Waseem Bashir of the Department of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging at the University of Alberta Hospital , Canada , who led the study , said : " Sitting in a sound anatomic position is essential , since the strain put on the spine and its associated ligaments over time can lead to pain , deformity and chronic illness . "
Rishi Loatey of the British Chiropractic Association said : " One in three people suffer from lower back pain and to sit for long periods of time certainly contributes to this , as our bodies are not designed to be so sedentary . "
Levent Caglar from the charity BackCare , added : " In general , opening up the angle between the trunk and the thighs in a seated posture is a good idea and it will improve the shape of the spine , making it more like the natural S - shape in a standing posture .
" As to what is the best angle between thigh and torso when seated , reclining at 135 degrees can make sitting more difficult as there is a tendency to slide off the seat : 120 degrees or less may be better . "

A leading plastic surgeon today dismissed claims that a powder made from a pig 's bladder caused the regrowth of a man 's fingertip .
Professor Simon Kay , professor of hand surgery at the University of Leeds , said the claims by the US company that developed the powder were " junk science " .
Lee Spievack , a hobby store salesman in Cincinnati , Ohio , has claimed the treatment stimulated the regrowth of his right hand middle fingertip , which was severed in 2005 by the propeller of a model plane .
Spievack , 69 , described the powder as " pixie dust " .
It was developed by ACell - a company co-founded by his brother Alan , a former Harvard surgeon .
Within four weeks of using the preparation , he said his finger had regained its original length , and four months later " it looked like my normal finger " .
But Kay , consultant plastic and hand surgeon at St James ' University Hospital , Leeds , said Spievack 's injury did not look to have been serious from studying before and after photos .
" It 's a ridiculous story – absurd and over - egged in the extreme , " Kay said .
" It looked to have been an ordinary fingertip injury with quite unremarkable healing .
All wounds go through a repair process . "
ACell , the company behind the claim , said it had already used the extract of pig bladder to treat ulcers and other wounds , and to help regrow cartilage .
The powder was mostly collagen and a variety of substances , without any pig cells , said Dr Stephen Badylak , a regeneration researcher at the University of Pittsburgh and scientific adviser to ACell .
He said it formed microscopic scaffolding for human cells to occupy , and emitted chemical signals to encourage those cells to regenerate tissue .
The signals did not specifically say " make a finger " but cells picked up that message from their surroundings , Badylak said .
" We 're not smart enough to figure out how to regrow a finger , " Badylak said .
" Maybe what we can do is bring all the pieces of the puzzle to the right place and then let mother nature take its course .
" But we are very uninformed about how all of this works .
There 's a lot more that we do n't know than we do know . "
Kay said there was " no evidence " that ACell had manipulated the regenerative capabilities of the human body .
" There 's no clinical evidence to support the claims , " he said .
" It really is junk science .
" If you could regenerate body parts like this , your first port of call would be a serious science journal like Nature because it would be a Nobel prize winning revolution . "
British scientists have led the way in research into genetic treatments that could enable humans to regrow limbs damaged by accidents or surgery and allow patients to recover from wounds without scarring .
A charity , the Healing Foundation , which funds research into pioneering scientific techniques , set up a 25 - year project in 2005 with the University of Manchester to advance the understanding of wound healing and tissue regeneration .
The Healing Foundation Centre aims to unravel the genetic quirks that allow certain amphibians , such as frogs and salamanders , to recover from severe injuries by generating fresh body tissue .
By identifying the genetic mechanisms involved , the researchers hope to develop medical treatments that do the same in humans .
Professor Enrique Amaya , a tissue engineer at Manchester University and leader of the project , is investigating the regenerative capabilities of frogs .
Frog embryos share the human embryo's ability to heal wounds without scars in a matter of hours .
Frogs can also regrow appendages .
Mr Blair has recently announced his conversion to Catholicism Former prime minister Tony Blair has promised to " spend the rest of my life " uniting the world 's religions
He said faith could be a " civilising force in globalisation " , bringing people together to solve problems such as malaria and extreme poverty .
Mr Blair , who is now a peace envoy to the Middle East , told Time magazine that religious belief had given him " strength " while in power .
He is launching a " faith foundation " in New York on Friday .
Mr Blair , who recently converted to Catholicism , said : " Faith is part of our future , and faith and the values it brings with it are an essential part of making globalisation work . "
' Fantastic thing '
His foundation will attempt to bring religions together to tackle global issues such as the UN 's eight Millennium Development Goals , which range from eradicating extreme poverty to ensuring environmental sustainability .
One of its first priorities will be to fight the spread of malaria .
Mr Blair said : " If you got churches and mosques and those of the Jewish faith working together to provide the bed nets that are necessary to eliminate malaria , what a fantastic thing that would be .
You do n't put a hotline up to God and get the answers
Tony Blair " That would show faith in action , it would show the importance of cooperation between faiths , and it would show what faith can do for progress . "
He added that it was possible to " achieve a greater understanding between the different religious faiths , so that we make platforms for action by those faiths and deal with some of the biggest issues in the world " .
Mr Blair 's press secretary Alastair Campbell , when asked about his boss 's faith , once famously remarked that the government did n't " do God " .
But Mr Blair , 55 , has recently spoken out on the subject far more than during his 10 years in Downing Street .
Discussing decisions he made as prime minister , he told Time : " You do n't put a hotline up to God and get the answers .
" The worst thing in politics is when you 're so scared of losing support that you do n't do what you think is the right thing .
" What faith can do is not tell you what is right but give you the strength to do it . "
Mr Blair is not being paid for his work as a Middle East envoy for the " Quartet " of the United Nations , United States , European Union and Russia .
But he has lucrative consultancy posts with insurer Zurich and merchant bank JP Morgan , on top of a reported £ 5 m deal for his Downing Street memoirs .

Breathing is the life giving force that keeps us alive .
We may be able to survive without water for some time but we certainly cannot live without air .
Human lungs are capable of holding up to two gallons of air but most people breathe only two or three pints per breath .
Breathing is associated with the chest and abdominal breathing is not known to many .
Breathing with the abdomen , also called diaphragmatic breathing , involves expanding the abdomen while inhaling and then expanding the chest while exhaling .
This form of breathing ensures that blood is directed towards the vital organs , improving energy levels .
Alternative health practices such as Yoga , Qigong and Tai Chi focus mainly on breathing and simple body movements .
Good breathing techniques , along with burning calories , also have a harmonizing influence on every system in the body .
Yoga : Yoga is one of the most ancient practices of self healing , which teaches the basic principle of mind , body and spirit unity .
If the mind is restless and agitated , the health of the body is compromised .
Similarly , if the body is in poor health , the mind is affected .
One important aspect of yoga is that it increases the flow of prana ( life energy . )
The blockage of prana through improper diet , lifestyle stressors or imbalances in the mind , body or spirit can lead to illness .
Breathing techniques and certain postures remove blockages and improve oxygen intake .
The most well - known yoga is Hatha yoga , which teaches breathing techniques ( pranayama ) and certain postures ( asanas ) to create unbelievable positive changes in the body and mind .
These breathing techniques help exercise the inner organs of the body , help lose weight , get glowing skin and make the person feel very energetic physically and mentally .
Yoga is also said to be a cure for many diseases , such as diabetes , hypertension etc .
Qigong :
This is an ancient exercise that balances and stimulates the flow of “ qi ” ( chee , ) meaning life force , along energy pathways .
Qigong is said to cultivate inner strength , calmness of the mind and has the capacity to restore the body to its natural state of health .
It is very easy to learn and can even be performed by disabled people .
Qigong exercises can range from the simple calisthenics - type movements with breath coordination to the more difficult exercises that provide deep relaxation , improve strength and flexibility , burn calories as well as reverse damage done by disease and injuries .
Tai Chi : A slow and unique Chinese system that consists of slow , flowing and continuous movements , which provide vitality and a sense of tranquility .
It is gentle yet effective in stretching muscles and providing good blood circulation .
It is said that Tai Chi is great for emotional well - being .
Tai Chi teaches the mind how to control the body and promotes weight loss when practiced regularly .
You can shed fat and become fit through all these exercises that are not vigorous or taxing .
Most people who have not practiced any of the above and who have not experienced the benefits , may have doubts as to their value .
How can simple movements in different poses and deep breathing compare with aerobics , running or lifting weights ?
These movements may look too soft to promote fitness or too slow to be considered an exercise , but they deliver extraordinary physiological benefits .
While other forms of exercises focus solely on body weight and muscular development , these practices , while helping shed fat , provide the body with other benefits that standard exercises may not .
The best thing about them is that once a person takes a structured course and learns the breathing techniques and exercises , they can be done at home .
Fungi could help clean up toxic war zones , scientists at a Scottish university have discovered .
Dundee University researchers have found evidence that fungi can " lock " depleted uranium into a mineral form .
This would make it more difficult for the heavy metal - used in armour - piercing shells - to find its way into plants , animals or the water supply .
The fungal - produced minerals are capable of long - term uranium retention , the scientists say .
Prof Geoffrey Gadd , from the university 's College of Life Sciences , said : " This work provides yet another example of the incredible properties of micro-organisms in effecting transformations of metals and minerals in the natural environment .
DEPLETED URANIUM
Has a reduced proportion of isotope Uranium - 235 Less radioactive than natural uranium and very dense Military uses include defensive armour plating , armour - penetrating ordnance Can be inhaled as dust or ingested in contaminated food and water near impact sites " Because fungi are perfectly suited as biogeochemical agents - often they dominate the biota in polluted soils , and play a major role in the establishment and survival of plants through their association with roots - fungal - based approaches should not be neglected in our attempts to deal with metal - polluted soils . "
The testing of depleted uranium ammunition and its recent use in Iraq and the Balkans had led to contamination of the environment with the unstable metal , said Prof Gadd , who heads the Division of Molecular and Environmental Biology at Dundee .
Depleted uranium differs from natural uranium .
It is the by - product of uranium enrichment for use in nuclear reactors or nuclear weapons and is valued for its very high density .
Although less radioactive than natural uranium , depleted uranium is just as toxic and poses a threat to people .
In the new study , the researchers found that free - living and plant fungi can colonise depleted uranium surfaces and transform the metal into uranyl phosphate minerals .
Professor Gadd said that while they likely still posed some threat , " the fungal - produced minerals are capable of long - term uranium retention , so this may help prevent uptake of uranium by plants , animals and microbes .
It might also prevent the spent uranium from leaching out from the soil . "
The research , published in the journal Current Biology , concludes that the discovery could lead to uranium - polluted soils eventually being brought back into use .

Senators Joseph I. Lieberman and Lindsey Graham , prominent surrogates for Senator John McCain ’s presidential campaign , stepped down Wednesday from their positions with an independent group that released a pair of Internet advertisements attacking Senator Barack Obama on Iraq .
Mr. Lieberman , independent of Connecticut , and Mr. Graham , Republican of South Carolina , were both on the policy advisory board to the organization , Vets for Freedom , which on Wednesday released its second Web advertisement in less than a week attacking Mr. Obama .
The senators ’ positions with the group , which describes itself as a grass - roots advocacy organization pushing for victory in Iraq and Afghanistan , seemed to place them in contravention of new conflict - of - interest rules released by Mr. McCain ’s campaign that specifically prohibit anyone “ with a McCain campaign title or position ” from participating in a “ 527 or other independent entity that makes public communications that support or oppose any presidential candidate . ”
After inquiries from reporters , the senators released a joint letter to Vets for Freedom on Wednesday saying they had requested a leave from their positions to come into compliance with the new policy .
Relations have been tense since a Colombian cross - border raid
Colombia and Ecuador have agreed to restore low - level diplomatic ties , which were severed after a raid on a Colombian rebel camp within Ecuador .
Relations are to be renewed at the level of charge d'affaires , under an agreement brokered by former US President Jimmy Carter .
Colombia 's cross - border raid on 1 March killed rebel commander Raul Reyes and more than 25 other guerrillas .
It caused one of the biggest diplomatic crises in Latin America in years .
Ecuador and Venezuela sent troops to their borders after Colombia 's raid , withdrawing them several days later after a meeting of regional leaders in the Dominican Republic .
Fragile agreement
The thaw in relations came after mediation conducted by former President Carter .
He spoke to both President Alvaro Uribe of Colombia and his Ecuadorian counterpart , Rafael Correa , by telephone , the Atlanta - based Carter Center said in a statement .
Colombia insisted the Farc camp had been a legitimate military target
" President Rafael Correa confirms his willingness to immediately renew relations at the level of charges d'affaires , " Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Maria Isabel Salvador confirmed later .
Relations had been severed abruptly after the Colombian air force bombed a camp used by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Farc ) just inside Ecuador , and sent troops to recover the body of Paul Reyes along with several laptops and documents .
The BBC's Jeremy McDermott in Bogota says it is the content of these computers that has delayed the restoration of diplomatic relations , and could see them break down again .
The Colombian government insists that the computers show Ecuador had secret links to the left - wing rebel group .
President Correa has vehemently denied the allegation and asked the Organisation of American States to investigate .
The OAS has already ruled that Colombia 's attack was a violation of Ecuador 's sovereignty .
Junk Food
PRESS : India Bans Junk Food in Schools
The Indian government has finalized a law banning the sale and marketing of junk food  food products high in saturated fat or trans - fat or added sugar or sodium   in all schools and a fifty meter radius .
The ban would effectively end the sale of junk food such as sugar sweetened beverages , pizzas , chips and deep fried foods in all schools across India  from pre-kindergarten to twelfth grade , government and private .
Uber
PRESS : Cash Rich Uber Crowdfunding for Drivers in India Cash rich Uber Technologies Inc. , whose stocks skyrocketed  43 % last month after it reported unrestricted cash of US $ 10 billion to see it through the COVID - 19 pandemic unharmed , has turned to crowdfunding to ostensibly support its drivers in India .
Uber announced the launch of the  Uber Care Driver Fund last week with a seed grant of INR 25 crore ( approx . US$ 3 million ) .
The company announced that it is seeking an additional INR 25 crore from other sources , and included a link to donate via a prominent Indian crowdsourcing website , Milaap .
Coca - Cola
Coca -Cola Credits Indian Campaigns for Companys Water Vision
The Coca -Cola Company has officially credited its new - found zeal on water conservation to the local , community - led campaigns in India that have successfully challenged the companys atrocious mismanagement of water .
But much of Coca - Cola 's claims on water management come from their public relations department , and a reality check on the ground reveals an ineffective water management plan .
If Coca - Cola were really serious about having learnt lessons from Indian campaigns , it could start by ceasing bottling operations in water stressed areas of India , including bottling operations of their franchisees .
Uber
OPINION : Regulations Imminent to Correct Uber , Rideshare Wrongdoings
There is a lot of hype around Uber and Lyft as they go public on Wall Street but these companies contribute to more problems than they solve , and are the target of protests globally .
After destroying the taxi industry , they pay poverty wages , misclassify their drivers as contractors , increase congestion on our streets , aim to privatize public transportation , contribute to increased pollution and climate change  just to name a few .
It is only a matter of time before rideshare companies are regulated more  around the world  to protect society from the negative externalities of the rideshare business .
Coca - Cola
OPINION : Coca -Cola , Junk Food Companies Influencing Public Health Policies in India International Life Sciences Institute ( ILSI ) is a front organization for food , beverage and agrichemical industries , and was founded by Coca - Cola .
A recent study has found that ILSI has undermined Chinas public health policies on obesity by networking with nutrition scientists to nudge government policy into alignment with the companys corporate interests . 
Alarmingly , ILSI is also active in India , and key Indian functionaries who sit on ILSIs board also occupy central roles in Indias primary food regulator , the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India ( FSSAI ) .

PRESS : Coca -Cola Launches  Healthy  Drink for Kids in India  With More Sugar than Coca - Cola
The Coca - Cola Company in India has launched a new healthy and nutritious beverage geared towards active , growing children that contains more sugar than Coca - Cola .
Minute Maid Smoothie , the newly introduced beverage under the companys  Health and Wellness  portfolio , contains 12.6 grams of sugar per 100 ml .
Coca -Cola contains 11 grams of sugar per 100 ml in India .
Coca - Cola
PRESS : India Applies Sin Tax on Sweetened Carbonated Beverages
The Indian government has introduced sin taxes on sweetened carbonated beverages such as Coca - Cola and Pepsi because of the negative health impacts of products with high sugar content .
The sin tax was brought into force on July 1 , 2017 , and makes India one of the first countries in the world to implement a nationwide sin tax on sweetened carbonated beverages .
Soft drinks in India are now listed alongside more established harmful products such as tobacco .
Coca - Cola
PRESS : Government Tie - Up with Coca - Cola on Food Safety and Nutrition Misguided The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India ( FSSAI )  the countrys premier government organization responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the regulation and supervision of food safety  announced yesterday that it has entered into a partnership with Coca - Cola India to provide training to vendors in order to ensure safe and nutritious food for all .
FSSAIs partnership is misguided and antithetical to the food regulators mission , and must be scrapped .
FSSAI should not enter into partnerships with entities it is supposed to regulate because it ensures conflicts of interest .
Pepsi
PRESS : Water Restrictions Force Pepsi to Cease Production US based PepsiCo has been forced to cease operations at its bottling plant in Kanjikode , in the south Indian state of Kerala because of water shortages , the India Resource Center can confirm .
Tthe state government of Kerala has issued strict measures to ease drought conditions in Palakkad district ( where the PepsiCo plant is located ) , and ordered industries using water as a raw material to reduce water use by 75 % until May 2017 , and also noted that legal action will be taken against the companies that disobey the order . 
Coca - Cola
PRESS : Indian Court Stops Water to Coke , Pepsi Plants
In a major development , an Indian High Court has ordered that water from the river Tamirabarani in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu must not be diverted to Coca - Cola and Pepsi producing plants in Gangaikondan due to the severe water shortages in the area .
The court order came as the result of a public interest litigation filed by FEDCOT , a statewide consumer organization , which had sought to stop the use of river water for production of Coca - Cola and Pepsi product because water scarcity has diminished both drinking water as well as water for irrigation in the area .
Coca - Cola
PRESS : Coca -Colas Second Largest Plant Shuts Production in India Coca - Colas second largest bottling plant in India has shut production due to pollution violations , the India Resource Center can confirm after a visit to the plant yesterday .
The bottling plant in Hapur has been under scrutiny by the National Green Tribunal  Indias Green Court  since 2015 , and a number of inspections by government regulators have found the plant to be flouting environmental laws in India , and also operating without valid licenses , or No Objection Certificate ( NOC ) .
Junk Food
PRESS : Global Support for Sin Tax on Sugary Drinks in India Medical professionals from the US , UK , India , Brazil and Mexico have released a statement in support of a sin tax on sugar - sweetened beverages in India .
The statement , which has been mailed to key Members of Parliament and ministries in India this week , notes that a changing Indian diet is leading to an alarming increase in rates of obesity , type 2 diabetes , hypertension , and cardiovascular diseases in India .
Coca - Cola
PRESS : 20 % of Coca - Cola Company Owned Plants Closed in India
In continued troubles for the Coca - Cola company in India , a press release issued March 17 , 2016 indicated that the company has stopped production in another two bottling plants in India  in addition to the three bottling plants that were shut down earlier this year .
Coca - Cola
PRESS : Disputed Coca - Cola Plant Shut Down in Kala Dera , India
The Coca - Cola company has stopped production at its controversial bottling plant in Kala Dera in Jaipur , and has no plans to resume operations .
Groundwater levels have plummeted ever since Coca - Cola began operations in 2000 , and the increased difficulty in accessing groundwater from the depleted aquifer is one of the main reasons for the plants closure .

The new guidelines are significant because they will apply to industries using groundwater regardless of when the industry was established .
The latest guidelines could put an end to the excessive and destructive groundwater usage by industries that were grandfathered in under the last guidelines .
Coca - Cola
PRESS : Coca -Colas Water Replenishment Claims Mislead
As campaigners that have closely scrutinized Coca - Colas operations in India for over a decade , we find Coca - Colas assertions on balancing water use to be misleading .
The companys track record of managing water resources in and around its bottling operations is dismal , and the announcement is a public relations exercise designed to manufacture an image of a company that uses water sustainably  far removed from the reality on the ground .

The cancellation of the land allotted to Coca - Cola for a Rs. 500 crore ( USD 80 million ) bottling plant came as the result of an extremely well - coordinated campaign led by farmers and political parties who opposed Coca - Colas plant because it would worsen the already existing water shortages in the area , and bring more pollution into the area .

PepsiCo
OPINION : PepsiCos Investment in India Does More Harm Than Good PepsiCos announcement that the company will invest another $ 5.5 billion in India by 2020  to manufacture and sell more junk food to Indians  does not bode well for the long term public health of the country .
More junk food is not something India can afford , nor should it encourage .
For India , a growing obesity problem is sure to further burden an already overstressed and under - funded public health system in India , as well as adversely impact the quality of life of millions .

“ Deadly hawks come in many styles .
Some have polished talons . ” – Norman Solomon

Fareed Zakaria debuted his new show for CNN this past Sunday .
Introducing his program , called Fareed Zakaria GPS ( as in Global Public Square , not Global Positioning System , though the latter might also apply ) , he explains :
FAREED ZAKARIA , HOST , “ GPS ” : Welcome to the very first edition of “ Global Public Square . ” I ’m Fareed Zakaria .
For the last 20 years , I ’ve been writing about the world .
And now I have an opportunity to bring all of you along with me on what has been a fascinating adventure .
I know that right now to a lot of people , the world looks like a grim place .
Almost every day you ’re bombarded with frightening headlines , stories of out - of - control governments and terrorists who want to kill you .
But beyond those headlines , the picture is actually much brighter .
Economic growth and technology are raising people out of disease and poverty every day .
On this program , we ’ll try to understand the new forces shaping our world , both the good and the bad .
And I ’ll talk to some of the world ’s great thinkers and doers — people like former British Prime Minister Tony Blair , who will be joining me in a few minutes .
So , let ’s get started on what ’s going to be a hell of a ride .
My “ built - in bullshit detector , ” to borrow Ernest Hemingway ’s phrase , was triggered by the words “ some of the world ’s great thinkers and doers — people like former British Prime Minister Tony Blair . ”
But nothing could prepare me for what followed .
FAREED ZAKARIA :
At water coolers across this country , people are talking about the American presidential election .
But our strange drama is also gripping the rest of the world .
I gathered some of the smartest people I know to talk about this subject , and China , and Iran and anything else that comes up .
Hmm , ca n’t wait to meet the panel .
FAREED ZAKARIA : Joining me are Christiane Amanpour , CNN ’s chief international correspondent …
Oh , Amanpour .
I ’m intrigued .
And ?
FAREED ZAKARIA : the European Union ’s ambassador to the United States and the former prime minister of Ireland , John Bruton …
Tell me more …
FAREED ZAKARIA : Minxin Pei , one of the world ’s top China scholars …
Hey , this might actually be a substantive geopolitical confab .
Of course , no true progressives , anti-globalists , human rights representatives or anti-war activists but this is still CNN .
Let ’s be realistic .
At least , however , there ’s no knee - jerk sycophantic Bush lackey either .
No mindless “ fair and balanced ” framework , where inane and dangerous ideas – many often already discredited – are given equal weight .
So I ’m interested .
I ’ve reserved my judgment .
I ’m ready to go along with Zakaria on this “ hell of a ride . ”
And I ’m eager to hear who rounds out this more promising - than - usual panel .
FAREED ZAKARIA : … and Douglas Feith , former undersecretary of defense , one of Donald Rumsfeld ’s key lieutenant ’s in President Bush ’s first term .
Cue the spit - take .
( I actually did nearly spit my coffee across the room . )
Feith ?!
Douglas Feith .
One of the “ smartest people ” that Fareed Zakaria knows ?
Donald Rumsfeld ’s under secretary of defense for policy ?
One of the primary architects of the occupation in Iraq and point man on circumventing the Geneva Conventions so torture and holding detainees indefinitely without charge or recourse was “ legal ” ?
The one who oversaw both the Counter Terrorism Evaluation Unit , which issued the bogus pre-war report linking Saddam Hussein with al Qaeda that helped sell the invasion , and the Office of Special Plans , which was in charge of the disastrous post - war planning ?
The schmendrick that former US Army General Tommy Franks , who led the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan , called â€ œthe dumbest fucking guy on the planetâ€ for his sparkling ideas ?
Whose work on Iraq former CIA chief George Tenet called “ total crap ” ?
The level - headed global strategist who Jay Garner , a former American administrator in Iraq , believes is “ incredibly dangerous ” and “ a smart guy whose electrons are n’t connected ? ”
About whom Larry Wilkerson , Colin Powell ’s former chief of staff , said “ Seldom in my life have I met a dumber man ” ?
The brilliant man who , as Chris Suellentrop wrote in Slate :
… [ as reported by The New Yorker ] intentionally excluded experts with experience in postwar nation - building , out of fear that their pessimistic , worst - case scenarios would leak and damage the case for war .
In the Atlantic earlier this year , James Fallows told a similar story : The Pentagon did not participate in CIA war games about the occupation , because “ it could be seen as an ‘ antiwar ’ undertaking ” that “ weakened the case for launching a ‘ war of choice . ’ ” The State Department ’s Future of Iraq Project , an effort that accurately predicted some contingencies that the Pentagon overlooked , was dismissed by Feith and company out of hand .
That guy ?
The same schmo who ’s said :
â€ œThe main rationale [ for invading Iraq ] was not based on intelligence.â€ 
â€ œI am talking about myself in the following sense : expertise is a very good thing , but it is not the same thing as sound judgment regarding strategy and policy .
George W. Bush has more insight , because of his knowledge of human beings and his sense of history , about the motive force , the craving for freedom and participation in self - rule , than do many of the language experts and history experts and culture experts.â€ 
â€ œThe common refrain that the postwar has been a disaster is only true if you had completely unrealistic expectations.â€ 
Regarding diplomatic agreements with adversaries : â€ œIf we had mutual trust and real security , you wouldnâ€™t need these agreements , and if you need these agreements , then it is an illusion to say that you have mutual trust and security . ”
â€ œThe surprising thing is not that there are so many Jews who are neocons but that there are so many who are not.â€ 
“ We certainly understood that these are the things that might happen .
Thatâ€™s why we wrote them down . ”
( Feith ’s response in a recent 60 Minutes interview to Steve Kroft reading him portions of Rumsfeld ’s pre-war “ Parade of Horribles ” memo , which detailed what might go wrong in Iraq : “ ‘ The United States could become so absorbed with its Iraq effort that we pay inadequate attention to other serious problems ; the war could cause more harm and entail greater costs than expected ’ – obviously it has ; ‘ that it would not go on for two to four years but eight to 10 years ; terrorist networks could improve their recruiting and fundraising as a result our being depicted as anti-Muslim ; Iraq could experience ethnic strife among Kurds , Sunnis and Shia ; it could damage our relationship with our allies and our reputation in the world community . ’
Did you think that one or two of these would happen ? ”
“ One of the things that is reflected in this memo , ” said Feith , “ is secretary Rumseld ’s deeply held view that it ’s foolish to try to predict the future . ”
Kroft replied , “ Well , as it turned out , he was pretty good at anticipating problems because virtually all of these things have happened . ” )
Yes , that Douglas Feith , who is not only a disastrous foreign policy thinker with no regard for domestic or international law , but a dangerous propagandist whose views have been roundly discredited and whose reputation , in the minds of most sentient beings , has been irrevocably tarnished by his thoughts and deeds .
So the question remains :
Why would Fareed Zakaria include this man in a circle of “ some of the smartest people I know , ” inviting him to take part in his new program ’s inaugural panel discussion on global issues ?
Zakaria ’s strong support for the invasion of Iraq is no secret .
And though he morphed into a staunch critic of the Bush administration ’s prosecution of the war , he ’s never said the initial aim , the act of invading a sovereign country and implementing democracy at the barrel of a gun , was a bad idea .
Similarly , Feith ’s current justification for the invasion – not WMD , what he and the administration presented to the American people and the world , but rather the hope of remaking the Middle East into a democracy – appealed to Zakaria .
In fact , Zakaria attended a little known ( and little reported ) November 2001 meeting , convened by then deputy secretary of defense Paul Wolfowitz , to help craft a PR narrative for the war in Iraq .
Bob Woodward detailed this secret gathering in his 2006 book State of Denial .
As The New York Times reported in October 2006 :
What was more unusual , Mr. Woodward reveals , was the presence of journalists at the meeting .
Fareed Zakaria , the editor of Newsweek International and a Newsweek columnist , and Robert D. Kaplan , now a national correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly , attended the meeting and , according to Mr. Kaplan , signed confidentiality agreements not to discuss what happened .
Mr. Zakaria , who was not told that the meeting would produce a report , takes issue with Mr. Woodwardâ€™s account .
â€ œI thought it was a brainstorming session , â€  he said .
â€ œI was never told that there was going to be a document summarizing our views and I have never seen such a document .â€ 
( Mr. Woodward wrote that the report , which supported the invasion of Iraq , caused Mr. Bush to focus on the â€œmalignancyâ€ of the Middle East situation . )
While members of policy research groups often dispense advice to administration officials , journalists do not typically attend secret meetings or help compile government reports .
Indeed , many Washington journalists complain that the current administration keeps them at an unhealthy distance .
Mr. Kaplan said much of the meeting was spent drafting and reworking the document , on which Mr. Zakariaâ€™s name did not appear , and was â€œa forceful summary of some of the best pro-war arguments at the time .â€ 
Could any of the participants have been unaware there was a document in the making ?
â€ œNo , thatâ€™s not possible , â€  he said .
The Times later appended a correction to this article .
( Incidentally , the article had been buried in the Business section , an added twist of irony after recent news , broken by The Times , about the networks , unwittingly or not , allowing some TV war analysts to shill directly for the Pentagon and the Bush administration ) .
The correction simply “ confirmed ” that : “ Mr. Zakaria was not told that the meeting would produce a report for the Bush administration , nor did his name appear on the report . ”
A rather odd and dubious correction that does n’t refute a ) Zakaria signed a confidentiality agreement “ not to discuss what happened , ” b ) he was in attendance and played an active role , c ) Woodward ’s belief and The Times ’ agreement that it was “ unusual ” for journalists to attend such a meeting , or d ) provide any evidence why we should n’t believe Kaplan ’s assessment that Zakaria had to have known he was contributing to a document with “ a forceful summary of some of the best pro-war arguments at the time . ”
Moreover , it ’s easy to forget just how wrong Zakaria got it .
On February 3 , 2003 , he wrotea Newsweek article titled “ Looking on the Bright Side , ” which was not only woefully myopic and misguided but stunningly cavalier about invading a country that did not attack us .
While Zakaria noted there “ are legitimate concerns ” and the “ risks are real , ” here are some of “ the potential benefits … of a successful war in Iraq ” he put forth :
A major producer of weapons of mass destruction would be eliminated . [… ]
The Iraqi people would gain liberty .
No matter what comes after Saddam , it will be better than his totalitarian regime . [… ]
The Iraqi people would get on the road to economic well being . [… ]
Political and economic reform would quicken around the Arab world . [… ]
The cause of radical , violent anti-Westernismâ € ” the one ideological trait that is shared by both Saddam and the Islamic fundamentalistsâ€ ” would be dealt a severe blow .
Osama bin Laden once said that when people see a weak horse and a strong horse , they naturally want to side with the strong horse .
No one will want to side with a dead horse .
The oil cartel would break down . [… ]
If oil prices stay low , over time the pressures for reform could build even more .
The regimes of the Middle Eastâ€ ” most of which are nondemocratic and nonperformingâ€ ” will find it increasingly difficult to stay in power if they do n’t open up .
In short , if oil goes to $ 10 a barrel , the Saudi monarchy goes to Majorca . [… ]
Even his caveat was deeply , and tragically , flawed :
Not all of this will happen .
In fact , most of it will probably not happen .
But not all of the bad things people predict will likely happen , either .
And even if a few of the forces described above are unleashed , they will have lasting positive effects on the region and the whole Muslim world .
Of course , not everyone would be helped by a successful war .
The ruling elites in the Middle Eastâ€ ” particularly those that remain stubbornly set in their old waysâ€ ” will be challenged , threatened and eventually overturned .
For these potentates and their courtiers it would mean the end of one of the richest gravy trains in history .
That is why they will fight change as fiercely as they can .
But for the people of the Middle East , after the shock of the war fades , it could mean a chance to break out of the terrible stagnancy in which they now sit .
There are always risks involved when things change .
But for the past 40 years the fear of these risks has paralyzed Western policy toward the Middle East .
And what has come of this caution ?
Repression , radical Islam and terror .
I ’ll take my chances with change .
I ’ll take my chances .
Ponder the haughty recklessness of those words for a moment in context to war and death in general , and in context to this particular war ’s mass number of deaths .
I ’ll take my chances .
Thanks for your sacrifice , Mr. Zakaria .
But “ after the shock of war fades , ” the reality of it continues to multiply body counts more than five years later .
Zakaria rather blithely flipped a coin with hundreds of thousands or millions of lives .
Rational foreign policy experts , who are not hawks , might call that irresponsible , even barbaric .
And as late as March 2005 , in another Newsweek article titled “ What Bush Got Right , ” with the subtitle , “ Freedom ’s march :
The president has been right on some big questions .
Now , if he can get the little stuff right , he ’ll change the world , ” Zakaria was still spinning utter nonsense in an attempt to defend Bush ’s war and his own flawed ideas :
The other noted political scientist who has been vindicated in recent weeks is George W. Bush .
Across New York , Los Angeles and Chicagoâ € ” and probably Europe and Asia as wellâ€ ” people are nervously asking themselves a question : “ Could he possibly have been right ? ”
The short answer is yes .
Whether or not Bush deserves credit for everything that is happening in the Middle East , he has been fundamentally right about some big things .
From the same article comes this unintended comic gem :
People have often wished that the president had traveled more over the years .
But Bush ’s capacity to imagine a different Middle East may actually be related to his relative ignorance of the region .
Had he traveled to the Middle East and seen its many dysfunctions , he might have been disheartened .
Freed from looking at the day - to - day realities , Bush maintained a vision of what the region could look like .
Thus , it ’s clear why Zakaria desires to rebrand Feith as one of the “ smartest people I know ” : in doing so , Zakaria simultaneously absolves , or disappears , his own pre-war bungling , a stain to which a more forthright and less arrogant journalist who specializes in foreign affairs would confess , not only to repair his credibility but also to avail himself of the ability to hold other people ’s global ideas and actions under the full light of the facts , both current and historical .
In a recent interview on The Daily Show , JonStewart laid bare why Feith is now selling this particular bit of revisionism :
JON STEWART : I guess the difference in my mind is if you knew the perils but the conversation that you had with the public painted a rosier picture .
How is that not deception ?
That sounds like … when you ’re selling a product …( applause ) what it sounds like for me .
Sorry .
The fact that you seem to know all the risks , takes this from manslaughter to homicide .
It almost takes it from , like with the cigarette companies .
If they come out and say , “ No , our products I think are going to be delicious . ”
You go back and you look and they go , well , they actually did talk about addictiveness and cancer .
Is n’t that deception ?
In the end , for Feith and other culpable Bush administration officials , it ’s a fine point that might mean the difference between prosecution and getting away with murder .
CNN should be commended for both green - lighting a Sunday talk show that focuses on world events and letting a Muslim Indian - American host it .
But if Zakaria ’s program genuinely strives to bring the world into sharper focus , rewriting the recent history in Iraq is an egregious first step .

Aging Boomers could burst housing bubble Sellers will outnumber potential buyers , depressing home prices
The common perception among economists is that the current housing bubble will be a relatively short - term affair that should see a return to normal within the next few years .
But according to a study by two University of Southern California researchers , a bubble of even more monumental proportions lies just ahead .
They call it the " generational housing bubble , " and maintain that it will be fueled by the same Baby Boomers who have been bidding up prices since 1970 as they moved higher and higher on the housing ladder .
Now , though , the 78 million Boomers are about to enter the years when people tend to become sellers rather than buyers .
And as a result , they expect " many more homes ( will be ) available for sale than there are buyers for them . "
According to the researchers , the tilt toward age groups that are net sellers of housing is unprecedented .
" The Baby Boom generation was born over a period of 18 years , and once its sell - off commences , it could dominate the housing market for up to two decades , " they say .
As the elderly become more numerous than the young , and as they shift into seller mode , the researchers postulate , the market shift could come quickly after 2010 , causing housing prices to fall .
Even if housing prices remain flat , the researchers maintain , young households will likely slow their entry into homeownership , meaning sales should be slower than normal , and worsening the imbalance between sellers and buyers .
Only time will tell whether the alarming projections by Dowell Myers , a professor of urban planning and demography in USC's School of Policy , Planning and Development , and Sungho Ryu , a doctoral candidate at the school and an associate planner with the Southern California Association of Governments , will come to pass .
After all , not all seniors retire or sell their homes and move to smaller places .
Many prefer to age in place and live out their lives in the houses where they 've built a lifetime of memories .
But eventually , as they die off , most of their homes will come on the market .
Myers ' and Ryu's foreboding prophecies bring to mind a 1989 study by a pair of Harvard economists , who predicted a 47 percent decline in housing prices during the 1990s because Boomers would stop buying as they aged .
Housing - industry economists lambasted that forecast as pure poppycock , and it eventually blew up in smoke .
Indeed , one economist recently called their projection " one of the worst forecasts in the history of mankind . "
But Myers and Ryu maintain that Gregory Mankiw , who eventually became chairman of President Bush 's Council of Economic Advisers from 2003 to 2005 , and David Weil , now working in the economics department at Brown University , were simply two decades ahead of their time .
Mankiw and Weil " may have miscalculated the timing of the decline , predicting its beginning 20 years or more prematurely , " the new study says .
" But the Baby Boomers will finally start retiring from the housing market . "
In a paper that was published in the current edition of the Journal of the American Planning Association , Myers and Ryu say that folks who were born from 1946 through 1964 will continue to dominate the housing market , just as they have throughout their entire adult lives and just as they have like no generation before them .
Over the next two decades , though , the ratio of seniors to working adults will soar by 67 percent , they say .
The USC researchers do n't expect the generational correction to begin until 2011 or so .
That 's just about the time the most pessimistic prognosticators suggest the American housing market will finally return to normal after spending five years or so on the rocks .
But it's also when the first wave of Boomers reaches age 65 , the traditional dividing point between seniors and working adults .
And once that tipping point is reached , Myers and Ryu say they will put more houses up for sale than the market will be able to absorb .
" After 2010 , the leading edge of the Boomers will pass age 65 and growth among the elderly population will substantially exceed that of younger adults , an unprecedented social and economic development , " they argue .
The researchers base much of their theory on the historic relationship between age and housing demand .
Traditionally , homeownership rises with age and generally does not peak until after age 65 .
Balanced buying and selling
For most of the American lifespan , the rates of buying and selling remain closely related , if only because those who sell one house typically buy another .
Below age 50 , buying is more common .
But when people enter their late 50s and early 60s , as the leading age of Baby Boomers has now done , buying and selling are in balance .
When they reach their mid-60s , though , sellers start to outnumber buyers .
And when they hit their 70s , sellers tend to dominate .
People continue to buy homes after that age .
But once they hit that milestone , the number of sellers begins to exceed the number of buyers .
Once they reach 75 , they are three times as likely to be sellers than buyers .
And at 80 and above , they are nine times more likely to be sellers .
Myers and Ryu project that the ratio of those 65 and over to people 25 to 64 will surge 30 percent in the decade between 2010 to 2020 and 29 percent more in the 2020s , altering the delicate balance between buyers to sellers for the foreseeable future .
They say the supply of houses on the market will be dominated by the actions of aging homeowners " who have little ability to postpone " their need to sell and retire from the housing market .
They also caution that Boomers facing financial , community and age - related issues " could flood the market with excess supply . "
If values decline , as the researchers suspect they will , Boomers who remain owners will themselves suffer because their equity will fall , shrinking what for many is their retirement savings .
A possible upside
If there is a positive aspect to Myers and Ryu 's dire predictions , it 's that the coming generational bubble will be a rolling one that wo n't impact all housing markets at the same time .
In some states , the sell - off will come later rather than sooner .
Indeed , if the growing number of seniors behave as those who have gone before them , regional differences will be sharp .
Historically , seniors do n't become net sellers in Arizona , Florida and Nevada until they reach 75 .
In 12 other states - Arkansas , Colorado , Delaware , Georgia , Hawaii , Idaho , New Mexico , North Carolina , Oregon , South Carolina , Tennessee and Utah - they become net sellers when they hit 70 .
But the opposite is true in 13 other states - Alaska , California , Connecticut , Illinois , Indiana , New Jersey , New York , Maryland , Massachusetts , Michigan , Minnesota , Ohio and Rhode Island .
In those states , the crossover point starts at age 55 .
Senior sellers outnumber senior buyers in the remaining 22 states when they turn 65 .
Do n’t Let Your Vacation Be Ruined By Cheap Tour
People can learn from others ’ mistake to be able to make wise choice when they have to face the same situation .
That is the purpose of sharing my story from a recent vacation .
Beautiful Dream
Living in New York , I dreamed to spend my vacation with my spouse to different atmosphere of the west cost .
When the time came , we decided to go to the happiest place in the world the Disneyland , the sin city Las Vegas , and one of the wonders of the world Grand Canyon .
We signed up at a travel agent , Harmony Int’l Travel , to join a six - day west cost tour operated by American Business Connection ( A.B.C. Inc ) , located in San Gabriel , CA .
The agent convinced us it would be a bilingual Chinese - English tour .
We were really happy to be able to materialize the dream soon ; and I was also satisfied to be able to buy a bargain tour package for the price of $ 368 a person , excluding airfare .
Untruthful and Rip- off
On May 19th , 2008 , we left for Los Angeles airport for the long awaited vacation .
When we arrived in the LAX airport after six - hour flight , we had to make several telephone calls to the tour operator , the A.B.C Inc. , and wait for 45 minutes , before a man , called Mr. Chen , from the tour operator came to pick us .
Next , we were dropped at a fast - food restaurant and Mr. Chen left us there to pick other people from the same airport .
One hour passed , he did n’t show up ; two hours passed he still did n’t show up .
Again , we had to make several calls to , both the travel agent and the A.B.C. tour office before Mr. Chen showed up to bring us to the hotel .
It ’s unpleasant welcome gesture by the tour operator on the first day , because we had to wait for three hours since arriving in the airport before getting to a hotel .
On the third day of the tour we got a new tour leader , called Andy who would lead the group going to Las Vegas and then visiting Grand Canyon for the next three days .
In the morning of May 21st , we were picked by a big tour couch , # 2009 , license plate # CP83117 .
I had to remind the tour leader that we do n’t speak Chinese because since leaving the hotel , the tour leader had spoken only in Chinese .
What happened next was out of our expectation ; the tour leader kept speaking Chinese regardless our request and the fact there were at least five people did n’t speak Chinese .
Andy spoke English only for limited purposes , such as collecting money for optional tour , informing us where the bus would stop , and time to come back to the couch .
The rest of trip to Las Vegas and Grand Canyon was the same ; the guiding was only delivered in Chinese .
When we asked Andy about the language problem , he took it easy and said he forgot that we did n’t understand Chinese .
Complaints were also voiced by another couple who also kept asking the tour leader for guiding in English .
Arriving in Las Vegas on the May 21st the afternoon , the couch directly dropped us at Las Vega Club hotel located in old town Las Vegas .
It was just 4 pm when the guided tour of the day was ended .
I expected the bus would at least take us around the city because it was still too early to go to the hotel ; and after all it is a Las Vegas tour .
Instead , the tour leader arranged an optional tour to explore the city for extra cost $ 25 a person .
When selling the optional tour , the tour leader convinced us that exploring the city by oneself would be more expensive because it would cost $ 30 a person only to reach the new city .
What tuned out later , the optional tour was merely dropping the participants at one point on the Las Vegas Boulevard South and let the participant to take picture ; no guiding at all , nothing .
Add to the insult , it was turned out that it was easy to reach the place with only $ 5 bus fare valid for all day .
Some participants grumbled for paying the optional tour ; some of them felt that the tour leader and the tour company had cheated them .
The rest of the group that did n’t join the optional tour also complained ; that it was not the kind of tour they intended to join because what they got was only transportation to and accommodation service in Las Vegas , nothing to do with going around Las Vegas city .
It was still early morning on the way back to Los Angeles from Las Vegas when Andy collected $ 18 a person for his and the driver ’s salary for the three days .
He did n’t mention it as a “ tip ” , instead he used the term “ salary ” , which implicitly indicated everybody had to pay him regardless of his poor , unprofessional service .
Still , some participants did n’t give him the full amount he requested .
Tour members revealed disappointment with the tour because the tour leader , Andy , did n’t do his job and did n’t care what tour members concerned about , while handling complaints with unprofessional , rude manner .
Some refer the tour leader as nasty rude person , while others called him as a greedy and no manner person .
Lesson to Learn
Do n’t be fooled and lured by a cheap tour package for your vacation .
The price is not the only issue you have to concern about .
Buying an inexpensive tour , you may end up paying even more costly and having unpleasant vacation because of many hidden extra costs , unprofessional service , and rude treatment from the tour leader .
Read the brochure carefully and ask questions , especially about the tour details , potential extra costs , optional tours , and admission tickets for attractions .
You have to make sure the tour operator provides guided tour when visiting the tour destination mentioned on the brochure instead only arranging transportation and accommodation .
When joining a bilingual tour , get a guarantee from the agent about it .
This is crucial if you want to have fun and enjoy your vacation .
There is no point to purchase a guided tour conducted in foreign language that you do n’t understand and only to become a stranger among the crowd .
Finally , get recommendation from friends , relatives , or others who are satisfied with the tour that your will join to .
Eminem to Sing at Nelson Mandela 's Birthday Party
This is not at all what we were expecting from the " retired " rapper .has been writing songs and working on a comeback , and I say that every so lightly because I think the heavyweight rapper ( no pun intended ) will be welcomed back by most with open arms .
June 27th at Hyde Park in London is the place to be if you are a fan of South Africa 's President Nelson Mandela .
After going into retirement in 2005 , we did n't hear a lot from Eminem , other than a reconciliation / split with his babies ' mama Kim Mathers .
There was also the book " My Son Marshall , My Son Eminem " that his disgruntled mother , Debbie Nelson wrote .
Most recently he ballooned up but other than that not much .
A source that is putting the 90th birthday bash together for Nelson Mandela has said that they are thrilled to have the controversial singer on board .
Other star performers who will be at the celebration are Stevie Wonder , Annie Lennox , Keane and Razorlight .
Some feel that Eminem 's presence will be a conflict of interest .
Mandela is known for his views on being a freedom fighter and some feel that anyone who has strong views on oppressed minorities should not be attending .
In an unreleased song that somehow got leaked , Eminem expresses his dislike for dating black women .
If you would like to read the lyrics to the song , check them out at The Sun .
Mohammed fled just hours before the raid but his sons and another senior al - Qaeda member were found cowering behind a wardrobe in the apartment .
The boys have been held by the Pakistani authorities but this weekend they were flown to America where they will be questioned about their father .
CIA interrogators confirmed that the boys were staying at a secret address where they were being encouraged to talk about their father 's activities .
" We are handling them with kid gloves , " said one official .
" After all , they are only little children , but we need to know as much about their father 's recent activities as possible .
We have child psychologists on hand at all times and they are given the best of care . "
Mohammed , 37 , is being held in solitary confinement at the Bagram US military base in Afghanistan .
He is being subjected to " stress and duress " interrogation techniques .
He has been told that his sons are being held and is being urged to divulge future attacks against the West and reveal the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden .
" He has said very little so far , " a CIA official said on Saturday .
" He sits in a trance - like state and recites verses from the Koran .
But while he may claim to be a devout Muslim , we know he is fond of the Western - style fast life .
His sons are important to him .
The promise of their release and their return to Pakistan may be the psychological lever we need to break him . "
The Kuwaiti - born Mohammed named his older son after Ramzi Yousef , his nephew , who was convicted of masterminding the 1993 attack on New York 's World Trade Centre .
After the attack , Yousef fled to the Philippines with his uncle .
When bomb - making chemicals set fire to their Manila apartment , Yousef fled to Pakistan , where he was captured in an Islamabad hotel room in 1995 .
Mohammed was in the next room and , audaciously , gave an account of the arrest to a reporter .
By the time Pakistani authorities found out his identity he had fled the country .
He was eventually arrested on March 1 in Rawalpindi , near the home of Pakistan 's President Pervez Musharraf .
Among the items found was a photograph of a smiling Mohammed with his arms around his two sons .
Known as " The Engineer " , he is suspected of masterminding the Bali bombings and slashing the throat of American reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan in January last year .
Little is known of his sons ' mother , who is thought to be Pakistani .
" All we know is that she is the sister of an al - Qaeda member that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed met at a Pakistan college , the University of Dawa al Jihad , in the late 1980s , " a source said .

Closed - circuit TV cameras are the crime - fighting tool so fiendishly sophisticated that they can be foiled by the wearing of a hood .
Yet having stuck 4.2 million of the things around this country , with nary a consultation on the matter - nor any significant impact on crime statistics - efforts to pimp them to 2.0 status continue
This week it emerged that scientists at Portsmouth University are developing " listening " cameras .
Artificial intelligence software will be able to recognise sounds such as breaking glass , so that , when such a noise is detected , they can rotate in its direction and capture the act of vandalism / terrorism / God that resulted in a milk bottle falling off your doorstep .
I paraphrase slightly , but given that the most recent Home Office report on the matter found that better street lighting is seven times more effective at cutting crime than CCTV , the truly suspicious behaviour is our deepening obsession with surveillance .
The past few years have thrown up dozens of instances which made one wince to be a citizen of this septic isle , but a personal low came with the discovery that 500,000 bins had been fitted with electronic tracking devices .
Transponders in bins ...
Could any morning news item be more designed to force one back against the pillows , too embarrassed about one 's country to start the day ?
Yes , as it turned out .
A couple of months ago it was discovered that Poole borough council , in Dorset , had used the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act - designed to track serious criminals and terrorists - to determine whether a school applicant and her parents lived where they said they did .
They did , and were appalled to discover they had been spied on for three weeks , the subject of surveillance notes such as " female and three children enter target vehicle and drive off " .
Target vehicle , if you please !
The thought of some deep - cover council drone jotting this stuff down as though it were an elite Delta Force operation is not as funny as it is horrifying .
Just who are these people , these swelling legions of unelected , ill - qualified monitors who wield such extraordinary power in our surveillance society ?
Clarification in one case came last year , when the civilian in charge of a Worcester police station 's surveillance team was suspended after detectives found , among one day 's footage , a 20 - minute sequence of close - ups of a woman 's cleavage and backside as she walked oblivious through the streets .
Whether the woman ever discovered she was the star of a kind of pervert Truman Show is not recorded .
But the offending monitor escaped with a warning and was - unbelievably - back in post within weeks .
In some city centres , such as Middlesbrough , speakers have been put on the cameras , so that those monitoring can interact with potential miscreants .
Let 's hope these remote bossy boots imagine they 're involved in some high - level negotiation , in which they talk down a teenager from his decision to drop a hamburger wrapper on the pavement .
The former home secretary John Reid , on whose draconian watch the Middlesbrough scheme was approved , even suggested at its launch that schoolchildren should enter a competition to become the voice of the cameras - once again laying bare the government 's desire to co-opt its citizens into the surveillance process at all levels .
We are , of course , coming up to the time of year when we are ordered to shop our neighbours for acts of hosepipe , while the Shoreditch Trust recently trialled a scheme encouraging residents to watch live CCTV feeds on a special local channel , the better to assist in policing .
For all this creepy " outreach " , though , the only hands - down beneficiaries of our CCTV obsession ( apart from the revenue gatherers ) have been broadcasters .
For no good reason , all manner of TV networks have been furnished with hours of footage to pad out their witless police chase documentaries , or offensively cheap " street crime UK " shows .
Britain 's CCTV network : proudly supporting the Bravo channel .
The worst thing is the blithe insistence that this is all necessary and normal .
We are watched more closely , by more cameras , with each passing day .
But so faultlessly designed is our society that we have never come close to having a say on it .
There 's a great bit in Woody Allen 's movie Deconstructing Harry when Robin Williams 's character goes out of focus , appearing as a sort of fuzzy version of himself , which sounds increasingly like the sort of sickness that should be courted by any attractive woman keen to walk through Worcester .
That said , she could always don a hood .
Yet there does seem a vaguely depressing irony in governments insisting that constant surveillance is essential to prevent our being overrun by repressive regimes who'd make us all cover our heads and the like .
It 's these initiatives that drive even the most pliant members of society to dream of taking just that precaution themselves , if only for a bit of privacy .

BATH , South Dakota ( Reuters ) - Sitting on board Sen. Hillary Clinton ’s campaign plane are the remnants of a colorful balloon replica of the candidate , once nearly life - size but now almost deflated and shriveled .

Like the once cheery caricature , the former first lady soldiers on , but her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination is on the down - swing .
Crowds are shrinking , media attention is waning , supporters are jumping ship and calls are growing for her to drop out and help unite the Democrats behind Barack Obama .
Her voice hoarse and less forceful than it has been in more impassioned speeches , Clinton still seemed inscrutable and upbeat campaigning this week in South Dakota .
The rural state holds one of the last nominating primaries on June 3 .
“ There ’s a lot of people who say , ‘ Well , you know , we should just wrap this up . ’
Well , I ’ve never been impatient with democracy , ” she said .
“ I think actually letting people vote is , on balance , a really good thing and has served our country well over many , many years . ”
Clinton , a New York senator , vows to stay in the race until the last primary despite a campaign deeply in debt .
She trails Illinois Sen. Obama in the popular vote , in pledged convention delegates and in superdelegates who can back any candidate they choose .
“ You ’re going to see a lot of us between now and June 3 , ” she told voters in South Dakota .
While the candidate once campaigned relentlessly with four or five events a day , she now has two or three .
The number of press spokesmen with her is down to one from two , and the press corps barely fills one bus when once it filled two .
As she steps from her plane , Clinton smiles and waves but no crowd actually awaits her .
SAGGING AND TANGLED
The balloon gift from a supporter last month used to be a smiling image with yellow balloons for hair , pink balloons for lips and black balloons for its trademark pantsuit .
Now the memento is sagging and tangled .
To hear Clinton tell it , she will stay in the race until every state primary is held , with June 3 the do - or - die date .
She often compares her situation to a sporting event in which the losing team , trailing however badly , plays to the end .
But critics are more likely to compare it to a boxing match , with the losing fighter knocked to the mat and unable to get up .
Winning the remaining primaries would not give her the delegate support she needs to overcome Obama ’s lead .
In sparsely populated Bath , about 300 people turned up to hear Clinton talk about farming and economic woes .
Several spoke out for her to stay in the race .
“ My opinion is that the people that vote are the ones that count .
I ’m not for how many delegates there are or any of that kind of stuff , ” said Debra Pulfrey , 49 , a nursing assistant from Aberdeen .
“ I think she should keep right on going . ”
Retiree Marilyn Rekow , 74 , echoed the sentiment .
“ Just stick with what you believe and do n’t kowtow to the Obama forces , ” she said .
An undecided voter , she said : “ I ’m going to weigh these suckers right up until the very end . ”
Slideshow ( 2 images )
But in the online world of blogs and opinion pieces , calls abound for Clinton to drop out .
Critics say her persistent campaign could hurt Obama ’s fight against presumptive Republican nominee Arizona Sen. John McCain in the November election .
On the popular video site YouTube , a scathing parody of the film “ Sunset Boulevard ” shows Clinton in the role of Norma Desmond , the delusional , over - the - hill actress who is no longer a star but insists , “ I ’m ready for my close - up . ”
In The Washington Post , columnist Dana Milbank compared Clinton ’s plight to a well - known dead parrot sketch by the Monty Python comedy troupe , in which a customer tries to return a deceased bird to a pet shop only to be told it is sleeping or stunned .
“ This is an ex-parrot , ” the customer insists .
“ This is an ex-candidate , ” the Post headline said .

Patrick Swayze's First Public Appearance Since Cancer Reports
Patrick Swayze attends an NBA playoff game on May 23 .
, who recently confirmed reports that he has pancreatic cancer , took time out from his grueling chemotherapy treatment to attend the Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio Spurs NBA playoff game .
The 55 - year - old actor and his wife of 32 years , Lisa Niemi , watched Friday night as the Lakers beat the Spurs 101 - 71 .
Pancreatic cancer is a particularly aggressive form of cancer that usually kills within weeks of diagnosis .
Sixteen itty bitty pigs , which belong to a species that faces extinction , will be released into their natural habitat at the foot of the Himalayas .
Sixteen of the world 's smallest and rarest pigs will take their first tentative steps in the wild today after the species was rescued from the brink of extinction .
The pygmy hog ( Porcula salvanius ) , once common in India , Nepal and Bhutan , was thought extinct in the 1960s after years passed without a sighting of the mammal , which stands up to 30 cm high and weighs a maximum of nine kilogrammes ( 20 lb ) .
In 1971 four were rescued from a market in the state of Assam , in the north of India , a discovery that alerted the world to a further handful surviving in the region 's tea gardens .
After a 13 - year captive breeding programme led by Durrell Wildlife , the Jersey - based conservation centre founded by the author Gerald Durrell , the descendents of those surviving hogs are being reintroduced to their natural habit at the foot of the Himalayas .
Analysis of U.S. military documents and defense contractor presentations suggests that a wave of munitions using reactive materials may be headed for a battlefield soon .

The Pentagon has quietly been working on a new arsenal of advanced weaponry that replaces metal casings with " reactive materials , " normally harmless matter that combines to release explosive amounts of energy on impact , tearing targets apart with violent fury .
In development for more than 30 years , the research is beginning to bear fruit , and may soon spawn more powerful bombs , warheads that tear apart stone and concrete , mines that can be set to stun or kill , and grenades that can swat rockets or mortar rounds out of the sky like flies .
" You can get effects that are more precisely tailored to a particular target , " says John Pike , director of Washington military research group GlobalSecurity.org .
" And you 're able to get a greater effect out of a smaller munition . "
Reactive materials are combinations of materials that are normally stable , but , when subjected to sudden shock – such as striking a target – release a large amount of energy .
Depending on the composition and warhead design , the energy can be released as heat , a blast or a combination of the two .
Unlike conventional explosives , RMs can not be set off by fuses .
Technically , they are classified as flammable solids , and they are less hazardous to transport and store than explosives .
While they 're more energetic than explosives , RMs are not intended to be a substitute .
Instead , they will replace warhead components normally made of metal .
An analysis of U.S. military procurement papers and defense contractor presentations , as well as interviews with companies working on the technology , suggests that a wave of munitions using reactive materials may be headed for a battlefield near you .
The material can dramatically magnify the yield of conventional bombs , and do away with the waste embodied by a bomb 's inert metal skin .
The U.S. Air Force 's 5,000 BLU - 122 bunker buster , for example , contains just 780 pounds of explosives ; the other 80 percent is the bomb 's thick steel casing .
DARPA 's Reactive Munition program ( .doc ) aims to replace that steel with RMs , to create a bomb with a blast four times as powerful .
Alternatively , a new bomb could be half the size of existing weapons but twice as powerful .
Conventional warheads could also benefit from an RM makeover .
For centuries , shells have blasted out steel shrapnel , small pieces of metal that cause damage with their high speed .
Defense contractor Alliant Techsystems is developing a warhead called BattleAxe for the Air Force that uses fragments made of RM instead of metal .
Those fragments will explode on impact , making the warhead far more effective against soft targets like trucks .
RM shrapnel is also being touted as the ideal way of shooting down incoming rockets and mortar bombs ( .pdf ) .
A radar - guided defense pod can automatically engage incoming rockets or other threats using RM - based grenades .
Weapons designers suggest that RMs can be five to ten times as effective as the existing inert shrapnel for this task .
Moreover , RM shrapnel can be engineered to burn out at a set distance , so there is no hazard to nearby friendly forces .
Bullets can even be made of RM .
The Navy 's new electromagnetic railgun has been criticized because it can only fire solid slugs , not the usual explosive shells .
However , documents reveal that tungsten - based RM rounds are being developed for the weapon .
These will explode on impact , making the railgun effective against buildings , ships and vehicles .
Shaped charges are another application where RMs can increase the effectiveness of existing designs .
In a shaped charge , a hollow metal cone is surrounded by explosive material , which is then detonated , forcing the blast through the small end of the cone .
" The action is analogous to stamping on an open toothpaste tube , ejecting the liquid contents , " says Douglas Millard of British defense contractors QinetiQ .
Replace the metal liner with RM , and the explosive power of that jet will increase dramatically .
" Such reactions are highly exothermic and therefore lead to the release of large amounts of energy , which is in addition to the kinetic energy within the jet , " Millard says .
" An increase in the energy coupled into the target occurs and this results in the creation of greater damage to the target . "
QinetiQ is marketing an RM - based shaped charge called Connex for oil - well perforation in the civil market .
Meanwhile , the U.S. Army is developing a demolition charge called Bam Bam that blasts a jet of RM deep into stone or concrete , producing massive damage
One version of the Bam Bam charge is intended for demolishing bridges and other structures .
An alternative version blasts broader , shallower craters in roads or runways , making them useless .
RMs will also transform another mutation called the Explosively Formed Penetrator , a modified version of the shaped charge .
Instead of producing a narrow , short - range jet , the Penetrator fires an aerodynamic slug of metal over a long distance .
It 's best known as a favored weapon of insurgents in Iraq .
Again , replacing the metal with RM makes a much deadlier weapon – after punching through armor , the slug releases energy like a grenade going off .
If you 're a weapons designer , RMs also offer amazing flexibility .
Alliant Techsystems is building a variable landmine ( .pps ) – a so - called " dial - a - yield " weapon that can produce a range of different effects .
At the lowest setting , most of the output would be light – a dazzling warning that would be impossible to miss .
A higher setting would produce intense heat , creating a " discomfort zone " to drive off intruders .
The third setting produces a nonlethal blast , like the concussion stun grenades used by Special Forces .
If lethal force is called for , the mine could be set to produce either inert shrapnel or reactive shrapnel that explodes on impact .
RM munitions may face legal challenges .
Under the St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868 , the use of explosive projectiles with a weight of less than 400 grams is forbidden , as is using incendiary ammunition , like napalm , against personnel .
But RMs are not technically explosive or incendiary , and although the effect on human targets might cause protests from some groups , they are likely to be accepted , human rights experts say .
" Like any weapon , it would have to go through a lengthy effectiveness and then legal review , " says Marc Garlasco , senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch .
" If used in the open against military targets , it does not seem to have any obvious problems at first blush . "
However , there may be technology issues too .
Although the developers sound very upbeat in all their descriptions of RM munitions , producing material that will reliably release energy only when required is extremely challenging .
" The fact that they 've been working on it so long and do n't seem to have fielded anything yet suggests that there may be a problem with the technology , " GlobalSecurity 's
Pike says .
Normally new weapons are fielded rapidly if there is a military demand – assuming they work .
So far , RMs have not made it into the field , and the technology may not be as mature as developers suggest .
But Pike also notes that there has been an unprecedented surge in munitions development over the last few years , with " all kinds of weird stuff " being developed .
So after decades of being kept very quiet , reactive materials may soon be making a lot of noise .

How Bad Can a ' Dirty Bomb ' Be ?

When a Gun Is More Than a Gun
Around this time of the year , presidency candidates typically hold a campaign , and citizens of the United States are induced by the candidates to vote them and let them lead the country .
The main question in every candidate is :
What does it take to be the next U.S. President ?
Even us , citizens , we never outgrow the question :
What does it takes to lead a large country with a productive population ?
Candidates are asked : “ what , or who is a president ? ” almost daily but never : “ What does it takes ? ”
Absolutely thinking , you are familiar with the technical definitions and qualifications that suggest an answer with the question : “ what , or who is a president ? ”
Technical Definition
President is a title held by many leaders of organizations , companies , trade unions , universities , and countries .
Etymologically , a “ president ” is one who presides , who sits in leadership ( from Latin prae - “ before ” + sedere “ to sit ” ; giving the term praeses ) .
Originally , the term referred to the presiding officer of a ceremony or meeting ( i.e. chairman ) ; but today it most commonly refers to an official with executive powers .
Among other things , president today is a common title for the head of state of most republics , whether popularly elected , chosen by the legislature or a special electoral college .
It is also often adopted by dictators .
Qualifications
1. Foreign Policy experience .
After all , constitutionally speaking , a president ’s main function is foreign policy .
2. Military experience .
I admit this looks good on a resume , but I ’m not sure how jumping in and out of fox holes while firing a machine gun lends itself to being a good President .
Perhaps this should be restated as “ military officer experience in a time of war . ”
Now that is impressive .
One with this type of background has probably made life and death decisions that effected people other than himself .
3. Executive experience .
Has the candidate actually run anything – a city ?
A state ?
A business ?
But more importantly , were he able to do it effectively ?
The problem with this question is that they do not adequately answer the question : “ What does it takes ? ” I guess the answer can be summarized in three words :
Acquire .
It takes specialized leadership , political or management experience and education .
A president needs to acquire experience and knowledge and be committed to a life long learning and experiencing process ; possess far more managing and political knowledge than what is needed to pass existing series of problems of a country .
Voters should consider developing their own style of choosing who should be the one before voting and saying yes and / or serve in the country .
Apply .
It takes the ability , capacity , willingness , and autonomy to apply the acquired political and management experience in presidency responsibility .
This is where rallies and protests came from .
There are numbers of candidates who have knowledge , leadership , political experience and management experience but who are prohibited from doing so .
Advance .
It takes a commitment to advance and apply the acquired presidency practices and procedures .
In a real sense , presidents should look upon their work as a public service , never parlaying their position of trust for personal profit .
A president has to be willing to advance their interests - not just the citizens of the country – to apply their acquired specialized knowledge regardless of form or amount of compensation .
What does it take to be a president ?
It takes a person who is well - educated , experienced , and well traveled .
It should be someone who can apply their specialized knowledge , not to be burdened by regularly structure , committed to rising to the top of their profession and mastering the management of a country .
I wish you could get transparent post it notes .
I 'd find them useful
Part of All Request Thursday
Google Street View is both a blessing and a curse .
For those of us who get lost easily , being able to see an actual photograph of your destination before leaving the house can be immensely helpful .
For others , the prospect of having everything photographed from the street — including possibly themselves — is very creepy .
The European Union agrees with the latter folks , and feels strongly that Google Street View — as implemented now in the US — would be a violation of EU privacy laws .
That 's why the organization reminded Google this week to respect local privacy laws once Street View makes its jump across the pond .
" Taking pictures on a street is n't in itself a problem but taking pictures anywhere can be .
We have sent a very strong message to Google and other Internet search companies in our report on search engines about complying with European privacy laws , " EU data protection supervisor Peter Hustinx said during a press conference , according to IDG News Service .
" Street View is only available in the US still , but I understand that it will work differently when it 's launched in Canada , so there is a capacity to deploy the service in different ways to suit different privacy laws . "
Hustinx 's comment references statements made by Google last fall in response to Canadian Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart , who had voiced concern that Street View might violate Canadian privacy laws when it comes to the Great White North .
At the time , Google responded by saying that it will do everything it can to respect local laws in other countries .
" Street View is n't available outside of the US yet , but when it is , we 'll be sure to respect local laws .
We understand that means that we 'll have to ensure that there are n't identifiable faces and license plates in some countries , " wrote Global Privacy Counsel Peter Fleischer .
" There 's an important public policy debate in every country around what privacy means in public spaces .
That balance will vary from country to country , and Street View will respect it . "
The main concern here is Google Street View 's tendency to catch people walking around in public every so often , permanently documenting their presence in certain areas of town or near certain buildings .
Some have felt that this is a massive , public intrusion on privacy if the individuals involved are identifiable — after all , few people want to be seen by the world walking out of the sex toy store on the other side of town .
The same goes for license plates on cars along the street , which are displayed in full view .
Google has long maintained that it follows the same rules in the US for " public spaces " that allow journalists to publish photos of people in public , but it is sympathetic to the plight of those who would not like to be identified .
The company previously offered a way for individuals to request that their faces or license plates be blurred , which Google said usually meets the requirements for privacy .
Do n't worry , Mr. Ed , no one can identify you now
Requiring individuals to file requests for each incident was not enough to satisfy privacy advocates , though , prompting the company to finally implement an automated solution this week .
The system has begun working on images of New York , according to Google , but will slowly expand out to the other 40 cities in Street View .
The only problem with that , as Fleischer pointed out on his personal blog in October , is that such technology is imperfect .
" Firstly , face recognition misses a lot of faces in practice , and secondly , a surprising number of natural features ( bits of buildings , branches , signs , chance coincidence of all of the above ) look like faces . "
Perhaps this is part of the explanation behind a widely - linked image this week of a horse in New York whose face has been blurred .
Despite the warning , the EU appears confident that Google will meet all privacy requirements to operate in Europe .
" Success or failure for them in Europe will depend on them respecting the laws .
They are smart , I 'm confident they wo n't ignore the laws , " Hustinx said .
If time were no object , we 'd all live a more secure computer life — we'd beef up our browsers , use complex passwords , and keep our data locked up with encryption Skynet could n't crack .
But that kind of stuff requires obscure software , tricky command line work , and most of a free weekend , right ?
Nope .
Anybody can feel more secure about their systems with the help of some free software and easy tweaks and add - ons .
We 've rounded up a good deal of these swift and simple security fixes for Windows , Mac , and Linux , so bust out the tinfoil hats and check 'em out after the jump .

Encryption made easy
When it comes to solid , dependable encryption on a hard disk or flash drive , nothing beats TrueCrypt , now available in GUI form for Windows , Mac , and Linux , and it 's not that hard to set up .
Still , you do n't need to set up system - wide encryption or virtual drives to ensure no nefarious third parties are looking at your communications :

Make strong but memorable passwords
The heart of any secure computer lies in its passwords — from commonly - used web passwords down to ultra - paranoid stuff like BIOS locking .
If you find yourself resorting all too often to birthdays and pet names , check out the following resources :

If you 're the type of person who writes their passwords down , like security expert Bruce Schneier , it never hurts to have at least one ultra-secure master password .
For that , look no further than the Ultra High Security Password Generator — you can just use 6 - 10 of the totally random characters , unless you feel up for memorizing more than 60 of them .
Once you 've got that uber - tight password , feel free to use it for your Windows / Mac / Linux login password or your multi-app keychain program , and then pick more basic , easy - to - grok passwords for web sites and the like , as suggested by a recent Macworld article

Finally got some time to throw these together with a little commentary ; these are the top 10 aquascapes from the 2007 Aqua Design Amano Aquascaping Contest .
The contest , held yearly and open to anyone , is the most significant award in the hobby and garners international recognition .
The entries are judged by Takashi Amano himself and other renowned judges .
There are some fairly original and interesting ideas in some of these and they are great inspiration !
World Ranking 1
This is a classic Nature Aquarium style tank and the contrast between the heavily planted left side and the open right side create a tranquil border scene complete with sandy foreground .
The use of rock and driftwood help to add structure to the aquascape .
World Ranking 2
A lovely hillside scene with rocky outcroppings and schools of tiny colorful fish create an idyllic scene in this iwagumi inspired layout .
World Ranking 3
The carefully placed petrified wood in the foreground of this beautiful aquascape combined with the lush , overflowing green vegetation create the atmosphere of overgrown ruins deep in a jungle .
The nearly terraced midground creates a beautiful " staircase " effect up to the dip in the plants where a school of fish hover like a flock of tropical birds .
This is my personal favorite of the top 10 .
World Ranking 4
Diagonal layers of ferns on driftwood create a stunning effect coupled with the contrast of the orange - tipped plant on the right side of the tank .
The grassy , pastoral foreground complete with a school of fish completes the scene .
World Ranking 5
This aquascape looks like a lush mountain , with the two background groups of plants overlapping , creating a valley - like feeling .
I love the contrast in colors and textures in this one .
World Ranking 6
An " island " aquascape , the driftwood adds a lot of interest and I especially like the hint of red peeking over the midground plants .
The white sand foreground must be a pain to keep clean though !
World Ranking 7
This is a particularly interesting aquascape .
I 'm not quite sure how the designer created the illusion of a waterfall , but it could have been done with sand or air bubbles .
Either way , the visual interest of this aquascape is amazing .
It 's such a beautiful tropical scene , with lush plants and mosses surrounding a clearing filled with grasses .
The slope of the entire aquascape also adds such depth to the scene that it makes it seem much bigger than it actually is .
World Ranking 8
The most striking feature of this aquascape is the vertical rock formations .
They are perfectly placed and dotted with all sorts of plants , creating an overgrown , natural look .
World Ranking 9
The black background of this aquascape helps to bring out the brilliant green colors of the plants , and the two red plants , on either side of the " valley " provide contrast .
World Ranking 10
Filipe Oliveira 's entry , this is such a unique and wonderful aquascape .
The moss " tree " and the pastoral setting beneath are fundamentally relaxing and pleasing to look at .
It 's also the only entry in the top 10 rankings from outside Asia .
McDermott , Skett and Melaney also set fire to Mr Mehmood 's trousers
Three men have been jailed for three years for a campaign of racial harassment against a Muslim colleague .
Amjid Mehmood was tied to railings and force - fed bacon while a rucksack with protruding wires was put on his locker , Wolverhampton Crown Court heard .
Fellow road maintenance workers Lee McDermott , of Rowley Regis , and Sean Melaney and Phillip Skett , both from Birmingham , admitted racial harassment .
The nine - month campaign of abuse came to light when Mr Mehmood told police .
McDermott , 31 , from Blue Stone Walk , Sean Melaney , 28 , of Steatham Grove , Kingstanding , and Skett , 39 , of College Road , Erdington , were each jailed for three years .
It was ... an appalling example of racial harassment and one that will not be tolerated in a civilised society
Judge John Warner
The men , who worked for road maintenance company Amey Mouchel at a depot in Bescot , Walsall , were accused of nine separate incidents of racial harassment from autumn 2005 to summer 2006 , the court heard .
The firm said it takes matters like this " very seriously " , but Mr Mehmood did not report the incidents until after he left the company .
Other incidents included the group removing Mr Mehmood 's trousers and exposing him to passing motorists while they worked on the M6 motorway in Cannock , Staffordshire , the court heard .
His trousers had also been set on fire while he was wearing them , the court was told .
While riots raged between Asians and Afro-Caribbeans in the Lozells area of Birmingham in 2005 , Mr Mehmood was driven by the group to an area with a large Afro- Caribbean population and abandoned .
The court heard they then racially abused him and told him the local residents " were coming to get him " .
' Deliberate bullying '
Mr Mehmood eventually reported the incidents to his employer and police .
But on his last day of work , he was tied to railings , hosed down with cold water and force - fed bacon , which he can not eat as part of his religious beliefs .
The incident was filmed on a mobile phone .
The court was told the harassment left him very depressed , suicidal and unable to sleep .
Sentencing the men , Judge John Warner said that " horseplay in the workplace is one thing but , this was a catalogue of deliberate bullying " .
It was an " appalling example of racial harassment and one that will not be tolerated in a civilised society " , he added .
Speaking after the case , the District Crown Prosecutor for the Black Country , Colin Molloy , urged anyone who was subjected to workplace harassment to report it to police .
' Internal investigation ' " It was a very prolonged and persistent attack , where the victim was picked upon simply because of his race , " he said .
The authorities would " tenaciously and robustly " prosecute those responsible for criminal offences committed against colleagues , he added .
In a statement , Amey Mouchel , said it " does not tolerate unlawful discrimination against any employee on the basis of their race " .
" The employee in question did not report the event until after he left the company , " the firm said .
" However , as soon as we became aware of the allegations we carried out our own internal investigation and disciplinary action was taken resulting in the three individuals leaving the company . "

What are these ?
PHILADELPHIA , Nov. 10 — From posting video on YouTube to enlisting friends through Facebook , all of the presidential candidates are looking for ways to harness the Internet .
In the case of Ron Paul , the Internet has harnessed him .
Mr. Paul , a 10 - term Texas congressman who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination , came into the campaign with a conservative platform : a return to the gold standard , abolition of the I.R.S. , a literal view of the Constitution .
His campaign was bare bones .
Then he started appearing in debates .
His emphatic presence and fierce opposition to the war in Iraq set him apart from his fellow Republicans .
Setting him even farther apart were ideas like blaming American foreign policy for the attacks of 9/11 and abolishing the Federal Reserve .
If his campaign had taken place in the pre-Internet era , it might have gone the way of his 1988 Libertarian campaign for president , as a footnote to history .
But because of the Internet ’s low - cost ability to connect grass - roots supporters with one another — in this case , largely iconoclastic white men — Mr. Paul ’s once - solo quest has taken on a life of its own .
It is evolving from a figment of cyberspace into a traditional campaign , with yard signs , direct mail and old - fashioned rallies , like one here on Saturday attended by a few thousand people under cold , gray skies .
Mr. Paul said it was his biggest rally so far .
He said it proved his campaign was more than “ a few spammers ” and called it a “ gigantic opportunity ” to establish credibility .
How much the Paul campaign had snowballed on the Internet became evident last week when supporters independent of the campaign raised $ 4 million online and an additional $ 200,000 over the phone in a single day , a record among this year ’s Republican candidates .
There is even talk that Mr. Paul could influence the primary in New Hampshire , where he could draw votes from Senator John McCain of Arizona , who is trying to revive the independent persona that helped him win the state ’s primary in 2000 .
From One Rat to Another /
How one man went from living the urban rat race to living like a desert rat
As planned , I met Carl ( not his real name ) at a bar in a tiny town 100 miles east of Reno .
The bar , a ramshackle but clearly well - loved place , was hosting a birthday party .
A pool table was loaded with potluck food reminiscent of the 1970s — a cheese log , cream puffs , fried chicken .
The birthday boy , a big guy who later confessed to me he was having trouble meeting women out here in the vast desert , careened across the room , clutching a gift bag to his heart .
Carl guided me over to the bar , bought me a Guinness in a can , and we settled down to talk .
Carl 's hair was long and peeked out from underneath a cowboy hat .
It had turned white since the last time I saw him , a year ago in downtown San Francisco .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
By most standards , Carl had been a successful urban businessman .
He started a small company when he was in his 20s , and it flourished and grew in the dot - com era and beyond .
He was happily married , and he and his wife owned their home in the East Bay .
Finances had never been a problem .
Now , on the cusp of 40 , Carl found himself living in a double - wide trailer and buying cans of beer from a 90 - year old bartender in a Podunk Nevada town .
And he had never been happier .
His eyes were shining in a way I had never seen when he lived in the city .
A year ago , Carl evacuated from San Francisco and moved to the Nevada desert .
He sold the business , sold his house , bought some land and relocated his wife and dog to what he calls the " deep desert . "
Now he 's obsessed with self - reliance and ingenuity , and told me about plans for a windmill that will generate some of the electricity used in the double - wide .
As we talked , it became clear that his emigration from city to country had radically changed Carl 's perspective on money , and that living in a scrubby wasteland had forever changed his notion of what is valuable .
Rewind to last year .
Carl , at work , in San Francisco , miserable .
He put in 14 hours a day , wandered around with wads of 20s in his pocket , ready to pay for whatever delight the city had for him .
" I used to eat out for every meal .
Breakfast , lunch and dinner , " Carl said .
" Then there 's coffee — what does that cost now , $ 5 a cup ? "
Then there was gas and drinks —
Carl felt like he was constantly buying or consuming something .
These days , Carl 's wife cooks their meals , which they eat sitting out on the deck with a view of jagged hills and snow capped peaks .
He often takes his four - wheeler out for drives in the desert , usually armed with one of his many guns .
" I am the lord of all I survey , " Carl said .
He chose the Nevada desert because of its small population and relatively harsh living conditions .
" If you want to maximize your freedom , you have to live in a place where no one else wants to live , " Carl advised .
As we walked to the car to drive up to the ranch , Carl explained how he sees the desolation of the surrounding scrubby desert as beautiful .
" Not to sound all religious , " Carl said , " when you spend all your time surrounded by man 's works — cement , cars , steel , bridges — it 's difficult to imagine a world without man .
When you live out in the wilderness , man is a minor part of the world .
Man 's accomplishments seem a lot smaller . "
Carl is taking part in a long - standing American tradition of giving up on the endless drive to earn more money and abandoning a society based on consumption of goods .
In the 1840s , there were the transcendentalists and writers like Nathaniel Hawthorne , who escaped the rat race in Boston to the quiet quarters of Brook Farm .
Henry David Thoreau went to live in the woods by Walden Pond .
In the 1970s , over 1 million hippies left cities for rural areas in order to grow their own food and live off the land .
These days — with the price of oil topping $ 130 a barrel , an ever - weakening dollar and food shortages worldwide , moving toward a more self - sufficient lifestyle suddenly seems like a good idea again .
Although there are n't any hard numbers on people like Carl , anecdotal evidence indicates that there may be a consumer backlash in the making .
Lynn R. Miller , the founder and publisher of Small Farm Journal , a how - to magazine about running small farms , with a circulation of 20,000 , has certainly noticed increased business in recent months .
" We 've had a lot of ups and downs over our 32 - year time period , " Miller said over the phone from his farm in Oregon .
" But right now we 're getting a lot of new customers . "
Miller receives 150-300 e-mails a day , many of them from people like Carl , who are worried about living in the city during a financial meltdown , and want to have peace of mind by becoming more self - sufficient .
Miller believes that starting a farm , contrary to popular opinion , does n't have to involve spending a lot of money .
" People who think they need a lot of money to buy the land , buy brand new equipment , hire people to do all the work , are destined for failure , " said Miller , who once lived in San Francisco himself before moving to Oregon .
" If instead you can embrace the notion that not daring is fatal , and go after the adventure , you will succeed . "
Carl is up for the adventure — and as for spending money , his budget is very low .
One of his inspirations was the book " Rancho Costa Nada , " by Philip Garlington .
The book tells the story of a newspaper reporter who purchased a few acres of land in the California desert with $ 400 , and then " retired " to his hand - made hogan where he lived off nothing , using various scrapper techniques .
Carl , however , had greater resources than Garlington , and bought 55 acres with $ 100,000 he pulled out of his home 's equity .
Although $ 100,000 for that many acres — with a spring - fed well that meets all their water needs — seems like a bargain , Carl has some regrets .
" I probably paid three times too much , " he said , " Because I did n't understand how to buy land in the West , which is , the rancher will look at you and calculate how much you 're worth .
I should have befriended the older people out here and got their help .
Maybe they would have negotiated on my behalf . "
Slowly over a period of nine years , Carl and his wife added buildings to the property while he continued to work in the city .
" I bought this 1970s double - wide for $ 1,600 , " Carl said proudly when he later gave me a tour of the property .
When Carl and his wife were finally ready to move out to the ranch for good last year , they had to sell their house .
In the softening housing market , this was no easy task .
With help from his real estate agent , Carl called upon everyone he knew to sell his home in the East Bay .
Eventually he found a friend of a friend who was interested .
A few months after the deal was sealed , the cracks in the housing market became craters .
Carl had gotten out just in time .
Once he and his wife moved to the ranch full - time , they realized the desert economy was vastly different from an urban one .
Money will get you anything in the city , but Carl said , " Because there 's no store , no place to shop , the money does n't do you any good here .
You need things to barter .
You work trade on someone else 's ranch . "
He had some farm equipment he had bought but ended up not needing , and bartered it for two generators , something he really needed for his ranch , which is totally off the electrical grid .
Carl noted that as he learned about bartering in the desert , he noticed that it served a social function too .
" Bartering is a way for them to make sure you 're OK .
It 's socialization , a way to examine you . "
As newcomers , Carl and his wife had to be vetted by the locals — by participating in the local economy , they were deemed socially acceptable .
Soon , they found themselves accepted into the circle of ranchers .
Carl and his wife 's " commute " to work involves walking down their trailer 's stairs and following a pebbly path for 200 feet to a work trailer next door , where they run an Internet book and toy business .
The warehouse , an airy Quonset hut , is right on the grounds of their property .
" Imagine how much that would cost in San Francisco — owning a warehouse outright ! "
Carl said while we wandered around his property .
UPS makes regular trips out to the desolate desert to pick up pallets of boxes to ship all over the world .
Carl then showed me his garden , which is mostly fruit trees watered by drip irrigation from his natural spring , and a small vegetable plot protected from wind and critters by a large fence .
He buys eggs from a neighbor who keeps chickens nearby .
One reason Carl wants to grow his own food is a matter of being self - reliant .
" We are far more helpless in the city .
In urban society , everyone does specialized jobs .
In the situation now , it 's suddenly in the interest of corn farmers to not feed you and sell it to the fuel companies .
That 's a massive social weakness . "
Energy is the same in Carl 's mind .
Solar panels provide most of his energy needs .
On a minimal budget , but with a steep learning curve , Carl managed to cobble together enough panels to power the couple 's lights , computers and television ( a main source of entertainment for them is cable television shows on DVD ) .
He said he cut costs by buying panels used , on eBay , or at RV stores .
I ask Carl what he 'll do if the price of gas becomes too expensive for UPS to take his packages .
" When things go badly , the urban person says : ' This is n't fair , ' " Carl said .
" In a rural area , you say : ' Of course things go wrong ' .
Things usually break out here , and when they do , you fix it .
It 's a bad thing about fuel prices , but I 'm sure we can come up with an individualized solution for our problems . "
Looking back on his life in the city , Carl is not ambivalent .
" It 's wasteful .
Living off grid is the ultimate education , " he said .
He knows exactly where his water comes from , how his television is powered .
This knowledge makes him less likely to waste power or water .
He wishes that more people would try to become self - sufficient .
" I always dreamed of the ideal of the self - sufficient individual — I had to live that way .
Otherwise , I would be just a person dreaming . "

How do you cut online crime , tackle child pornography , halt crippling viruses and get rid of spam ?
The answers could lie in a £ 200 m successor to the internet that computer experts are already referring to as the next rendition of the virtual world .
Researchers in the US want at least $ 350 m ( £ 175 m ) to build the Global Environment for Network Innovations ( Geni ) , touted by some as the possible replacement for today 's internet .
In Europe , similar projects are under way as part of the EU's Future and Internet Research ( Fire ) programme , which is expected to cost at least £ 27 m .
With online crime rising and traffic increasing rapidly , some academics believe it is time to have a serious discussion about what succeeds today 's internet .
" There 's a real need to have better identity management , to declare your age and to know that when you 're talking to , say , Barclays bank , that you 're really doing so , " said Jonathan Zittrain , professor of internet governance and regulation at the Oxford Internet Institute .
At the moment we are still using very clumsy methods to approach such problems .
The result : last year alone , identity theft and online fraud cost British victims an estimated £ 414 m , while one recent report claimed 93 % of all email sent from the UK was spam .
The backers of Geni are hoping that it can find answers to problems like this .
It is supported by America 's National Science Foundation and has a timescale of 10 - 15 years .
Many ideas revolve around so - called " mesh networks " , which link many computers to create more powerful , reliable connections to the internet .
By using small meshes of many machines that share a pipeline to the net instead of relying on lots of parallel connections , experts say they can create a system that is more intelligent and less prone to attack .
Dipankar Raychaudhuri , a professor at Rutgers University in New York , is working on alternative systems but says making progress is tough .
" People keep trying to evolve the network , but it has n't really changed in 20 years , " he said .
" Once you 've built something as large and complex as the internet it is difficult to start over again . "
One of Prof Raychaudhuri 's projects involves short - range communication .
The technology could be put inside cars , allowing them to talk to each other , and other systems , to bring long - held visions of safer , automated driving into reality .
Another option is to spread information around the planet in a different way : rather than scattering small pieces of the network across hundreds of millions of computers like puzzle pieces , each containing one tiny piece of the internet , alternative systems could be able to keep a local copy of the net .
Instead of surfing in public view , users would spend much of their time wandering around inside their own computers - leaving them less vulnerable to attacks from hackers and criminals .
Millions of pounds are being pumped into academic research , bringing to mind the early days of computer networking such as Arpanet , the forerunner of today 's internet .
Arpanet was funded by the American government for experimental research and began operating almost 40 years ago .
But while American computer scientists in the past relied on government money , they have had less support from the Bush administration , which has substantially reduced funding and channelled money instead into homeland security projects .
With those limitations in mind , some experts have warned that starting from scratch is a gamble .
Jon Crowcroft , Marconi professor at Cambridge University and one of Britain 's foremost internet engineers , is among those who do not believe a clean - slate approach is necessarily the way forward .
" There 's a risk in doing completely blue - sky research that fixes a problem but then turns out to be useless at the things the internet did well , " he said .
" There are n't that many who can do a clean - slate design – and you do n't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater . "
A reader sent me a link to a story about a Japanese woman who was accused of kicking a hole in some guy ’s door , crawling through the hole , and destroying his property .
She was acquitted when the court realized that her breasts were too big to allow her to fit through the hole .
http://mdn.mainichi.jp/national/news/20080304p2a00m0na028000c.html
In other words , if the tit does n’t fit , you must acquit .
The funniest thing about this story is the visual it puts in your head .
The accused turned out to be innocent .
But she had to sit in court while a room full of strangers , and later the press , imagined her trying to crawl through a hole in a door and getting snagged by her knockers .
It is all the funnier because the hole is in a door .
Somehow that is just more amusing .
Apparently there was an extensive courtroom discussion about the physics involved in getting a torso and two melons through a smallish hole .
I immediately started solving the puzzle in my head , wondering if you could poke your head through then flop one boob through , then an arm …no , it would n’t work .
But you ca n’t tell me you did n’t have the same thought .
If I were the prosecutor , and I saw that the defense was winning its case , I would demand that the accused put butter on her breasts and try to fit them , and optionally her head , through a smallish hole in front of the jury .
It would n’t help win the case , but it would make the afternoon go a lot faster .
[ Update : Okay , this just gets better .
Blog reader Aaron wonders if she could have reached through the hole in the door and just unlocked it .
I am laughing because I got so carried away thinking about how to get those boobs through the hole that I never once considered just reaching in and unlocking the door .
That is hilarious . ]
BioWare is still working on its first handheld effort , Sonic Chronicles for the Nintendo DS , but the team may be interested in developing for the Wii .
In a very brief part of an interview , Mark Darrah of BioWare revealed , “ Yeah , we ’re looking into Wii and PSP as a company , as well , but nothing ’s been decided , and nothing ’s been announced .
And we are , from styles of games , we are trying to broaden our portfolio .
But we still have Dragon Age , which is a more traditional style of BioWare game . ”
It does n’t seem as though there are concrete , official plans to develop for the Wii , though it is a plausible idea at this point .

Barack catches a break [ but Ambinder and Sully need to give me a break - see below ] - the NewsMax reporter who claimed Obama was in the church nodding in agreement during yet another of Jeremiah Wright 's speeches has a space - time problem .
From NewsMax :
Contrary to Senator Barack Obama ’s claim that he never heard his pastor Jeremiah A. Wright , Jr. preach hatred of America , Obama was in the pews last July 22 when the minister blamed the “ white arrogance ” of America ’s Caucasian majority for the world ’s suffering , especially the oppression of blacks .
However , Barack spoke that Sunday to a La Raza rally in Miami - here is video from his website , a Washington Times story , and the speaking schedule - Barack was due up at 1:30 PM .
This does not resolve Obama 's central problem - he is telling the nation that
" We ’ve got a lot of pent - up anger and bitterness and misunderstanding .
But what I continue to believe in is that this country wants to move beyond these kinds of divisions . "
but there is no evidence that , over the course of twenty years , he has moved his own minister past anger and bitterness .
However , if Obama was not attending church the specific day NewsMax claims he was , this gotcha is gone , and Obama 's ludicrous claim that he was unaware of Wright 's incendiary black separatism has not yet been disproven .
Props to Mickey Kaus for this .
MORE : Planes , trains , and automobiles ?
From Chicago to Miami for a 1:30 scheduled speech ?
I could believe Obama flew in Sunday morning , but to have time to go to church first ?
Per NewsMax , it was a Sunday morning sermon .
And there is a one hour time difference between Chicago , so even the 7 AM service would be a tight schedule .
Hmm , in by 8 AM ( Eastern time ) , out by 9 ( C'mon , do n't tell an old Catholic that the early service is n't the quick one ) , private plane for three hours to Miami - EZ !
Or at least , not utterly implausible .
Pretty high level of energy and commitment from Obama , though .
Show us some plane ticket receipts !
[ Or do n't - Obama was in Chicago Sunday AM and did have an event scheduled , but that event was not a church appearance .
Or so the Obama people say . ]
FWIW , Obama spoke to a rally in Manchester , NH on Friday , July 20 .
Chicago is an air hub , so he may have gone home that night .
But geez , playing " Where 's Obama ? " is absurd - Wright delivered twenty years of this stuff .
GIVE ME A BREAK : Marc Ambinder and Andrew Sullivan go off on William Kristol , who recited the NewsMax reporting in his own column .
Ambinder :
Bill Kristol 's New York Times column about Barack Obama this morning contains a major , prejudicial error .
Paragraph five : But Ronald Kessler , a journalist who has written about Wright ’s ministry , claims that Obama was in fact in the pews at Trinity last July 22 .
That ’s when Wright blamed the “ arrogance ” of the “ United States of White America ” for much of the world ’s suffering , especially the oppression of blacks .
In any case , given the apparent frequency of such statements in Wright ’s preaching and their centrality to his worldview , the pretense that over all these years Obama had no idea that Wright was saying such things is hard to sustain .
Let give some praise to Ambinder , who has the honor to present the Kristol 's NewsMax cite in context .
Reading the full paragraph ( my emphasis added ) , it is clear that Kristol quite reasonably believes that one swallow does not a springtime make , and that trying to demonstrate whether Obama was in attendance for specific inflamatory sermon is a mug 's game .
Did Kristol bow it ?
Apparently .
Was it a " major " error ?
He could have easily submitted the column with the NewsMax cite omitted and changed almost nothing else .
This is what Kristol makes of the Wright connection :
This does n’t mean that Obama agrees with Wright ’s thoroughgoing and conspiracy - heavy anti-Americanism .
Rather , Obama seems to have seen , early in his career , the utility of joining a prominent church that would help him establish political roots in the community in which he lives .
Now he sees the utility of distancing himself from that church .
Obama ’s behavior in dealing with Wright is consistent with that of a politician who often voted “ present ” in the Illinois State Legislature for the sake of his future political viability .
That is essentially the Matt Yglesias " defense " ; if Ambinder has offered an interpretation I can't find it .
THE NEWSMAX NON - DEFENSE : Groan - NewsMax has a clarification :
... Our writer , Jim Davis , says he attended several services at Senator Obama 's church during the month of July , including July 22 .
The church holds services three times every Sunday at 7:30 and 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. Central time .
While both the early morning and evening service allowed Sen .
Obama to attend the service and still give a speech in Miami , Mr. Davis stands by his story that during one of the services he attended during the month of July , Senator Obama was present and sat through the sermon given by Rev. Wright as described in the story .
Mr. Davis said Secret Service were also present in the church during Senator Obama 's attendance .
First , the original story is written as though the writer attended just one service .
But more importantly , if the best the Mr. Davis could come up with after attending " several " services was one " United States of White America " moment , maybe Obama really did sleep through or miss the worst of Wright .
Now , maybe he went to a service , saw Obama was n't there , and skipped out .
And on the other side , both church service tapes I sat through have objectionable moments .
Well , I have an idea for NewsMax - get it right the first time , ' kay ?
We want drip , drip , drip from Obama , but thanks for sharing .
WHO IS THIS REPORTER ?
NewsMax 's Jim Davis has three bylines in his career there ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) , one of them shared , if I can trust their own site Google search .
All of this is a helpful reminder of why I use NewsMax for transcripts and not much else .
AMERICAblog reader Bcre8ve writes in the comments :
As a Southerner , the attacks on Obama being elitist by the elites of this country , it made me uncomfortable .
Not just because the attacks are generally unfair and a distortion of what he actually said , but because it smacks of the sort of dirty , snide , racial attacks of the old South – the “ uppity ” black man attack .
That somehow he just does n’t seem to “ know his place ” , that his “ reach has exceeded his grasp ” .
Sort of like the attacks that he was n’t “ black ” enough .
Being made by white people .
( “ high yellow ” , anyone ? )
I could continue with the sort of vile , negative , stereotypical attacks that have been made by rich , white Southerners against black men that they view as a threat , but I would n’t want to give Hillary any ideas .
This is a disgusting , racial attack against Obama being portrayed as an attack on Pennsylvania voters , and I will have none of it .
This afternoon , I had the opportunity to ask former USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev if , after November , he would please be so kind as to lead and advise the next USA President as to how to get out of our quagmire .
This is what he replied , through a translator : " The Middle East is what the entire world is watching .
If things go badly for the USA , things go badly for all of us .
America must not abuse the trust it has from its allies , much of which has virtually stopped .
I am glad to see in this election a resurgence of interest in international affairs .
As I will say in my talk tonight , judging from the USA 's military budget , your nation seems to be at war with the world , and I sense that the American people do n't like this at all .
The size of your weapons budget is larger than it was at the peak of the Cold War , and larger all of the rest of the nuclear nations put together .
Why do you continue to build these weapons ?
This is amazing to me !
I think that [ former Secretaries of State ] George Schultz and Henry Kissinger , [ former US Senator ] Sam Nunn , and [ former Secretary of Defense ] William Perry have put together recently a very interesting plan in this regard , for which I appreciate their initiative .
With a background of conflict , military budgets in the USA continue to grow , and you produce more weapons .
The next president must show courage and responsibility to resist increasing your arms expenditures .
Most serious nations in the European Union are studying the proposal by Schultz and Kissinger , and the USA should heed this proposal .
You must bear in mind , that many nations find it difficult to trust America if it insists on maintaining its weapon superiority .
After January 1 , 1986 , when I proposed an abolition of Nuclear Weapons , there was an immediate reaction , that many did n't trust me , because of the USSR 's massive ground forces and conventional weapons .
I replied by making some large cuts in spending for conventional weapons , and eventually we signed a treaty in this context in Paris .
So I would put the same question to America and to Americans ! "
______________________________________
At the beginning of today 's Press Conference in Santa Fe , Gorbachev defended Putin 's concern over USA building extensive missile defense systems in Eastern Europe , but said that it was good that Bush and Putin took the time to recently meet , once before Bush leaves office .
He also stated that the USA needs to " elect a President who gets along with the world , and does n't brandish a big stick and make threats . "
This is " up to the American people to persuade its leaders , and this burden can't be shouldered by others . "
After 15 years of " pushing " since leaving office in 1992 , Gorbachev now believes that most world leaders and heads of state are " lagging , " and that what we need next is " planetary glasnost . "
He is encouraged by the progress in Russia of the political party he started , the Union of Social Democrats , given that more than 100 nations have the same kind of party , the Social Democrats .
He said the history of the USSR was a 70 year experiment with Communism in its extreme Bolshevik form , and that Russia had " paid the price " for doing so .
Gorbachev reminisced on Yeltsin being pressured by the International Monetary Fund and a few US Think Tanks which came to impose on Russia a free market approach , which did a lot of good .
He called it the " Washington Consensus " that was really the opposite ideology and effect of Bolshevism .

I have met and talked with several Nobel Peace Laureates , as well as several others I thought should have won that honorable prize .
The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to 95 individuals and 20 organizations since 1901 .
The Laureates I have exchanged extensive correspondence with include His Holiness , the Dalai Lama , and Kofi Annan .
I have talked at great length with Jody Williams .
I asked Oscar Aria Sanchez , former - and - now - again President of Costa Rica , to help create a branch in Santa Fe of the United Nations University for Peace ; Dag Hammarskjold 's nephew Knut was on the Board of Honorary Advisors of this conception , as was Gandhi 's grandson , Arun , and Einstein 's granddaughter , Evelyn .
So was former USA Secretary of Interior , Stewart Udall .
As an organization making a huge difference in the world , Doctors without Borders is my highest inspiration daily in my work to get the neurotoxic and carcinogenic artificial sweetener , aspartame , off the market by rescinding its approval to be sold .
Mairead Corrigan of Ireland was the first Nobel Peace Laureate I talked with for several hours at the Second United Nations Special Session on Disarmament in 1978 .
I also had a very long conversation with Canada 's Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau , and I have always thought he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize .
Certainly , George Mc Govern deserves something like a Nobel Peace Prize , for his lifetime of pacifism .
Yet somehow , today former President Mikhail Gorbachev was the most compelling .
I am certain that because I was asking on behalf of tens of millions of Americans and several billions people in hundreds of nations , that he really will help to advise and guide the next USA President to bring the USA out of the Middle East , and to end the war in Iraq .
There really is no choice .

I. Charles Darwin ’s theory of evolution , called natural selection , stated that different species originated from shared ancestors , with the differences in the organisms being caused by adaptations to different environments .
The environment determines which species are best fit to survive , and the traits of the organisms are passed down to new generations .
With enough time , such passages of traits could lead to whole new species .
This theory was developed after more than two decades of observations , studying thousands of animal and plant samples , all with extraordinary inferences drawn from observed similarities and differences .
II .
Intelligent Design ( ID ) is essentially a negative argument : the forces at work , whether natural selection or something else , are not sufficient to bring about aspects of life which we observe , such as humans — therefore , there must have been an intelligent designer .
The appearances of organisms , then , have nothing to do with the survival success of their ancestors , like in natural selection : the intelligent designer brought life about quickly in all the various forms we observe today , as opposed to the slow process theorized in natural selection .
III .
Using the evidence I ’ve seen for both proposals , I ’ve concluded that evolutionary theory better explains the phenomena of different life - forms .
I ’ll establish why I think so by considering the simplicity , explanatory power , and predictive success of both ideas .
IV .
In terms of simplicity , I think that evolutionary theory wins hands down .
Speaking about ontological complexity , both ideas incorporate the existence of various life - forms , but with Intelligent Design one must also include the existence of the designer , as well as the tools used in the design .
In addition , a problem is raised regarding the origin of the existence of the intelligent designer ; since it has abilities far more complex than even the current abilities of human beings , are we to suppose that it too was designed ?
In respect to dynamic complexity , both theories appear to accept the reproductive capabilities of organisms ( I ’m not sure about Intelligent Design ) , but Intelligent Design is the more complex nonetheless .
Natural selection would imply the existence of biological processes which explain the similarities between offspring and parent organisms ; such a thing is n’t too hard to believe because we can observe reproduction in organisms , meaning that something must be functioning within them which allows for such a thing .
But Intelligent Design posits the existence of design processes outside of what goes on in reproduction , which have to be more complex because such designing gives rise to not just one type of organism , like a calf , but a multitude of organisms .
V. Evolutionary theory also wins in regards to its explanatory power .
Through the fossil records , the gaps between species are bridged ; fossils indicate a transitional stage from one type of organism to another , just as Darwin believed would be the case .
Intelligent Design cannot account for such transitional fossils , and every fossil found sheds greater light on the bridges between species and the weakness of ID ’s hypothesis .
VI .
ID ’s argument of irreducible complexity , which argues against evolution , fails to explain life forms because certain organisms have parts which are similar to other organism ’s parts , but serve different purposes which lend support to evolution .
A great example of this was the bacterial flagellum , which ID posits as an organism with an irreducibly complex motor ; its motor has a similar structure to a syringe - like part belonging to the Yersinia pestis bacterium , and this is because they are made of the same kind of protein , but the Yersinia simply lacks the number of proteins need for the motor .
Despite missing such proteins , the structure functions as an apparatus for carrying diseases , particularly the Bubonic plague ; this is hard evidence that this motor then is not “ irreducibly complex . ”
VII .
Lastly , I think evolution sort of wins by default in regard to predictive success , even though its success is astoundingly positive .
ID offers no predictions .
After its initial claims regarding the designing of species , it is silent regarding the implications of such designs , if any — meaning that there is nothing for scientists to test .
Whereas evolution offers a plethora of predictions , with no scientific discoveries ever found which contradict such predictions in over 150 years .
Darwin ’s prediction about the fossil record was proven true , and modern genetics has recently proven Darwin ’s contention of a common ancestry of humans and apes .
In fact , every observation and experiment made , whether in molecular biology or modern genetics , has only confirmed the truth of evolution ’s theory .
This shows evolution to be an argument with a high degree of predictive success .
VIII .
The conclusion then is that whether one looks at simplicity , explanatory power , or predictive success , it is clear that Darwin ’s theory of evolution by natural selection trumps the idea of Intelligent Design , and demonstrates a coherent and testable prediction regarding the origin of species .

While the world of online bitcoin gambling is literally exploding , the various companies on the market are struggling to attract players , vying for promotions and bonuses of all kinds .
The “ no deposit ” bonus necessary being the most popular of all .
But there are so many crypto casinos offering bonuses today , among other offerings just as interesting , it becomes difficult to know which promo is not to be missed !
Deciding where to put your money ?
After choosing the kind of game you want , the type of atmosphere you are looking for and the level of quality and reliability you are seeking , another factor – perhaps most important – to take into account is the type of bonus offered by the different bitcoin gambling sites .
It may be money directly credited to your account , bitcoin bonuses no deposit required , Bonus codes , the loyalty points , gifts and more !
As we have already said , the sector is growing and there is fierce competition , operators are becoming increasingly creative and generous to attract new customers .
This should guide the players in their choice .
Ask yourself , if you prefer more sophisticated graphics , 100 or $ 500 available so you can bet .
Of course , most players will opt for the second choice .
To help , we ’ve compiled below a short but useful list of the best promos offered by our casinos .
Take time to look at these sites because they have already proved their worth and that is why they are among the favorite bitcoin casinos .
Most casinos offer a sign - up bonus that is often reflected by an offer in line with the initial deposit .
In other words , a casino may decide to offer up to 100 % of a deposit of 100 $ .
This is the type of promotion is the most common .
However , some bids may be even more exciting than this example , but also much more complicated : it is better to consider the minimum bet and withdrawal rules before opting for a site offering a huge bonus .
Bonuses and promotions may take different forms and can be extremely tempting .
The “ no deposit required ” bonus has been met with great success .
They have the advantage of allowing the player to play and to pocket his winnings without making a deposit .
They represent a great opportunity to test a site for the first time before playing with them for good .
But all the big players that are reading , will be thrilled to learn that the bonuses reserved for them are even better !
But again , because we can’t repeat it enough , check the types of bonuses offered by casinos where you register to identify which offers are of the best value for your money , especially that , although free , they change all the time .
We strongly encourage you to check our page ranking where we organize and display a complete list of bitcoin casinos , regularly updated based on the best available bonus or “ no deposit required ” bonus .
And if the latter is important , there are still other criteria that you must check before you engage with an online casino .

More and more pets are being dumped for frivolous reasons , according to the RSPCA , who last week revealed that the number of abandoned animals rose to 7,347 last year - a 23 per cent increase on the previous year .
The charity blames the figures on our " throwaway society " , and exposed some of the astonishing excuses that owners use , including a cat given away because she did n't match the new carpet , and a dog who was unwanted because " she hurts my legs when she wags her tail " .
Here , FEMAIL showcases ten cats given to the RSPCA in Southall , West London , all of whom are now in urgent need of new homes .

The Pew Research Center has presented a simple linear chart that places the ideology of the three Presidential contenders and the current President on a left - right scale , along with the median ideology of the voting public .
A two - axis chart would be more informative , but this one - dimensional distribution reveals a great deal :
1 ) The center of gravity of the US public is significantly right of the center , no matter what leftists may say / wish .
McCain , thus , is far closer to the center of gravity than Bush , who in turn is closer than Obama or Clinton .
The GOP is far less dependent on centrists to win elections than Democrats are .
2 ) The notion that McCain is ' not conservative enough ' does not stand up to statistical evidence .
Those who whine about McCain 's support for amnesty of illegals or compromises on judicial appointments forget that even Ronald Reagan did three things that were not purely conservative .
a ) Reagan granted amnesty to illegals in 1986 b) Reagan appointed two moderate Supreme Court Justices , Kennedy and O'Connor , and only one conservative , Scalia .
c )
Reagan did increase income taxes , after first lowering them
No President will be purely conservative , nor should he / she be .
So I reject the initial conservative hostility to McCain ( which seems to have somewhat abated ) .
The job of a political party is to win elections , and the fact that Republicans span a wider ideological spectrum than Democrats should be a source of pride , which brings us to observation # 3 .
3 ) The Democratic Party has been enslaved by fringe leftists .
Obama and Clinton are nearly identical in ideology , yet very far to the left of the center of gravity .
The purple oval I have inserted , along with the question mark , represents a vacuum in the moderate left .
A large number of voters clearly reside there , but the Democratic party of today will not nominate someone who resides in the purple zone , leaving these voters as ideological orphans .
Thus , Clinton and Obama have to lie ( assisted by a complicit leftist media ) to appear more moderate than they are , and hope that the public does n't figure that out .
Joseph Lieberman , the VP candidate against Bush / Cheney just seven years ago , was run out of the Democratic Party simply for not being opposed to bringing democracy to Iraq .
Bill Clinton 's actions of supporting free trade agreements like NAFTA , sending troops to fight proto - Al - Qaeda terrorists in Somalia in 1993 , reforming welfare , cutting taxes on capital gains in 1997 , attacking Saddam Hussein to remove his WMD programs in 1998 , etc. are all actions that the modern Democratic party would not take .
I am a political moderate , in that I care about only three issues .
These are , in order of importance to me :
a ) aggresively fighting against terrorists and other enemies of democracy and women 's rights , b ) the preservation of free market meritocracy , and the use of market forces to solve problems , and c ) a judicial system that punishes crime , instead of ignoring justice and proceeding to reward the criminal as a poster - child for some perverted cause .
I have a neutral / uninterested position on abortion , gay marriage , gun ownership , prayer in schools , and many other domestic issues .
Yet , I am considered ' right wing ' by some extreme leftists , on account of holding the above three positions alone .
Until 2001 , it did not even occur to me that only one of the two parties still advocates these three basic principles - I assumed that these were values held by any logical person .
I wish I had a true choice between two parties , but I do n't .
In the words of once - Democrat Ronald Reagan , I did not move away from the Democratic Party , it moved away from me .
The moderate left died in 1968 , when two of their most promising young leaders were assassinated .
Since then , Democrats have only won three of the last ten elections .
After the disaster of Jimmy Carter , Democrats never again won 50 % of the popular vote in SEVEN attempts , while Republicans achieved this feat 4 times over that period ( 1980 , 84 , 88 , 2004 ) .
This is a truly shambolic performance from the Democrats of the modern era .
Jimmy Carter did more to ensure a generation of GOP dominance than Reagan , Gingrich , Limbaugh , or Rove ever could .
Furthermore , Democrats are not capable of getting a majority of voters who earn over $ 30,000 a year .
The middle class earning between $ 50,000 and $ 75,000 voted just 44 % for Democrats .
A party that is soundly rejected by the middle class and upper class is not positioned for long - term success .
2008 is a year where more factors , from a weak economy to an unpopular incumbent , are working against Republicans than at any time since 1976 .
Thus , Democrats should be in a position to win by a landslide , but even now are trailing in the polls , and have at best a 50/50 chance of winning the White House in November , with a nominee far more distant from the voting public than John McCain is .
Even if , say , Obama wins , he might repeat the Carter - esqe phenomenon of ensuring another generation of GOP dominance starting from 2012 .
If 2008 is 1976 , 2012 could be 1980 .
Once again , the job of a political party is to attract the votes of 50 % of the public , and Democrats can only hope to achieve this by fluke .
If Democrats want to become a national party again , they must move into the purple zone , period .
I sincerely want them to do this , as this will force the GOP to compete to become a better party as well , rather than stagnate into mediocrity with the knowledge that they only have to be better than the most pathetic of opponents .
When will Democrats purge the leftists and move to the center ?

WHEN BLACKWATER founder Erik Prince took his seat before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last October , in the midst of a firestorm over the killing of 17 civilians in Baghdad by his contractors the previous month , the 38 - year - old was at the helm of a fast - growing global business — and had the confidence to match .
Sporting a neatly pressed suit and a fresh military - style haircut that evoked his service as a Navy SEAL , Prince had been prepped by crisis - management specialists from the Beltway PR firm Burson - Marsteller , and throughout the tense four - hour hearing he leaned back frequently to confer with his lawyer .
A private man who seldom gives interviews , he nevertheless seemed at ease in a room filled with politicians , cameras , and reporters .
He extolled his men’s professionalism — ” I believe we acted appropriately at all times ” — and bristled at the term most commonly used to describe his line of work .
“ The Oxford dictionary defines a mercenary as a professional soldier working for a foreign government , ” he said .
“ We have Americans working for America , protecting Americans . ”
The truth is a bit more complex .
As profit margins in the private security industry have narrowed — Blackwater clears just 10 percent on its primary State Department contract , Prince testified — the CEO has increasingly looked beyond American shores .
More and more of his foot soldiers now come from Third World countries , and his corporate network is aggressively pitching for business from foreign governments .
( It has already trained naval commandos in Azerbaijan and has been hired to train special forces troops in Jordan . )
In his most ambitious moments , Prince has set out a vision in which his companies would act as for - profit peacekeepers , working with the United Nations and other international organizations in conflict areas around the world .
Even Blackwater ’s marketing materials are infused with the imagery of global humanitarianism ; one of the company ’s recent ads shows a tiny malnourished infant being spoon - fed and proclaims the company ’s intention to “ provide hope to those who still live in desperate times . ”
Yet the most important vehicle for Prince ’s global aspirations is n’t Blackwater proper , but Greystone Limited , a company he quietly founded in 2004 as his firm ’s “ international affiliate . ”
According to Chris Taylor , a former Marine Recon soldier who until May was Blackwater ’s vice president for strategic initiatives , Prince sought to build a new brand .
“ Blackwater has a sexy name and people pay attention to it , ” Taylor says , and sometimes that high profile “ may not fit the proposed mission . ”
In particular , he says , “ international opportunities ” were to be “ looked at through Greystone . ”
Nearly all of the 20 or more companies Prince has launched or acquired over the years are U.S. based .
Greystone , however , was incorporated in the Caribbean tax haven of Barbados , although it is managed from Blackwater ’s headquarters in Moyock , North Carolina .
( The Barbados address and phone number listed in the federal government ’s contractor database trace back to a firm that specializes in shielding corporate revenues from U.S. tax authorities . )
“ As far as I know , they were the same company with different names , ” notes a contractor who worked for Blackwater in Iraq .
Unlike Blackwater , Greystone has managed to stay almost entirely out of public view , and it remains a mystery even to industry insiders .
Doug Brooks , president of the International Peace Operations Association , a trade group of which Greystone was a member until late last year , could n’t say what the company does .
( Blackwater pulled out of the group last October after the IPOA launched an investigation into its conduct ; Greystone followed suit in November . )
Neither could R.J. Hillhouse , a political scientist and private - security expert who follows the industry closely .
Even a spokesman for the State Department ’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security , which has issued contracts to Blackwater on which Greystone works as a subcontractor , admits he has never heard of the company .
Despite — or perhaps because of — its close - to - the - vest MO , the company has built up a certain mystique .
One contractor we spoke to said he was present when Greystone managers arrived to claim their office space at Blackwater ’s Baghdad headquarters .
They were a different breed from the “ yee - haw cowboys ” that filled Blackwater ’s ranks , and their tattoos indicated backgrounds in elite military units like Marine Recon , the Navy SEALs , and the Green Berets .
“ They did n’t talk to the other Americans , ” he said , let alone foreigners .
“ They had different bodies , different mentalities , and used different language .
They had a different professional attitude . ”
Greystone ’s managing director is a 40 - year - old ex-SEAL named Christopher Burgess , who first met Prince while the pair was in training for the Navy ’s elite unit .
Burgess rarely grants interviews , but he agreed to answer some of our questions in writing .
Asked why Greystone had chosen to incorporate in Barbados , he responded that the country “ is a well known business center with established business practices and banking systems . ”
Tax benefits aside , at least one industry observer has suggested that offshoring Blackwater ’s sister company may have been an attempt to skirt strict regulations on the export of military services .
Burgess disputes the notion .
Greystone , he said , seeks “ State Department licensure for all security services overseas , ” and complies with “ other trade controls and restrictions . ”
Taylor admits that taxes were a factor , but says the primary goal was to better position Greystone for international contracts .
“ It ’s a matter of focus and efficiency , ” he says .
“ I do n’t think it obfuscates anything . ”
THE SCION of a prominent and politically connected Michigan family , Erik Prince followed in his father ’s entrepreneurial footsteps .
Edgar Prince was a billionaire auto - parts maker who provided seed money for conservative activist Gary Bauer ’s Family Research Council .
After his father ’s death in 1995 , Prince combined his inherited wealth and Special Forces background to launch Blackwater .
The company ’s original business goal was modest — training state and local cops to be better marksmen .
But then came the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , and with them a bonanza for the private security industry .
Since then , Prince ’s holding company , Prince Group LLC , has come to include numerous ventures .
Among them are Presidential Airways , an air - charter and cargo - transport firm ; Pelagian , a maritime security operation with its own 153 - foot vessel , helipad - equipped and outfitted for training and disaster response ; and defense projects to make high - tech armaments such as mine - resistant armored vehicles and surveillance blimps .
In February 2007 , Prince rounded out his operations with Total Intelligence Solutions , a “ one- stop ” intelligence and risk consultancy for the private sector staffed by former CIA officials .
The total of the Prince Group ’s federal contracts , some of which are classified , is hard to ascertain .
But according to government records , Blackwater alone pulled in close to $ 600 million in fiscal year 2006 — an impressive figure considering its annual take from government work was well under $ 1 million prior to 9/11 .
Its checks come from a host of agencies , including the departments of State , Defense , and Homeland Security , and the CIA , which , a European Parliament investigation alleges , has hired Prince ’s air - charter company to transport terrorist suspects to secret interrogation sites .
( Blackwater denies any involvement in rendition flights . )
The Prince business model calls to mind an earlier generation of private security companies typified by South Africa - based Executive Outcomes and U.K. - based Sandline International .
Through the 1990s , these companies deployed private armies for the embattled regimes of countries such as Angola and Sierra Leone , waging war against rebels allegedly in exchange for diamond and oil concessions .
Although both are now defunct , their alumni remain among the industry elite ; Tim Spicer , Sandline ’s former ceo , now runs Aegis Defence Services , which contracts with the Pentagon to coordinate security for all reconstruction projects in Iraq .
And as Executive Outcomes founder Eeben Barlow wrote in a memoir released in South Africa last year , the main difference between his company and those now working in Iraq “ under the guise of security companies ” may simply be that Blackwater et al. have government backing .
“ After we had blazed the path for military consultancy and advisory work , ” he wrote , “ companies realised that the military market was an open playing field . ”
NONE , PERHAPS , realized it more than Greystone , which has set out to meld government and corporate business into a seamless global web .
In February 2005 , the company was inaugurated at an exclusive event at the Ritz - Carlton Hotel in Washington , D.C.
There , a carefully selected coterie of foreign dignitaries and international businessmen strode past armored vehicles conspicuously parked near the entrance .
Inside , they browsed tables stocked with military - grade weapons and equipment , including uniforms , boots , knives , and gas masks , according to one invited guest .
The keynote speaker was Cofer Black , the former State Department and CIA official who , as head of the Agency ’s Counterterrorist Center , famously promised after 9/11 to deliver Osama bin Laden ’s head to the White House in a box of dry ice .
Just two weeks before the Ritz - Carlton shindig , Black ( now chairman of Total Intelligence Solutions ) had joined a parade of officials leaving government service to work for Prince .
In his speech , he urged attendees to consider our “ changing world , ” the “ far different threats ” America faces , and the “ creative solutions and approaches ” required to deal with them .
Black ’s rhetoric closely echoed Greystone ’s promotional materials .
“ In today ’s grey world , ” reads one of the company ’s pamphlets , “ the solutions to your security concerns are no longer as simple as black and white . ”
Greystone offers clients full protective details staffed by special operations , law enforcement , and intelligence personnel “ for any threat scenario around the world . ”
It is prepared to train indigenous forces “ in developing a capability to conduct defensive and offensive small group operations . ”
Greystone contractors can stage mock “ red team ” attacks on secure installations to identify potential vulnerabilities .
The company will work “ in support of national security objectives as well as private interests ” and is prepared to deploy “ proactive engagement teams ” — suggestive of offensive forces , not just security guards .
Prince ’s companies maintain a small fleet of aircraft , including Little Bird helicopters , commonly used in Special Forces operations , and CASA - 212s , rugged turboprops with high - mounted wings for moving cargo or up to 28 passengers .
Blackwater also has sought to acquire at least one Embraer Super Tucano fighter — a lightweight plane used by several Latin American governments for counterinsurgency , pilot training , and monitoring .
In an early promotional video ( see motherjones.com /greystone ) , Greystone operators , some wearing black ski masks , are shown doing everything from handing out food to refugees and protecting diplomats to jumping out of airplanes , running cars off the road , and landing strike teams on Iraqi rooftops — all to a synthesized drum - and - bass soundtrack .
“ They have the ability to do whatever tickles your pickle , ” says one private - security contractor .
“ They have services literally from A to Z. Aviation .
Special operations .
Rescue .
Ransom .
You name it .
If you got the money , they got the honey .
You can hire 17 James Bonds with Arnold Schwarzenegger in charge , or you can knock on the same door and tell them , ‘ I ’m a Kuwaiti businessman and would like protection for my convoys between Kuwait City and Baghdad , but I only have half a million dollars a month . ’
Greystone will take the contract , and they ’ll hire grunts . ”
In addition to being a regular subcontractor for Blackwater in Iraq , Burgess said Greystone has also been hired directly by “ foreign governments and private sector clients to provide static security , K - 9 support , [ vulnerability ] assessments , aviation maintenance and management , and training . ”
He would n’t specify clients or countries of operation “ due to operational security concerns , ” except to say Greystone has worked “ in various Middle Eastern countries . ”
The company has also registered with the UN ’s procurement division , theoretically allowing it to compete for international peacekeeping contracts ; speaking at a 2006 conference in Amman , Jordan , Black suggested that Blackwater could rapidly dispatch a brigade - size force to , say , Darfur .
Taylor , the former Blackwater VP , says : “ You just ca n’t deny the capability that Erik Prince has developed to assuage human suffering around the world . ”
So far , though , the world seems disinclined to take advantage of Greystone ’s capabilities :
In late December , after we asked a UN official about the company ’s presence in the organization ’s procurement database , Greystone and Presidential Airways were removed from the list ; a UN source told us it was a temporary move pending an investigation into “ ethical ” concerns .
For its part , Blackwater has tried to crack the African market with a bid to train South Sudanese security forces long engaged in battle with the country ’s Islamic regime , although a company spokeswoman says it has no current contracts to do so .
Writing in the Lebanese daily An - Nahar late last year , Sudan ’s ambassador to Lebanon said that Blackwater had sought permission to enter Sudan under “ a different name ” — Greystone .
IN ADDITION TO prospecting for international contracts , Greystone has become Prince ’s primary recruiter of foreign military muscle .
On its website , the company says its operators are drawn “ from the best militaries throughout the world ” and represent “ numerous nationalities . ”
Its reliance on foreign recruits , it claims , is a matter of “ cultural sensitivity ” and “ awareness . ”
What the PR materials do n’t say is that Greystone , along with other security companies , likely outsources its work overseas for the same reason many other businesses do — it brings down costs and helps bypass bothersome regulations .
“ They ’re going to pay these people a lot less , and they ’re not going to respect the same type of employee and labor rights that U.S. nationals would require , ” says Erica Razook , an Amnesty International lawyer whose work focuses on private - security contractors .
Consider the case of Greystone subcontractor ID Systems .
Incorporated in Panama and headquartered in a nondescript office complex in Bogotá , Colombia , the company in 2005 placed newspaper ads that drew men with military experience — a plentiful commodity in a country torn by civil war and terrorized by guerrillas and paramilitaries .
According to one ID Systems recruit , a former Colombian army officer who asked to remain anonymous , he and at least 30 other men were promised $ 4,000 per month to do security work for Blackwater in Iraq .
They went through a quick refresher course in firearms and hand - to - hand combat at the Colombian army ’s cavalry school in northern Bogotá , he said ; among the instructors were several Americans , all ex-U.S. military working for Greystone .
Afterward , the recruits returned home to wait for the call to Iraq .
It came late one evening in June 2006 .
The men assembled at ID Systems ’ offices , where they were met by Gonzalo Adolfo Guevara , a former Colombian army captain who had overseen their recruitment .
He handed them contracts and told them to be at the airport in four hours .
They were told they would be making not $ 4,000 but $ 2,700 per month — still not bad in Colombia , where some workers only earn that much in a year .
But the actual contract , which some of them did n’t read until after they were airborne , provided for just $ 1,000 per month , or $ 34 per day .
On arriving in Baghdad , the men were issued weapons and introduced to Blackwater and Greystone managers .
Bitterness turned to anger when they discovered that their pay was about one - fourth that of the Romanians they were replacing .
They composed a letter to managers at ID Systems , Greystone , and Blackwater demanding either a raise or a ticket back to Colombia .
The companies stonewalled , and it was n’t until three months later , after reports of the dispute had appeared in Semana , Colombia ’s largest newsmagazine , that the men were finally sent home .
( Chris Taylor says there was no impropriety : “ Before every single one of those professionals were deployed , they understood there was a change in the contract .
Those who went understood perfectly what they were signing . ” )
According to the former recruit , ID Systems continues to supply personnel to Greystone .
But Guevara , the man who deceived the recruits about their wages , is no longer involved — he was shot and left to die outside a Bogotá bakery last May .
IT WAS NEITHER GUEVARA nor Erik Prince who pioneered the idea of hiring foreign soldiers to do the business of the U.S. government .
That took the imagination of a Chilean American businessman named José Miguel Pizarro .
“ Pizarro opened the door , ” says José Luis Gómez del Prado , a former diplomat who heads the UN Working Group on the use of mercenaries ; it ’s thanks to Pizarro that recruiting ex-soldiers from Latin America has become “ a big business . ”
Born in California and raised in Santiago , Pizarro served ten years as an officer in the Chilean army and another three as a Marine Corps translator attached to the U.S. Southern Command .
By March 2003 , he was heading a small defense - consulting firm in suburban Washington , D.C. Pizarro was connected and well spoken .
He was also telegenic , and as the U.S. stormed toward Iraq he was hired as an on - air military analyst with cnn en Español , the network ’s Spanish - language affiliate .
It was there , in the cafeteria between shows , that he befriended a former U.S. general , also working as an analyst , who helped him hatch the idea of renting former Chilean soldiers to American private security companies .
“ He explained to me how the opportunity to do business in the Middle East was growing , that there was a need for private , professional security forces in Iraq , ” Pizarro recalls .
“ I started showing up in the cafeteria with pen and paper , taking notes , taking names .
It took me several weeks to form the idea . ”
Before long , Pizarro was cold - calling security contractors to pitch his commandos .
It was n’t an easy sell .
“ No one in any of the firms would even return his calls , ” says one industry expert Pizarro turned to for advice .
Pizarro recalls his first meeting with Blackwater president Gary Jackson : “ He told me , ‘ This is a respectable company , and we ’re going into a war zone .
I need professional commandos , not peasants with rifles . ' ”
Not easily discouraged , Pizarro scored an appointment with Prince , who signed on for an initial batch of recruits to add to Blackwater ’s security operations in Iraq .
Pizarro left the meeting starstruck with his first paying customer .
“ He ’s my hero , ” Pizarro says .
“ He ’s a patriot , a great Christian , and has the balls that 250 million Americans would love to have . ”
Back in Santiago , Pizarro formed a new company called Grupo Táctico — incorporated in Uruguay to sidestep Chilean laws prohibiting paramilitary activity — and posted an ad in a Chilean newspaper offering recruits $ 3,000 per month .
More than a thousand men sent résumés , including some active - duty Chilean soldiers .
Blackwater reps traveled to Chile to review the applicants , and by February 2004 , Pizarro and about 75 of his top recruits — most of them former Chilean special forces , marine commandos , and paratroopers — were brought to Blackwater ’s compound in Moyock for training .
Within weeks , they flew to Iraq , where they found themselves working alongside a veritable United Nations of security contractors : Nepalese and Indian Gurkhas , South Africans , and Eastern Europeans , to name a few .
They became known as the “ Black Penguins ” because of the distinctive figures they cut on foot patrol , weighed down by weapons and flak jackets .
Pizarro took to the term and designed a shoulder patch for his recruits : a penguin with an M - 4 carbine across its chest .
TO FIND THEIR DISCOUNT SOLDIERS , Blackwater , Greystone , and their competitors have built recruitment networks reaching deep into the paramilitary milieus of the Third World .
It works like this : Blackwater , for example , will win a U.S. government contract ; it will then subcontract with itself — that is , with Greystone — to do the job .
From there , Greystone looks to its network of international affiliates , firms like Pizarro ’s Grupo Táctico in Chile or ID Systems in Colombia , which maintain informal relationships with what are known in the trade as “ briefcase recruiters ” — individuals with connections to the local paramilitary scene .
These men find the recruits and funnel them back up the chain until , finally , they are deployed alongside U.S. forces in Iraq .
The practice also serves as a convenient firewall , shielding U.S. - based companies from direct liability for the actions of their subcontractors .
“ If a court is looking at these issues , where the contract is signed is a factor , ” explains Amnesty ’s Razook .
“ There is a lot there that would take it out of a U.S. court ’s control . ”
Briefcase recruiting is a little - known niche of the private security business that has attracted some less - than - savory characters .
Take Julio ( a.k.a. “ George ” ) Nayor , a Cuban American currently serving an 11 - year sentence at a federal prison in Miami for drug trafficking .
A one - time associate of Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar , Nayor escaped arrest in the United States in the early 1990s and fled , by means of a fake passport and various false identities , to San Salvador .
There he reportedly opened a gym and several restaurants including one he named Karaoke George , which was adjacent to an upscale shopping mall .
In late 2004 , Nayor placed newspaper ads seeking men to work on contract in Iraq for an unspecified U.S. security firm ; recruits were to meet him at the karaoke bar .
According to a Washington
Post reporter who witnessed the scene , men lined up outside for weeks .
“ This is the future of global security , ” Nayor bragged to the reporter , adding that he ’d already accepted 300 Salvadorans and expected to sign up many more , including veterans of the 380 - man contingent that the Salvadoran government had contributed to the Coalition of the Willing .
As soldiers in Iraq , they had earned a monthly salary of $ 280 ; as hired guns , they expected to make as much as $ 2,400 .
Nayor disappeared as quickly as he had emerged , but nine months later many of the men who had interviewed with him were contacted by capros , a new company headed by two high - ranking Salvadoran military officers that , according to a Salvadoran newspaper , was recruiting for Greystone .
In December 2005 , Greystone representatives visited El Salvador to review the recruits , although it ’s unclear whether they were ever sent to Iraq .
Some of the men later told the Salvadoran press that the company had encouraged them to rack up credit - card purchases in preparation for their deployment , then failed to reimburse them .
Nayor ’s own career as a briefcase recruiter was cut short in September 2006 by his arrest for allegedly plotting to assassinate El Salvador ’s president by shooting down his helicopter with a shoulder - fired missile .
He was subsequently extradited to the United States to face some of his old drug charges .
By then , Greystone ’s search for contractors had expanded far beyond Latin America .
In 2005 , a Croatian newspaper reported that Greystone had dispatched a man named Marko Radielovic , who once worked for the aid group Mercy Corps , to perform a “ feasibility study ” on hiring former Croatian soldiers and police .
The following year , the Filipino press reported that a company called Satelles Solutions had applied to lease land ( about 25 acres ) within the former U.S. Navy base at Subic Bay .
Satelles was a Greystone front ; its Filipino “ owners ” included a former high - ranking general and an attorney at a major law firm that specialized in advising foreign investors .
Each held a few pennies ’ worth of Satelles stock , while Greystone controlled the rest .
The firm had been courting the Filipino government for some time ; seven of its embassy employees were invited to Greystone ’s unveiling ceremony in Washington , the largest contingent by far of any foreign embassy .
Greystone , according to Filipino news reports , hoped to build a jungle - survival training facility capable of processing up to 1,000 trainees a week .
“ It was merely a place to be able to provide training to customers in that part of the world , ” says Chris Taylor ; it was n’t about creating a “ third - country - national offensive force . ”
Nevertheless , after Filipino legislators called for an investigation , the company withdrew its application .
FOR A WHILE , it seemed to José Miguel Pizarro as if the private security boom might never end .
Following Erik Prince ’s example , he began to diversify — launching a Chilean business intelligence firm catering to the defense industry , and a security company that , like Blackwater , could provide guards , police and military trainers , and even bomb - sniffing dogs .
He also took on a new client , Virginia - based Triple Canopy .
But then , as quickly as his star had risen , it fell as both Greystone and Triple Canopy canceled his contracts .
Pizarro blames corporate intrigue — Blackwater did n’t like his doing business with the competition , he claims — but the true reason may be far simpler .
At the height of his operation , Pizarro charged a monthly fee of $ 4,500 per recruit , of which his men received $ 3,200 .
Recruits from other Latin American countries , meanwhile , were willing to deploy to Iraq for as little as $ 700 per month .
“ You can get five Colombian rifles for one Chilean , ” Pizarro says .
“ Do the math . ”
In January 2006 , the last of his 1,157 Chilean commandos left Iraq .
By the time Erik Prince testified before the House oversight committee last October , he acted as though he did n’t remember Pizarro : “ He might have been a vendor to us , ” he ventured when Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D - Ill . ) asked him point - blank .
But if Prince has lost all memory of the Chilean recruiter , Pizarro has n’t forgotten his role model .
Having focused of late on the strategic - consulting side of his business , he says he remains prepared to muster more than 1,200 Chilean commandos for deployment anywhere in the world .
“ Privatization of certain security services is a long - term trend with historical consequences , ” he says .
“ The entire future of private military companies is being redesigned as we speak . ”
Indeed , the private security industry could be heading toward a shake - up — though not necessarily in the way Pizarro would like .
Many of the new players could suffer the fate of any startup , disappearing or being swallowed by larger firms .
“ The problem these guys have is that they ’re not very profitable , ” says Larry Johnson , a former cia officer who works as a consultant for Special Forces .
Johnson , who ’s part of an investment group that was offered a crack at purchasing Triple Canopy when it went up for sale last year , says the firm clears , at most , 5 percent on about $ 170 million in annual revenue .
“ They ’re like a dollar wind machine , ” he says .
“ Dollars come in and dollars go out , but I do n’t see how they stay in business doing that . ”
Prince and his diversified group of companies , though , are positioned to endure .
The Greystone model does n’t depend on America ’s wars :
Whether the future of the business lies in what the industry calls “ peace and stability ” work or in providing “ proactive ” strike forces to private clients , some element of the Prince network is in a position to deliver .
“ They ’re soldiers of fortune , ” says the security director of a well - known humanitarian NGO .
“ Today they are willing to do the bidding of the United States , because the United States is willing to pay them .
Who are they willing to work for tomorrow ? ”
The two aspects of 9/11 I now think are most worth looking into further are :
Statements by whistleblowers such as Sibel Edmonds .
( See various links in my April 21 post U.S. government foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks . )
The relationship between the U.S. government and Saudi Arabia .
In my April 13 post My current views on 9/11 – brief summary , I wrote :
My current top reason to suspect at least criminal negligence , by high officials in the U.S. government , is the following combination of facts : Saudi Arabia ’s less than wholehearted cooperation with the U.S. government ’s attempts to investigate the hijackers .
The Bush family ’s continued friendship with the Saudi royal family , despite # 1 .
The continuing close alliance between the U.S. government and Saudi Arabia , despite # 1 .
The evidence that Osama bin Laden still maintained ties with both his own family and the Saudi royal family , contrary to officially - stated policy .
The FBI ’s and CIA ’s informal policies of avoiding investigations that might embarrass the Saudis ( and other U.S. allies such as Pakistan and Israel ) , both before and after 9/11/2001 .
Recently , I ’ve run into a very interesting opinion piece which might shed some light on the above .
According to Daniel Pipes in Government for Sale [ to the Saudis ] , New York Post , December 3 , 2002 :
Bush administration officials and leading U.S. senators responded very differently to the news that Princess Haifa al - Faisal , wife of the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States , had given many thousands of dollars to a person connected to two of the 9/11 suicide hijackers .
…
Senators spoke out forthrightly and honestly on the issue raised by the princesss donations .
After several quotes from senators , Daniel Pipes continues :
The senators also criticized U.S. law enforcement ’s reluctance to deal with the problem of Saudi financing of terrorism .
Lieberman noted , “ The FBI and maybe other parts of our government have seemed to want to almost defend the Saudis , or not be as aggressive as they should be about the Saudis . ”
Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) concurred : “ It seems every time the Saudis are involved , we stop [ doing a proper investigation ] . ”
In contrast , the Bush administration offered excuses for the couple and glossed over the problems of law enforcement .
Secretary of State Colin Powell poured cold water on the revelations : “ I think it ’s unlikely that Prince Bandar or Her Royal Highness would do anything that would support terrorist activity ” – a most unusual endorsement , given that the FBI is actively investigating this matter .
…
Why this undue solicitude for Saudi feelings ?
This hedging by the executive branch fits a pattern going back almost 60 years , to when President Franklin D. Roosevelt met the Saudi king in 1945 .
Since then , U.S. politicians , diplomats , flag officers and lobbyists have enjoyed a cozy relationship with their counterparts on the Saudi side .
The tie is premised on Americans – Democrats and Republicans alike - accommodating the kingdom ’s wishes and in return , being plied with substantial sums of money , either at the time or after they leave government service .
A culture of corruption , in other words , pervades the upper reaches of the White House and several departments ; it does not , however , extend to Congress , perhaps because the Saudis do not understand the workings or importance of an elected body and so have not tried to buy it .
At some point I should double - check all of the above claims , for which Pipes does not give sources .
The above - mentioned corruption is discussed further on the following pages , also by Daniel Pipes :
Of course , I ’m sure Saudi Arabia is n’t the only foreign government that buys influence in Washington .
Daniel Pipes seems to be fixated on Saudi Arabia ’s wrongdoings and baleful influence , in much the same way that some other folks fixate on Israel ’s wrongdoings and influence .
I do n’t fully trust Daniel Pipes .
He specializes in opposing Islamism , on which I basically agree with him , but he sometimes seems not to know where to draw the line between opposing Islamism and promoting bigotry against Muslims .
Also he ’s very pro-Israel .
I do n’t yet have a definite stand on the Israel / Palestine conflict myself , but I ’m not inclined to trust the propaganda of either side .
Anyhow , because of Pipes ’s pro-Israel bias , I see him as having a strong bias against any or all Arab governments , which is one reason why I do n’t fully trust his statements about Saudi Arabia .
So , I ’ll need to investigate his claims further at some point , when I have time .
But I suspect he ’s onto something here .
For a long time I ’ve wondered what the real relationship might be between Al - Qaeda and the Saudi royal family .
Supposedly they ’re enemies .
But are they really ?
Or is / was Osama bin Laden really the leader of a controlled opposition movement ?
I do n’t know , but I think this question is worth looking into .
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - International activist groups accused the United Nations Human Rights Council on Monday of acting as a cover for Islamic and other countries aiming to restrict free speech .
The 47 - nation Council passed resolutions on Friday imposing new instructions for its investigator on freedom of expression which non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) said bowed too far to concerns about defamation of Islam , which have flared again with a Dutch lawmaker ’s film on the Islamic holy book the Koran .
Instead of defending human rights around the world , the Paris - based Reporters Without Borders said , the U.N. body was focusing on limiting criticism of state and religious interests .
“ All of the Council ’s decisions are nowadays determined by the interests of Muslim countries or powerful states such as China or Russia that know how to surround themselves with allies , ” the group said .
And the India and Britain - based International Humanist and Ethical Union ( IHEU ) said the Council “ stands exposed as no longer capable of fulfilling its central role : the promotion and protection of human rights . ”
The Council kept firmly away from taking any action over China ’s handling of recent protests in Tibet , although there was some muted criticism from Western countries .
It had earlier dropped special investigations into Cuba ’s rights record .
Some Western and Latin American Council members who first helped draft the freedom of expression resolution , including main sponsor Canada , withdrew support when it came to a vote , saying it had been radically changed by amendments .
One of these , from Pakistan for the 57 - nation Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) , decreed the investigator must “ report on instances in which the abuse of the right of freedom of expression constitutes an act of racial or religious discrimination . ”
CARTOONS TARGETTED
The amendment -- backed by Russia , Cuba , China and a range of African states on the Council -- clearly targetted media cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad and the Dutch film , released on the Internet at the weekend , that linked Islam with terrorism .
A broad coalition of NGOs -- including more than 20 from Muslim countries such as Egypt , Bahrain , Sudan and Syria -- said on Friday the amendment would undermine free expression “ when it most needs protection and strengthening . ”
The U.N. investigator ’s role was not to look at the abuse of free expression but to monitor abuses of human rights which were used to limit freedom of expression , those NGOs declared .
Amnesty International said the resolution , which passed by a majority vote , showed “ troubling signs that the Council is moving away from its mandate to promote human rights in the direction of policing the exercise of human rights . ”
Canada voiced a similar view in the Council on Friday , and Slovenia , speaking for the 27 - nation European Union , said the amendment shifted the investigator ’s mandate “ from promoting freedom of expression towards restricting it . ”
Critics of the nearly two - year - old Council say it has failed to overcome Cold War alliances that plagued its discredited predecessor , the Human Rights Commission .
Before 1991 , the Soviet bloc could count on near - automatic support of developing nations on the Commission .
The current chairman of the Council , Doru Costea of Romania , hinted at a similar view on Friday , telling a news conference that there appeared to be “ a slipback to a language and attitudes which we were used to some 20 years ago . ”
Located in Midtown , a neighborhood nestled between Detroit ’s downtown high rises and New Center , Wayne State University ’s location provides a prime vantage point to take in the city .
However , the spectacular views are n’t the only Instagrammable sights on campus .
With newly renovated laboratories , century - old buildings and the designs of world famous architects , there are plenty of ’ gram - worthy spots to check out .
Here are 10 of our favorites .
10 . Gullen Mall
What used to be part of Second Avenue was closed off in 1964 to create a more walkable campus , and in 1979 it was renamed Gullen Mall in honor of George E. Gullen , who served as president of Wayne State from 1972 - 1978 .
Now this mall is not only the busiest walkway , but is the perfect place to stop and snap a clear picture of what ’s happening on campus .
Whether you focus on the landmark Fisher Building to the north or bustling Second Avenue to the south , Gullen Mall has a perfect view to capture all the action on campus .
9. Linsell House
Built in 1904 , the Frederick Linsell House was designed by John C. Stahl , who graduated from Central High School ( aka Old Main ) and later studied building and design at night school .
Stahl was only 28 when he designed the house for Frederick and Rosa Linsell , and he customized it to incorporate the fine woods and Georgian style requested by residents .
The house now serves as the Office of the Dean for the College of Fine , Performing and Communication Arts .
Beautiful inside and out , this historic home is an architectural gem on campus .
8. IBio
The Integrative Biosciences Center , a $ 90 million facility located near TechTown , is dedicated to eliminating the many health disparities that plague the city ’s residents .
With 200,000 square feet of lab and clinical space , IBio fosters a collaborative approach to research .
The facility , which has breathed new life to a 1927 Dalgleish Cadillac dealership designed by legendary architect Albert Kahn , features a decidedly modern aesthetic while still showcasing elements of the architect ’s original design .
An Insta post of this building encapsulates both the past , and the future .
Constructed in 1960 , the College of Education Building is the second of four buildings on Wayne State ’s campus designed by the famous architect Minoru Yamasaki .
The four - story building is known for its striking pointed windows , which make for an aesthetically pleasing addition to your Instagram feed .
6. Tierney Alumni House
The Tierney Alumni House was designed by architect Louis Kemper for Col. Frank J. Hecker , a man who made his fortune in the railroad business .
Over the years , the structure has been home to Smiley Brothers Music Company and a law firm , and today — thanks to the donation from WSU alumnus Thomas Tierney and wife Elizabeth Carr Tierney — it serves as Wayne State ’s alumni house .
From the intricate woodwork inside to the large turrets outside , this urban mansion is not to be missed .
5. Top of Parking Structure 6 .
Structure 6 , which is located on the corner of Putnam and Cass , might not be what first comes to mind when you think about Instagrammable spots on campus .
However , insiders will tell you that if you go all the way to the top , you ’ll be met with an amazing view of campus below you .
This unique location provides a different angle to capture campus beauties like the Maccabees Building and Old Main .
4. 5057 Woodward ( Maccabees Building )
Another Albert Kahn design , 5057 Woodward — aka the Maccabees Building — was built in 1927 .
One notable early tenant of the building was the radio and TV station WXYZ , which broadcast popular radio programs such as The Lone Ranger , Challenge of the Yukon and The Green Hornet to listeners throughout North America .
After WXYZ left in the late 1950s , the Maccabees Building became the headquarters for the Detroit Public Schools until Wayne State purchased the building in 2002 .
This historic building is certainly Instagram worthy all by itself , but the stunning views it provides of the Detroit Public Library and the Detroit Institute of Art put this location toward the top of our list .
3. Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences
The College of Pharmacy was founded in 1924 , and it later evolved into the College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Professions .
In 2001 , it officially became the Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences that we know today , and in 2002 the college moved into its new facility on Mack Avenue .
Lucky for us , this five - story learning and research space stretches high enough to provide a view of the downtown skyline that ’s worth sharing .
2. Old Main
Old Main , the “ Hogwarts ” of Wayne State , was originally built in 1895 as Detroit Central High School .
Warriors are likely familiar with David Mackenzie , who was the high school ’s principal .
During his time there , Mackenzie began to introduce post - secondary classes that started the beginning of what would become Wayne State University .
Whether you post a frantic selfie of your first time getting lost in the many hallways and “ changing staircases , ” or if you share a magnificent shot of the Romanesque Revival architecture , Old Main is a crown jewel that will get you instant likes .
1. McGregor Memorial Conference Center
Completed in 1958 , McGregor Memorial Conference Center is the first Yamasaki–designed building at Wayne State .
Intended as “ a structure that is in harmony with both man and its environment , ” the center continues to be a place where students can relax or study on beautiful days .
This incredible space is too good not to share on Instagram , making this spot No. 1 on our list !

It is no news that politics act centralizing .
In Europe , the free regions subjected to a distant , and therefore practically powerless , monarch are forever gone , and have step by step been forced to give up whatever powers they had .
The nation states took over , but are now giving way to the super - national entity called the European Union .
The same development has been going on in the United States , where the power structures were even more clearly defined legally .
The states ' right to secede was brutally canceled by the federal government , and their rights to govern themselves have since long been undermined -- and have evaporated .
The conclusion we must draw is that even a very strict legal framework based on state rule will give up to a federal power even if that federal power is legally crippled through power - sharing .
This is the historical rule of politics : political powers at a higher level will always find a way to cooperate in order to extract more powers from lower levels , just like new and even higher levels will form and eventually undermine the ones currently thought of as absolute powers .
This political logic tells us what to expect : a world government , starting as an inter -state body for organization and coordination between super- national states , will form and eventually take over .
Even though the logic of politics -- indeed , the rule of politics -- is all too clear , it does not mean undermined levels of government and rule easily let go of power .
In a legal framework such as that under which the United States rule claims its powers , lower levels of political power can hold on to their powers to a degree that nation - states in the European Union cannot .
They can challenge the centralization of power by the federal government , and will of course -- in their own self interest -- do so .
As we will see shortly in the future , European nation - states will not have that opportunity to keep their " prince 's right " ( even though they will , undoubtedly , try ) .
This makes the situation in the United States much more interesting than in the European Union .
Unless a popular revolution takes place -- and this is hardly likely , since Europeans tend to love government -- Europe is already lost .
This might not necessarily be the case in the United States , even though it does not look good ( at all ) .
Take the issue of medical marijuana as an example of the struggle between state and federal levels of power .
While the state of California has legally approved of medical marijuana , the federal government through one of its militant agencies -- the Drug Enforcement Agency , DEA -- is still persecuting legal users .
We therefore have the strange situation where state licensed physicians hand their patients receipts for medical marijuana as treatment for painful , deadly diseases ; where the patients can use their receipts in legal stores to purchase marijuana to ease their pain ; but where both physicians , their patients , and stores face the threat of being federal - legally assaulted and imprisoned for state - legal and state - approved actions .
It is also the case that stores selling legal herbs , including marijuana , are repeatedly attacked by the DEA , have their merchandise and equipment stolen , and have their stores literally butchered by the so - called law - enforcing agency .
At the same time , their business is perfectly legal in the state !
What we are seeing is a small - scale civil war , where the state 's legislature is using its legal right to legislate for the state while the federal agency is enforcing conflicting federal policies .
Of course , when politicians struggle and fight , there is only one category of losers : people like you and me .
On the other hand , the same is true when levels of government do not fight each other , meaning the higher level is still in its infancy or has already won the struggle for power .
As we know all too well , politics in its very essence means the rest of us lose , and we lose big time .
In the case of California versus the federal government , it is obvious that the state legislature is indirectly opposing the federal government taking over the former state 's rights .
But the state of California does not dare to explicitly and publicly oppose the federal government , which means it will eventually lose .
According to the logic of politics , state powers will be collectively centralized under the rule of the federal government and we will eventually see an American Union take the place of the United States .
The alternative would be for the state of California to condemn the DEA raids in state territory , and use its police force to protect legal businesses from attacks and at the same time protect users of the substances that are legal .
This would , in minarchist terminology , be to exercise the legitimate powers of government : to protect rights and bring rights violators ( DEA agents ) to justice .
Standing up for the legal code in the state would mean outright civil war , with the state of California taking on the federal attacker .
In such a war , military or not , there would undoubtedly be a large number of victims -- and the victims would to a large part not be state or federal thugs , the true victims would be the people subjected to the unleashed forces of government .
As a libertarian , understanding the logic of politics and expecting politicians to act in their ( not our ) self - interest , it is not clear what to wish for .
Should we hope for civil war ?

A judge on Thursday gave the Justice Department three weeks to report in writing whether the destruction of C.I.A. videotapes in November 2005 violated an order he issued four months earlier to preserve evidence .
The new order , issued by Judge Richard W. Roberts of the Federal District Court in Washington , is the first to require the Bush administration to provide information related to the videotapes ’ destruction , which is under criminal investigation .
The tapes showed harsh interrogation of two high - level Qaeda suspects , Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri .
Judge Roberts ’s order came in the case of Hani Saleh Rashid Abdullah , a Yemeni electrician who is challenging his imprisonment at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Mr. Abdullah ’s lawyers say that because he is accused of having ties to Al Qaeda , it is likely that Mr. Zubaydah was asked about him during his interrogation .
If so , they argue , the videotapes should have been preserved under Judge Roberts ’s July 2005 order to “ preserve and maintain all evidence ” regarding Mr. Abdullah and several other Guantanamo prisoners .

Well looky looky what we have here .
Some say storage = snore - age .
Know what ?
Those people are mostly right .
Except when you get in the world 's first notebook that contains a grand freaking total of one terabyte (! ) of hard disk space .
First impressions ?
The m70 comes with Vista Home Premium ( Meh. ) and weighs a bone crushing 9 - pounds .
Seriously , it 's pushing the limits of portability .
Asus still has n't gotten back to us yet about how much the unit 's price .
Our IT guru said it 'll probably cost about $ 2500 - $ 3000 considering the specs .
To give you an idea of what it would take to fill up the hard drive , hit the jump to see the breakdown on how much porn , MP3s , DVDs , games , and pictures would be needed to fill the roomy storage .
1 terabyte of storage by the numbers :
1TB = 1,024 GB = 1,048,576 MB = 1,073,741,824 KB
Porn : Debbie Does Dallas ( 838 MB in AVI format ) =
1,251 porn flicks
DVD Rips : Star Wars : Empire Strikes Back ( 4.36 GB ) =
235 copies .
Pics : 1.3 megapixel stills from the integrated webcam ( recorded as 516 KB jpgs ) =
2,080,895 images .
Games : Crysis ( 6.03 GB ) = 169 copies of Crytek - crippling craziness .
MP3s : Stars are Blind , by Paris Hilton ( 7.3MB ) =

Fast silicon is hitting a wall in game PCs , according to Alienware , which is looking for ways to boost game PC performance .
Parent company
Dell vowed on Tuesday to pour more resources into the game PC unit and invest in " product development , design , and engineering . "
Alienware
Alienware 's Marc Diana believes optimizing systems for the 64 - bit world would allow game PCs to make big strides in performance .
In effect , today 's 32 - bit environments are putting a crimp on PC - based gaming .
" So many people are caught up in this hardware race .
Dual - core , quad - core this and that , " said Diana , who is Alienware 's product marketing manager for desktops .
" If these companies -- Intel , Microsoft , Nvidia , ATI , and AMD -- if they 'd just sit down and realize the performance benefit of optimizing their drivers and software for 64 - bit . "
" I think that would make sense now , " Diana said emphatically .
Much of the software in the PC world is still 32 - bit , including most copies of Windows XP and Vista .
In fact , Diana said Alienware does n't offer 64 - bit operating systems because " we do n't feel comfortable shipping a system to a customer with the 64 - bit driver support that 's out there in the industry . "
The most obvious limitation of 32 - bit operating systems and applications is a cap - - 4GB - - on how much memory an operating system can use .
And some applications can't even use the entire 4GB .
" Who cares about DDR3 memory ?
What about giving me 4GB ? " Diana asked .
" They 're building ( software ) for something that is inherently very old technology , " he said .
" We ( need ) drivers that are very healthy in the 64 - bit space .
I 'm not saying that 64 - bit drivers do n't exist .
I 'm just saying there 's not enough software development and support on that end to warrant companies like us to move to 64 - bit operating systems . "
He also talked about other factors -- beyond faster processors and graphics chips -- that affect system performance , particularly for consumers who have limited budgets .
" If I was looking to invest in one component over another , " Diana said , " I would probably invest in a really good motherboard , " and after that , a dual - core processor and a midrange graphics card such as Nvidia 's 8800 GT or ATI 's X2 card .
New DDR3 memory is also becoming more of a factor .
DDR3 memory is offered in two Alienware platforms .
" It is the highest - performing memory now on the market .
But I 'm not so sure it 's quite there yet .
The cost is very high , " he said .
" Six months from now it will start making a lot more sense ( economically ) than it does right now . "
Because of this , DDR2 memory is still widely used .
DDR3 memory modules use less power and double the data prefetch buffer to 8 bits from 4 bits per cycle .
DDR3 also operates at higher clock rates ( 1600 MHz ) , among other improvements .
Vietnam vet faces jail over T - shirt , gesture
Vietnam vet Greg Kachka , center , appeared in court for two disorderly conduct charges stemming from a March 13 village meeting where he wore an offensive T - shirt and made a gun gesture with his fingers .
Island Lake residents protested outside of the courthouse .
Island Lake resident Greg Kachka was arrested for disorderly conduct after wearing a T - shirt to a village board meeting where some board members called the shirt threatening .
Embattled Vietnam veteran Greg Kachka had his first appearance in court Monday on a pair of disorderly conduct charges over his choice of clothing and hand gestures during an Island Lake village board meeting .
The case was continued to a pretrial hearing set for July 21 .
" This is nothing but small - town politics and personal vendettas against my client , " said Alfred Stavros , Kachka 's Wheeling - based attorney .

If convicted , Kachka , 60 , of 3221 Hyacinth Terrace , faces up to 30 days in jail , two years ' probation and a $ 1,500 fine .
The case gained international attention after a March 13 meeting where Kachka questioned the board 's expenditures and legal fees while wearing a T - shirt with a picture of a Marine Corps sniper and the words , " Do n't Move .
If you Run , You 'll Only Die Tired . "
Kachka allegedly had his right index finger and thumb portraying a handgun pointed at the village board , prompting Trustee Debbie Herrmann and Village Clerk Christy Kaczmarek to file a complaint with police .
Kachka , who served in the Marines from 1966 to 1970 , contends he was just pointing at the board .
No one representing the village was in court .
Officials could not be reached for comment Monday .
Before Kachka 's hearing , about 15 people , both village residents and members of the Citizen Advocacy Center , protested the charges .
" I 'm stunned that a former Marine 's free speech rights have been completely violated , " said Natalie Brouwer , with the Citizen Advocacy Center .
" He was acting as a good citizen and questioning his government .
This is a classic example of chilling free speech . "
Monday 's protest was n't the first sign of public support .
An eBay auction was set up in April selling a replica of Kachka 's shirt by a group of residents calling themselves Citizens for Better Government in Island Lake .
So far , about $ 700 has been raised , which will be used for Kachka 's legal costs .
Kachka also has received letters of support from people across the country and internationally .
Kachka said the support is touching , but all of the attention has been overwhelming .
" I 've been trying to stay calm , but anything can happen once we go to court , " Kachka said .

U.S. energy consumption at the end of 2008 is expected to total half of the energy consumed in 1970 , according to a new report .
Yet the success in energy efficiency during the last 30 - plus years has been paid little homage , and future gains are threatened by inaction , says â€ œThe SIze of the U.S. Energy Efficiency Market : Generating a More Complete Pictureâ€ from the American Council for an Energy - Efficient Economy .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
The U.S. stands to gain enormously from investments in energy efficiency , the report found , and could reasonably reduce consumption by as much as 30 percent during the next two decades .
" The greatest American success story in dealing with energy in recent decades is also the least understood and the most invisible , â€ said ACEEE Director of Economic Analysis John Laitner , who also co-authored the report .
â€
œThis report shows that energy efficiency is among the most cost - effective solutions available to consumers , businesses , policymakers , and investors .
Energy efficiency has made great strides , but we need to look at picking up the pace .
The efforts would bear additional fruit through the creation of green collar jobs .
In addition to energy savings , current annual investment in the sector now support 1.6 million jobs , the majority of which are found in the buildings sector , the report found .
Additional investment may push the energy efficiency market to almost $ 400 billion by 2030 , which has the potential to yield an annual efficiency market that tops $ 700 billion .
Nearly 60 percent of energy efficiency investments made in 2004 were from the buildings sector , with nearly half coming from appliances and electronics .
Twenty - nine percent were from commercial building structures .
Overall , the building sector was responsible for 39 percent of total energy consumption .
The industrial sector was responsible for about a quarter of investments , followed by the transportation sector , which accounted for 28 percent of overall energy use .
" While these figures indicate that , as a nation , we are clearly making positive strides toward increasing our energy productivity and reducing our carbon footprint , we have only begun to scratch the surface of the potential savings that additional investments in energy efficiency technologies could provide , â€ said Karen Ehrhardt - Martinez , the report 's lead author .
At a benefit the other night , I saw Andrea Dworkin , the anti-porn activist most famous in the eighties for her conviction that opening the floodgates of pornography would lead men to see real women in sexually debased ways .
If we did not limit pornography , she argued — before Internet technology made that prospect a technical impossibility — most men would come to objectify women as they objectified porn stars , and treat them accordingly .
In a kind of domino theory , she predicted , rape and other kinds of sexual mayhem would surely follow .
The feminist warrior looked gentle and almost frail .
The world she had , Cassandra - like , warned us about so passionately was truly here : Porn is , as David Amsden says , the “ wallpaper ” of our lives now .
So was she right or wrong ?
She was right about the warning , wrong about the outcome .
As she foretold , pornography did breach the dike that separated a marginal , adult , private pursuit from the mainstream public arena .
The whole world , post - Internet , did become pornographized .
Young men and women are indeed being taught what sex is , how it looks , what its etiquette and expectations are , by pornographic training — and this is having a huge effect on how they interact .
But the effect is not making men into raving beasts .
On the contrary :
The onslaught of porn is responsible for deadening male libido in relation to real women , and leading men to see fewer and fewer women as “ porn - worthy . ”
Far from having to fend off porn - crazed young men , young women are worrying that as mere flesh and blood , they can scarcely get , let alone hold , their attention .
Here is what young women tell me on college campuses when the subject comes up :
They ca n’t compete , and they know it .
For how can a real woman — with pores and her own breasts and even sexual needs of her own ( let alone with speech that goes beyond “ More , more , you big stud ! ” ) — possibly compete with a cybervision of perfection , downloadable and extinguishable at will , who comes , so to speak , utterly submissive and tailored to the consumer ’s least specification ?
For most of human history , erotic images have been reflections of , or celebrations of , or substitutes for , real naked women .
For the first time in human history , the images ’ power and allure have supplanted that of real naked women .
Today , real naked women are just bad porn .
For two decades , I have watched young women experience the continual “ mission creep ” of how pornography — and now Internet pornography — has lowered their sense of their own sexual value and their actual sexual value .
When I came of age in the seventies , it was still pretty cool to be able to offer a young man the actual presence of a naked , willing young woman .
There were more young men who wanted to be with naked women than there were naked women on the market .
If there was nothing actively alarming about you , you could get a pretty enthusiastic response by just showing up .
Your boyfriend may have seen Playboy , but hey , you could move , you were warm , you were real .
Thirty years ago , simple lovemaking was considered erotic in the pornography that entered mainstream consciousness :
When Behind the Green Door first opened , clumsy , earnest , missionary - position intercourse was still considered to be a huge turn -on .
Well , I am 40 , and mine is the last female generation to experience that sense of sexual confidence and security in what we had to offer .
Our younger sisters had to compete with video porn in the eighties and nineties , when intercourse was not hot enough .
Now you have to offer — or flirtatiously suggest — the lesbian scene , the ejaculate - in - the - face scene .
Being naked is not enough ; you have to be buff , be tan with no tan lines , have the surgically hoisted breasts and the Brazilian bikini wax — just like porn stars .
( In my gym , the 40 - year - old women have adult pubic hair ; the twentysomethings have all been trimmed and styled . )
Pornography is addictive ; the baseline gets ratcheted up .
By the new millennium , a vagina — which , by the way , used to have a pretty high “ exchange value , ” as Marxist economists would say — was n’t enough ; it barely registered on the thrill scale .
All mainstream porn — and certainly the Internet — made routine use of all available female orifices .
Not Tonight , Honey .
I ’m Logging On. : Internet porn is everywhere ; even “ nice ” guys are hooked .
So where does that leave their girlfriends ?
By David Amsden ( October 20 , 2003 ) The New Position on Casual Sex :
The rise of Internet dating has brought a sexual openness ( not to mention one - night stands ) to the younger generation not seen since the seventies heyday of Maxwell ’s Plum .
But can there be too much of a good thing ?
By Vanessa Grigoriadis ( January 13 , 2003 )
The porn loop is de rigueur , no longer outside the pale ; starlets in tabloids boast of learning to strip from professionals ; the “ cool girls ” go with guys to the strip clubs , and even ask for lap dances ; college girls are expected to tease guys at keg parties with lesbian kisses à la Britney and Madonna .
But does all this sexual imagery in the air mean that sex has been liberated — or is it the case that the relationship between the multi-billion - dollar porn industry , compulsiveness , and sexual appetite has become like the relationship between agribusiness , processed foods , supersize portions , and obesity ?
If your appetite is stimulated and fed by poor - quality material , it takes more junk to fill you up .
People are not closer because of porn but further apart ; people are not more turned on in their daily lives but less so .
The young women who talk to me on campuses about the effect of pornography on their intimate lives speak of feeling that they can never measure up , that they can never ask for what they want ; and that if they do not offer what porn offers , they can not expect to hold a guy .
The young men talk about what it is like to grow up learning about sex from porn , and how it is not helpful to them in trying to figure out how to be with a real woman .
Mostly , when I ask about loneliness , a deep , sad silence descends on audiences of young men and young women alike .
They know they are lonely together , even when conjoined , and that this imagery is a big part of that loneliness .
What they do n’t know is how to get out , how to find each other again erotically , face - to - face .
So Dworkin was right that pornography is compulsive , but she was wrong in thinking it would make men more rapacious .
A whole generation of men are less able to connect erotically to women — and ultimately less libidinous .
The reason to turn off the porn might become , to thoughtful people , not a moral one but , in a way , a physical - and emotional - health one ; you might want to rethink your constant access to porn in the same way that , if you want to be an athlete , you rethink your smoking .
The evidence is in : Greater supply of the stimulant equals diminished capacity .
“ For the first time in human history , the images ’ power and allure have supplanted that of real naked women .
Today , real naked women are just bad porn . ”
After all , pornography works in the most basic of ways on the brain :
It is Pavlovian .
An orgasm is one of the biggest reinforcers imaginable .
If you associate orgasm with your wife , a kiss , a scent , a body , that is what , over time , will turn you on ; if you open your focus to an endless stream of ever - more - transgressive images of cybersex slaves , that is what it will take to turn you on .
The ubiquity of sexual images does not free eros but dilutes it .
Other cultures know this .
I am not advocating a return to the days of hiding female sexuality , but I am noting that the power and charge of sex are maintained when there is some sacredness to it , when it is not on tap all the time .
In many more traditional cultures , it is not prudery that leads them to discourage men from looking at pornography .
It is , rather , because these cultures understand male sexuality and what it takes to keep men and women turned on to one another over time — to help men , in particular , to , as the Old Testament puts it , “ rejoice with the wife of thy youth ; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times . ”
These cultures urge men not to look at porn because they know that a powerful erotic bond between parents is a key element of a strong family .
And feminists have misunderstood many of these prohibitions .
I will never forget a visit I made to Ilana , an old friend who had become an Orthodox Jew in Jerusalem .
When I saw her again , she had abandoned her jeans and T - shirts for long skirts and a head scarf .
I could not get over it .
Ilana has waist - length , wild and curly golden - blonde hair .
“ Ca n’t I even see your hair ? ” I asked , trying to find my old friend in there .
“ No , ” she demurred quietly .
“ Only my husband , ” she said with a calm sexual confidence , “ ever gets to see my hair . ”
When she showed me her little house in a settlement on a hill , and I saw the bedroom , draped in Middle Eastern embroideries , that she shares only with her husband — the kids are not allowed — the sexual intensity in the air was archaic , overwhelming .
It was private .
It was a feeling of erotic intensity deeper than any I have ever picked up between secular couples in the liberated West .
And I thought :
Our husbands see naked women all day — in Times Square if not on the Net .
Her husband never even sees another woman ’s hair .
She must feel , I thought , so hot .
Compare that steaminess with a conversation I had at Northwestern , after I had talked about the effect of porn on relationships .
“ Why have sex right away ? ” a boy with tousled hair and Bambi eyes was explaining .
“ Things are always a little tense and uncomfortable when you just start seeing someone , ” he said .
“ I prefer to have sex right away just to get it over with .
You know it ’s going to happen anyway , and it gets rid of the tension . ”
“ Is n’t the tension kind of fun ? ” I asked .
“ Does n’t that also get rid of the mystery ? ”
“ Mystery ? ” He looked at me blankly .
And then , without hesitating , he replied : “ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about .
Sex has no mystery . ”
Brazil has been accused of turning its back on its duty to protect the Amazon after the resignation of its award - winning Environment Minister fuelled fresh fears over the fate of the forest .
The departure of Marina Silva , who admitted she was losing the battle to get green voices heard amidst the rush for economic development , has been greeted with dismay by conservationists .
" She was the environment 's guardian angel , " said Frank Guggenheim , executive director for Greenpeace in Brazil .
" Now Brazil 's environment is orphaned . "
In a letter to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , Ms Silva said that her efforts to protect the rainforest acknowledged as the " lungs of the planet " were being thwarted by powerful business lobbies .
" Your Excellency was a witness to the growing resistance found by our team in important sectors of the government and society , " she wrote .

The decision by Ms Silva to walk away five years on from her triumphant unveiling as a minister in President Lula 's first term has underlined just how far the former trade union hero 's administration has drifted from the promises made in its green heyday .
" Her resignation is a disaster for the Lula administration , " said Jose Maria Cardoso da Silva , of Conservation International .
" If the government had any global credibility in environmental issues , it was because of minister Marina . "
The Latin American giant 's supposed progress on environmental protection has unravelled in the past year as revelations of record levels of deforestation , violent land disputes and runaway forest fires have followed in quick succession .
The worldwide boom in agricultural commodities has created an unparalleled thirst for land and energy in Brazil , and the result has been a potentially catastrophic land grab into the world 's largest remaining rainforest .
The Amazon basin is home to one in 10 of the world 's mammals and 15 per cent of its land - based plant species .
It holds more than half of the world 's fresh water and its vast forests act as the largest carbon sink on the planet , providing a vital check on the greenhouse effect .
Since President Lula won a second term Ms Silva found herself a lone voice in a government acutely aware that its own political future depended on the vast agribusiness interests she was trying to rein in .
The final breakdown in her relationship with the President came after he gave the green light to massive road and dam - building projects in the Amazon basin , and a plan she drafted for the sustainable management of the region was taken from her and handed to a business - friendly fellow minister .
Marcelo Furtado , the campaign director for Greenpeace Brazil , said the resignation was " disastrous " and blamed it on the government 's Amazon policy and pressure to ease environmental regulations on factories .
" Although Lula has adopted the environmental talk , the practice is development at whatever cost , " he said .
Next week , the Amazonian city of Alta Mira will host the largest ever gathering of indigenous leaders in a bid to stop a massive hydroelectric dam being built on the Xingu river , a tributary of the Amazon .
Although the government claims no decision has been made on the Bel Monte project it 's believed to have already committed itself to the construction despite experts warning of potentially dire environmental consequences .
The resignation brings a sad close to Ms Silva 's relationship with President Lula , whose personal story closely mirrors her own remarkable journey as the daughter of an impoverished rubber tapper who rose to be a government minister and internationally recognised environmental champion .
Ms Silva spent her childhood drawing rubber sap from trees and hunting and fishing to help support her large family in the Amazonian state of Acre .
It was only heavy metal poisoning from polluted water and the contraction of tropical diseases that brought her to the city as an illiterate 16 - year - old .
Working as a maid , she taught herself to read and put herself through university , emerging as a vocal figure in the rubber tappers ' union and a close ally to Chico Mendes , the movement 's inspirational leader whose brutal murder would cause an international outcry .
Together the pair led a campaign to halt the disastrous deforestation and rampant eviction of forest - dwelling communities to make way for the logging and ranching that still threaten the Amazon .
The tappers ' idea of creating sustainable reserves where forest people can make a livelihood from extractive industries has become a global model for managing forests and Acre now has a two - million - hectare reserve .
Health problems
Ms Silva inherited from her youth have led to long periods in hospital but in 1994 she became the first rubber tapper elected to Brazil 's senate .
The winner of inter-national awards , including the Goldman prize , she has also provided credibility on environmental issues for her former boss .
Roberto Smeraldi , head of Friends of the Earth Brazil , said her greatest legacy may be her decision to walk away .
" The emperor is naked now : Lula no longer has a smokescreen to show a policy and implement the opposite of it .
He will have a problem , since Marina was perfect for him : she accepted anything he imposed and at the same time acted as a green seal for the Brazilian government . "
Andrew Mitchell , a leading forests expert and director of the Global Canopy Programme , said : " The Amazon provides the vital rainfall on which Brazil 's crops and hydropower depend , as well as regulating the global climate for the rest of us ; losing all that is too big a price to pay . "
Enemies of the Amazon rainforest
RANCHING
The explosion of cattle ranching exactly mirrors the dramatic increase in deforestation .
The world 's leading beef exporter has ignored the link and pumped more money into slaughter houses with the help of the World Bank .
MINING
The soaring price of gold and minerals has revived old mines and spurred the creation of hundreds of new ones .
Major mining projects not only require large clearings in the forest , they also leave a toxic legacy of pollution .
DAMS AND ROADS
Every study shows that more roads bring more people and destroy more forest .
But the cycle continues .
There is noevidence that massive hydroelectric dams deliver benefits to communities or cheap electricity .
SOYA
The worldwide boom in agricultural commodities has bitten enormous chunks out of the rainforest .
Vast soy plantations supply the demand for livestock feed and bio-fuels , and make a fortune for agribusiness giants .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The White House Wednesday said it was " puzzled " by a former spokesman 's memoir in which he accuses the Bush administration of being mired in propaganda and political spin and at times playing loose with the truth .
Former White House spokesman Scott McClellan blasts President Bush and advisers in a new book .
In excerpts from a 341 - page book to be released Monday , Scott McClellan writes on the war in Iraq that Bush " and his advisers confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candor and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war . "
" [ I ] n this regard , he was terribly ill - served by his top advisers , especially those involved directly in national security , " McClellan wrote .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino called McClellan 's description of his time at the White House " sad . "
Read excerpts from the book »
" Scott , we now know , is disgruntled about his experience at the White House , " Perino said .
" For those of us who fully supported him , before , during and after he was press secretary , we are puzzled .
It is sad .
This is not the Scott we knew . "
McClellan 's former White House colleagues had harsher reactions to McClellan 's book .
Frances Townsend , former Homeland Security adviser to Bush , said advisers to the president should speak up when they have policy concerns .
" Scott never did that on any of these issues as best I can remember or as best as I know from any of my White House colleagues , " said Townsend , now a CNN contributor .
" For him to do this now strikes me as self - serving , disingenuous and unprofessional . "
Fox News contributor and former White House adviser Karl Rove said on that network Tuesday that the excerpts from the book he 's read sound more like they were written by a " left - wing blogger " than his former colleague .
Rove declined to comment to CNN after the Fox News interview .
In a brief phone conversation with CNN Tuesday evening , McClellan made clear that he stands behind the accuracy of his book .
McClellan said he cannot give on - the - record quotes yet because of an agreement with his publisher .
Watch further details emerge from McClellan 's book »
Another former Bush aide - turned - critic says the reaction to McClellan 's book by his former colleagues has a familiar ring to it .
" They 're saying some of the exact same things about McClellan they said about me , " Richard Clarke , the former White House counterterrorism chief , told CNN .
Clarke left government in 2003 .
The following year , he accused President Bush of ignoring warnings about the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington and of using the attacks to push for war with Iraq .
But Clarke gave McClellan little credit for speaking out now .
" I think the difference with McClellan 's book is he's now telling us something we all know -- that the war with Iraq was a disastrous war [ and ] was sold with deception .
It 's a little different when you say something as I did and a few other people did four or five years ago , when the war was popular and when we were unpopular for saying what we said . "
Besides his criticism of how the administration handled the run-up to the Iraq war , McClellan also sharply criticizes the administration on its handling of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath in the book .
" One of the worst disasters in our nation 's history became one of the biggest disasters in Bush 's presidency , " he wrote .
" Katrina and the botched federal response to it would largely come to define Bush 's second term . "
Early in the book , which CNN obtained late Tuesday , McClellan wrote that he believes he told untruths on Bush 's behalf in the case of CIA agent Valerie Plame , whose identity was leaked to the media .
Rove and fellow White House advisers Elliot Abrams and I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby were accused of leaking the name of Plame -- whose husband , former U.S. ambassador Joseph Wilson , had gone public with charges the Bush administration had " twisted " facts to justify the war in Iraq .
Libby was convicted last year of lying to a grand jury and federal agents investigating the leak .
Bush commuted his 30 - month prison term , calling it excessive .
At the time , McClellan called the three " good individuals " and said he spoke to them before telling reporters they were not involved .
" I had allowed myself to be deceived into unknowingly passing along a falsehood , " he wrote .
" It would ultimately prove fatal to my ability to serve the president effectively . "
McClellan wrote he did n't realize what he said was untrue until reporters began digging up details of the case almost two years later .
A former spokesman for Bush when he was governor of Texas , McClellan was named White House press secretary in 2003 , replacing Ari Fleischer .
McClellan had previously been a deputy press secretary and was the traveling spokesman for the Bush campaign during the 2000 election .
He announced he was resigning in April 2006 at a news conference with Bush .
" One of these days , he and I are going to be rocking in chairs in Texas talking about the good old days of his time as the press secretary , " Bush said at that conference .
" And I can assure you , I will feel the same way then that I feel now , that I can say to Scott , job well done . "

" The internet has been a godsend for freedom of expression in the Arab world , " the Egytian - American syndicated columnist Mona Eltahawy told MENASSAT .
" A reader of my blog said it right when he left me a message saying :
' In the USA and most of the western nations , they have so many ways to express their opinions .
They have freedom of press , speech and so on .
So they use the blogs and Facebook to keep in touch with family and friends .
But in Egypt , blogs and Facebook became a great method of expressing your opinion since most of the media are controlled by the government . '

BEIRUT , May 3 , 2008 ( MENASSAT ) – May 3 marks World Press Freedom Day , a concept initiated by the United Nations in an attempt to spur awareness of the importance of press freedom and to " remind governments of their duty to respect and uphold the right to freedom of expression , " as stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
Freedom of expression : a human right .
How beautiful .
If only these words were implemented and practiced as often as they are spoken – especially in the Arab world .
Although much of the focus on World Press Freedom Day 2008 is on China – because of Tibet and the Olympic Games – the Middle East and North Africa remains one of the regions most deprived of press freedom and freedom of expression .
In a newly released report , U.S. - based Freedom House , recognizes only one country in the MENA region as " free " – Israel .
Three other countries – Kuwait , Lebanon and Egypt – are qualified as " partly free , " while all others are considered " not free .
" It is not always governments that prey on press freedom either .
Paris - based Reporters without Borders ( RSF ) , in a report released today , identifies 39 so - called " predators of freedom , " which include individual leaders but also groups such as the FARC guerilla in Colombia , the drug cartels in Mexico and " armed groups " in Nepal .
Among the " predators " in the Arab world , RSF identified Lybia 's Muammar Ghaddafi , Syria 's Bashar Assad , Saudi's Abdallah Ibn al - Saud , Tunisia 'sseveral warlords in Somalia .
Among the newcomers this year are the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) , But RSF also singles out the security forces of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas ' armed wing in the Gaza Strip .
" Despite these worrying trends , there is one other Big Truth in the Arab world : much of the censorship is self - censorship .
Arab journalists know the " red lines " that apply to their trade and most operate within their relative safety .
Some very courageous ones – most notably in Egypt , Syria , Tunisia and Yemen – refuse to do so and they pay the price .
Egypt is celebrating World Press Freedom Day 2008 by putting three newspapers editors on trial In Morocco and Tunisia , two journalists went on a hunger strike today to protest their imprisonment .
Increasingly though , in the Arab world , it is bloggers and other Internet activists who are challenging the status quo – and who are going to jail for it .
With much of the traditional media muzzled by authoritarian regimes , the Internet has become a vital tool in the fight for freedom of expression .
Armed with nothing but a keyboard and dedication to their cause , Arab Internet activists take use of the blogs , online networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter , and video - sharing pages like YouTube as means to further their calls and provide readers with the news that otherwise would receive little or no coverage in mainstream media .
Recently in Tunisia , bloggers and activists turned to the Internet to tell the story about the protests of thousands of workers employed in the rich phosphate mines of Gafsa , Redyef and Oum el Arayess against inflation and the rising cost of living – an event that went unreported in the official Tunisian media .
In Egypt , a leaked video depicting two police officers abusing and sodomizing a micro- bus driver with a stick resulted in the landmark sentencing of the two to prison sentences in November 2007 .
It was the celebrated Egyptian blogger Wael Abbas who got a hold of the clip and subsequently uploaded it on his blog .
The footage sparked outcry from Egyptian society and attracted much unwanted international attention .
Esra ’a Al - Shafei is the Director of the student - run web portal Mideast Youth , a website aiming to provide " constructive dialogue and understanding within the Middle East and North Africa . "
The site often features discussions on taboo - labeled topics , including religious minorities and homosexuality .
For Al - Shafei , the Internet is key in the promotion of free speech in the Arab world today .
" It is offering us a wealth of things and they are actively being used as anti-censorship tools .
There is a major increase in the number of Internet users in the Arab world and [ governments ] are beginning to realize the impact of it , " she told MENASSAT .
But with Internet penetration in the Arab world still very low compared to Europe and the U.S. , and some countries so poor that many people can't even afford to go to an Internet cafe , is Internet activism really reaching the masses ?
Al - Shafei thinks it is .
Even in a country like Mauritania , where the percentage of Internet users is in the single digits , she says , " the word still gets out somehow .
People print posts from the Internet , talk about them with their friends .
Eventually it reaches the countryside as well .
" Walid Al - Saqaf , administrator of the news engine Yemenportal ( which is constantly outrunning Internet censorship in Yemen ) , echoed Al - Shafei 's claim , saying that the Internet now plays an important role in Yemeni society even if less than one percent of Yemenis have access to it .
"
In a country like Yemen , culture plays a crucial role in disseminating information .
If one person reads an article on the Internet , for example , he will spread this message to literally hundreds of people .
Word of mouth is extremely powerful in our society , " Al - Saqaf said in an interview with WAN .
In Egypt , Internet activism will be put to the test on Sunday , May 4 , when President Hosni barak turns eighty .
Egypt ’s activists and cyber - dissidents are planning to mark the President 's birthday by organizing a day of strikes and protests .
Through various Facebook groups and blogs , they are urging their fellow countrymen to wear black and strike on Sunday .
One of the Facebook groups promoting the May 4 strike has almost 74,000 members at this point .
Egypt has recently witnessed a string of workers ' uprisings against rising commodity prices and stifled wages .
In the latest strike on April 6 , it was again the Internet activists that shed light on the event – as well as arrests of their colleagues .
Not surprisingly , oppressive regimes are trying to bring the Internet under their control .
Tunisia reportedly dedciated a special branch of the police tracking cyber - dissdients , whereas the blocking or banning critical websites is the tool of choice for the regimes in Syria , Yemen and Saudi Arabia .
Syria , in an Internet crackdown in November 2007 , blocked access to more than one - hundred web sites , including the video - sharing site YouTube , the blog platform Blogspot and the social networking site Facebook .
Censorship set apart , the cyber activists themselves increasingly claim to be subject to harassment , intimidation , or even arrest .
Syrian blogger Ahed Al Hendi claims he was detained by security in December 2006 for posting a comment on an opposition website from a Damascus Internet cafe .
He remembers the following from the holiday season of 2006 : " I want to tell you about Christmas 2006 which I regret to say was spent groveling in a Syrian prison .
It was no Christmas by any means .
It was more like hell , " Al Hendi wrote in email to MENASSAT .
Esraa Abdel Fattah was held in Egyptian custody for more than three weeks for creating a Facebook group urging Egyptians to take part in an April 6 general strike .
Most recently , Saudi Arabia released reformist blogger Fouad Al - Farhan , the first cyber - dissident to be detained the Kingdom .
No official statement for neither his arrest nor release was ever given , but the reason behind the affair is thought to be Al - Farhan ’s outspoken blog posts .
Despite continuous hardships , it will prove a hard task to stop the determined army of Internet - savvy activists , using the Internet as their weapon .
" When a blogger like Wael Abbas helps to put away police officers for three years , " Eltahaway said , " then dictators around the region know they 're being watched .
Bloggers are the watchdogs that the media have been prevented from being for too long . "

Obama Needs a History Lesson
In his victory speech after the North Carolina primary , Sen. Barack Obama said something that is all the more remarkable for how little it has been remarked upon .
In defending his stated intent to meet with America 's enemies without preconditions , Sen. Obama said : " I trust the American people to understand that it is not weakness , but wisdom to talk not just to our friends , but to our enemies , like Roosevelt did , and Kennedy did , and Truman did . "
That he made this statement , and that it passed without comment by the journalists covering his speech indicates either breathtaking ignorance of history on the part of both , or deceit .
I assume the Roosevelt to whom Sen. Obama referred is Franklin D. Roosevelt .
Our enemies in World War II were Nazi Germany , headed by Adolf Hitler ; fascist Italy , headed by Benito Mussolini , and militarist Japan , headed by Hideki Tojo .
FDR talked directly with none of them before the outbreak of hostilities , and his policy once war began was unconditional surrender .
FDR died before victory was achieved , and was succeeded by Harry Truman .
Truman did not modify the policy of unconditional surrender .
He ended that war not with negotiation , but with the atomic bomb .
Harry Truman also was president when North Korea invaded South Korea in June , 1950 .
President Truman 's response was not to call up North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung for a chat .
It was to send troops .
Perhaps Sen. Obama is thinking of the meeting FDR and Churchill had with Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in Tehran in December , 1943 , and the meetings Truman and Roosevelt had with Stalin at Yalta and Potsdam in February and July , 1945 .
But Stalin was then a U.S. ally , though one of whom we should have been more wary than FDR and Truman were .
Few historians think the agreements reached at Yalta and Potsdam , which in effect consigned Eastern Europe to slavery , are diplomatic models we ought to follow .
Even fewer Eastern Europeans think so .
When Stalin 's designs became unmistakably clear , President Truman 's response was n't to seek a summit meeting .
He sent military aid to Greece , ordered the Berlin airlift and the Marshall Plan , and sent troops to South Korea .
Sen .
Obama is on both sounder and softer ground with regard to John F. Kennedy .
The new president held a summit meeting with Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev in Vienna in June , 1961 .
Elie Abel , who wrote a history of the Cuban missile crisis ( The Missiles of October ) , said the crisis had its genesis in that summit .
" There is reason to believe that Khrushchev took Kennedy 's measure in June 1961 and decided this was a young man who would shrink from hard decisions , " Mr. Abel wrote .
" There is no evidence to support the belief that Khrushchev ever questioned America 's power .
He questioned only the president 's readiness to use it .
As he once told Robert Frost , he came to believe that Americans are ' too liberal to fight . ' "
That view was supported by New York Times columnist James Reston , who traveled to Vienna with President Kennedy : " Khrushchev had studied the events of the Bay of Pigs , " Mr. Reston wrote .
" He would have understood if Kennedy had left Castro alone or destroyed him , but when Kennedy was rash enough to strike at Cuba but not bold enough to finish the job , Khrushchev decided he was dealing with an inexperienced young leader who could be intimidated and blackmailed . "
It 's worth noting that Kennedy then was vastly more experienced than Sen.
Obama is now .
A combat veteran of World War II , Jack Kennedy served 14 years in Congress before becoming president .
Sen .
Obama has no military and little work experience , and has been in Congress for less than four years .
The closest historical analogue to Sen .
Obama 's expressed desire to meet with no preconditions with anti-American dictators such as Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is the trip British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French premier Eduoard Daladier took to Munich in September of 1938 to negotiate " peace in our time " with Adolf Hitler .
That did n't work out so well .
History is an elective few liberals choose to take these days , noted a poster on the Web log " Hot Air . "
The lack of historical knowledge among journalists is merely appalling .
But in a presidential candidate it 's dangerous .
As Sir Winston Churchill said :
" Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it . "
“ I live within my paycheck , ” he said .
“ I want to get up every day and get in the car and go to work and be a respected member of my community .
And I am respected .
I know I am .
I ’m not looking in the rear view mirror to see if anyone is tailing me anymore .
I do n’t turn on the blender when I ’m at home so I can talk .
That is not a part of my life .
Sure , I ’d love to have more money , but I am not willing to do anything but go to my job to get it . ”
Except sell some of the secrets of his old life .
He agreed to be interviewed , but not photographed , by The New York Times , as he was for its earlier magazine cover , somewhere in middle America .
He would not divulge much about his new identity .
His mission , he insisted , was not some late - life effort to stroke his ego , seek vindication or arrange redemption .
He just wants to make a buck off his autobiography .
“ Ego ?
That ’s not what I need , not with gas at $ 3 , ” he said .
“ I need bank , and this is my only way to get it . ”
The millions he made and squandered , he said , are gone .
“ I miss it , ” he said .
“ There was glamour , money , influence , attractive women .
I did n’t have any financial concerns , and I do have them now .
I ’m concerned about being able to retire at some point comfortably .
That ’s my principal concern . ”
He said he received no subsidy from the government for his cooperation .
( His profits from the book might yet be diverted to his victims under the Son of Sam law in New York . )
Mr. Barnes is still on probation , which means he has to submit to a monthly urine test for drugs .
He must regularly show his pay stubs to federal marshals and account for any expense over $ 500 .
Coding Horror is a popular programming blog .
A recent post concerns type inference in C# :
C# ... offers implicitly typed local variables .
...
It 's not dynamic typing , per se ; C# is still very much a statically typed language .
It 's more of a compiler trick , a baby step toward a world of Static Typing Where Possible , and Dynamic Typing When Needed .
... I use implicit variable typing whenever and wherever it makes my code more concise .
Anything that removes redundancy from our code should be aggressively pursued -- up to and including switching languages .
You might even say implicit variable typing is a gateway drug to more dynamically typed languages .
And that 's a good thing .
I think this post is interesting for a number of reasons , and the link to LtU is just the start .
Now it appears the author is confused as to what “ implicitly typed local variables ” are , confusing local type inference ( which they are ) with dynamic typing ( which they are not ) .
Many commenters also suffer from this confusion .
Other commenters rightly note that the inferred type is not always the type the programmers wants ( particularly important in the presence of sub- typing ) .
Furthermore , type inference harms readability .
I 'm reminded of recent discussion on the PLT Scheme mailing list on the merits of local and global type inference .
The consensus there seems to be that while local type inference is useful , global inference is not .
So , wise people , what is the future of type inference ?
How useful is it really , especially when we look at type systems that go beyond what H -M can handle ?
How are we going to get working programmers to use it , and understand it ?
Do we need better tool support ?
Do we have any hope of better education for the average programmer ?
Fewer hotels are offering free breakfasts , more are charging for late cancellations , and more are offering free in - room wireless Internet access .
Ironically , the more you pay for your room , the less likely you are to get free Wi-Fi .
Those are some of the findings from a recent survey of 10,000 hotels conducted by Smith Travel Research for the American Hotel & Lodging Association .
Wireless Internet access is offered by 91 percent of hotels , up 35 percent from four years ago , according to the survey .
Only 15 percent of hotels charge for Internet access , down from 18 percent in 2006 and 22 percent in 2004 .
But charges for Internet access were most common at more expensive properties , with three - fourths of luxury hotels and 91 percent of " upper upscale " hotels charging guests to access the Net from their rooms .
Thirty - five percent of the hotels that responded to the survey also offer iPod docking stations in their rooms .
Nearly three - fourths offer a computer in the lobby for guest use , though economy hotels are least likely to offer this service .
Fifty - nine percent offer a complimentary breakfast , down 9 percentage points from 2006 .
Forty - seven percent have swimming pools , and 58 percent have outdoor swimming pools .
Forty - three percent said they have flat - screen TVs in guest rooms , and 57 percent said they upgraded bedding packages in the past year .
Eighty - two percent offer a refrigerator in rooms , up from 68 percent in 2006 .
The number of hotels offering vegetarian menus rose to 48 percent , up 16 percentage points , while the number offering " healthy menu " options rose to 66 percent , up 15 points .
Nearly 40 percent said all of their rooms are nonsmoking .
In terms of rates , 67 percent of respondents offer weekend special rates , up 8 percentage points from 2006 , while the percentage that charge for late cancellation rose 8 percentage points to 82 percent .
Fifty - six percent said their properties allow pets , but 61 percent charge extra for the service .

DISNEYLAND
New attraction is back to the future
The picture phones are gone , and , upon further reflection , maybe the all - plastic walls were n't such a good idea .
But Disneyland 's latest version of the House of the Future will be crammed full of the coolest gadgets the folks at Microsoft and Hewlett - Packard can dream up .
Now called the Innoventions Dream House , the 5,000 - square - foot exhibit is located next to Space Mountain in Tomorrowland .
If the building looks familiar , it 's because over the years it was home to the G.E. Carousel of Progress , America Sings and Innoventions .
In the $ 15 million collaboration between Disneyland , several high - tech firms and home builder Taylor Morrison , individual family members - and even the family dog - are recognized by sensors as soon as they step through the front door , and the house 's lighting , temperature and even artwork are adjusted accordingly .
The kitchen countertop recognizes items as they are set on it and helps prepare shopping lists .
In the teenage daughter 's room , a " magic mirror " lets her virtually try on any outfit in her closet .
The entertainment room features a 100 - inch flat - panel TV .
" It 's both high - tech and high - touch , " said Greg Atkins , the attraction 's writer and director .
Presumably the Innovations Dream Home will be as prescient as the old Monsanto House of the Future , which featured devices straight out of science fiction : a microwave oven and a flat - panel TV .
The plastic walls never caught on , but they were certainly durable :
When Disneyland tried to knock the house down in 1967 , the wrecking ball just bounced off .
Workers had to cut it apart piece by piece with chain saws .

China reopens
Tibet to foreign tourists
Now that the Olympic torch has passed through Lhasa , Chinese authorities have reopened Tibet to foreign tourists , saying the torch 's successful journey has shown that Tibet is stable enough for foreign visitors .
Officials closed Tibet to all tourists after anti-Chinese riots broke out in Lhasa March 14 , but allowed domestic tourists back in on April 23 and tourists from Hong Kong , Macau and Taiwan on May 1 .
Australia : From snakes to crocodiles to sharks to jellyfish , Australia 's reputation for creatures that can sicken or kill is well known , but the effects of a recent spider bite on an Englishman emphasizes the importance of seeking immediate treatment if you do not know what bit you .
Last month a Londoner on vacation in the Northern Territory was bitten on the knee by a spider near Alice Springs .
Weeks later , he is in danger of losing a kidney because the bite , from either a male brown tree spider or a female redback spider ( similar to a black widow ) , appears to have caused a growth on his kidney and produced symptoms of dizziness and nausea .
Bites from either spider can cause renal problems .
Bermuda :
An American man learned the folly of taking marijuana with him on vacation , especially when traveling abroad , when a sniffer dog alerted police to drugs in his cabin on a cruise ship in Bermuda .
Inside , police found six grams of marijuana that the man admitted was his .
A week later , a judge accepted his guilty plea and fined him $ 2,500 , payable immediately .
In many other countries , the sentence could have been a long prison term .
Peru : The U.S. Embassy in Lima has received reports of numerous petty thefts occurring in five - star hotels and prominent restaurants in the capital city .
Criminals working together dress up and act as guests to infiltrate conferences and special events where they steal purses , laptops , cell phones and other valuables while attendees are distracted .
It is not surprising for guests to let their guard down when they feel they are in a secure environment , and these gangs understand that and make the most of their opportunities .
Scotland : A surge of pickpocketing by a gang of thieves that allegedly was not from Scotland occurred in Edinburgh 's central city in recent days , with some 30 thefts reported in Princes Street , Lawnmarket , Waverley Bridge , High Street and Cockburn Street .
The incidents prompted police to send in special units to curb the crime , and they arrested five suspects .
But the city is especially busy at this time of year with tourists from many countries and pickpocketing cannot be ruled out , despite police success .

Oops : Feds admit mistake in calling Democratic governor ' special offender ' Associated Press
Published : Friday May 2 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Federal court officials acknowledged Friday that they erred this week in classifying former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman as a special offender who required an extra layer of approval before traveling to New Orleans .
Probation officials in Alabama and Louisiana mistakenly applied rules governing offenders who are on probation .
Siegelman is not on probation ; he is free on bond pending appeal , said Karen Redmond , spokeswoman for the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts .
" They made an honest mistake , " Redmond said .
" They were giving him conditions for a special offender under probation .
He 's not .
He 's pretrial . "
Siegelman , a Democrat who was convicted in 2006 on corruption charges , complained this week that he had been placed under new travel restrictions after appearing in several national media outlets and traveling to Washington to criticize his prosecution , which he claims was politically motivated .
He said the new rules were aimed at slowing him down or preventing him altogether from stating his case to the public .
Siegelman had requested to travel to New Orleans to visit friends , including a journalist who makes documentaries .
But probation officials informed him Tuesday that he was being classified as a special offender who would need approval from the district court there to visit  a process that could take as long as a month .
Court officials in Alabama said the change was not a new restriction and that they were simply applying existing rules established by the New Orleans court .
The mistake came as a result of a misunderstanding between officials in Louisiana and Alabama about Siegelman 's status , Redmond said .
The 94 court districts across the country have different rules regarding visiting offenders who are on probation .
As travel requests come in , probation officers routinely call other districts to inquire about those rules and to notify them of a visiting offender , she said .
Although those rules do n't apply to Siegelman , he is required to get approval from the judge handling his case before traveling out of state .
Siegelman expressed relief that they acknowledged the error , but he said court officials in Alabama still seem to be tightening his travel flexibility .
Every time he bought a 6/49 lottery ticket , Jose Lima prayed he'd win the big prize and promised God to share his boa sorte , good fortune .
He 's doing just that .
Canada 's newest millionaire – the 52 - year - old father of two who won $ 14.5 million in the 6/49 draw – is giving each of his 50 employees at O Nosso Talho butcher shop $ 5,000 .
On April 3 , the fifth anniversary of his father Joao 's death , his generosity will spread even further when he gives away 22,680 kilograms of chicken legs to thank his customers and help Toronto 's needy .
Gilberto Andre , a 10 - year veteran behind the meat counter , was with Lima , who manages the busy shop , when he checked his numbers .
" When I told him he'd won , he hugged me , " said Andre who described Lima as a very caring , kind man .
" For me , he 's a great person who never says no .
We 're all very happy for him .
And it 's such a good thing that he 's doing , sharing his good luck with us .
I do n't know if anyone else would do that . "
Lima admitted he 's still in a state of shock and it's too early to decide what to do with the money .
" The first thing I will do is to keep my promise to my employees and the people .
I 'll decide what to do with the rest of the money later . "
Also at the top of his list is his immediate and extended family .
There are two sisters and four brothers , one in Brazil .
" I believe that if you can help , you should help , " Lima said as customers stopped him in the aisles yesterday to shake his hand , slap his back and offer their congratulations .
It was business as usual .
He picked up a java at the coffee shop next door and then went to the butchery to prepare for the 8 a.m. opening .
He slipped a white lab coat over his jeans and sweatshirt , and donned a company baseball cap embroidered with the words " King of Meat . "
And then , as he 's done for umpteen years , Lima scrubbed the sidewalk in front of the shop .
But somehow , " the air is more fresh today , " he said , smiling .
Lima said he 's been lucky since the first day he arrived in Canada .

And he 's always had a heart as big as his new bank account .
Lima said he believes in reaching out to those who need it .
A few weeks ago , an elderly customer asked for his help – a $ 60 loan so she could buy groceries to feed her family .
He did n't hesitate .
She promised to repay him by March 27 – the day his multi-million - dollar ship came in .
" My customer came to the store crying and wishing me all of God 's blessings , " he said , wiping tears .

OTTAWA  Canadian federal and provincial government officials were conducting an investigation Wednesday into Syncrude Canada , a large oil - sands project operator , after hundreds of migrating ducks that landed in a company tailings pond died .
Water used to separate and process the oil - bearing tar in oil - sands deposits ends up in large ponds and becomes a toxic sludge .
Alberta officials said Tuesday that Syncrude had failed to operate noisemakers to frighten away birds .
The company also appears not to have notified the province ’s government about the birds ’ arrival on Monday .
An anonymous tip eventually alerted officials that about 500 birds were in the pond .
“ This is a tragedy and this is unacceptable , ” Alberta ’s environment minister , Rob Renner , said , “ and we ’re going to do everything within our power to find out why it occurred ” and “ to prevent it from occurring again . ”
Cheryl Robb , a spokeswoman for Alberta Environment , said only five ducks had survived and been recovered .
The episode comes as environmental groups in Canada and the United States are pushing for a slowdown or even a halt to further oil - sands development in northern Alberta .

On Tuesday , ABC News posted a story headlined " Al - Qaeda Tape to Call for Use of WMDs . "
Which would be awfully scary – if it were true .
" Operatives " from the terrorist group , the network warned , " will post a new video on the Internet in the next 24 hours , calling for what one source said is ' jihadists to use biological , chemical and nuclear weapons to attack the West . '
The report then quotes FBI spokesman Richard Kolko , who says that " there have been several reports that al Qaeda will release a new message calling for the use of weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) against civilians . "
Or maybe not .
The video was actually released on Monday Sunday .
And while it is called '' Nuclear Jihad , The Ultimate Terror , " it is not from Al - Qaeda – or any other major terrorist group .
Rather , it is " a jihadi supporter video compilation , " notes Ben Venzke with IntelCenter – a flick " made by fans or supporters who may not have ever had any contact with a real terrorist . "
These videos almost always are comprised of old video footage that is edited together to make a new video .
The material in these types of videos do not qualify as an official message from al - Qaeda or any other group .
Considering them so would be the equivalent of considering a 10 - year - old 's homemade fan video of his favorite sports team to be an official team message .
" The intel community appears to have ( once again ) fallen victim to poorly researched open source news reporting , " writes Evan Kohlmann over at the Counterterrorism Blog .
In recent days , several fringe media organizations have published stories about a video recording posted by anonymous Al - Qaida miscreants on extremist Internet chat forums .
The video consisted of a remarkably amateurish mash - up of Discovery Channel documentaries , widely published sermons by radical clerics , and stolen propaganda footage .
While it is perhaps true that the video offered subtle encouragement for nuclear attacks on the United States , it featured no original content and could have been clumsily strung together with little more than two VCRs .
The video was meandering , boring , and difficult to follow – and it certainly was not the product of Al - Qaida .
Look , reporters get stories wrong all the time .
And ABC , to its credit , has revised its original report ... but only slightly .
There 's a caveat from Venzke buried in the piece .
The headline now reads : " Al Qaeda Supporters ' Tape to Call for Use of WMDs . "
The quote from FBI spokesman Kolko remains the same .
UPDATE : Looks like the – video and a partial translation are here .

Overview
As people increasingly rely on the Internet to deliver downloadable music , movies , and television , content producers are faced with the problem of increasing Internet piracy .
To protect their content , copyright holders police the Internet , searching for unauthorized distribution of their work on websites like YouTube or peer - to - peer networks such as BitTorrent .
When infringement is ( allegedly ) discovered , formal complaints are issued to network operators that may result in websites being taken down or home Internet connections being disabled .
Although the implications of being accused of copyright infringement are significant , very little is known about the methods used by enforcement agencies to detect it , particularly in P2P networks .
We have conducted the first scientific , experimental study of monitoring and copyright enforcement on P2P networks and have made several discoveries which we find surprising .
Practically any Internet user can be framed for copyright infringement today .
By profiling copyright enforcement in the popular BitTorrent file sharing system , we were able to generate hundreds of real DMCA takedown notices for computers at the University of Washington that never downloaded nor shared any content whatsoever .
Further , we were able to remotely generate complaints for nonsense devices including several printers and a ( non - NAT ) wireless access point .
Our results demonstrate several simple techniques that a malicious user could use to frame arbitrary network endpoints .
By profiling copyright enforcement in the popular BitTorrent file sharing system , we were able to generate hundreds of real DMCA takedown notices for computers at the University of Washington that never downloaded nor shared any content whatsoever .
Even without being explicitly framed , innocent users may still receive complaints .
Because of the inconclusive techniques used to identify infringing BitTorrent users , users may receive DMCA complaints even if they have not been explicitly framed by a malicious user and even if they have never used P2P software !
Because of the inconclusive techniques used to identify infringing BitTorrent users , users may receive DMCA complaints even if they have not been explicitly framed by a malicious user and even if they have never used P2P software !
Software packages designed to preserve the privacy of P2P users are not completely effective .
To avoid DMCA complaints today , many privacy conscious users employ IP blacklisting software designed to avoid communication with monitoring and enforcement agencies .
We find that this software often fails to identify many likely monitoring agents , but we also discover that these agents exhibit characteristics that make distinguishing them straightforward .
While our experiments focus on BitTorrent only , our findings imply the need for increased transparency in the monitoring and enforcement process for all P2P networks to both address the known deficiencies we have exposed as well as to identify lurking unknown deficiencies .
More details about our findings and our experimental methodology are available in our online FAQ .
A more thorough treatment is available in our paper .

MERIDIAN , Miss . –
As he launched a tour here designed to highlight his family ’s long tradition of military service , Senator John McCain said Monday that he was surprised by the latest turn of events in America ’s current war in Iraq .
Mr. McCain said he had not expected Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki to try to oust Shiite militias from Basra without consulting the Americans , and that he was troubled by some of the demands that were made by the Shiite cleric Moktada al - Sadr as part of his offer of a ceasefire after the militias held off the American - supported assault .
And he tied some of the current problems to the Bush administration ’s old strategy there .
“ Maliki decided to take on this operation without consulting the Americans , ’’ Mr. McCain said on his campaign bus as it rolled through downtown Meridian , saying that the move showed independence but that he had expected the military to focus on Mosul .
“ I just am surprised that he would take it on himself to go down and take charge of a military offensive , ’’ he said .
“ I had not anticipated that he would do that . ’’
“ I think he felt – which many of us had talked about many times — that Basra was an important part of the country , it was not under the control of the government , we all know that varying mafia - like factions , Shiite militias , control different parts of it , ’’ he said .
“ The police are corrupt .
So he decided he wanted to address the issue .
And whether he should have or not , I think we will see what the ultimate results are .
But it certainly shows a degree of independence . ’’
“ Apparently they have a ceasefire , and Sadr has made some demands , some of them certainly not agreeable , and also apparently there are some Shiite militias that are not under Sadr ’s control , ’’ he said .
“ So it ’s still a very fluid situation , and we ’ll see what happens in the next 24 , 48 hours or so . ’’
And Mr. McCain , an ardent supporter of the war who then faulted the Bush administration ’s post - invasion strategy for deploying too few troops , said that some of the current problems can be traced to the failures of that earlier strategy .
“ This goes back to when we did n’t have enough boots on the ground , after the initial military success , ’’ he said .
“ Iranian clerics moved into the region , Iranian influence moved into southern Iraq , and we basically , and the British , did not do a great deal to prevent them .
These are the penalties we continue to pay for the very bad mishandling of the war for nearly four years while they became solidly entrenched . ”
Asked if the Basra campaign had backfired , he said : “ Apparently it was Sadr who asked for the ceasefire , declared a ceasefire .
It was n’t Maliki .
Very rarely do I see the winning side declare a ceasefire .
So we ’ll see . ’’
Then Mr. McCain arrived at a theater in downtown Meridian , where he pivoted from talking about the current war to the wars decades ago that his father and grandfather , both admirals in the Navy , fought , and how their examples molded him .
“ As a boy , my family legacy , as fascinating as it was to me , often felt like an imposition , ’’ he said .
“ I knew from a very early age that I was destined for Annapolis and a career in the Navy .
In reaction , I often rebelled in small and petty ways to what I perceived as an encroachment on my free will . ’’
“ I concede that I remember with affection the unruly passions of youth , and how they governed my immature sense of honor and self - respect .
As I grew older , and the challenges to my self - respect grew more varied and serious , I was surprised to discover that while my sense of honor had matured , its defense mattered even more to me than it did when it was such a vulnerable thing that any empty challenge threatened it . ”
“ Like most people , when I reflect on the adventures and joys of youth , I feel a longing for what is lost and cannot be restored .
But though the happy pursuits of the young prove ephemeral , something better can endure , and endure until our last moment of life .
And that is the honor we earn and the love we give when we work and sacrifice with others for a cause greater than our self - interest .
For me that cause has long been our country .
I am a lucky , lucky man to have found it , and am forever grateful to those who showed me the way .
What they gave me was much more valuable and lasting than the tribute I once paid to vanity . ”
“ I am the son and grandson of admirals , ’’ he said .
“ My grandfather was an aviator ; my father a submariner .
They were my first heroes , and their respect for me has been one of the most lasting ambitions of my life .
They gave their lives to their country , and taught me lessons about honor , courage , duty , perseverance and leadership that I did n’t fully grasp until later in life , but remembered when I needed them most .
I have been an imperfect servant of my country for many years .
But I am their son , and they showed me how to love my country , and that has made all the difference for me , my friends , all the difference in the world . ’’
Want to be an astronaut ?
Here 's your chance A chance to really shoot for the stars
NASA looking to hire 10 to 15 new astronauts
NASA posted a hiring notice for new astronauts Tuesday , seeking for the first time in almost 30 years men and women to fly aboard spacecraft other than the shuttle .
The pilots , scientists , engineers and educators that NASA recruits will train primarily for three - to six - month missions aboard the international space station .
However , some could be among those who stroll on the surface of the moon as part of NASA 's plan to return human explorers to the lunar surface by 2020 aboard the shuttle fleet 's successor spacecraft .
" Yes , I think it 's quite likely , " said Ellen Ochoa , who supervises NASA 's astronaut corps as the director of flight crew operations at the Johnson Space Center in Houston .
The space agency 's help - wanted notice for 10 to 15 new space fliers was posted Tuesday on www.usajobs.com, the federal government 's employment Web site .
Several thousand people are expected to apply by the July 1 deadline .
They will join a similar number who 've applied to NASA in previous years and now must update their applications and convert them from paper to the new electronic format .
After four spaceflights herself , Ochoa , a former electrical engineer , knows the appeal .
" Something that deals with exploration , that is trying to push not only our country but the world in a direction that it has not been before , that looks beyond yourself and your own community , is very appealing , " Ochoa said .
" Then there is just the experience of being in space , of looking down at the Earth and experiencing weightlessness — that is just a very special experience . "
NASA offers a starting annual salary of $ 59,493 to $ 130,257 , depending on qualifications and experience .
With the shuttle fleet headed for retirement in 2010 , the newest astronauts will train to travel on Russian Soyuz capsules for missions to the space station .
Astronauts have been doing so since the mid-1990s , when the U.S. began collaborating with the Russians .
The U.S. - led space station international partnership intends to increase to six from three the number of astronauts living aboard the outpost in 2009 , creating more flight opportunities .
New shuttle in the works
NASA 's new Orion moon ship , the shuttle 's replacement , will not be ready for space station flights until 2015 , unless the White House and Congress change funding levels .
Orion is considered a centerpiece of a lunar initiative announced by President Bush three years ago .
He directed NASA to lead an international effort to reprise and expand on the Apollo missions of the late 1960s and early ' 70s by establishing a permanently staffed lunar base .
The base would serve as a training ground for missions to Mars and other deep space destinations .
NASA 's astronaut corps includes 91 people considered eligible for flight assignments .
Fifteen have not flown or been assigned to upcoming shuttle and station missions .
Some corps members are expected to leave the program because there will be fewer chances to fly after the shuttle fleet is mothballed and before the first Orion missions .
Other current astronauts are expected to remain past 2010 in hopes of drawing a moon mission or to participate in the development of Orion and a yet - to - be funded lunar lander .
Announcement in 2009
The decision to hire 10 to 15 new astronauts was based on NASA 's best estimate of the attrition rate and funding , spokeswoman Kylie Clem said .
After the application deadline , the agency will invite the best job candidates to Houston for interviews with a selection panel and medical screening .
NASA is reassessing its psychological screening process to address concerns raised by incidents this year involving the astronaut corps .
One involved the arrest of astronaut Lisa Nowak at the Orlando , Fla. , airport .
She was charged after a confrontation with another woman over the affections of astronaut Bill Oefelein .
In response to the widely publicized incident , NASA asked an outside panel of behavioral health experts to examine astronaut behavior .
The newest astronauts are to be announced in spring 2009 and report to the JSC the following August to begin two years of training .
NASA is seeking pilots and crewmembers such as scientists , engineers and teachers .
Pilot applicants must have at 1,000 hours at the controls of a fighter jet or in command of a larger jet aircraft .
Military test pilots will have an advantage .
After two years of basic training , the new astronauts will become eligible for assignment to a mission .
But past practice indicates they will first draw assignments supporting more senior astronauts and face at least another year of mission - specific training before they head for the launch pad .

Playing with heroku
If you ’ve been following things in the Ruby sphere , you might have heard of heroku .
In my mind , it provides two major things :
Web UI for Rails development
Turnkey Rails hosting and deployment
I attended a workshop earlier today giving a shallow dive through Ruby and Rails , where we used heroku as our testbed .
Initial setup
To start , you ’ll obviously need an account :)
It is currently in invite - only beta , but I might be able to swing an invite or two , so drop me a note if you ’re interested .
Once you have an account setup , you should install their gem .
urmachine $ sudo gem install heroku Updating metadata for 3 gems from http://gems.rubyforge.org/
... complete Successfully installed heroku-0.2 1 gem installed Installing ri documentation for heroku - 0.2 ...
Installing RDoc documentation for heroku -0.2 ...
This gives you access to the basic stuff for managing your heroku apps .
Creating an app
urmachine $ heroku create urapp Enter your Heroku credentials .
Email : joshua.nichols@gmail.com
Password : Uploading ssh public key Created http:// urapp .heroku.com /
This does a few things :
The first time you use any heroku commands , you will be prompted for your heroku email and password .
It will also upload your public ssh key ( which you need to create ahead of time )
Creates a default app , as if you had done rails urapp locally
locally Sticks this in a remote git repository
Starts up the app , and makes it accessible at http://urapp.heroku.com
Developing the app
At this point , you have two options for going forward with development .
Use the heroku web interface .
Not for me .
Pull down a copy of your repository , work remotely and periodically push changes .
Yes yes yes yes yes .
The heroku command line tool acts as a front to
urmachine $ heroku clone urapp Initialized empty Git repository in / Users / nichoj / Projects / urapp /.git /
The authenticity of host ' heroku.com ( 67.202.2.198 ) ' can't be established .
RSA key fingerprint is 8b:48:5e:67:0e :c9:16:47:32:f2:87:0c:1f:c8:60 :ad .
Are you sure you want to continue connecting ( yes / no ) ? yes Warning : Permanently added ' heroku.com,67.202.2.198 ' ( RSA ) to the list of known hosts .

Mongrel not running , ca n't restart
WHOA .
Not only did it push the commit , it seems to have some post - commit magic to migrate your database and restart mongrel .
Impressions
Overall , this seems pretty slick .
Lots of cool stuff going on .
Web UI for Rails development if you want it
git access for when you want to do local development
Effortless deployment
Really useful for trying out proof - of - concept apps
Free
The only concern I have is pricing .
It ’s free now , but I can only imagine it ’ll be a pay service at one point or another .
I ’m told development will be free , but there will be some pricing scheme for making stuff publicly accessible .
Astronomers have found the remains of the youngest supernova , or exploded star , in the Milky Way Galaxy .
The supernova occurred in 1868 , but was hidden behind a thick veil of gas and dust .
Using the Very Large Array ( VLA ) and NASA ’s Chandra X - Ray Observatory , which could peer through the veil , astronomers have now found “ G1.9+0.3 , ” the first example of what scientists believe are a “ missing population ” of young supernova remnants .
This is NASA ’s long awaited announcement , and astronomers have been searching for over 50 years for this type of young supernova .
From observing supernovae in other galaxies , astronomers estimate that about three such stellar explosions should occur in our Milky Way every century .
However , the most recent one known until now occurred around 1680 , creating the remnant called Cassiopeia A .
The newly - discovered object is the remnant of an explosion only about 140 years ago .
“ It ’s great to finally track one of them down , ” said David Green of the University of Cambridge in the UK , who led the VLA study .
Supernovas mark the violent death of a star , and release tremendous amounts of energy and spew heavy elements such as calcium and iron into interstellar space .
This seeds the clouds of gas and dust from which new stars and planets are formed .
The lack of evidence for young supernova remnants in the Milky Way had caused astronomers to wonder if our Galaxy , which appears otherwise normal , differed in some unknown way from others , or if our understanding of the relationship between supernovae and other galactic processes was in error .
Cassiopeia
A supernova remnant — from the year 1680 .
The astronomers made their discovery by measuring the expansion of the debris from the star ’s explosion .
They did this by comparing images of G1.9+0.3 , made more than two decades apart .
In 1985 , astronomers led by Green observed G1.9+0.3 with the VLA and identified it as a supernova remnant .
At that time , they estimated its age as between 400 and 1,000 years .
It is near the center of our Galaxy , roughly 25,000 light - years from Earth .
In 2007 , another team of astronomers , led by Stephen Reynolds of North Carolina State University , observed the object with the Chandra X - Ray Observatory .
To their surprise , their image showed
the object to be about 16 percent larger than in the 1985 VLA image .
“ This is a huge difference .
It means the explosion debris is expanding very quickly , which in turn means the object is much younger than we originally thought , ” Reynolds explained .
However , this expansion measurement came from comparing a radio image to an X - ray image .
To make an “ apples to apples ” comparison , the scientists sought and were quickly granted observing time on the VLA which confirmed the supernova remnant ’s rapid expansion .
The object already has provided surprises .
The velocities of its explosion debris and extreme energies of its particles are unprecedented .
“ No other object in the Galaxy has properties like this , ” said Reynolds .
“ Finding G1.9+0.3 is extremely important for learning more about how some stars explode and what happens in the aftermath . ”

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The case of a convicted rapist paroled in 1999 has come back to haunt Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee , with the mother of a woman the convict later murdered pledging to campaign against the former Arkansas governor .
Mike Huckabee says he did not try to influence the Arkansas Parole board to parole Wayne DuMond .
Huckabee , during his first term as Arkansas governor , expressed support for the parole of Wayne DuMond in a letter to him .
DuMond was serving a life sentence for raping a 17 - year - old girl .
The Arkansas parole board had the final say on DuMond 's parole .
Less than a year after his release from prison in 1999 , DuMond was accused of raping and murdering Carol Shields , a woman in Kansas City , Missouri .
DuMond was convicted of the crime in 2003 .
He died in prison in 2005 .
Huckabee on Sunday confirmed to CNN he had sent the letter to DuMond .
The murdered woman 's mother , Lois Davidson , said she will " absolutely campaign against " Huckabee , and said she decided to come forward when he started doing well in the polls .
" It 's because he is a serious contender , " Davidson said .
" I did n't think he had a chance , but now he 's right up there in Iowa . "
In an interview with CNN Wednesday , Huckabee said it was " heartbreaking " that the murders had become politicized .
" There are families who are truly , understandably and reasonably , grief stricken , " Huckabee said .
" And for people to now politicize these deaths and to try to make a political case out of it rather than to simply understand that a system failed and that we ought to extend our grief and heartfelt sorrow to these families , I just regret politics is reduced to that . "
Huckabee said he had considered granting DuMond clemency , but he dropped the idea in response to public outcry .
Huckabee also said he did not grant clemency because he wanted to ensure DuMond was supervised when he was released from prison .
" Had I granted his commutation , then there would have been no supervision at all , " Huckabee said , " I was n't comfortable with that . "
The DuMond case began in 1985 , when he was accused of raping a 17 - year - old girl .
Before trial , DuMond was attacked in his home and castrated , and the local sheriff kept the severed testicles in a jar .
No charges were brought in the attack .
Huckabee said the process leading to DuMond 's release began under former President Bill Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas .
Clinton and , later , Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker commuted part of DuMond 's sentence , Huckabee said , because they thought it was excessive .
When he spoke about the case , Huckabee suggested his role in the decision to parole DuMond was limited .
Huckabee said it was the decision by Clinton and Tucker that made DuMond eligible for parole , and Huckabee declined to reduce DuMond 's sentence further .
In 1996 , Huckabee sent a letter to DuMond saying parole was the best option for him , the National Review reported .
" I 've never made a decision about the DuMond case other than the decision to write the letter " to DuMond , Huckabee said .
" That was my decision , but I did n't parole him , because governors do n't parole people in Arkansas . "
However , Charles Chastain , a parole board member at the time , told ABC News he felt pressure from Huckabee when the board considered DuMond 's parole in 1996 .
The Arkansas Times reported in 2002 that two other board members said they were influenced by Huckabee to parole DuMond .
Huckabee denied he asked the board to approve DuMond 's parole .
" No , I did not , " Huckabee said Sunday .
" Let me categorically say I did not . "
Huckabee said Wednesday his discussion with the parole board in 1996 was a general discussion about clemency , not about the DuMond case .
Huckabee noted that the three board members who said they were pressured were appointed to the board by Democrats Clinton and Tucker .
Documents posted on the Web site The Huffington Post indicate Huckabee received letters from several victims of DuMond before his release .
The letters detailed his past actions and pleaded that he remain incarcerated .
" I feel that if he is released it is only a matter of time before he commits another crime and fear that he will not leave a witness to testify against him the next time , " one victim wrote .
She described how DuMond had raped her at knifepoint .
A former top Huckabee aide confirmed to CNN the then - governor received that letter and a follow - up phone call from the victim .
In another letter , a woman documented how her mother was raped by DuMond , and said he had told her mother he would rape her daughter if she did not cooperate .
The Huffington Post said it received the never - before - published letters from a " deeply troubled " former aide to Huckabee who believes the presidential candidate has " deliberately attempted to cover up his knowledge of DuMond 's other sexual assaults . "
Huckabee spokeswoman Alice Stewart denied to the Huffington Post that Huckabee received any of the letters , but later told CNN he got at least one from a victim named " Onita , " who lived in DeWitt , Arkansas .
It 's not clear if this is one of the letters posted on the Huffington Post , because the site has redacted the names .
The Huffington Post has published three victims ' letters , and says it will post additional files later Wednesday .

ONCE you become accustomed to gas at $ 4 a gallon , brace yourself for the next shocking retail threshold : bananas reaching $ 1 a pound .
At that price , Americans may stop thinking of bananas as a cheap staple , and then a strategy that has served the big banana companies for more than a century  enabling them to turn an exotic , tropical fruit into an everyday favorite  will begin to unravel .
The immediate reasons for the price increase are the rising cost of oil and reduced supply caused by floods in Ecuador , the world ’s biggest banana exporter .
But something larger is going on that will affect prices for years to come .
That bananas have long been the cheapest fruit at the grocery store is astonishing .
They ’re grown thousands of miles away , they must be transported in cooled containers and even then they survive no more than two weeks after they ’re cut off the tree .
Apples , in contrast , are typically grown within a few hundred miles of the store and keep for months in a basket out in the garage .
Yet apples traditionally have cost at least twice as much per pound as bananas .
Americans eat as many bananas as apples and oranges combined , which is especially amazing when you consider that not so long ago , bananas were virtually unknown here .
They became a staple only after the men who in the late 19th century founded the United Fruit Company ( today ’s Chiquita ) figured out how to get bananas to American tables quickly  by clearing rainforest in Latin America , building railroads and communication networks and inventing refrigeration techniques to control ripening .
The banana barons also marketed their product in ways that had never occurred to farmers or grocers before , by offering discount coupons , writing jingles and placing bananas in schoolbooks and on picture postcards .
They even hired doctors to convince mothers that bananas were good for children .
Dear Diary , I just got my first job as an IT professional .
It ’s at a big box electronics retailer .
I quit the music store and started work with an earning potential at nearly twice the minimum wage .
True they make me wear a skin tight blue shirt and tan pants , but that is a small price to pay for finally earning my first paycheck from my computing skills .
Who knew all those hours of playing video games would finally pay off .
I ’m so excited !
Dear Diary , I had yet another bad day .
An old man brought his computer in .
He screamed at me and told me that I was stupid .
The other techs said not to worry and that it happens all the time .
The old man had the computer because his son did n’t want to write letters anymore .
He wanted his dad to get on - line so he could send emails instead .
The old man could fly a fighter jet in the war but could n't find the ' On ' button for the computer .
We showed him the ‘ On ’ button .
Everyone left happy .
He apologized to me for being such a bitter old codger .
It was great to see him leave happy .
Dear Diary , I hate retail .
I ’ve learned to hate all the customers , my boss , and my attire .
The other techs said this was a milestone .
They called it my new retail skin and assured me this was how everyone in the store felt .
I fixed twelve computers today and my manager was so happy he asked me to cover Johns shift on Saturday .
I can't imagine doing this for much longer .
Dear Diary ; I just got a new job at a medical device manufacturer .
I ’m one of three techs for all the two thousand employees .
Its great .
The CEO and gardener both know my first name .
I 'm just beginning to learn the ropes of corporate life , it is quite different .
The goal in corporate IT seems to be control .
The objective is to give the users as little access and few rights as possible .
It ’s a delicate balance and lot of people call and complain .
My boss says “ As long as they call and complain we all have jobs .
” Dear Diary , I just had my first paid coffee break .
I ’m never going back .
I ca n’t imagine stopping work for ten minutes in retail and getting away with it .
I have also noticed that the secretaries have an unusual amount of power .
Whatever they say goes .
I find when I do what they want my life is much easier .
I do n’t have time to fix everyones computer .
I need another coffee break .
Dear Diary , I just got a job at a startup .
It came with something call ‘ stock options . ’
I do n’t know what they are , but everyone wants them so , I do too !
I work long hours for less pay , and I have n't shaved in a week .
I 'm never at home and I 've slept a my desk a couple of times .
My boss is a jerk and even the coffee here tastes bitter .
I met the lead Engineer .
He ’s very smart .
I think .
He mumbles a lot and is terribly anti-social .
I can see I ’m going to need to decline my communication skills if I want to get ahead in this company .
Dear Diary , I just got laid - off .
I feel like this is just another leg of the journey in my path of IT professional .
I always felt left out at the water cooler when the other guys would talk about all their hard times .
I 'm not bitter , it 's just part of the business .
I have a map to the CEO 's home , a sackful of Molotov Cocktails and good pair of running shoes .
Dear Diary , I am now the lead Engineer .
Yes it ’s working fine .
No I did n’t change anything .
Your wrong , and it is n’t my problem .
Married couple ignores washing and haircutting for 16 years
Anatoly and Larisa Shakhovs met 21 years ago .
He was a 52 - year old piano tuner and piano instaurator .
He was then an experienced trekker , a UFO eyewitness , a member of Astronomic society , a bookworm that read hundreds of philosophical books , a brilliantly - educated man that has been to all big museums of USSR and met many famous people .
She was just an undergraduate in the music school of 19 .
They had one common topic – ufology .
21 years later they are still together .
The Shakhovs live in Makeevka that is close to Donetsk , the Ukraine .
Married couple ignores washing and haircutting for 16 years
Larisa ’s parents were shocked to know that their daughter was to live with a man that is 31 years older than her .
Things became worse when they gave up their jobs to dedicate all the time to their hobby – ufolofy .
However , they still decided to keep in touch .
Once a month they visit Larisa and give her vegetables and preserves .
The Shakhovs accept food , however , with suspicion : before eating , they test it on cats to identify if it is poisoned or not .
They are completely sure in the food that they themselves buy in the market , situated nearby .
Click here to see the PHOTO report about Anatoly and Larisa Shakhovs
Anatoly thinks it is the market owners that once set his house on fire .
He thinks they wanted enlarge the market and his house was the only obstacle .
The ufologist still ca n’t keep up with the thought that his observatory with telescopes , books on astronomy and some rare icons are gone in the fire .
The house was put out by firemen , and this is how the town found out about the couple that does n’t accept any norms of society .
Their half - dilapidated house is situated almost in the center of the industrial town Makeevka .
Their shelter deserves to be talked about .
The crib has neither light , nor any electronic utensils .
The walls are all covered with the maps - labyrinths of space .
Larisa claims they are not handmade , but painted by the hand of someone from the above .
But what really shocks is not their house , but the appearances of these people .
They have n’t washed themselves for 16 years !
They never wash their clothes .
They wear the same apparel for a year until it becomes damp .
Neither do they wash up .
10 years ago , after the market construction , their water pipe dried up .
But they decided not to ask anyone to get it fixed .
Instead they started to gather rainwater and use it for cooking and drinking .
They say they get enough water , because they are very thrifty : they eat and drink once a day , sometimes even less frequently – once a couple of days , and with absolutely no salt .
They bought 4 loaves of bread in Februaty and still have half a loaf .
Larisa also manages to cook soup , sauces , mush , beans , potatoes , coffee and so on .
The most surprising is , with shortage of fresh water and lack of any hygiene , they never needed neither medicines , nor medical help .
Well , to some extent they do really take care of their health : they neither smoke , nor drink alcohol and beware of products with harmful ingredients .
When someone asked them if the like the way they smell , the couple says that they hate the smell of shampoo and deodorant and think it is much more harmful for health to use them than to stay unwashed for decades .
They do n’t just stay unwashed for decades , but also unshaved .
Anatoly has an almost 78 - inch long beard .
It is difficult to say about the length of hair of the man and his wife : for 16 years that they have n’t cut hair it became a tight mat .
It is difficult to wear such long hair , but the couple already got used to it .
The Shakhovs do n’t try to underline that their long hair is used to communicate with space .
They just say that ‘ it ’s meant to be so ’ .
They have never thought of leading another way of life .
They both say that it is the best life and they would die to live in any other conditions .
Well , tastes differ , they say .

The wireless clock will soon strike midnight in the City of Brotherly Love , as EarthLink will soon shut down Philadelphia 's municipal WiFi for good .
EarthLink claims it was going transfer the network to the city of Philadelphia for free ( as well as donate the WiFi equipment ) , but blames the conclusion of this months - long drama on the city 's inability to get its act together .
Current customers will have 30 days to transition to something else , and the plug will officially be pulled on Thursday , June 12 .
" EarthLink has worked diligently for many months to transfer our WiFi network to a new owner — at no cost , " EarthLink CEO Rolla Huff said in a statement today .
" Unfortunately , our hope that we could transfer our network to a nonprofit organization that had planned to offer free WiFi throughout Philadelphia will not be realized .
Since we have exhausted our efforts to find a new owner of the network , our only responsible alternative now is to remove our network at our cost and assist our Wi-Fi customers with alternative ways to access the Internet . "
The announcement comes under a week after EarthLink gave the city its second ( and apparently final ) deadline to take the network off its hands .
The company had stopped accepting new customers a week previous in anticipation of the possible shutdown .
Philadelphia had reportedly been working to save the network without dipping into taxpayer funds , but never managed to figure out a solution .
EarthLink 's decision to jump ship on Philadelphia goes back to last year , when the ISP decided there was no money to be made in municipal WiFi .
This , of course , came after the company had already begun to help a number of cities launch municipal WiFi networks ( including Philadelphia ) .
In February , EarthLink hung a " for sale " sign on its WiFi business after announcing major losses as a result of the municipal WiFi projects .
When Philadelphia 's WiFi network goes dark come June 12 , it will mark the end of one of the first and largest citywide WiFi projects in the US .
The move is reflective of overall problems in municipal WiFi , too .
San Francisco 's planned network has yet to launch ( despite having been planned since 2005 ) , and Chicago 's was canned last August after the city butted heads with EarthLink and AT&T over the city using the network itself as an anchor tenant .
On the other hand , Corpus Christi , Texas has managed to keep its network running just fine , due in part to the city 's willingness to use the network to transmit data for its own services .
As part of EarthLink 's announcement today , the company also filed a proceeding in federal court that will allow it to remove the equipment it had installed , including transmitters installed on lightposts .
EarthLink requested that its potential liability for the takedown be no more than $ 1 million , and said that it does n't expect the move to have any impact on its current financial outlook .
It looks like EarthLink may have been headed to court anyway : Philadelphia councilman Frank Rizzo pointed out to the Associated Press that the network had yet to be completed and hinted at a possible lawsuit .
" EarthLink knows they are vulnerable to litigation , " he said .
On the heels of our reporting about Canada 's probable move to ban BPA plastics comes a story about researchers working at Missouri University of Science and Technology to develop hybrid plastics that would biodegrade in landfills within four months .
As our editor Nicole Dyer pointed out in a comment to the BPA post , the larger and more important issue facing plastics is their propensity to stick around forever .
As we pointed out in our article about the waste gyre in the Pacific Ocean , plastics will eventually photodegrade into microscopic bits , but those polymer molecules will forever be inorganic toxins .
The Missouri S&T scientists are working to change that by focusing their attention on a biodegradable polyester .
When people think health care most immediately think doctor or dentist .
The next thing that comes to mind are the number of long years in college , then graduate school , possibly an internship , giving up sleep and a social life .
Finally , at the end of all that schooling , an exhausted human being opens their own practice and welcomes patients .
The people who do go through all that to become a doctor or dentist need support personnel .
Doctors need nurses and receptionists .
Dentists need hygienists and dental assistants .
Becoming a dental assistant does not require a person to go to a four year college .
In a relatively short amount of time you can get your certification and licensing .
You can graduate from an accredited program within 12 to 24 months .
Upon graduation , the newly educated dental assistant must pass the Certified Dental Assistant ( CDA ) exam which is provided by the Dental Assisting National Board , ( DANB ) .
The purpose for taking the CDA is to make certain the new dental assistant is sufficiently prepared to assist in the dental office .
Learning to be a dental assistant involves classroom study , clinical work and laboratory training .
The student will learn about teeth , jaws , dental instruments and procedures .
Classes include oral exams , medical terms , dental materials , teeth and gum infections , radiology , maintenance and understanding of charts .
To learn to assist in the office classes must be taken to learn bookkeeping , understanding dental insurance and proper interaction with patients , and staff .
Clinical training is another aspect of learning to be a dental assistant .
Many schools require a certain number of hours to be completed before you can get your certification .
This experience is gained through work at health care centers , medical clinics , and of course dental offices .
Dental Assisting can be a varied career and what you do each day depends on your specific dentist ’s office .
Working with Patients :
• Make the patients comfortable
• Prepare patients for the dental exam
• Sterilize and lay out the dentist ’s instruments
• Hand the dentist instruments as needed
• Take x-rays and develop them
• Remove stitches
• Apply topical anesthetics to gums
• Apply fluoride
Managing the dentist office :
• Answering the phone
• Making appointments
• Greeting patients and helping them fill out forms
• Applying in - office payments
• Issuing invoices
• Ordering and receiving office supplies
Lab Work :
• Make plaster casts of teeth and mouth
• Clean and polish removable mouth apparatus
• Measure for orthodontics
The dental assistant salary as of 2013 , ranged from $ 24,220.00 to $ 48,350.00 .
The average salary is about $ 35,640.00 .
Higher salaries are more readily available in larger metropolitan areas .
The average salary in 2004 was about $ 28,500.00 , so as you see there has been a steady increase in the dental assistant salary .
The need for dental assistants is growing .
The Bureau of Labor Statistics states that it anticipates more than 74,000 new openings up to 2022 creating a growth rate of 24.5 percent .
Several reasons for the growth can be attested to that people are taking much better care of their teeth , as well as increased dental insurance allowing more people to go to the dentist more often .
There are other perks in becoming a dental assistant .
Most offices are only open Monday through Friday .
Very few dentists keep hours on Saturdays , and if they are open , it is usually only for a half day .
The hours are normally pretty great too , quite often 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM .
Of course this is subject to change and is dependent on the dentist ’s needs .
A lot of dental offices require its staff to wear scrubs .
Some offices even purchase scrubs for its employees so everyone will be dressed uniformly .
Wearing scrubs is a terrific way to save money .
Scrubs are not nearly as expensive as buying a work wardrobe .
Becoming a dental assistant is a wide open field .
There are plenty of jobs , the pay is good and the hours are easy .
This might just be the job for you .
ROME 
In the past year , as the diversion of food crops like corn and palm to make biofuels has helped to drive up food prices , investors and politicians have begun promoting newer , so - called second - generation biofuels as the next wave of green energy .
These , made from non -food crops like reeds and wild grasses , would offer fuel without the risk of taking food off the table , they said .
But now , biologists and botanists are warning that they , too , may bring serious unintended consequences .
Most of these newer crops are what scientists label invasive species  that is , weeds  that have an extraordinarily high potential to escape biofuel plantations , overrun adjacent farms and natural land , and create economic and ecological havoc in the process , they now say .
At a United Nations meeting in Bonn , Germany , on Tuesday , scientists from the Global Invasive Species Program , the Nature Conservancy and the International Union for Conservation of Nature , as well as other groups , presented a paper with a warning about invasive species .
“ Some of the most commonly recommended species for biofuels production are also major invasive alien species , ” the paper says , adding that these crops should be studied more thoroughly before being cultivated in new areas .
BRAD BLOG's Call to Action Cited in Round - Up of Last Week 's Notable News ...
Brad Friedman Byon 6/2/2008 , 7:35 am PT
Our friends at GoLeft.TV and RAW STORY have picked up on our call from late last week to help the folks out at Fox " News " by letting them know about Ann Coulter 's voter fraud .
Last week ,
Fox asked viewers for help in their " voter fraud special investigation . "
Be sure to let them know about Coulter 's several felony acts down in Palm Beach County , Florida , ( well - documented at the link above ) by writing to them at their super - special tipster address : VoterFraud@FoxNews.com .
GoLeft 's coverage of the story follows ( 1:45 mins ) , with a kind nod to The BRAD BLOG , as they join our call to action ...
From their coverage :
The new claim being made by Fox is that illegal immigrants are going to be casting votes in November , playing on right - wing anti-immigrant sentiments .
Fox News has now set out to find the evidence of fraud that the Bush Department of Justice could not , whipping up their audience with the threat of non-citizens " getting a fake ID , a driver 's license , or a social security card and voting in this year 's election . "
The network has even gone as far as creating a special email address for evidence - Voterfraud@foxnews.com .
Brad Friedman of the Brad Blog has encouraged people to submit the case of Ann Coulter , who as Brad says , " knowingly lied about her address on her voter registration form in Palm Beach County , Florida ; proceeded to break the law again by knowingly voting at the wrong precinct ; then lied about it repeatedly ; hired a former Bush attorney to protect her ; and even called her FBI ex-boyfriend to save her , when it looked like the Palm Beach County Sheriff might actually bring charges .

Over the weekend I learned that all of my current and future problems have been solved .
For example , I was worried about the cost of energy , but scientists recently figured out how to make gasoline out of plants .
Problem solved .
http://www.chemistrytimes.com/research/Money_Doesnt_Grow_on_Trees_But_Gasoline_Might.asp
With the energy problem solved , America will soon be able to leave the Middle East alone .
Cheap domestic energy will heal our aching economy and end any reason for International terrorism .
As a nifty side effect , this plant - to - gas technology has no carbon footprint .
So say goodbye to global warming .
Still , I was worried I might someday die of natural causes .
Apparently there was no need to worry , as I learned on 60 Minutes .
A guy with some pie tins and hot dogs discovered a cure for every type of cancer .
It will take a few years to perfect it , but I think I can hold on until then .

Cancer is n’t the only health problem I was worried about .
I might need a new heart someday .
As luck would have it , I will soon be able to grow a replacement in the lab .

Gamma radiation is the most penetrating and energetic form of nuclear radiation .
To absorb half the incoming Gamma you need two and a half inches of concrete or almost half an inch of lead .
So my eyebrows went up when I saw a press release for an organization called Radiation Shielding Technologies , or RST , selling protective clothing with this startling claim :
" DemronTM not only protects against particle ionizing / nuclear radiation ( such as Beta and Alpha ) , but does what NO OTHER full body radiation protection can do : shield against X - ray and low - energy Gamma emissions . "
This sounds like it merits either a Nobel Prize or an Ig Nobel , the award for bad science .
Check their site and you 'll find details of an independent test claiming that their anti-radiation blanket really does stop a significant fraction of gamma ( about 28 percent at a 90 degree angle ) .
What 's the secret ?
Well , the ' blanket ' involved is 30 inches by 36 and weighs 60 pounds …
So it 's basically equal to one - seventh of an inch of lead , and it works because it 's so dense .
I checked with RST , and research scientist James Bradshaw agrees :
*" You are correct in stating that in attenuation of gamma and x-ray radiation , cross-sectional density is the key parameter .
A number of other much more minor effects are also at play , such as the role a supporting matrix has in excepting ejected electrons , etc .
We do integrate heavy atomic absorbers into our material , though completely none toxic , that act as the primary attenuation component .
*
Our material meets or exceeds the absorption capabilities of lead by weight equivalent …
Certainly , when it comes to high energy radiation , you ca n’t beat fundamental physics , but luckily you can get away from using lead . "
The point of Demron is not that it has magical properties , but that it is more flexible and wearable than traditional lead - lined garments of the same weight ; that blanket they tested might be easier to get over a radiation source than a lead one .
But in spite of RST 's fulsome press releases ( including one which imaginatively likened the product to Iron Man 's armor ) , it 's not going to allow you to walk through heavily irradiated areas with impunity .
As with many companies in the defense field , their science is fine but their marketing department may be prone to exaggeration .

For decades the environmental movement has drafted the world ’s cutest and cuddliest mega fauna as symbols for their cause .
From the grizzly to the panda , bears have always been the top choice for environmental iconography .
In recent years environmental activists have enlisted the polar bear in their effort to take control of the U.S. economy on the grounds that global warming is destroying the bear ’s arctic habitat .
Now that the Interior Department has listed the polar bear as “ endangered ” pursuant to the Environmental Species Act ( ESA ) , however , libertarians who are serious about their intentions to bring the federal government to a screeching halt ought to consider adopting the bear .
Normally libertarians are not a litigious bunch , but if they are willing to adopt some new tactics , Section 7 of the ESA could provide them the tool they need to end federal government interference in the economy forever .
See the polar bear will be the first animal ever listed as endangered on a global warming theory .
Normally , species are listed due to harms to their habitat from local factors like logging , farming , or hospital building .
So when the Army wants to build a firing range to train troops to protect our country , environmentalists can sue to stop the activity since it will harm local endangered bird populations .
But global warming is just that : global .
Virtually every federal government action anywhere in the country can be connected to increased greenhouse gas emissions , which after all , are the cause of the destruction of the polar bear ’s habitat according to the Interior Department .
So you wanna stop the Agriculture Department from sending subsidy checks to millionaire farmers ?
Claim the increased emissions from transporting the crops to market will harm the polar bears and sue to stop them .
Wanna stop a new high way from being funded ?
Just point out the new traffic will increase emissions and ‘ presto ’ … no more high way .
Wanna end increases in Medicare spending ?
All you need to do is show that increased health care spending prolongs peoples lives who inevitably emit more carbon .
The possibilities are endless …..
Subpoena OK'd for Rove
Posted Friday , March 28 , 2008 7:07 am
Friday , March 28
WASHINGTON -- Senators joined the House on Thursday in approving subpoenas to force President Bush 's political adviser and other aides to testify about the firings of federal prosecutors .
While Sen. Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , is not budging from his insistence that Rove be questioned publicly and under oath , Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter offered President Bush a compromise .
Specter , who took the first step toward brokering a deal a few hours after the Senate Judiciary Committee approved but did not issue subpoenas for Rove and others , suggested that select lawmakers question Karl Rove and other administration officials in public , but not under oath .
White House counsel Fred Fielding promised to convey the offer to Bush , but Leahy does n't support the deal .
" I 've had a lot of those unstructured briefings and found that I was given , in many instances , not the whole truth , nothing near the whole truth , " said Leahy .
His committee , by voice vote Thursday , gave Leahy authority to issue subpoenas for Rove , former White House Counsel Harriet Miers and her deputy , William Kelley .
The House Judiciary Committee chairman , Rep. John Conyers , D - Mich. , was given that same authority a day earlier .
But neither chairman appeared in a rush to issue the subpoenas to White House officials and provoke a showdown .
Specter 's plan would grant one of Bush 's key demands -- that the officials named in the subpoena authorization testify without being sworn .
But the proposal dismisses other White House conditions by suggesting that Rove and the others testify in public .
" Mr. Fielding did not accept or reject it , " White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .

Presidential press secretary Tony Snow again cast the administration 's offer to allow Rove and the others to talk to lawmakers in private as the best deal Democrats are going to get .
" We opened with a compromise , " he told reporters .
In letters Thursday , Senate and House Democrats rejected Fielding 's offer to let Rove and other officials talk about their roles in the firings , but only on Bush 's terms : in private , off the record and not under oath .
" I have never heard the Senate take an ultimatum like that , " Leahy said .
" I know he 's the decider for the White House , " Leahy added , referring to Bush .
" But he 's not the decider for the United States Senate . "

Nonetheless , the offer stands , Perino said .
He suggested the committees could grant the president 's demand that his aides not be required to take an oath , but persuade the White House to allow public proceedings with perhaps 16 House and Senate Judiciary Committee members asking questions .
Taking an oath was not necessary , Specter said , because congressional witnesses are required by law to tell the truth .
Specter also said the situation might benefit from time .
" The dust has to settle first , " Specter said .
On that , Snow agreed : " We 're going to let this thing simmer a little bit and let people reflect on it . "

The developments came as Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , struggling to save his job from increasing calls for his resignation over the firings , promised to cooperate with Congress .
" I 'm not going to resign , " Gonzales told reporters after an event in St. Louis , the first of a series of meetings with federal prosecutors in coming days in an apparent attempt to patch up relations tattered by the scandal .
" No United States attorney was fired for improper reasons , " Gonzales said .
Rep. Paul Gillmor , R - Ohio , said Gonzales has become a " lightning rod " for criticism , joining a growing number of GOP lawmakers who want Gonzales out .
" It would be better for the president and the department if the attorney general were to step down , " Gillmor said .
Members of both parties want to know why the Justice Department fired eight well - regarded U.S. attorneys over the winter ; whether politicians pressured the prosecutors to rush corruption cases ; and whether the firings were punishments for the prosecutors ' balking at Bush administration priorities .
Lawmakers also want answers on whether the firings were to make way for more loyal Bush allies , as the White House has acknowledged doing in Arkansas .
The White House reaffirmed on Thursday there is nothing to show that Bush was aware of the plan for replacing the eight federal prosecutors .

NBC : Secretive DC prayer group has worldwide reach Nick Langewis and David Edwards
Published : Saturday April 5 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Who is Douglas Coe ?
" The most important religious leader you 've never seen or heard , " says NBC's Andrea Mitchell .
Coe , leader of a group called The Fellowship , is a powerful , secretive and well - connected religious leader , widely known among senators across the aisles , and across faiths ; but not by the general public .
Coe 's services have been attended by all three of the major 2008 presidential hopefuls : Senator Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) , Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) and Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) .
The Fellowship appears to be as much of a networking opportunity as it is a religious group , says Joshua Green , senior editor of The Atlantic Monthly .
" I think , in part , through her involvement with The Fellowship 's prayer group , " Green says , " [ Senator Hillary Clinton ] was able to meet a lot of these conservative Republican senators , get to know them on a one - on - one basis ... "
Jeff Sharlet , author of The Family , was disturbed by Coe 's teachings after spending time living among his followers .
Sometimes referring to themselves in jest as the " Christian Mafia , " Sharlet says , Fellowship members did n't seem to understand why he was concerned that Coe referenced such historical figures as Adolf Hitler , Vladimir Lenin and Chairman Mao in his teachings .
" Hitler 's genocide was n't really an issue for them , " says Sharlet .
" It was the strength that he emulated . "
People close to Clinton say Coe is not Clinton 's minister , she does not consider Coe to be a leading spiritual advisor , nor has she contributed to his group or ever been a member .
Coe mostly talks about Jesus , and invokes Hitler only as an example of how small groups can cultivate power for good or bad , said a close friend to NBC .
Coe declined to be interviewed for the segment .
The following video report was broadcast on NBC's Nightly News on April 3 , 2008 .

Legend of the Crystal Skulls Volume 61 Number 3 , May / June 2008 by Jane MacLaren Walsh
Along with superstars like Harrison Ford , Cate Blanchett , and Shia LaBeouf , the newest Indiana Jones movie promises to showcase one of the most enigmatic classes of artifacts known to archaeologists , crystal skulls that first surfaced in the 19th century and that specialists attributed to various " ancient Mesoamerican " cultures .
In this article , Smithsonian anthropologist Jane MacLaren Walsh shares her own adventures analyzing the artifacts that inspired Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ( in theaters May 22 ) , and details her efforts tracking down a mysterious " obtainer of rare antiquities " who may have held the key to the origin of these exotic objects .
In 1992 , this hollow rock - crystal skull was sent to the Smithsonian anonymously .
A letter accompanying the 30 - pound , 10 - inch - high artifact suggested it was of Aztec origin .

Sixteen years ago , a heavy package addressed to the nonexistent " Smithsonian Inst .
Curator , MezoAmerican Museum , Washington , D.C. " was delivered to the National Museum of American History .
It was accompanied by an unsigned letter stating : " This Aztec crystal skull , purported to be part of the Porfirio Díaz collection , was purchased in Mexico in 1960 .... I am offering it to the Smithsonian without consideration . "
Richard Ahlborn , then curator of the Hispanic - American collections , knew of my expertise in Mexican archaeology and called me to ask whether I knew anything about the object -- an eerie , milky - white crystal skull considerably larger than a human head .
I told him I knew of a life - sized crystal skull on display at the British Museum , and had seen a smaller version the Smithsonian had once exhibited as a fake .
After we spent a few minutes puzzling over the meaning and significance of this unusual artifact , he asked whether the department of anthropology would be interested in accepting it for the national collections .
I said yes without hesitation .
If the skull turned out to be a genuine pre-Columbian Mesoamerican artifact , such a rare object should definitely become part of the national collections .
I could n't have imagined then that this unsolicited donation would open an entirely new avenue of research for me .
In the years since the package arrived , my investigation of this single skull has led me to research the history of pre-Columbian collections in museums around the world , and I have collaborated with a broad range of international scientists and museum curators who have also crossed paths with crystal skulls .
Studying these artifacts has prompted new research into pre-Columbian lapidary ( or stone - working ) technology , particularly the carving of hard stones like jadeite and quartz .
Crystal skulls have undergone serious scholarly scrutiny , but they also excite the popular imagination because they seem so mysterious .
Theories about their origins abound .
Some believe the skulls are the handiwork of the Maya or Aztecs , but they have also become the subject of constant discussion on occult websites .
Some insist that they originated on a sunken continent or in a far - away galaxy .
And now they are poised to become archaeological superstars thanks to our celluloid colleague Indiana Jones , who will tackle the subject of our research in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull .
Details about the movie 's plot are being closely guarded by the film 's producers as I write this , but the Internet rumor mill has it that the crystal skull of the title is the creation of aliens .
These exotic carvings are usually attributed to pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures , but not a single crystal skull in a museum collection comes from a documented excavation , and they have little stylistic or technical relationship with any genuine pre-Columbian depictions of skulls , which are an important motif in Mesoamerican iconography .
They are intensely loved today by a large coterie of aging hippies and New Age devotees , but what is the truth behind the crystal skulls ?
Where did they come from , and why were they made ?
Museums began collecting rock - crystal skulls during the second half of the nineteenth century , when no scientific archaeological excavations had been undertaken in Mexico and knowledge of real pre-Columbian artifacts was scarce .
It was also a period that saw a burgeoning industry in faking pre-Columbian objects .
When Smithsonian archaeologist W. H. Holmes visited Mexico City in 1884 , he saw " relic shops " on every corner filled with fake ceramic vessels , whistles , and figurines .
Two years later , Holmes warned about the abundance of fake pre-Columbian artifacts in museum collections in an article for the journal Science titled " The Trade in Spurious Mexican Antiquities . "

The first Mexican crystal skulls made their debut just before the 1863 French intervention , when Louis Napoleon 's army invaded the country and installed Maximilian von Hapsburg of Austria as emperor .
Usually they are small , not taller than 1.5 inches .
The earliest specimen seems to be a British Museum crystal skull about an inch high that may have been acquired in 1856 by British banker Henry Christy .
Two other examples were exhibited in 1867 at the Exposition Universelle in Paris as part of the collection of Eugène Boban , perhaps the most mysterious figure in the history of the crystal skulls .
A Frenchman who served as the official " archaeologist " of the Mexican court of Maximilian , Boban was also a member of the French Scientific Commission in Mexico , whose work the Paris Exposition was designed to highlight .
( The exhibition was not entirely successful in showcasing Louis Napoleon 's second empire , since its opening coincided with the execution of Maximilian by the forces of Mexican president Benito Juárez . )
One small crystal skull was purchased in 1874 for 28 pesos by Mexico City 's national museum from the Mexican collector Luis Costantino , and another for 30 pesos in 1880 .
In 1886 , the Smithsonian bought a small crystal skull , this one from the collection of Augustin Fischer , who had been Emperor Maximilian 's secretary in Mexico .
But it disappeared mysteriously from the collection some time after 1973 .
It had been on display in an exhibit of archaeological fakes after William Foshag , a Smithsonian mineralogist , realized in the 1950s that it had been carved with a modern lapidary wheel .
In 1886 , the Smithsonian acquired a crystal skull that may have been a pre-Columbian bead re-carved in the 19th century .

These small objects represent the " first generation " of crystal skulls , and they are all drilled through from top to bottom .
The drill holes may in fact be pre-Columbian in origin , and the skulls may have been simple Mesoamerican quartz crystal beads , later re-carved for the European market as little mementos mori , or objects meant to remind their owners of the eventuality of death .
In my research into the provenance of crystal skulls , I kept encountering Boban 's name .
He arrived in Mexico in his teens and spent an idyllic youth conducting his own archaeological expeditions and collecting exotic birds .
Boban fell in love with Mexican culture -- becoming fluent in Spanish and Nahuatl , the Aztec language -- and began to make his living selling archaeological artifacts and natural history specimens through a family business in Mexico City .
After returning to France , he opened an antiquities shop in Paris in the 1870s and sold a large part of his original Mexican archaeological collection to Alphonse Pinart , a French explorer and ethnographer .
In 1878 , Pinart donated the collection , which included three crystal skulls , to the Trocadero , the precursor of the Musée de l'Homme .
Boban had acquired the third skull in the Pinart collection sometime after his return to Paris ; it is several times larger than any of the others from this early period , measuring about 4 inches high .
This skull , now in the Musée du Quai Branly , has a large hole drilled vertically through its center .
There is a comparable , though smaller , skull ( about 2.5 inches high ) in a private collection .
It serves as the base for a crucifix ; the somewhat larger Quai Branly skull may have had a similar use .
Macabre Obsession
The 19th century was a period of keen fascination with skulls and skeletons in Europe .
During the reign of Louis Napoleon ( 1852 -1870 ) , French artists created stereoscopic photographs , called Diableries , of miniature dioramas of skeletons at dress balls , libraries ( below ) , conferences with the devil , and in amorous trysts .
Wicked lampoons of corruption at Napoleon 's court , they illustrate how popular skeletal imagery was when the first crystal skulls made their appearance .

A second - generation skull - - life - size and without a vertical hole -- first appeared in 1881 in the Paris shop of none other than Boban .
This skull is just under 6 inches high .
The description in the catalogue he published provided no findspot for the object and it is listed separately from his Mexican antiquities .
Boban called it a " masterpiece " of lapidary technology , and noted that it was " unique in the world . "
Despite being one of a kind , the skull failed to sell , so when Boban returned to Mexico City in 1885 , after a 16 - year absence , he took it with him .
He exhibited it alongside a collection of actual human skulls in his shop , which he dubbed the " Museo Cientifico . "
According to local gossip , Boban tried to sell it to Mexico 's national museum as an Aztec artifact , in partnership with Leopoldo Batres , whose official government title was protector of pre-Hispanic monuments .
But the museum 's curator assumed the skull was a glass fake and refused to purchase it .
Then Batres denounced Boban as a fraud and accused him of smuggling antiquities .
In July 1886 , the French antiquarian moved his museum business and collection to New York City and later held an auction of several thousand archaeological artifacts , colonial Mexican manuscripts , and a large library of books .
Tiffany & Co. bought the crystal skull at this auction for $ 950 .
A decade later , Tiffany 's sold it to the British Museum for the original purchase price .
Interestingly , Boban 's 1886 catalogue for the New York auction lists yet another crystal skull .
Of the smaller variety , it is described as being from the " Valley of Mexico " and is listed with a crystal hand , which is described as Aztec .
Neither of these objects can now be accounted for .
A third generation of skulls appeared some time before 1934 , when Sidney Burney , a London art dealer , purchased a crystal skull of proportions almost identical to the specimen the British Museum bought from Tiffany's .
There is no information about where he got it , but it is very nearly a replica of the British Museum skull -- almost exactly the same shape , but with more detailed modeling of the eyes and the teeth .
It also has a separate mandible , which puts it in a class by itself .
In 1943 , it was sold at Sotheby 's in London to Frederick Arthur ( Mike ) Mitchell - Hedges , a well - to - do English deep - sea fisherman , explorer , and yarn - spinner extraordinaire .
Since the 1954 publication of Mitchell - Hedges 's memoir , Danger My Ally , this third - generation , twentieth - century skull has acquired a Maya origin , as well as a number of fantastic , Indiana Jones - like tall tales .
His adopted daughter , Anna Mitchell - Hedges , who died last year at the age of 100 , cared for it for 60 years , occasionally exhibiting the skull privately for a fee .
It is currently in the possession of her widower , but 10 nieces and nephews have also laid claim to it .
Known as the Skull of Doom , the Skull of Love , or simply the Mitchell - Hedges Skull , it is said to emit blue lights from its eyes , and has reputedly crashed computer hard drives .
Although nearly all of the crystal skulls have at times been identified as Aztec , Toltec , Mixtec , or occasionally Maya , they do not reflect the artistic or stylistic characteristics of any of these cultures .
The Aztec and Toltec versions of death heads were nearly always carved in basalt , occasionally were covered with stucco , and were probably all painted .
They were usually either attached to walls or altars , or depicted in bas reliefs of deities as ornaments worn on belts .
They are comparatively crudely carved , but are more naturalistic than the crystal skulls , particularly in the depiction of the teeth .
The Mixtec occasionally fabricated skulls in gold , but these representations are more precisely described as skull - like faces with intact eyes , noses , and ears .
The Maya also carved skulls , but in relief on limestone .
Often these skulls , depicted in profile , represent days of their calendars .
French and other European buyers imagined they were buying skillful pre-Columbian carvings , partially convinced perhaps by their own fascinated horror with Aztec human sacrifice .
But the Aztecs did n't hang crystal skulls around their necks .
Instead , they displayed the skulls of sacrificial victims on racks , impaling them horizontally through the sides ( the parietal - temporal region ) , not vertically .
I believe that all of the smaller crystal skulls that constitute the first generation of fakes were made in Mexico around the time they were sold , between 1856 and 1880 .
This 24 - year period may represent the output of a single artisan , or perhaps a single workshop .
The larger 1878 Paris skull seems to be some sort of transitional piece , as it follows the vertical drilling of the smaller pieces , but its size precludes it being a bead , or being worn in any way .
This skull now resides in the basement laboratories of the Louvre , and the Musée du Quai Branly has begun a program of scientific testing on the piece that will include advanced elemental analysis techniques like particle induced X - ray emission and Raman spectroscopy , so we may know more about its material and age in the near future .
South American Idol ?
In the opening scenes of Raiders of the Lost Ark ( 1981 ) , Indiana Jones is hot on the trail of an extremely valuable golden idol created by an unidentified ancient South American culture .
The goddess 's image , which Jones deftly snatches from an altar ( setting off a series of booby traps that culminate with an enormous boulder nearly crushing our hero ) , is of a woman in the act of giving birth .
The golden figure was modeled on a purportedly Aztec greenstone carving called Tlazolteotl , considered to be a masterpiece by the Dumbarton Oaks Museum in Washington , D.C .
In my research into the object 's acquisition history , I discovered that a Chinese dealer in Paris sold the figure in 1883 to a famous French mineralogist , Augustin Damour .
His friend , Eugene Boban , advised Damour on the purchase .
In examining the artifact 's iconography , I found that the birthing position is unknown in documented pre-Columbian artifacts or depictions in codices .
I have also used scanning electron microscopy to analyze the manufacture of the idol and have found there is ample evidence of the use of modern rotary cutting tools on the object 's surface .
In my opinion , the Tlazolteotl idol , like the crystal skulls , is a nineteenth - century fake .
The 1878 Paris skull and the Boban - Tiffany - British Museum skull that appeared in 1881 are perhaps nineteenth - century European inventions .
There is no direct tie to Mexico for either of these two larger skulls , except through Boban ; they simply appear in Paris long after his initial return from Mexico in 1869 .
The Mitchell - Hedges skull , which appears after 1934 , is a veritable copy of the British Museum skull , with stylistic and technical flourishes that only an accomplished faker would devise .
In fact , in 1936 British Museum scholar Adrian Digby first raised the possibility that the Mitchell - Hedges skull could be a copy of the British Museum skull since it showed " a perverted ingenuity such as one would expect to find in a forger . "
However , Digby , then a young curator , did not suggest it was a modern forgery and also dismissed the possibility that his museum 's own crystal skull was a fraud , as early twentieth - century microscopic examination did not reveal the presence of modern tool marks .
The skull that arrived at the Smithsonian 16 years ago represents yet another generation of these hoaxes .
According to its anonymous donor , it was purchased in Mexico in 1960 , and its size perhaps reflects the exuberance of the time .
In comparison with the original nineteenth - century skulls , the Smithsonian skull is enormous ; at 31 pounds and nearly 10 inches high , it dwarfs all others .
I believe it was probably manufactured in Mexico shortly before it was sold .
( The skull is now part of the Smithsonian 's national collections and even has its own catalogue number : 409954 .
At the moment it is stored in a locked cabinet in my office . )
There are now fifth - and probably sixth - generation skulls , and I have been asked to examine quite a number of them .
Collectors have brought me skulls purportedly from Mexico , Guatemala , Brazil , and even Tibet .
Some of these " crystal " skulls have turned out to be glass ; a few are made of resin .
British Museum scientist Margaret Sax and I examined the British Museum and Smithsonian skulls under light and scanning electron microscope and conclusively determined that they were carved with relatively modern lapidary equipment , which were unavailable to pre-Columbian Mesoamerican carvers .
( A preliminary report on our research is on the British Museum website , www.britishmuseum.ac.uk/compass).
So why have crystal skulls had such a long and successful run , and why do some museums continue to exhibit them , despite their lack of archaeological context and obvious iconographic , stylistic , and technical problems ?
Though the British Museum exhibits its skulls as examples of fakes , others still offer them up as the genuine article .
Mexico 's national museum , for example , identifies its skulls as the work of Aztec and Mixtec artisans .
Perhaps it is because , like the Indiana Jones movies , these macabre objects are reliable crowd - pleasers .
Impressed by their technical excellence and gleaming polish , generations of museum curators and private collectors have been taken in by these objects .
But they are too good to be true .
If we consider that pre-Columbian lapidaries used stone , bone , wooden , and possibly copper tools with abrasive sand to carve stone , crystal skulls are much too perfectly carved and highly polished to be believed .
Ultimately , the truth behind the skulls may have gone to the grave with Boban , a masterful dealer of many thousands of pre-Columbian artifacts -- including at least five different crystal skulls - - now safely ensconced in museums worldwide .
He managed to confound a great many people for a very long time and has left an intriguing legacy , one that continues to puzzle us a century after his death .
Boban confidently sold museums and private collectors some of the most intriguing fakes known , and perhaps many more yet to be recognized .
It sounds like a great premise for a movie .

The " hard problem " of consciousness , according to which scientific models cannot explain the " qualia " or " first order experiences " , is misguided if it is used to imply that we need more than structures and functions to explain conscious experience
We believe that this approach is essential misguided .
If the hypothetical zombie behaves in all respects indistinguishably from a person with consciousness , then the principle of the identity of the indistinguishables would force us to conclude that the " zombie " has consciousness .
How else would we know that the people around us are n't zombies ?
We assume they have conscious experience similar to ourselves because they behave in all other respects similar to us .
But if you would take this reasoning seriously , then you might start to get nightmarish fantasies in which you are the only real , conscious person in the world , and all the others are merely sophisticated automatons that pretend to be like you .
What we do agree with is that " first - person experience " is essentially different from " third - person experience " .
Every cybernetic agent complex enough to be capable of learning will develop an essentially unique experience .
No language or formalism is powerful enough to capture this experience fully .
Although we may have used certain formal languages to program our cybernetic agent - robot , once the robot has become capable of learning , its program will change in myriads of ways that are impossible to control or predict .
If we could predict the robot 's developments , this would merely mean that we have done a poor job of design , producing a creature that lacks the creativity and flexibility to adapt to really novel situations .
Moreover , even for the most simple cybernetic agents , sensations , though perhaps not unique , are intrinsically subjective or affective .
Agents do not sense the world as if they were impersonal , objective bystanders , that try to internally represent the world as it is , independently of themselves .
For an agent a sensation is meaningful only to the degree that it relates to the agent 's goals , which , in practice , means that it is relevant to the agent 's individual survival .
Thus , all sensation or awareness is from the beginning subjective or " first - person " : it is directly connected to the " I " , the " self " , and only indirectly to the world outside .
A cybernetic system is defined by its relations , both the internal relations that determine its organization , and the external relations it has with its environment .
Consciousness emerges from this network of relations , and not from the " objective " , material components out of which the agent is built .
What matters is not whether the robot is made from flesh and blood or from silicon chips , but how the robot 's different sensations , goals , memories and actions are interrelated so as to produce an autonomous agent .
Consciousness is not some mysterious substance , fluid , or property of matter , but a level of organization emerging from abstract processes and relations .
People who search for consciousness in elementary particles ( a form of panpsychism that has been suggested as a way to tackle the " hard problem " ) , because they cannot otherwise explain where the consciousness in our brain comes from , are misguided .
Their intuition may be correct insofar that particles , just like any other system , should be seen as relations rather than just as clumps of matter .
But to attribute consciousness to these extremely simple types of relations is merely a way to evade the really hard , but solvable , problem of reconstructing the complex cybernetic organization of the human mind in all its details and subtleties .
Tata has huge ambitions
Aiming to enable more people in India and other developing nations to move up from two wheels to four , it will sell for 100,000 rupees or $ 2,500 ( £ 1,277 ) .
While exact details and even its name are still unknown , the vehicle , dubbed the " People 's Car " , is expected to have four seats and a 0.6 litre engine .
Although it seems a world apart from luxury Western cars , Tata is currently in talks to buy Jaguar and Land Rover .
Soaring sales
Tata's $ 2,500 car is being unveiled at the New Delhi motor show .
The product has rightfully gained a lot of international attention
Mohit Arora of JD Power Asia - Pacific
Its release comes as India 's domestic car market is predicted to soar in the coming years on the back of the country 's fast - growing economy and increased consumer wealth .
Indian car sales are predicted to more than quadruple to $ 145bn by 2016 .
Western firms such as Volkswagen and Ford are also rushing to increase their presence in India , as it represents a giant untapped market .
At present just seven people per 1,000 own a car in India , compared to 550 per 1,000 in Germany , or 476 per 1,000 in France .
" The product has rightfully gained a lot of international attention , " said motoring analyst Mohit Arora of JD Power Asia -Pacific .
" It 's a big , big deal for Tata Motors , and will be recorded in history books , whether or not it does well . "
At the start of this year , US car giant Ford announced that Tata would be the likely buyer of its UK - based Jaguar and Land Rover luxury brands , reflecting the Indian company 's global ambitions .
This post is all about speculative compilation , or just speculation for short , in the context of the JavaScriptCore virtual machine .
Speculative compilation is ideal for making dynamic languages , or any language with enough dynamic features , run faster .
In this post , we will look at speculation for JavaScript .
Historically , this technique or closely related variants has been applied successfully to Smalltalk , Self , Java , . NET , Python , and Ruby , among others .
Starting in the 90’s , intense benchmark - driven competition between many Java implementations helped to create an understanding of how to build speculative compilers for languages with small amounts of dynamism .
Despite being a lot more dynamic than Java , the JavaScript performance war that started in the naughts has generally favored increasingly aggressive applications of the same speculative compilation tricks that worked great for Java .
It seems like speculation can be applied to any language implementation that uses runtime checks that are hard to reason about statically .
This is a long post that tries to demystify a complex topic .
It ’s based on a two hour compiler lecture ( slides also available in PDF ) .
We assume some familiarity with compiler concepts like intermediate representations ( especially Static Single Assignment Form , or SSA for short ) , static analysis , and code generation .
The intended audience is anyone wanting to understand JavaScriptCore better , or anyone thinking about using these techniques to speed up their own language implementation .
Most of the concepts described in this post are not specific to JavaScript and this post does n’t assume prior knowledge about JavaScriptCore .
Before going into the details of speculation , we ’ll provide an overview of speculation and an overview of JavaScriptCore .
This will help provide context for the main part of this post , which describes speculation by breaking it down into five parts : bytecode ( the common IR ) , control , profiling , compilation , and OSR ( on stack replacement ) .
We conclude with a small review of related work .
Overview of Speculation
The intuition behind speculation is to leverage traditional compiler technology to make dynamic languages as fast as possible .
Construction of high - performance compilers is a well - understood art , so we want to reuse as much of that as we can .
But we cannot do this directly for a language like JavaScript because the lack of type information means that the compiler ca n’t do meaningful optimizations for any of the fundamental operations ( even things like + or == ) .
Speculative compilers use profiling to infer types dynamically .
The generated code uses dynamic type checks to validate the profiled types .
If the program uses a type that is different from what we profiled , we throw out the optimized code and try again .
This lets the optimizing compiler work with a statically typed representation of the dynamically typed program .
Types are a major theme of this post even though the techniques we are describing are for implementing dynamically typed languages .
When languages include static types , it can be to provide safety properties for the programmer or to help give an optimizing compiler leverage .
We are only interested in types for performance and the speculation strategy in JavaScriptCore can be thought of in broad strokes as inferring the kinds of types that a C program would have , but using an internal type system purpose built for our optimizing compiler .
More generally , the techniques described in this post can be used to enable any kind of profile - guided optimizations , including ones that are n’t related to types .
But both this post and JavaScriptCore focus on the kind of profiling and speculation that is most natural to think if as being about type ( whether a variable is an integer , what object shapes a pointer points to , whether an operation has effects , etc ) .
To dive into this a bit deeper , we first consider the impact of types .
Then we look at how speculation gives us types .
Impact of Types
We want to give dynamically typed languages the kind of optimizing compiler pipeline that would usually be found in ahead - of - time compilers for high - performance statically typed languages like C .
The input to such an optimizer is typically some kind of internal representation ( IR ) that is precise about the type of each operation , or at least a representation from which the type of each operation can be inferred .
To understand the impact of types and how speculative compilers deal with them , consider this C function :
int foo( int a , int b ) { return a + b ; }
In C , types like int are used to describe variables , arguments , return values , etc .
Before the optimizing compiler has a chance to take a crack at the above function , a type checker fills in the blanks so that the + operation will be represented using an IR instruction that knows that it is adding 32 - bit signed integers ( i.e. int s ) .
This knowledge is essential :
Type information tells the compiler ’s code generator how to emit code for this instruction .
We know to use integer addition instructions ( not double addition or something else ) because of the int type .
type .
Type information tells the optimizer how to allocate registers for the inputs and outputs .
Integers mean using general purpose registers .
Floating point means using floating point registers .
Type information tells the optimizer what optimizations are possible for this instruction .
Knowing exactly what it does allows us to know what other operations can be used in place of it , allows us to do some algebraic reasoning about the math the program is doing , and allows us to fold the instruction to a constant if the inputs are constants .
If there are types for which + has effects ( like in C++ ) , then the fact that this is an integer + means that it ’s pure .
Lots of compiler optimizations that work for + would not work if it was n’t pure .
Now consider the same program in JavaScript :
function foo( a , b ) { return a + b ; }
We no longer have the luxury of types .
The program does n’t tell us the types of a or b .
There is no way that a type checker can label the + operation as being anything specific .
It can do a bunch of different things based on the runtime types of a and b :
It might be a 32 - bit integer addition .
It might be a double addition .
It might be a string concatenation .
It might be a loop with method calls .
Those methods can be user - defined and may perform arbitrary effects .
This ’ll happen if a or b are objects .
Branch
if
Figure 1 .
The best that a nonspeculative compiler can do if given a JavaScript plus operation .
This figure depicts a control flow graph as a compiler like JavaScriptCore ’s DFG might see .
Theoperation is like anand has outgoing edges for the then / else outcomes of the condition .
Based on this , it ’s not possible for an optimizer to know what to do .
Instruction selection means emitting either a function call for the whole thing or an expensive control flow subgraph to handle all of the various cases ( Figure 1 ) .
We wo n’t know which register file is best for the inputs or results ; we ’re likely to go with general purpose registers and then do additional move instructions to get the data into floating point registers in case we have to do a double addition .
It ’s not possible to know if one addition produces the same results as another , since they have loops with effectful method calls .
Anytime a + happens we have to allow for the the possibility that the whole heap might have been mutated .
In short , it ’s not practical to use optimizing compilers for JavaScript unless we can somehow provide types for all of the values and operations .
For those types to be useful , they need to help us avoid basic operations like + seeming like they require control flow or effects .
They also need to help us understand which instructions or register files to use .
Speculative compilers get speed - ups by applying this kind of reasoning to all of the dynamic operations in a language — ranging from those represented as fundamental operations ( like + or memory accesses like o.f and o[ i ] ) to those that involve intrinsics or recognizable code patterns ( like calling Function.prototype.apply ) .
Speculated Types
This post focuses on those speculations where the collected information can be most naturally understood as type information , like whether or not a variable is an integer and what properties a pointed - to object has ( and in what order ) .
Let ’s appreciate two aspects of this more deeply : when and how the profiling and optimization happen and what it means to speculate on type .
Figure 2 . Optimizing compilers for C and JavaScript .
Let ’s consider what we mean by speculative compilation for JavaScript .
JavaScript implementations pretend to be interpreters ; they accept JS source as input .
But internally , these implementations use a combination of interpreters and compilers .
Initially , code starts out running in an execution engine that does no speculative type - based optimizations but collects profiling about types .
This is usually an interpreter , but not always .
Once a function has a satisfactory amount of profiling , the engine will start an optimizing compiler for that function .
The optimizing compiler is based on the same fundamentals as the one found in a C compiler , but instead of accepting types from a type checker and running as a command - line tool , here it accepts types from a profiler and runs in a thread in the same process as the program it ’s compiling .
Once that compiler finishes emitting optimized machine code , we switch execution of that function from the profiling tier to the optimized tier .
Running JavaScript code has no way of observing this happening to itself except if it measures execution time .
( However , the environment we use for testing JavaScriptCore includes many hooks for introspecting what has been compiled . )
Figure 2 illustrates how and when profiling and optimization happens when running JavaScript .
Roughly , speculative compilation means that our example function will be transformed to look something like this :
function foo( a , b ) { speculate ( isInt32 ( a ) ) ; speculate ( isInt32 ( b ) ) ; return a + b ; }
The tricky thing is what exactly it means to speculate .
One simple option is what we call diamond speculation .
This means that every time that we perform an operation , we have a fast path specialized for what the profiler told us and a slow path to handle the generic case :
if ( is int ) int add else Call ( slow path )
To see how that plays out , let ’s consider a slightly different example :
var tmp1 = x + 42 ; ... // things var tmp2 = x + 100 ;
Here , we use x twice , both times adding it to a known integer .
Let ’s say that the profiler tells us that x is an integer but that we have no way of proving this statically .
Let ’s also say that x ‘s value does not change between the two uses and we have proved that statically .
x
Figure 3 . Diamond speculation thatis an integer .
Figure 3 shows what happens if we speculate on the fact that x is an integer using a diamond speculation : we get a fast path that does the integer addition and a slow path that bails out to a helper function .
Speculations like this can produce modest speed - ups at modest cost .
The cost is modest because if the speculation is wrong , only the operations on x pay the price .
The trouble with this approach is that repeated uses of x must recheck whether it is an integer .
The rechecking is necessary because of the control flow merge that happens at the things block and again at more things .
The original solution to this problem was splitting , where the region of the program between things and more things would get duplicated to avoid the branch .
An extreme version of this is tracing , where the entire remainder of a function is duplicated after any branch .
The trouble with these techniques is that duplicating code is expensive .
We want to minimize the number of times that the same piece of code is compiled so that we can compile a lot of code quickly .
The closest thing to splitting that JavaScriptCore does is tail duplication , which optimizes diamond speculations by duplicating the code between them if that code is tiny .
A better alternative to diamond speculations or splitting is OSR ( on stack replacement ) .
When using OSR , a failing type check exits out of the optimized function back to the equivalent point in the unoptimized code ( i.e. the profiling tier ’s version of the function ) .
x
Figure 4 . OSR speculation thatis an integer .
Figure 4 shows what happens when we speculate that x is an integer using OSR .
Because there is no control flow merge between the case where x is an int and the case where it is n’t , the second check becomes redundant and can be eliminated .
The lack of a merge means that the only way to reach the second check is if the first check passed .
OSR speculations are what gives our traditional optimizing compiler its static types .
After any OSR - based type check , the compiler can assume that the property that was checked is now fact .
Moreover , because OSR check failure does not affect semantics ( we exit to the same point in the same code , just with fewer optimizations ) , we can hoist those checks as high as we want and infer that a variable always has some type simply by guarding all assignments to it with the corresponding type check .
Note that what we call OSR exit in this post and in JavaScriptCore is usually called deoptimization elsewhere .
We prefer to use the term OSR exit in our codebase because it emphasizes that the point is to exit an optimized function using an exotic technique ( OSR ) .
The term deoptimization makes it seem like we are undoing optimization , which is only true in the narrow sense that a particular execution jumps from optimized code to unoptimized code .
For this post we will follow the JavaScriptCore jargon .
JavaScriptCore uses OSR or diamond speculations depending on our confidence that the speculation will be right .
OSR speculation has higher benefit and higher cost : the benefit is higher because repeated checks can be eliminated but the cost is also higher because OSR is more expensive than calling a helper function .
However , the cost is only paid if the exit actually happens .
The benefits of OSR speculation are so superior that we focus on that as our main speculation strategy , with diamond speculation being the fallback if our profiling indicates lack of confidence in the speculation .
Figure 5 . Speculating with OSR and exiting to bytecode .
OSR - based speculation relies on the fact that traditional compilers are already good at reasoning about side exits .
Trapping instructions ( like for null check optimization in Java virtual machines ) , exceptions , and multiple return statements are all examples of how compilers already support exiting from a function .
Assuming that we use bytecode as the common language shared between the unoptimizing profiled tier of execution and the optimizing tier , the exit destinations can just be bytecode instruction boundaries .
Figure 5 shows how this might work .
The machine code generated by the optimizing compiler contains speculation checks against unlikely conditions .
The idea is to do lots of speculations .
For example , the prologue ( the enter instruction in the figure ) may speculate about the types of the arguments — that ’s one speculation per argument .
An add instruction may speculate about the types of its inputs and about the result not overflowing .
Our type profiling may tell us that some variable tends to always have some type , so a mov instruction whose source is not proved to have that type may speculate that the value has that type at runtime .
Accessing an array element ( what we call get_by_val ) may speculate that the array is really an array , that the index is an integer , that the index is in bounds , and that the value at the index is not a hole ( in JavaScript , loading from a never assigned array element means walking the array ’s prototype chain to see if the element can be found there — something we avoid doing most of the time by speculating that we do n’t have to ) .
Calling a function may speculate that the callee is the one we expected or at least that it has the appropriate type ( that it ’s something we can call ) .
While exiting out of a function is straightforward without breaking fundamental assumptions in optimizing compilers , entering turns out to be super hard .
Entering into a function somewhere other than at its primary entrypoint pessimises optimizations at any merge points between entrypoints .
If we allowed entering at every bytecode instruction boundary , this would negate the benefits of OSR exit by forcing every instruction boundary to make worst - case assumptions about type .
Even allowing OSR entry just at loop headers would break lots of loop optimizations .
This means that it ’s generally not possible to reenter optimized execution after exiting .
We only support entry in cases where the reward is high , like when our profiler tells us that a loop has not yet terminated at the time of compilation .
Put simply , the fact that traditional compilers are designed for single - entry multiple - exit procedures means that OSR entry is hard but OSR exit is easy .
JavaScriptCore and most speculative compilers support OSR entry at hot loops , but since it ’s not an essential feature for most applications , we ’ll leave understanding how we do it as an exercise for the reader .
Figure 6 . Speculation broken into the five topics of this post .
The main part of this post describes speculation in terms of its five components ( Figure 6 ) : the bytecode , or common IR , of the virtual machine that allows for a shared understanding about the meaning of profiling and exit sites between the unoptimized profiling tier and the optimizing tier ; the unoptimized profiling tier that is used to execute functions at start - up , collect profiling about them , and to serve as an exit destination ; the control system for deciding when to invoke the optimizing compiler ; the optimizing tier that combines a traditional optimizing compiler with enhancements to support speculation based on profiling ; and the OSR exit technology that allows the optimizing compiler to use the profiling tier as an exit destination when speculation checks fail .
Overview of JavaScriptCore
Figure 7 .
The tiers of JavaScriptCore .
JavaScriptCore embraces the idea of tiering and has four tiers for JavaScript ( and three tiers for WebAssembly , but that ’s outside the scope of this post ) .
Tiering has two benefits : the primary benefit , described in the previous section , of enabling speculation ; and a secondary benefit of allowing us to fine - tune the throughput - latency tradeoff on a per-function basis .
Some functions run for so short — like straight - line run-once initialization code — that running any compiler on those functions would be more expensive than interpreting them .
Some functions get invoked so frequently , or have such long loops , that their total execution time far exceeds the time to compile them with an aggressive optimizing compiler .
But there are also lots of functions in the grey area in between : they run for not enough time to make an aggressive compiler profitable , but long enough that some intermediate compiler designs can provide speed - ups .
JavaScriptCore has four tiers as shown in Figure 7 :
The LLInt , or low - level interpreter , which is an interpreter that obeys JIT compiler ABI .
It runs on the same stack as the JITs and uses a known set of registers and stack locations for its internal state .
The Baseline JIT , also known as a bytecode template JIT , which emits a template of machine code for each bytecode instruction without trying to reason about relationships between multiple instructions in the function .
It compiles whole functions , which makes it a method JIT .
Baseline does no OSR speculations but does have a handful of diamond speculations based on profiling from the LLInt .
The DFG JIT , or data flow graph JIT , which does OSR speculation based on profiling from the LLInt , Baseline , and in some rare cases even using profiling data collected by the DFG JIT and FTL JIT .
It may OSR exit to either baseline or LLInt .
The DFG has a compiler IR called DFG IR , which allows for sophisticated reasoning about speculation .
The DFG avoids doing expensive optimizations and makes many compromises to enable fast code generation .
The FTL JIT , or faster than light JIT , which does comprehensive compiler optimizations .
It ’s designed for peak throughput .
The FTL never compromises on throughput to improve compile times .
This JIT reuses most of the DFG JIT ’s optimizations and adds lots more .
The FTL JIT uses multiple IRs ( DFG IR , DFG SSA IR , B3 IR , and Assembly IR ) .
An ideal example of this in action is this program :
" use strict " ; let result = 0 ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < 10000000 ; ++i ) { let o = {f : i} ; result += o.f ; } print ( result ) ;
Thanks to the object allocation inside the loop , it will run for a long time until the FTL JIT can compile it .
The FTL JIT will kill that allocation , so then the loop finishes quickly .
The long running time before optimization virtually guarantees that the FTL JIT will take a stab at this program ’s global function .
Additionally , because the function is clean and simple , all of our speculations are right and there are no OSR exits .
Figure 8 . Example timeline of a simple long loop executing in JavaScriptCore .
Execution times recorded on my computer one day .
Figure 8 shows the timeline of this benchmark executing in JavaScriptCore .
The program starts executing in the LLInt .
After about a thousand loop iterations , the loop trigger causes us to start a baseline compiler thread for this code .
Once that finishes , we do an OSR entry into the baseline JITed code at the for loop ’s header .
The baseline JIT also counts loop iterations , and after about a thousand more , we spawn the DFG compiler .
The process repeats until we are in the FTL .
When I measured this , I found that the DFG compiler needs about 4 × the time of the baseline compiler , and the FTL needs about 6 × the time of the DFG .
While this example is contrived and ideal , the basic idea holds for any JavaScript program that runs long enough since all tiers of JavaScriptCore support the full JavaScript language .
Figure 9 . JavaScriptCore tier architecture .
JavaScriptCore is architected so that having many tiers is practical .
Figure 9 illustrates this architecture .
All tiers share the same bytecode as input .
That bytecode is generated by a compiler pipeline that desugars many language features , such as generators and classes , among others .
In many cases , it ’s possible to add new language features just by modifying the bytecode generation frontend .
Once linked , the bytecode can be understood by any of the tiers .
The bytecode can be interpreted by the LLInt directly or compiled with the baseline JIT , which mostly just converts each bytecode instruction into a preset template of machine code .
The LLInt and Baseline JIT share a lot of code , mostly in the slow paths of bytecode instruction execution .
The DFG JIT converts bytecode to its own IR , the DFG IR , and optimizes it before emitting code .
In many cases , operations that the DFG chooses not to speculate on are emitted using the same code generation helpers as the Baseline JIT .
Even operations that the DFG does speculate on often share slow paths with the Baseline JIT .
The FTL JIT reuses the DFG ’s compiler pipeline and adds new optimizations to it , including multiple new IRs that have their own optimization pipelines .
Despite being more sophisticated than the DFG or Baseline , the FTL JIT shares slow path implementations with those JITs and in some cases even shares code generation for operations that we choose not to speculate on .
Even though the various tiers try to share code whenever possible , they are n’t required to .
Take the get_by_val ( access an array element ) instruction in bytecode .
This has duplicate definitions in the bytecode liveness analysis ( which knows the liveness rules for get_by_val ) , the LLInt ( which has a very large implementation that switches on a bunch of the common array types and has good code for all of them ) , the Baseline ( which uses a polymorphic inline cache ) , and the DFG bytecode parser .
The DFG bytecode parser converts get_by_val to the DFG IR GetByVal operation , which has separate definitions in the DFG and FTL backends as well as in a bunch of phases that know how to optimize and model GetByVal .
The only thing that keeps those implementations in agreement is good convention and extensive testing .
To give a feeling for the relative throughput of the various tiers , I ’ll share some informal performance data that I ’ve gathered over the years out of curiosity .
Figure 10 .
Relative performance of the four tiers on JetStream 2 on my computer at the time of that benchmark ’s introduction .
We ’re going to use the JetStream 2 benchmark suite since that ’s the main suite that JavaScriptCore is tuned for .
Let ’s first consider an experiment where we run JetStream 2 with the tiers progressively enabled starting with the LLInt .
Figure 10 shows the results : the Baseline and DFG are more than 2× better than the tier below them and the FTL is 1.1× better than the DFG .
The FTL ’s benefits may be modest but they are unique .
If we did not have the FTL , we would have no way of achieving the same peak throughput .
A great example is the gaussian - blur subtest .
This is the kind of compute test that the FTL is built for .
I managed to measure the benchmark ’s performance when we first introduced it and did not yet have a chance to tune for it .
So , this gives a glimpse of the speed - ups that we expect to see from our tiers for code that has n’t yet been through the benchmark tuning grind .
Figure 11 shows the results .
All of the JITs achieve spectacular speed - ups : Baseline is 3 × faster than LLInt , DFG is 6 × faster than Baseline , and FTL is 1.6× faster than DFG .
Figure 11 .
Relative performance of the four tiers on the guassian - blur subtest of JetStream 2 .
The DFG and FTL complement one another .
The DFG is designed to be a fast - running compiler and it achieves this by excluding the most aggressive optimizations , like global register allocation , escape analysis , loop optimizations , or anything that needs SSA .
This means that the DFG will always get crushed on peak throughput by compilers that have those features .
It ’s the FTL ’s job to provide those optimizations if a function runs long enough to warrant it .
This ensures that there is no scenario where a hypothetical competing implementation could outperform us unless they had the same number of tiers .
If you wanted to make a compiler that compiles faster than the FTL then you ’d lose on peak throughput , but if you wanted to make a compiler that generates better code than the DFG then you ’d get crushed on start - up times .
You need both to stay in the game .
Another way of looking at the performance of these tiers is to ask : how much time does a bytecode instruction take to execute in each of the tiers on average ?
This tells us just about the throughput that a tier achieves without considering start - up at all .
This can be hard to estimate , but I made an attempt at it by repeatedly running each JetStream 2 benchmark and having it limit the maximum tier of each function at random .
Then I employed a stochastic counting mechanism to get an estimate of the number of bytecode instructions executed at each tier in each run .
Combined with the execution times of those runs , this gave a simple linear regression problem of the form :
ExecutionTime = ( Latency of LLInt ) * ( Bytecodes in LLInt ) + ( Latency of Baseline ) * ( Bytecodes in Baseline ) + ( Latency of DFG ) * ( Bytecodes in DFG ) + ( Latency of FTL ) * ( Bytecodes in FTL )
Where the Latency of LLInt means the average amount of time it takes to execute a bytecode instruction in LLInt .
After excluding benchmarks that spent most of their time outside JavaScript execution ( like regexp and wasm benchmarks ) and fiddling with how to weight benchmarks ( I settled on solving each benchmarks separately and computing geomean of the coefficients since this matches JetStream 2 weighting ) , the solution I arrived at was :
Execution Time = ( 3.97 ns ) * ( Bytecodes in LLInt ) + ( 1.71 ns ) * ( Bytecodes in Baseline ) + ( .349 ns ) * ( Bytecodes in DFG ) + ( .225 ns ) * ( Bytecodes in FTL )
In other words , Baseline executes code about 2 × faster than LLInt , DFG executes code about 5 × faster than Baseline , and the FTL executes code about 1.5× faster than DFG .
Note how this data is in the same ballpark as what we saw for gaussian - blur .
That makes sense since that was a peak throughput benchmark .
Although this is n’t a garbage collection blog post , it ’s worth understanding a bit about how the garbage collector works .
JavaScriptCore picks a garbage collection strategy that makes the rest of the virtual machine , including all of the support for speculation , easier to implement .
The garbage collector has the following features that make speculation easier :
The collector scans the stack conservatively .
This means that compilers do n’t have to worry about how to report pointers to the collector .
The collector does n’t move objects .
This means that if a data structure ( like the compiler IR ) has many possible ways of referencing some object , we only have to report one of them to the collector .
The collector runs to fixpoint .
This makes it possible to invent precise rules for whether objects created by speculation should be kept alive .
The collector ’s object model is expressed in C++. JavaScript objects look like C++ objects , and JS object pointers look like C++ pointers .
These features make the compiler and runtime easier to write , which is great , since speculation requires us to write a lot of compiler and runtime code .
JavaScript is a slow enough language even with the optimizations we describe in this post that garbage collector performance is rarely the longest pole in the tent .
Therefore , our garbage collector makes many tradeoffs to make it easier to work on the performance - critical parts of our engine ( like speculation ) .
It would be unwise , for example , to make it harder to implement some compiler optimization as a way of getting a small garbage collector optimization , since the compiler has a bigger impact on performance for typical JavaScript programs .
To summarize : JavaScriptCore has four tiers , two of which do speculative optimizations , and all of which participate in the collection of profiling .
The first two tiers are an interpreter and bytecode template JIT while the last two are optimizing compilers tuned for different throughput - latency trade - offs .
Speculative Compilation
Now that we ’ve established some basic background about speculation and JavaScriptCore , this section goes into the details .
First we will discuss JavaScriptCore ’s bytecode .
Then we show the control system for launching the optimizing compiler .
Next will be a detailed section about how JavaScriptCore ’s profiling tiers work , which focuses mostly on how they collect profiling .
Finally we discuss JavaScriptCore ’s optimizing compilers and their approach to OSR .
Bytecode
Speculation requires having a profiling tier and an optimizing tier .
When the profiling tier reports profiling , it needs to be able to say what part of the code that profiling is for .
When the optimizing compiler wishes to compile an OSR exit , it needs to be able to identify the exit site in a way that both tiers understand .
To solve both issues , we need a common IR that is :
Used by all tiers as input .
Persistent for as long as the function that it represents is still live .
Immutable ( at least for those parts that all tiers are interested in ) .
In this post , we will use bytecode as the common IR .
This is n’t required ; abstract syntax trees or even SSA could work as a common IR .
We offer some insights into how we designed our bytecode for JavaScriptCore .
JavaScriptCore ’s bytecode is register - based , compact , untyped , high - level , directly interpretable , and transformable .
Our bytecode is register - based in the sense that operations tend to be written as :
add result , left , right
Which is taken to mean :
result = left + right
Where result , left , and right are virtual registers .
Virtual registers may refer to locals , arguments , or constants in the constant pool .
Functions declare how many locals they need .
Locals are used both for named variables ( like var , let , or const variables ) and temporaries arising from expression tree evaluation .
Our bytecode is compact : each opcode and operand is usually encoded as one byte .
We have wide prefixes to allow 16 - bit or 32 - bit operands .
This is important since JavaScript programs can be large and the bytecode must persist for as long as the function it represents is still live .
Our bytecode is untyped .
Virtual registers never have static type .
Opcodes generally do n’t have static type except for the few opcodes that have a meaningful type guarantee on their output ( for example , the | operator always returns int32 , so our bitor opcode returns int32 ) .
This is important since the bytecode is meant to be a common source of truth for all tiers .
The profiling tier runs before we have done type inference , so the bytecode can’t have any more types than the JavaScript language .
Our bytecode is almost as high - level as JavaScript .
While we use desugaring for many JavaScript features , we only do that when implementation by desugaring is n’t thought to cost performance .
So , even the “ fundamental ” features of our bytecode are high level .
For example , the add opcode has all of the power of the JavaScript + operator , including that it might mean a loop with effects .
Our bytecode is directly interpretable .
The same bytecode stream that the interpreter executes is the bytecode stream that we will save in the cache ( to skip parsing later ) and feed to the compiler tiers .
Finally , our bytecode is transformable .
Normally , intermediate representations use a control flow graph and make it easy to insert and remove instructions .
That ’s not how bytecode works : it ’s an array of instructions encoded using a nontrivial variable - width encoding .
But we do have a bytecode editing API and we use it for generatorification ( our generator desugaring bytecode - to - bytecode pass ) .
We can imagine this facility also being useful for other desugarings or for experimenting with bytecode instrumentation .
Compared to non-bytecode IRs , the main advantages of bytecode are that it ’s easy to :
Identify targets for OSR exit .
OSR exit in JavaScriptCore requires entering into an unoptimized bytecode execution engine ( like an interpreter ) at some arbitrary bytecode instruction .
Using bytecode instruction index as a way of naming an exit target is intuitive since it ’s just an integer .
Compute live state at exit .
Register - based bytecode tends to have dense register numberings so it ’s straightforward to analyze liveness using bitvectors .
That tends to be fast and does n’t require a lot of memory .
It ’s practical to cache the results of bytecode liveness analysis , for example .
JavaScriptCore ’s bytecode format is independently implemented by the execution tiers .
For example , the baseline JIT does n’t try to use the LLInt to create its machine code templates ; it just emits those templates itself and does n’t try to match the LLInt exactly ( the behavior is identical but the implementation is n’t ) .
The tiers do share a lot of code – particularly for inline caches and slow paths – but they are n’t required to .
It ’s common for bytecode instructions to have algorithmically different implementations in the four tiers .
For example the LLInt might implement some instruction with a large switch that handles all possible types , the Baseline might implement the same instruction with an inline cache that repatches based on type , and the DFG and FTL might try to do some combination of inline speculations , inline caches , and emitting a switch on all types .
This exact scenario happens for add and other arithmetic ops as well as get_by_val / put_by_val .
Allowing this independence allows each tier to take advantage of its unique properties to make things run faster .
Of course , this approach also means that adding new bytecodes or changing bytecode semantics requires changing all of the tiers .
For that reason , we try to implement new language features by desugaring them to existing bytecode constructs .
It ’s possible to use any sensible IR as the common IR for a speculative compiler , including abstract syntax trees or SSA , but JavaScriptCore uses bytecode so that ’s what we ’ll talk about in the rest of this post .
Control
Speculative compilation needs a control system to decide when to run the optimizing compiler .
The control system has to balance competing concerns : compiling functions as soon as it ’s profitable , avoiding compiling functions that are n’t going to run long enough to benefit from it , avoiding compiling functions that have inadequate type profiling , and recompiling functions if a prior compilation did speculations that turned out to be wrong .
This section describes JavaScriptCore ’s control system .
Most of the heuristics we describe were necessary , in our experience , to make speculative compilation profitable .
Otherwise the optimizing compiler would kick in too often , not often enough , or not at the right rate for the right functions .
This section describes the full details of JavaScriptCore ’s tier - up heuristics because we suspect that to reproduce our performance , one would need all of these heuristics .
JavaScriptCore counts executions of functions and loops to decide when to compile .
Once a function is compiled , we count exits to decide when to throw away compiled functions .
Finally , we count recompilations to decide how much to back off from recompiling a function in the future .
Execution Counting
JavaScriptCore maintains an execution counter for each function .
This counter gets incremented as follows :
Each call to the function adds 15 points to the execution counter .
Each loop execution adds 1 point to the execution counter .
We trigger tier - up once the counter reaches some threshold .
Thresholds are determined dynamically .
To understand our thresholds , first consider their static versions and then let ’s look at how we modulate these thresholds based on other information .
LLInt →Baseline tier - up requires 500 points .
Baseline →DFG tier - up requires 1000 points .
DFG→FTL tier - up requires 100000 points .
Over the years we ’ve found ways to dynamically adjust these thresholds based on other sources of information , like :
Whether the function got JITed the last time we encountered it ( according to our cache ) .
Let ’s call this wasJITed .
.
How big the function is .
Let ’s call this S .
We use the number of bytecode opcodes plus operands as the size .
.
We use the number of bytecode opcodes plus operands as the size .
How many times it has been recompiled .
Let ’s call this R .
.
How much executable memory is available .
Let ’s use M to say how much executable memory we have total , and U is the amount we estimate that we would use ( total ) if we compiled this function .
to say how much executable memory we have total , and is the amount we estimate that we would use ( total ) if we compiled this function .
Whether profiling is “ full ” enough .
We select the LLInt →Baseline threshold based on wasJITed .
If we do n’t know ( the function was n’t in the cache ) then we use the basic threshold , 500 .
Otherwise , if the function wasJITed then we use 250 ( to accelerate tier - up ) otherwise we use 2000 .
This optimization is especially useful for improving page load times .
Baseline →DFG and DFG→FTL use the same scaling factor based on S , R , M , and U .
The scaling factor is defined as follows :
( 0.825914 + 0.061504 * sqrt( S + 1.02406 ) ) * pow ( 2 , R ) * M / ( M - U )
We multiply this by 1000 for Baseline →DFG and by 100000 for DFG→FTL .
Let ’s break down what this scaling factor does :
First we scale by the square root of the size .
The expression 0.825914 + 0.061504 * sqrt( S + 1.02406 ) gives a scaling factor that is between 1 and 2 for functions smaller than about 350 bytecodes , which we consider to be “ easy ” functions to compile .
The scaling factor uses square root so it grows somewhat gently .
We ’ve also tried having the staling factor be linear , but that ’s much worse .
It is worth it to delay compilations of large functions a bit , but it ’s not worth it to delay it too much .
Note that the ideal delay does n’t just have to do with the cost of compilation .
It ’s also about running long enough to get good profiling .
Maybe there is some deep reason why square root works well here , but all we really care about is that scaling by this amount makes programs run faster .
Then we introduce exponential backoff based on the number of times that the function has been recompiled .
The pow ( 2 , R ) expression means that each recompilation doubles the thresholds .
After that we introduce a hyperbolic scaling factor , M / ( M - U ) , to help avoid cases where we run out of executable memory altogether .
This is important since some configurations of JavaScriptCore run with a small available pool of executable memory .
This expression means that if we use half of executable memory then the thresholds are doubled .
If we use 3 / 4 of executable memory then the thresholds are quadrupled .
This makes filling up executable memory a bit like going at the speed of light : the math makes it so that as you get closer to filling it up the thresholds get closer to infinity .
However , it ’s worth noting that this is imperfect for truly large programs , since those might have other reasons to allocate executable memory not covered by this heuristic .
The heuristic is also imperfect in cases of multiple things being compiled in parallel .
Using this factor increases the maximum program size we can handle with small pools of executable memory , but it ’s not a silver bullet .
Finally , if the execution count does reach this dynamically computed threshold , we check that some kinds of profiling ( specifically , value and array profiling , discussed in detail in the upcoming profiling section ) are full enough .
We say that profiling is full enough if more than 3/4 of the profiling sites in the function have data .
If this threshold is not met , we reset the execution counters .
We let this process repeat five times .
The optimizing compilers tend to speculate that unprofiled code is unreachable .
This is profitable if that code really wo n’t ever run , but we want to be extra sure before doing that , hence we give functions with partial profiling 5 × the time to warm up .
This is an exciting combination of heuristics !
These heuristics were added early in the development of tiering in JSC .
They were all added before we built the FTL , and the FTL inherited those heuristics just with a 100× multiplier .
Each heuristic was added because it produced either a speed - up or a memory usage reduction or both .
We try to remove heuristics that are not known to be speed - ups anymore , and to our knowledge , all of these still contribute to better performance on benchmarks we track .
Exit Counting
After we compile a function with the DFG or FTL , it ’s possible that one of the speculations we made is wrong .
This will cause the function to OSR exit back to LLInt or Baseline ( we prefer Baseline , but may throw away Baseline code during GC , in which case exits from DFG and FTL will go to LLInt ) .
We ’ve found that the best way of dealing with a wrong speculation is to throw away the optimized code and try optimizing again later with better profiling .
We detect if a DFG or FTL function should be recompiled by counting exits .
The exit count thresholds are :
For a normal exit , we require 100 * pow ( 2 , R ) exits to recompile .
exits to recompile .
If the exit causes the Baseline JIT to enter its loop trigger ( i.e. we got stuck in a hot loop after exit ) , then it ’s counted specially .
We only allow 5 * pow ( 2 , R ) of those kinds of exits before we recompile .
Note that this can mean exiting five times and tripping the loop optimization trigger each time or it can mean exiting once and tripping the loop optimization trigger five times .
The first step to recompilation is to jettison the DFG or FTL function .
That means that all future calls to the function will call the Baseline or LLInt function instead .
Recompilation
If a function is jettisoned , we increment the recompilation counter ( R in our notation ) and reset the tier - up functionality in the Baseline JIT .
This means that the function will keep running in Baseline for a while ( twice as long as it did before it was optimized last time ) .
It will gather new profiling , which we will be able to combine with the profiling we collected before to get an even more accurate picture of how types behave in the function .
It ’s worth looking at an example of this in action .
We already showed an idealized case of tier - up in Figure 8 , where a function gets compiled by each compiler exactly once and there are no OSR exits or recompilations .
We will now show an example where things do n’t go so well .
This example is picked because it ’s a particularly awful outlier .
This is n’t how we expect our engine to behave normally .
We expect amusingly bad cases like the following to happen occasionally since the success or failure of speculation is random and random behavior means having bad outliers .
_handlePropertyAccessExpression = function ( result , node ) { result.possibleGetOverloads = node.possibleGetOverloads ; result.possibleSetOverloads = node.possibleSetOverloads ; result.possibleAndOverloads = node.possibleAndOverloads ; result.baseType = Node.visit(node.baseType , this ) ; result.callForGet = Node.visit(node.callForGet , this ) ; result.resultTypeForGet = Node.visit(node.resultTypeForGet , this ) ; result.callForAnd = Node.visit(node.callForAnd , this ) ; result.resultTypeForAnd = Node.visit(node.resultTypeForAnd , this ) ; result.callForSet = Node.visit(node.callForSet , this ) ; result.errorForSet = node.errorForSet ; result.updateCalls ( ) ; }
This function belongs to the WSL subtest of JetStream 2 .
It ’s part of the WSL compiler ’s AST walk .
It ends up being a large function after inlining Node.visit .
When I ran this on my computer , I found that JSC did 8 compilations before hitting equilibrium for this function :
After running the function in LLInt for a bit , we compile this with Baseline .
This is the easy part since Baseline does n’t need to be recompiled .
We compile with DFG .
Unfortunately , the DFG compilation exits 101 times and gets jettisoned .
The exit is due to a bad type check that the DFG emitted on this .
We again compile with the DFG .
This time , we exit twice due to a check on result .
This is n’t enough times to trigger jettison and it does n’t prevent tier - up to the FTL .
We compile with the FTL .
Unfortunately , this compilation gets jettisoned due to a failing watchpoint .
Watchpoints ( discussed in greater detail in later sections ) are a way for the compiler to ask the runtime to notify it when bad things happen rather than emitting a check .
Failing watchpoints cause immediate jettison .
This puts us back in Baseline .
We try the DFG again .
We exit seven times due to a bad check on result , just like in step 3 .
This still is n’t enough times to trigger jettison and it does n’t prevent tier - up to the FTL .
We compile with the FTL .
This time we exit 402 times due to a bad type check on node .
We jettison and go back to Baseline .
We compile with the DFG again .
This time there are no exits .
We compile with the FTL again .
There are no further exits or recompilations .
This sequence of events has some intriguing quirks in addition to the number of compilations .
Notice how in steps 3 and 5 , we encounter exits due to a bad check on result , but none of the FTL compilations encounter those exits .
This seems implausible since the FTL will do at least all of the speculations that the DFG did and a speculation that does n’t cause jettison also cannot pessimise future speculations .
It ’s also surprising that the speculation that jettisons the FTL in step 6 was n’t encountered by the DFG .
It is possible that the FTL does more speculations than the DFG , but that usually only happens in inlined functions , and this speculation on node does n’t seem to be in inlined code .
A possible explanation for all of these surprising quirks is that the function is undergoing phase changes : during some parts of execution , it sees one set of types , and during another part of execution , it sees a somewhat different set .
This is a common issue .
Types are not random and they are often a function of time .
JavaScriptCore ’s compiler control system is designed to get good outcomes both for functions where speculation “ just works ” and for functions like the one in this example that need some extra time .
To summarize , control is all about counting executions , exits , and recompilations , and either launching a higher tier compiler ( “ tiering up ” ) or jettisoning optimized code and returning to Baseline .
Profiling
This section describes the profiling tiers of JavaScriptCore .
The profiling tiers have the following responsibilities :
To provide a non-speculative execution engine .
This is important for start - up ( before we do any speculation ) and for OSR exits .
OSR exit needs to exit to something that does no speculation so that we do n’t have chains of exits for the same operation .
To record useful profiling .
Profiling is useful if it enables us to make profitable speculations .
Speculations are profitable if doing them makes programs run faster .
In JavaScriptCore , the LLInt and Baseline are the profiling tiers while DFG and FTL are the optimizing tiers .
However , DFG and FTL also collect some profiling , usually only when it ’s free to do so and for the purpose of refining profiling collected by the profiling tiers .
This section is organized as follows .
First we explain how JavaScriptCore ’s profiling tiers execute code .
Then we explain the philosophy of how to profile .
Finally we go into the details of JavaScriptCore ’s profiling implementation .
How Profiled Execution Works
JavaScriptCore profiles using the LLInt and Baseline tiers .
LLInt interprets bytecode while Baseline compiles it .
The two tiers share a nearly identical ABI so that it ’s possible to jump from one to the other at any bytecode instruction boundary .
LLInt : The Low Level Interpreter
The LLInt is an interpreter that obeys JIT ABI ( in the style of HotSpot ‘s interpreter ) .
To that end , it is written in a portable assembly language called offlineasm .
Offlineasm has a functional macro language ( you can pass macro closures around ) embedded in it .
The offlineasm compiler is written in Ruby and can compile to multiple CPUs as well as C ++.
This section tells the story of why this crazy design produces a good outcome .
The LLInt simultaneously achieves multiple goals for JavaScriptCore :
LLInt is JIT - friendly .
The LLInt runs on the same stack that the JITs run on ( which happens to be the C stack ) .
The LLInt even agrees on register conventions with the JITs .
This makes it cheap for LLInt to call JITed functions and vice versa .
It makes LLInt →Baseline and Baseline →LLInt OSR trivial and it makes any JIT→LLInt OSR possible .
LLInt allows us to execute JavaScript code even if we ca n’t JIT .
JavaScriptCore in no-JIT mode ( we call it “ mini mode ” ) has some advantages : it ’s harder to exploit and uses less memory .
Some JavaScriptCore clients prefer the mini mode .
JSC is also used on CPUs that we do n’t have JIT support for .
LLInt works great on those CPUs .
LLInt reduces memory usage .
Any machine code you generate from JavaScript is going to be big .
Remember , there ’s a reason why they call JavaScript “ high level ” and machine code “ low level ” : it refers to the fact that when you lower JavaScript to machine code , you ’re going to get many instructions for each JavaScript expression .
Having the LLInt means that we do n’t have to generate machine code for all JavaScript code , which saves us memory .
LLInt starts quickly .
LLInt interprets our bytecode format directly .
It ’s designed so that we could map bytecode from disk and point the interpreter at it .
The LLInt is essential for achieving great page load time in the browser .
LLInt is portable .
It can be compiled to C ++.
It would have been natural to write the LLInt in C++ , since that ’s what most of JavaScriptCore is written in .
But that would have meant that the interpreter would have a C++ stack frame constructed and controlled by the C++ compiler .
This would have introduced two big problems :
It would be unclear how to OSR from the LLInt to the Baseline JIT or vice versa , since OSR would have to know how to decode and reencode a C++ stack frame .
We do n’t doubt that it ’s possible to do this with enough cleverness , but it would create constraints on exactly how OSR works and it ’s not an easy piece of machinery to maintain .
JS functions running in the LLInt would have two stack frames instead of one .
One of those stack frames would have to go onto the C++ stack ( because it ’s a C++ stack frame ) .
We have multiple choices of how to manage the JS stack frame ( we could try to alloca it on top of the C++ frame , or allocate it somewhere else ) but this inevitably increases cost : calls into the interpreter would have to do twice the work .
A common optimization to this approach is to have interpreter →interpreter calls reuse the same C++ stack frame by managing a separate JS stack on the side .
Then you can have the JITs use that separate JS stack .
This still leaves cost when calling out of interpreter to JIT or vice versa .
A natural way to avoid these problems is to write the interpreter in assembly .
That ’s basically what we did .
But a JavaScript interpreter is a complex beast .
It would be awful if porting JavaScriptCore to a new CPU meant rewriting the interpreter in another assembly language .
Also , we want to use abstraction to write it .
If we wrote it in C++ , we ’d probably have multiple functions , templates , and lambdas , and we would want all of them to be inlined .
So we designed a new language , offlineasm , which has the following features :
Portable assembly with our own mnemonics and register names that match the way we do portable assembly in our JIT .
Some high - level mnemonics require lowering .
Offlineasm reserves some scratch registers to use for lowering .
The macro construct .
It ’s best to think of this as a lambda that takes some arguments and returns void .
Then think of the portable assembly statements as print statements that output that assembly .
So , the macros are executed for effect and that effect is to produce an assembly program .
These are the execution semantics of offlineasm at compile time .
Macros allow us to write code with rich abstractions .
Consider this example from the LLInt :
macro llintJumpTrueOrFalseOp( name , op , conditionOp ) llintOpWithJump ( op_%name % , op , macro ( size , get , jump , dispatch ) get ( condition , t1 ) loadConstantOrVariable( size , t1 , t0 ) btqnz t0 , ~ 0xf , .slow conditionOp ( t0 , .target ) dispatch ( ) . target : jump ( target ) .slow : callSlowPath(_llint_slow_path_%name % ) nextInstruction ( ) end ) end
This is a macro that we use for implementing both jtrue and jfalse and opcodes .
There are only three lines of actual assembly in this listing : the btqnz ( branch test quad not zero ) and the two labels ( . target and . slow ) .
This also shows the use of first - class macros : on the second line , we call llintOpWithJump and pass it a macro closure as the third argument .
The great thing about having a lambda - like construct like macro is that we do n’t need much else to have a pleasant programming experience .
The LLInt is written in about 5000 lines of offlineasm ( if you only count the 64 - bit version ) .
To summarize , LLInt is an interpreter written in offlineasm .
LLInt understands JIT ABI so calls and OSR between LLInt and JIT are cheap .
The LLInt allows JavaScriptCore to load code more quickly , use less memory , and run on more platforms .
Baseline : The Bytecode Template JIT
The Baseline JIT achieves a speed - up over the LLInt at the cost of some memory and the time it takes to generate machine code .
Baseline ’s speed - up is thanks to two factors :
Removal of interpreter dispatch .
Interpreter dispatch is the costliest part of interpretation , since the indirect branches used for selecting the implementation of an opcode are hard for the CPU to predict .
This is the primary reason why Baseline is faster than LLInt .
Comprehensive support for polymorphic inline caching .
It is possible to do sophisticated inline caching in an interpreter , but currently our best inline caching implementation is the one shared by the JITs .
The Baseline JIT compiles bytecode by turning each bytecode instruction into a template of machine code .
For example , a bytecode instruction like :
add loc6 , arg1 , arg2
Is turned into something like :
0x2f8084601a65 : mov 0x30 ( %rbp ) , %rsi 0x2f8084601a69 : mov 0x38 ( %rbp ) , %rdx 0x2f8084601a6d : cmp %r14 , %rsi 0x2f8084601a70 : jb 0x2f8084601af2 0x2f8084601a76 : cmp %r14 , %rdx 0x2f8084601a79 : jb 0x2f8084601af2 0x2f8084601a7f : mov %esi , %eax 0x2f8084601a81 : add %edx , %eax 0x2f8084601a83 : jo 0x2f8084601af2 0x2f8084601a89 : or % r14 , %rax 0x2f8084601a8 c : mov %rax , - 0x38 ( %rbp )
The only parts of this code that would vary from one add instruction to another are the references to the operands .
For example , 0x30 ( %rbp ) ( that ’s x86 for the memory location at frame pointer plus 0x30 ) is the machine code representation of arg1 in bytecode .
The Baseline JIT does few optimizations beyond just emitting code templates .
It does no register allocation between instruction boundaries , for example .
The Baseline JIT does some local optimizations , like if an operand to a math operation is a constant , or by using profiling information collected by the LLInt .
Baseline also has good support for code repatching , which is essential for implementing inline caching .
We discuss inline caching in detail later in this section .
To summarize , the Baseline JIT is a mostly unoptimized JIT compiler that focuses on removing interpreter dispatch overhead .
This is enough to make it a ~ 2 × speed - up over the LLInt .
Profiling Philosophy
Profiling in JSC is designed to be cheap and useful .
JavaScriptCore ’s profiling aims to incur little or no cost in the common case .
Running with profiling turned on but never using the results to do optimizations should result in throughput that is about as good as if all of the profiling was disabled .
We want profiling to be cheap because even in a long running program , lots of functions will only run once or for too short to make an optimizing JIT profitable .
Some functions might finish running in less time than it takes to optimize them .
The profiling ca n’t be so expensive that it makes functions like that run slower .
Profiling is meant to help the compiler make the kinds of speculations that cause the program to run faster when we factor in both the speed - ups from speculations that are right and the slow - downs from speculations that are wrong .
It ’s possible to understand this formally by thinking of speculation as a bet .
We say that profiling is useful if it turns the speculation into a value bet .
A value bet is one where the expected value ( EV ) is positive .
That ’s another way of saying that the average outcome is profitable , so if we repeated the bet an infinite number of times , we ’d be richer .
Formally the expected value of a bet is :
p * B - ( 1 - p ) * C
Where p is the probability of winning , B is the benefit of winning , and C is the cost of losing ( both B and C are positive ) .
A bet is a value bet iff :
p * B - ( 1 - p ) * C > 0
Let ’s view speculation using this formula .
The scenario in which we have the choice to make a bet or not is that we are compiling a bytecode instruction , we have some profiling that implies that we should speculate , and we have to choose whether to speculate or not .
Let ’s say that B and C both have to do with the latency , in nanoseconds , of executing a bytecode instruction once .
B is the improvement to that latency if we do some speculation and it turns out to be right .
C is the regression to that latency if the speculation we make is wrong .
Of course , after we have made a speculation , it will run many times and may be right sometimes and wrong sometimes .
But B is just about the speed - up in the right cases , and C is just about the slow - down in the wrong cases .
The baseline relative to which B and C are measured is the latency of the bytecode instruction if it was compiled with an optimizing JIT but without that particular OSR - exit - based speculation .
For example , we may have a less - than operation , and we are considering whether to speculate that neither input is double .
We can of course compile less - than without making that speculation , so that ’s the baseline .
If we do choose to speculate , then B is the speed - up to the average execution latency of that bytecode in those cases when neither input is double .
Meanwhile , C is the slow - down to the average execution latency of that bytecode in those cases when at least one input is a double .
For B , let ’s just compute some bounds .
The lower bound is zero , since some speculations are not profitable .
A pretty good first order upper bound for B is the difference in per-bytecode - instruction latency between the baseline JIT and the FTL .
Usually , the full speed - up of a bytecode instruction between baseline to FTL is the result of multiple speculations as well as nonspeculative compiler optimizations .
So , a single speculation being responsible for the full difference in performance between baseline and FTL is a fairly conservative upper bound for B .
Previously , we said that on average in the JetStream 2 benchmark on my computer , a bytecode instruction takes 1.71 ns to execute in Baseline and .225 ns to execute in FTL .
So we can say :
B <= 1.71 ns - .225 ns = 1.48 ns
Now let ’s estimate C .
C is how many more nanoseconds it takes to execute the bytecode instruction if we have speculated and we experience speculation failure .
Failure means executing an OSR exit stub and then reexecuting the same bytecode instruction in baseline or LLInt .
Then , all subsequent bytecodes in the function will execute in baseline or LLInt rather than DFG or FTL .
Every 100 exits or so , we jettison and eventually recompile .
Compiling is concurrent , but running a concurrent compiler is sure to slow down the main thread even if there is no lock contention .
To fully capture C , we have to account for the cost of the OSR exit itself and then amortize the cost of reduced execution speed of the remainder of the function and the cost of eventual recompilation .
Fortunately , it ’s pretty easy to measure this directly by hacking the DFG frontend to randomly insert pointless OSR exits with low probability and by having JSC report a count of the number of exits .
I did an experiment with this hack for every JetStream 2 benchmark .
Running without the synthetic exits , we get an execution time and a count of the number of exits .
Running with synthetic exits , we get a longer execution time and a larger number of exits .
The slope between these two points is an estimate of C .
This is what I found , on the same machine that I used for running the experiments to compute B :
[ DFG ] C = 2499 ns [ FTL ] C = 9998 ns
Notice how C is way bigger than B !
This is n’t some slight difference .
We are talking about three orders of magnitude for the DFG and four orders of magnitude for the FTL .
This paints a clear picture : speculation is a bet with tiny benefit and enormous cost .
For the DFG , this means that we need :
p > 0.9994
For speculation to be a value bet .
p has to be even closer to 1 for FTL .
Based on this , our philosophy for speculation is we wo n’t do it unless we think that :
p ~ 1
Since the cost of speculation failure is so enormous , we only want to speculate when we know that we wo n’t fail .
The speed - up of speculation happens because we make lots of sure bets and only a tiny fraction of them ever fail .
It ’s pretty clear what this means for profiling :
Profiling needs to focus on noting counterexamples to whatever speculations we want to do .
We do n’t want to speculate if profiling tells us that the counterexample ever happened , since if it ever happened , then the EV of this speculation is probably negative .
This means that we are not interested in collecting probability distributions .
We just want to know if the bad thing ever happened .
Profiling needs to run for a long time .
It ’s common to wish for JIT compilers to compile hot functions sooner .
One reason why we do n’t is that we need about 3 - 4 “ nines ” of confidence that that the counterexamples did n’t happen .
Recall that our threshold for tiering up into the DFG is about 1000 executions .
That ’s probably not a coincidence .
Finally , since profiling is a bet , it ’s important to approach it with a healthy gambler ’s philosophy : the fact that a speculation succeeded or failed in a particular program does not tell us if the speculation is good or bad .
Speculations are good or bad only based on their average behavior .
Focusing too much on whether profiling does a good job for a particular program may result in approaches that cause it to perform badly on average .
Profiling Sources in JavaScriptCore
JavaScriptCore gathers profiling from multiple different sources .
These profiling sources use different designs .
Sometimes , a profiling source is a unique source of data , but other times , profiling sources are able to provide some redundant data .
We only speculate when all profiling sources concur that the speculation would always succeed .
The following sections describe our profiling sources in detail .
Case Flags
Case flags are used for branch speculation .
This applies anytime the best way to implement a JS operation involves branches and multiple paths , like a math operation having to handle either integers or doubles .
The easiest way to profile and speculate is to have the profiling tiers implement both sides of the branch and set a different flag on each side .
That way , the optimizing tier knows that it can profitably speculate that only one path is needed if the flags for the other paths are not set .
In cases where there is clearly a preferred speculation — for example , speculating that an integer add did not overflow is clearly preferred overspeculating that it did overflow — we only need flags on the paths that we do n’t like ( like the overflow path ) .
Let ’s consider two examples of case flags in more detail : integer overflow and property accesses on non -object values .
Say that we are compiling an add operation that is known to take integers as inputs .
Usually the way that the LLInt interpreter or Baseline compiler would “ know ” this is that the add operation we ’ll talk about is actually the part of a larger add implementation after we ’ve already checked that the inputs are integers .
Here ’s the logic that the profiling tier would use written as if it was C++ code to make it easy to parse :
int32_t left = ... ; int32_t right = ... ; ArithProfile * profile = ... ; //
This is the thing with the case flags .
int32_t intResult ; JSValue result ; //
This is a tagged JavaScript value that carries type .
if ( UNLIKELY ( addOverflowed ( left , right , &intResult ) ) ) { result = jsNumber ( static_cast < double >( left ) + static_cast < double >( right ) ) ; //
Set the case flag indicating that overflow happened .
profile->setObservedInt32Overflow ( ) ; } else result = jsNumber ( intResult ) ;
When optimizing the code , we will inspect the ArithProfile object for this instruction .
If ! profile ->didObserveInt32Overflow ( ) , we will emit something like :
int32_t left = ... ; int32_t right = ... ; int32_t result ; speculate (!addOverflowed ( left , right , &result ) ) ;
I.e. we will add and branch to an exit on overflow .
Otherwise we will just emit the double path :
double left = ... ; double right = ... ; double result = left + right ;
Unconditionally doing double math is not that expensive ; in fact on benchmarks that I ’ve tried , it ’s cheaper than doing integer math and checking overflow .
The only reason why integers are profitable is that they are cheaper to use for bit operations and pointer arithmetic .
Since CPUs do n’t accept floats or doubles for bit and pointer math , we need to convert the double to an integer first if the JavaScript program uses it that way ( pointer math arises when a number is used as an array index ) .
Such conversions are relatively expensive even on CPUs that support them natively .
Usually it ’s hard to tell , using profiling or any static analysis , whether a number that a program computed will be used for bit or pointer math in the future .
Therefore , it ’s better to use integer math with overflow checks so that if the number ever flows into an operation that requires integers , we wo n’t have to pay for expensive conversions .
But if we learn that any such operation overflows — even occasionally — we ’ve found that it ’s more efficient overall to unconditionally switch to double math .
Perhaps the presence of overflows is strongly correlated with the result of those operations not being fed into bit math or pointer math .
A simpler example is how case flags are used in property accesses .
As we will discuss in the inline caches section , property accesses have associated metadata that we use to track details about their behavior .
That metadata also has flags , like the sawNonCell bit , which we set to true if the property access ever sees a non -object as the base .
If the flag is set , the optimizing compilers know not to speculate that the property access will see objects .
This typically forces all kinds of conservatism for that property access , but that ’s better than speculating wrong and exiting in this case .
Lots of case flags look like sawNonCell : they are casually added as a bit in some existing data structure to help the optimizing compiler know which paths were taken .
To summarize , case flags are used to record counterexamples to the speculations that we want to do .
They are a natural way to implement profiling in those cases where the profiling tiers would have had to branch anyway .
Case Counts
A predecessor to case flags in JavaScriptCore is case counts .
It ’s the same idea as flags , but instead of just setting a bit to indicate that a bad thing happened , we would count .
If the count never got above some threshold , we would speculate .
Case counts were written before we realized that the EV of speculation is awful unless the probability of success is basically 1 .
We thought that we could speculate in cases where we knew we’d be right a majority of the time , for example .
Initial versions of case counts had variable thresholds — we would compute a ratio with the execution count to get a case rate .
That did n’t work as well as fixed thresholds , so we switched to a fixed count threshold of 100 .
Over time , we lowered the threshold to 20 or 10 , and then eventually found that the threshold should really be 1 , at which point we switched to case flags .
Some functionality still uses case counts .
We still have case counts for determining if the this argument is exotic ( some values of this require the function to perform a possibly - effectful conversion in the prologue ) .
We still have case counts as a backup for math operations overflowing , though that is almost certainly redundant with our case flags for math overflow .
It ’s likely that we will remove case counts from JavaScriptCore eventually .
Value Profiling
Value profiling is all about inferring the types of JavaScript values ( JSValues ) .
Since JS is a dynamic language , JSValues have a runtime type .
We use a 64 - bit JSValue representation that uses bit encoding tricks to hold either doubles , integers , booleans , null , undefined , or pointers to cell , which may be JavaScript objects , symbols , or strings .
We refer to the act of encoding a value in a JSValue as boxing it and the act of decoding as unboxing ( note that boxing is a term used in other engines to refer specifically to the act of allocating a box object in the heap to hold a value ; our use of the term boxing is more like what others call tagging ) .
In order to effectively optimize JavaScript , we need to have some way of inferring the type so that the compiler can assume things about it statically .
Value profiling tracks the set of values that a particular program point saw so that we can predict what types that program point will see in the future .
Figure 12 .
Value profiling and prediction propagation for a sample data flow graph .
We combine value profiling with a static analysis called prediction propagation .
The key insight is that prediction propagation can infer good guesses for the types for most operations if it is given a starting point for certain opaque operations :
Arguments incoming to the function .
Results of most load operations .
Results of most calls .
There ’s no way that a static analysis running just on some function could guess what types loads from plain JavaScript arrays or calls to plain JavaScript functions could have .
Value profiling is about trying to help the static analysis guess the types of those opaque operations .
Figure 12 shows how this plays out for a sample data flow graph .
There ’s no way static analysis can tell the type of most GetByVal and GetBy Id oerations , since those are loads from dynamically typed locations in the heap .
But if we did know what those operations return then we can infer types for this entire graph by using simple type rules for Add ( like that if it takes integers as inputs and the case flags tell us there was no overflow then it will produce integers ) .
Let ’s break down value profiling into the details of how exactly values are profiled , how prediction propagation works , and how the results of prediction propagation are used .
Recording value profiles .
At its core , value profiling is all about having some program point ( either a point in the interpreter or something emitted by the Baseline JIT ) log the value that it saw .
We log values into a single bucket so that each time the profiling point runs , it overwrites the last seen value .
The code looks like this in the LLInt :
macro valueProfile ( op , metadata , value ) storeq value , % op % : : Metadata::profile.m_buckets[metadata ]
end
Let ’s look at how value profiling works for the get_by_val bytecode instruction .
Here ’s part of the code for get_by_val in LLInt :
llintOpWithMetadata ( op_get_by_val , OpGetByVal , macro ( size , get , dispatch , metadata , return ) macro finishGetByVal( result , scratch ) get ( dst , scratch ) storeq result , [ cfr , scratch , 8 ] valueProfile ( OpGetByVal , t5 , result ) dispatch ( ) end ... // more code for get_by_val
The implementation of get_by_val includes a finishGetByVal helper macro that stores the result in the right place on the stack and then dispatches to the next instruction .
Note that it also calls valueProfile to log the result just before finishing .
Each ValueProfile object has a pair of buckets and a predicted type .
One bucket is for normal execution .
The valueProfile macro in the LLInt uses this bucket .
The other bucket is for OSR exit : if we exit due to a speculation on a type that we got from value profiling , we feed the value that caused OSR exit back into the second bucket of the ValueProfile .
Each time that our execution counters ( used for controlling when to invoke the next tier ) count about 1000 points , the execution counting slow path updates all predicted types for the value profiles in that function .
Updating value profiles means computing a predicted type for the value in the bucket and merging that type with the previously predicted type .
Therefore , after repeated predicted type updates , the type will be broad enough to be valid for multiple different values that the code saw .
Predicted types use the Speculated Type type system .
A SpeculatedType is a 64 - bit integer in which we use the low 40 bits to represent a set of 40 fundamental types .
The fundamental types , shown in Figure 13 , represent non-overlapping set of possible JSValues .
240 Speculated Types are possible by setting any combination of bits .
Figure 13 .
All of the fundamental Speculated Types .
This allows us to invent whatever types are useful for optimization .
For example , we distinguish between 32 - bit integers whose value is either 0 or 1 ( BoolInt32 ) versus whose value is anything else ( NonBoolInt32 ) .
Together these form the Int32 Only type , which just has both bits set .
BoolInt32 is useful for cases there integers are converted to booleans .
Prediction propagation .
We use value profiling to fill in the blanks for the prediction propagation pass of the DFG compiler pipeline .
Prediction propagation is an abstract interpreter that tracks the set of types that each variable in the program can have .
It ’s unsound since the types it produces are just predictions ( it can produce any combination of types and at worst we will just OSR exit too much ) .
However , it can be said that we optimize it to be sound ; the more sound it is , the fewer OSR exits we have .
Prediction propagation fills in the things that the abstract interpreter can’t reason about ( loads from the heap , results returned by calls , arguments to the function , etc. ) using the results of value profiling .
On the topic of soundness , we would consider it to be a bug if the prediction propagation was unsound in a world where value profiling is never wrong .
Of course , in reality , we know that value profiling will be wrong , so we know that prediction propagation is unsound .
Let ’s consider some of the cases where prediction propagation can be sure about the result type of an operation based on the types of its inputs .
array [ index ]
Figure 14 .
Some of the prediction propagation rules for Add .
This figure does n’t show the rules for string concatenation and objects .
Figure 15 .
Some of the prediction propagation rules for GetByVal ( the DFG opcode for subscript access like ) .
This figure only shows a small sample of the GetByVal rules .
Figure 14 shows some of the rules for the Add operation in DFG IR .
Prediction propagation and case flags tell us everything we want to know about the output of Add .
If the inputs are integers and the overflow flag is n’t set , the output is an integer .
If the inputs are any other kinds of numbers or there are overflows , the output is a double .
We do n’t need anything else ( like value profiling ) to understand the output type of Add .
Figure 15 shows some of the rules for GetByVal , which is the DFG representation of array [ index ] .
In this case , there are types of arrays that could hold any type of value .
So , even knowing that it is a JSArray is n’t enough to know the types of values inside the array .
Also , if the index is a string , then this could be accessing some named property on the array object or one of its prototypes and those could have any type .
It ’s in cases like GetByVal that we leverage value profiling to guess what the result type is .
Prediction propagation combined with value profiling allows the DFG to infer a predicted type at every point in the program where a variable is used .
This allows operations that do n’t do any profiling on their own to still perform type - based speculations .
It ’s of course possible to also have bytecode instructions that can speculate on type collect case flags ( or use some other mechanism ) to drive those speculations — and that approach can be more precise — but value profiling means that we do n’t have to do this for every operation that wants type - based speculation .
Using predicted types .
Consider the CompareEq operation in DFG IR , which is used for the DFG lowering of the eq , eq_null , neq , neq_null , jeq , jeq_null , jneq , and jneq_null bytecodes .
These bytecodes do no profiling of their own .
But CompareEq is one of the most aggressive type speculators in all of the DFG .
CompareEq can speculate on the types it sees without doing any profiling of its own because the values it uses will either have value profiling or will have a predicted type filled in by prediction propagation .
Type speculations in the DFG are written like :
CompareEq ( Int32:@left , Int32:@right )
This example means that the CompareEq will specuate that both operands are Int32 .
CompareEq supports the following speculations , plus others we do n’t list here :
CompareEq ( Boolean:@left , Boolean : @right ) CompareEq ( Int32:@left , Int32:@right ) CompareEq ( Int32:BooleanToNumber ( Boolean:@left ) , Int32:@right ) CompareEq ( Int32:BooleanToNumber ( Untyped:@left ) , Int32:@right ) CompareEq ( Int32:@left , Int32:BooleanToNumber ( Boolean:@right ) ) CompareEq ( Int32:@left , Int32:BooleanToNumber ( Untyped:@right ) ) CompareEq ( Int52Rep:@left , Int52Rep:@right ) CompareEq ( DoubleRep:DoubleRep ( Int52:@left ) , DoubleRep:DoubleRep ( Int52:@right ) ) CompareEq ( DoubleRep:DoubleRep ( Int52:@left ) , DoubleRep: DoubleRep( RealNumber:@right ) ) CompareEq ( DoubleRep:DoubleRep ( Int52:@left ) , DoubleRep: DoubleRep( Number:@right ) ) CompareEq ( DoubleRep:DoubleRep ( Int52:@left ) , DoubleRep:DoubleRep( NotCell:@right ) ) CompareEq ( DoubleRep:DoubleRep( RealNumber:@left ) , DoubleRep: DoubleRep( RealNumber:@right ) ) CompareEq ( DoubleRep :... , DoubleRep :... ) CompareEq ( StringIdent:@left , StringIdent: @right ) CompareEq ( String:@left , String : @right ) CompareEq ( Symbol:@left , Symbol: @right ) CompareEq ( Object:@left , Object : @right ) CompareEq ( Other:@left , Untyped: @right ) CompareEq ( Untyped:@left , Other:@right ) CompareEq ( Object:@left , ObjectOrOther:@right ) CompareEq ( ObjectOrOther:@left , Object : @right ) CompareEq ( Untyped:@left , Untyped: @right )
Some of these speculations , like CompareEq ( Int32 : , Int32 : ) or CompareEq ( Object : , Object : ) , allow the compiler to just emit an integer compare instruction .
Others , like CompareEq ( String : , String : ) , emit a string compare loop .
We have lots of variants to optimally handle bizarre comparisons that are not only possible in JS but that we have seen happen frequently in the wild , like comparisons between numbers and booleans and comparisons between one value that is always a number and another that is either a number or a boolean .
We provide additional optimizations for comparisons between doubles , comparisons between strings that have been hash - consed ( so - called StringIdent , which can be compared using comparison of the string pointer ) , and comparisons where we do n’t know how to speculate ( CompareEq ( Untyped : , Untyped : ) ) .
The basic idea of value profiling — storing a last - seen value into a bucket and then using that to bootstrap a static analysis — is something that we also use for profiling the behavior of array accesses .
Array profiles and array allocation profiles are like value profiles in that they save the last result in a bucket .
Like value profiling , data from those profiles is incorporated into prediction propagation .
To summarize , value profiling allows us to predict the types of variables at all of their use sites by just collecting profiling at those bytecode instructions whose output cannot be predicted with abstract interpretation .
This serves as the foundation for how the DFG ( and FTL , since it reuses the DFG ’s frontend ) speculates on the types of JSValues .
Inline Caches
Property accesses and function calls are particularly difficult parts of JavaScript to optimize :
Objects behave as if they were just ordered mappings from strings to JSValues .
Lookup , insertion , deletion , replacement , and iteration are possible .
Programs do these operations a lot , so they have to be fast .
In some cases , programs use objects the same way that programs in other languages would use hashtables .
In other cases , programs use objects the same way that they would in Java or some sensibly - typed object - oriented language .
Most programs do both .
Function calls are polymorphic .
You ca n’t make static promises about what function will be called .
Both of these dynamic features are amenable to optimization with Deutsch and Schiffman ’s inline caches ( ICs ) .
For dynamic property access , we combine this with structures , based on the idea of maps in the Chambers , Ungar , and Lee ’s Self implementation .
We also follow Hölzle , Chambers , and Ungar : our inline caches are polymorphic and we use data from these caches as profiling of the types observed at a particular property access or call site .
It ’s worth dwelling a bit on the power of inline caching .
Inline caches are great optimizations separately from speculative compilation .
They make the LLInt and Baseline run faster .
Inline caches are our most powerful profiling source , since they can precisely collect information about every type encountered by an access or call .
Note that we previously said that good profiling has to be cheap .
We think of inline caches as negative cost profiling since inline caches make the LLInt and Baseline faster .
It does n’t get cheaper than that !
This section focuses on inline caching for dynamic property access , since it ’s strictly more complex than for calls ( accesses use structures , polymorphic inline caches ( PICs ) , and speculative compilation ; calls only use polymorphic inline caches and speculative compilation ) .
We organize our discussion of inline caching for dynamic property access as follows .
First we describe how structures work .
Then we show the JavaScriptCore object model and how it incorporates structures .
Next we show how inline caches work .
Then we show how profiling from inline caches is used by the optimizing compilers .
After that we show how inline caches support polymorphism and polyvariance .
Finally we talk about how inline caches are integrated with the garbage collector .
Structures .
Objects in JavaScript are just mappings from strings to JSValues .
Lookup , insertion , deletion , replacement , and iteration are all possible .
We want to optimize those uses of objects that would have had a type if the language had given the programmer a way to say it .
Figure 16 .
Some JavaScript objects that have x and y properties .
Some of them have exactly the same shape ( only x and y in the same order ) .
Consider how to implement a property access like :
var tmp = o.x ;
Or :
o.x = tmp ;
One way to make this fast is to use hashtables .
That ’s certainly a necessary fallback mechanism when the JavaScript program uses objects more like hashtables than like objects ( i.e. it frequently inserts and deletes properties ) .
But we can do better .
This problem frequently arises in dynamic programming languages and it has a well - understood solution .
The key insight of Chambers , Ungar , and Lee ’s Self implementation is that property access sites in the program will typically only see objects of the same shape .
Consider the objects in Figure 16 that have x and y properties .
Of course it ’s possible to insert x and y in two possible orders , but folks will tend to pick some order and stick to it ( like x first ) .
And of course it ’s possible to also have objects that have a z property , but it ’s less likely that a property access written as part of the part of the program that works with {x , y} objects will be reused for the part that uses {x , y , z} .
It ’s possible to have shared code for many different kinds of objects but unshared code is more common .
Therefore , we split the object representation into two parts :
The object itself , which only contains the property values and a structure pointer .
The structure , which is a hashtable that maps property names ( strings ) to indices in the objects that have that structure .
Figure 17 .
The same objects as in Figure 16 , but using structures .
Figure 17 shows objects represented using structures .
Objects only contain object property values and a pointer to a structure .
The structure tells the property names and their order .
For example , if we wanted to ask the {1 , 2} object in Figure 17 for the value of property x , we would load the pointer to its structure , {x , y} , and ask that structure for the index of x .
The index is 0 , and the value at index 0 in the {1 , 2} object is 1 .
A key feature of structures is that they are hash consed .
If two objects have the same properties in the same order , they are likely to have the same structure .
This means that checking if an object has a certain structure is O ( 1 ) : just load the structure pointer from the object header and compare the pointer to a known value .
Structures can also indicate that objects are in dictionary or uncacheable dictionary mode , which are basically two levels of hashtable badness .
In both cases , the structure stops being hash consed and is instead paired 1:1 with its object .
Dictionary objects can have new properties added to them without the structure changing ( the property is added to the structure in - place ) .
Uncacheable dictionary objects can have properties deleted from them without the structure changing .
We wo n’t go into these modes in too much detail in this post .
To summarize , structures are hashtables that map property names to indices in the object .
Object property lookup uses the object ’s structure to find the index of the property .
Structures are hash consed to allow for fast structure checks .
Figure 18 .
The JavaScriptCode object model .
JavaScriptCore object model .
JavaScriptCore uses objects with a 64 - bit header that includes a 32 - bit structure ID and 32 bits worth of extra state for GC , type checks , and arrays .
Figure 18 shows the object model .
Named object properties may end up either in the inline slots or the out - of - line slots .
Objects get some number of inline slots based on simple static analysis around the allocation site .
If a property is added that does n’t fit in the inline slots , we allocate a butterfly to store additional properties out - of - line .
Accessing out - of - line properties in the butterfly costs one extra load .
Figure 19 shows an example object that only has two inline properties .
This is the kind of object you would get if you used the object literal {f : 5 , g:6} or if you assigned to the f and g properties reasonably close to the allocation .
Figure 19 .
Example JavaScriptCore object together with its structure .
Simple inline caches .
Let ’s consider the code :
var v = o.f ;
Let ’s assume that all of the objects that flow into this have structure 42 like the object in Figure 19 .
Inline caching this property access is all about emitting code like the following :
if ( o-> structureID == 42 ) v = o-> inlineStorage [ 0 ] else v = slowGet ( o , " f " )
But how do we know that o will have structure 42 ?
JavaScript does not give us this information statically .
Inline caches get this information by filling it in once the code runs .
There are a number of techniques for this , all of which come down to self - modifying code .
Let ’s look at how the LLInt and Baseline do it .
In the LLInt , the metadata for get_by_id contains a cached structure ID and a cached offset .
The cached structure ID is initialized to an absurd value that no structure can have .
The fast path of get_by_id loads the property at the cached offset if the object has the cached structure .
Otherwise , we take a slow path that does the full lookup .
If that full lookup is cacheable , it stores the structure ID and offset in the metadata .
The Baseline JIT does something more sophisticated .
When emitting a get_by_id , it reserves a slab of machine code space that the inline caches will later fill in with real code .
The only code in this slab initially is an unconditional jump to a slow path .
The slow path does the fully dynamic lookup .
If that is deemed cacheable , the reserved slab is replaced with code that does the right structure check and loads at the right offset .
Here ’s an example of a get_by_id initially compiled with Baseline :
0x46f8c30b9b0 : mov 0x30 ( %rbp ) , %rax 0x46f8c30b9b4 : test %rax , %r15 0x46f8c30b9b7 : jnz 0x46f8c30 ba2c 0x46f8c30b9bd : jmp 0x46f8c30 ba2c 0x46f8c30b9c2 : o16 nop % cs:0x200 ( %rax , %rax ) 0x46f8c30b9d1 : nop ( %rax ) 0x46f8c30b9d4 : mov %rax , - 0x38 ( %rbp )
The first thing that this code does is check that o ( stored in %rax ) is really an object ( using a test and jnz ) .
Then notice the unconditional jmp followed by two long nop instructions .
This jump goes to the same slow path that we would have branched to if o was not an object .
After the slow path runs , this is repatched to :
0x46f8c30b9b0 : mov 0x30 ( %rbp ) , %rax 0x46f8c30b9b4 : test %rax , %r15 0x46f8c30b9b7 : jnz 0x46f8c30 ba2c 0x46f8c30b9bd : cmp $ 0x125 , ( %rax ) 0x46f8c30b9c3 : jnz 0x46f8c30 ba2c 0x46f8c30b9c9 : mov 0x18 ( %rax ) , %rax 0x46f8c30b9cd : nop 0x200 ( %rax ) 0x46f8c30b9d4 : mov %rax , - 0x38 ( %rbp )
Now , the is - object check is followed by a structure check ( using cmp to check that the structure is 0x125 ) and a load at offset 0x18 .
Inline caches as a profiling source .
The metadata we use to maintain inline caches makes for a fantastic profiling source .
Let ’s look closely at what this means .
Figure 20 .
Timeline of using an inline cache at each JIT tier .
Note that we end up having to generate code for this `get_by_id` * six times * in the berst case that each tier compiles this only once .
Figure 20 shows a naive use of inline caches in a multi-tier engine , where the DFG JIT forgets everything that we learned from the Baseline inline cache and just compiles a blank inline cache .
This is reasonably efficient and we fall back on this approach when the inline caches from the LLInt and Baseline tell us that there is unmanagable polymorphism .
Before we go into how polymorphism is profiled , let ’s look at how a speculative compiler really wants to handle simple monomorphic inline caches like the one in Figure 20 , where we only see one structure ( S1 ) and the code that the IC emits is trivial ( load at offset 10 from %rax ) .
When the DFG frontend ( shared by DFG and FTL ) sees an operation like get_by_id that can be implemented with ICs , it reads the state of all ICs generated for that get_by_id .
By “ all ICs ” we mean all ICs that are currently in the heap .
This usually just means reading the LLInt and Baseline ICs , but if there exists a DFG or FTL function that generated an IC for this get_by_id then we will also read that IC .
This can happen if a function gets compiled multiple times due to inlining — we may be compiling function bar that inlines a call to function foo and foo already got compiled with FTL and the FTL emitted an IC for our get_by_id .
If all ICs for a get_by_id concur that the operation is monomorphic and they tell us the structure to use , then the DFG frontend converts the get_by_id into inline code that does not get repatched .
This is shown in Figure 21 .
Note that this simple get_by_id is lowered to two DFG operations : CheckStructure , which OSR exits if the given object does not have the required structure , and GetByOffset , which is just a load with known offset and field name .
Figure 21 .
Inlining a simple momomorphic inline cache in DFG and FTL .
CheckStructure and GetByOffset are understood precisely in DFG IR :
CheckStructure is a load to get the structure ID of an object and a branch to compare that structure ID to a constant .
The compiler knows what structures are .
After a CheckStructcure , the compiler knows that it ’s safe to execute loads to any of the properties that the structure says that the object has .
GetByOffset is a load from either an inline or out - of - line property of a JavaScript object .
The compiler knows what kind of property is being loaded , what its offset is , and what the name of the property would have been .
The DFG knows all about how to model these operations and the dependency between them :
The DFG knows that neither operation causes a side effect , but that the CheckStructure represents a conditional side exit , and both operations read the heap .
The DFG knows that two CheckStructures on the same structure are redundant unless some operation between them could have changed object structure .
The DFG knows a lot about how to optimize away redundant structure checks , even in cases where there is a function call between two of them ( more on this later ) .
The DFG knows that two GetByOffsets that speak of the same property and object are loading from the same memory location .
The DFG knows how to do alias analaysis on those properties , so it can precisely know when a GetByOffset ’s memory location got clobbered .
The DFG knows that if it wants to hoist a GetByOffset then it has to ensure that the corresponding CheckStructure gets hoisted first .
It does this using abstract interpretation , so there is no need to have a dependency edge between these operations .
The DFG knows how to generate either machine code ( in the DFG tier ) or B3 IR ( in the FTL tier ) for CheckStructure and GetByOffset .
In B3 , CheckStructure becomes a Load , NotEqual , and Check , while GetByOffset usually just becomes a Load .
Figure 22 .
Inlining two momomorphic inline caches , for different properties on the same object , in DFG and FTL .
The DFG and FTL are able to eliminate the CheckStructure for the second IC .
The biggest upshot of lowering ICs to CheckStructure and GetByOffset is the redundancy elimination .
The most common redundancy we eliminate is multiple CheckStrutures .
Lots of code will do multiple loads from the same object , like :
var f = o.f ; var g = o.g ;
With ICs , we would check the structure twice .
Figure 22 shows what happens when the speculative compilers inline these ICs .
We are left with just a single CheckStructure instead of two thanks to the fact that :
CheckStructure is an OSR speculation .
CheckStructure is not an IC .
The compiler knows exactly what it does , so that it can model it , so that it can eliminate it .
Let ’s pause to appreciate what this technique gives us so far .
We started out with a language in which property accesses seem to need hashtable lookups .
A o.f operation requires calling some procedure that is doing hashing and so forth .
But by combining inline caches , structures , and speculative compilation we have landed on something where some o.f operations are nothing more than load - at - offset like they would have been in C++ or Java .
But this assumes that the o.f operation was monomorphic .
The rest of this section considers minimorphism , polymorphism , and polyvariance .
Minimorphism .
Certain kinds of polymorphic accesses are easier to handle than others .
Sometimes an access will see two or more structures but all of those structures have the property at the same offset .
Other times an access will see multiple structures and those structures do not agree on the offset of the property .
We say that an access is minimorphic if it sees more than one structure and all structures agree on the offset of the property .
Our inline caches handle all forms of polymorphism by generating a stub that switches on the structure .
But in the DFG , minimorphic accesses are special because they still qualify for full inlining .
Consider an access o.f that sees structures S1 and S2 , and both agree that f is at offset 0 .
Then we would have :
CheckStructure ( @o , S1 , S2 ) GetByOffset ( @o , 0 )
This minimorphic CheckStructure will OSR exit if @o has none of the listed structures .
Our optimizations for CheckStructure generally work for both monomorphic and minimorphic variants .
So , minimorphism usually does n’t hurt performance much compared to monomorphism .
Polymorphism .
But what about some access sees different structures , and those structures have the property at different offsets ?
Consider an access to o.f that sees structures S1 = {f , g} , S2 = {f , g , h} , and S3 = {g , f} .
This would be a minimorphic access if it was just S1 or S2 , but S3 has f at a different offset .
In this case , the FTL will convert this to :
MultiGetByOffset( @o , [ S1 , S2 ] => 0 , [ S3 ] =>
1 )
in DFG IR and then lower it to something like :
if ( o-> structureID == S1 || o-> structureID == S2 ) result = o-> inlineStorage [ 0 ] else result = o-> inlineStorage [ 1 ]
in B3 IR .
In fact , we would use B3 ’s Switch since that ’s the canonical form for this code pattern in B3 .
Note that we only do this optimization in the FTL .
The reason is that we want polymorphic accesses to remain ICs in the DFG so that we can use them to collect refined profiling .

As SFpark is envisioned , parking rates would be adjusted based on time of day , day of week and duration of stay .
People would be able to pay not just with coins , but with credit cards , prepaid debit cards and even by cell phone .
If a meter is set to expire , a text message could be sent to the driver .
More time could be purchased remotely .
People also would be able to check parking availability before arriving at their destination via the Internet , handheld devices such as BlackBerrys , or cell phone .
Sensors would be embedded in the asphalt to keep track of when a parking spot is empty ....
" The idea is to give people more choice , more convenience and to reduce congestion , " said Mayor Gavin Newsom .
Under the program , which will focus on 10 neighborhoods , the city will adjust hourly parking rates based on demand - the price will go up when spaces are scarce and go down when plenty are available .
People may be less inclined to drive during peak times if they know it will cost them more .

In February , the Universe Today followed the sad tale about a dead US satellite called US - 193 , lifelessly floating around in orbit , possibly threatening the world by dumping hazardous fuel onto a city somewhere .
This was the perfect time for the US Navy to launch their Standard Missile - 3 ( SM - 3 ) into space , smashing US - 193 to tiny bits .
It worked and it worked well .
Although we ’ve seen loads of pictures of the rocket being launched , and the pinpoint accuracy it accomplished by detonating in low Earth orbit , but what technology goes into the actual warhead that takes out the satellite ?
Well , in an article just published , images of an older generation “ Kinetic Energy ” anti-satellite weapon are on display .
And to be honest , it does n’t look that scary …
There ’s more than one way to kill a satellite .
You can make it self destruct by firing its thrusters , sending it in a deadly descent through the atmosphere .
But say if you do n’t have communication with the craft ?
You could capture it in orbit using a robotic or manned spaceship .
But this would be prohibitively expensive and dangerous .
You could simply shoot it down … now this idea ( although far from beingÂ “ simple ” ) is the most popular and effective method to get rid of a satellite from orbit .
The anti-satellite ( ASAT ) idea has been around since the Cold War , as far back as the 1960 ’s , but very little information is available .
In fact , according to Dwayne Day ’s article in The Space Review on the 31st March , since the Cold War nobody has been bothered to write much about American ASAT technology development , policy , and doctrine .
It is unclear if this is down to the military being ( understandably ) secretive , or whether people simply lost interest in the “ Star Wars ” program proposed by U.S. President Ronald Reagan in 1983 .
But there are some clues as to the US anti-satellite capabilities back in the 1990 ’s , namely a cool - looking mock - up of one of Lockheed ’s proposals for a kinetic energy anti-satellite warhead ( or KE - ASAT , pictured left ) , the author discovered at the Aerospace Legacy Foundation ’s offices located at the former North American Aviation Downey factory .
The owner , a Dr. Jim Busby showed off a low fidelity mock - up of a Lockheed KE - ASAT , which he acquired in the early 1990s , when a previous owner discarded it .
It ’s a strange - looking device , resembling a mini-spaceship capsule ( although , from the images and description , it is unclear how big it is ) that would have sat on top of a rocket booster to send it from the ground and into space to hit its satellite target .
This type of anti-satellite does not explode on impact ; it relies on huge velocities and a high mass to generate enough kinetic energy to destroy the target on impact .
Some variations on this theme may have included a Kevlar “ fly swatter ” that would expand on impact , making it easier to hit the satellite and destroy it .
It is obvious from the images that the mass of the warhead is packed in the red cone at the front of the weapon ; the infrared heat - seeker targeting system would also be housed there .
There is also a main thruster ( that would fire to life once the rocket boosters had carried it into space ) , and attitude controls at the rear to guide the high velocity projectile to its target .
A similar method was used by the February 20th US spy satellite intercept , so the proposed technology this KE - ASAT is built on is not far from the current method employed by the US Navy .
Alas , the KE - ASAT never made it to the production line as Lockheed ’s bid for use in an anti-satellite program was beaten by the Rockwell company in July 1990 , the US Army opted for a far different - looking design , not dissimilar to the ASAT used today .
Personally I think the Lockheed concept looked better , but would have been very scary , causing a huge mess …

Siegelman : Rove ' hijacked ' the Dept. of Justice to win elections
In an extensive interview with Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. , former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman , who was released from prison on bond last month pending an appeal of his conviction on corruption charges , laid the blame for his prosecution squarely on Karl Rove 's " hijacking " of the federal Department of Justice .
" This is not about me , it 's not about my case , " Siegelman emphasized in his appearance on Air America 's Ring of Fire , a show hosted by Kennedy and Mike Papantonio available online at GoLeft.tv .
" This is about America , and about a quest now that must be pursued to find out who was responsible for hijacking the Department of Justice and using it as a political tool to win elections .
I believe that person that Congress will ultimately hold responsible is Karl Rove . "
Siegelman noted that even before Republican whistleblower Dana Jill Simpson implicated Rove directly , " I suspected from the circumstantial evidence that Karl Rove was deeply involved in my prosecution .
I mean , it was just so obvious that it was easy for me to put two and two together and connect those dots . "
" I grew up with your father being the Attorney General , " Siegelman told Kennedy , " and the heroic deeds that he did , and you know , you always thought that the Department of Justice was the last place that you could look to for justice and for fair play .
But I think Karl Rove learned two things out of Watergate .
...
He learned that you did n't have to create a secret plumbers unit within the White House when you had the Department of Justice .
If you just appointed the right U.S. Attorneys , you could accomplish the same thing and more .
And the second thing I think Rove learned was , you do n't leave evidence behind like Nixon did with his tapes .
You destroy e-mails . "
Siegelman made clear his belief that , even though the corruption investigation launched against him by a Republican state attorney general just a few weeks after he was sworn in as governor in 1999 may have begun as a matter of local politics , once the Bush administration took office it became something far larger .
By then , Siegelman was a rising star among Democratic governors , and after losing his bid for re-election in 2002 he became an increasingly visible critic of the administration .
That in itself was reason enough for Rove to want to bring him down .
In support of his argument that he was targeted at the highest levels of the Department of Justice , Siegelman cited the involvement of several highly - placed figures .
One was Noel Hillman , formerly the head of the Public Integrity Section at the department , whom Kennedy described as " a crooked federal judge from Camden , New Jersey , who is one of the other people who has completely corrupted the democratic process in our country and taken the Justice Department ... and turned it into a political outlet for muzzling and jailing political opponents . "
According to Siegelman , Hillman " actually came to Alabama several times to speak up for the prosecution , even at a time when there were questions whether or not they were going to move forward with the case .
He called the U.S. Attorneys to Washington and told them to go back and take a top - to - bottom review of the Siegelman case once they had lost their first run at me in 2004 . "
Another was Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , who visited U.S. Attorney Leura Canary in Alabama after the first case against Siegelman was thrown out by the judge and , far from criticizing her failure , offered his strong support .
" Shortly after the case was lost by the U.S. Attorney in Birmingham , who is a close social friend of Karl Rove 's , Alberto Gonzales comes to Alabama to give her an applause and to pat her on the back and to shore her up and to tell everybody what a great U.S. Attorney she was . "
Siegelman also noted that when the government witness who was preparing to testify against Siegelman told a room full of Department of Justice representatives that he had also given cash and blank checks to two prominent Republicans -- former Attorney General William Pryor and Senator Jeff Sessions -- " not one word was said and nothing was done . "
" Every single one of those people had a conflict and should have stepped out of that room at that time , " Siegelman explained .
" It cries about selective prosecution , but it also cries out , who is holding this umbrella of protection over these people so that they felt comfortable operating in that environment where they were possibly , certainly violating the cannons of ethics , but possibly violating laws and certainly subverting my right to a fair trial ? "
Siegelman added that " the Department of Justice , still to this day , is withholding over 500 documents that would shed some light on the origins of this case . "
Karl Rove has denied having ever met Dana Jill Simpson , the Republican whistleblower who linked him directly to the prosecution of Governor Siegelman , and has rejected her allegations .
He told GQ in an interview following Simpson 's appearance on 60 Minutes , " She 's a complete lunatic .
I 've never met this woman .
This woman was not involved in any campaign in which I was involved .
I have yet to find anybody who knows her .
... CBS is a shoddy operation .
They said , ' Hey , if we can say " Karl Rove , " " Siegelman , " that 'll be good for ratings .
Let 's hype it .
We 'll put out a news release on Thursday and then promo the hell out of it on Friday , Saturday , and Sunday . ' "
Video and audio of the interview follow .

Preface
Upon the establishment of the Foundation for Economic Education ( FEE ) in 1946 , Ludwig von Mises became a part - time adviser , and he served in that capacity until his death in 1973 .
Whenever FEE held a seminar in Irvington , if he was in town he would drive out from New York City , where he lived with his wife , Margit , to speak to the participants .
His topic was quite often inflation .
I attended all those lectures , took them down in shorthand and later transcribed them .
The thought occurred to me that eight to ten of his lectures on inflation , delivered in the 1960s , might be integrated , with the duplications deleted , and turned into a single piece .
Hence this paper .
Mises did not like to have his oral remarks quoted or published because , obviously , they did not represent the care and precision he devoted to his writings .
However , it does not seem to me that these lectures as I have edited them misrepresent his ideas in any way .
Moreover , they reveal his unpretentious manner and the informal simple style he used when talking to students .
He often rephrased an idea in several different ways , repeating it for emphasis .
He was frequently accused of being " simplistic , " of making economic subjects appear too clear and simple , but it was this very approach that made it possible for persons , even those without any background in economics , to understand and appreciate what he was saying .
BETTINA BIEN GREAVES , March 2001
Human Cooperation
Human cooperation is different from the activities that took place under prehuman conditions in the animal kingdom and among isolated persons or groups during the primitive ages .
The specific human faculty that distinguishes man from animal is cooperation .
Men cooperate .
That means that , in their activities , they anticipate that activities on the part of other people will accomplish certain things in order to bring about the results they are aiming at with their own work .
The market is that state of affairs under which I am giving something to you in order to receive something from you .
I do n't know how many of you have some inkling , or idea , of the Latin language , but in a Latin pronouncement 2,000 years ago already , there was the best description of the market — do ut des — I give in order that you should give .
I contribute something in order that you should contribute something else .
Out of this there developed human society , the market , peaceful cooperation of individuals .
Social cooperation means the division of labor .
The various members , the various individuals , in a society do not live their own lives without any reference or connection with other individuals .
Thanks to the division of labor , we are connected with others by working for them and by receiving and consuming what others have produced for us .
As a result , we have an exchange economy which consists in the cooperation of many individuals .
Everybody produces , not only for himself alone , but for other people in the expectation that these other people will produce for him .
This system requires acts of exchange .
The peaceful cooperation , the peaceful achievements of men are effected on the market .
Cooperation necessarily means that people are exchanging services and the products of services , goods .
These exchanges bring about the market .
The market is precisely the freedom of people to produce , to consume , to determine what has to be produced , in whatever quantity , in whatever quality , and to whomever these products are to go .
Such a free system without a market is impossible ; such a free system is the market .
We have the idea that the institutions of men are either ( 1 ) the market , exchange between individuals , or ( 2 ) the government , an institution which , in the minds of the many people , is something superior to the market and could exist in the absence of the market .
The truth is that the government — that is the recourse to violence , necessarily the recourse to violence — cannot produce anything .
Everything that is produced is produced by the activities of individuals and is used on the market in order to receive something in exchange for it .
It is important to remember that everything that is done , everything that man has done , everything that society does , is the result of such voluntary cooperation and agreements .
Social cooperation among men — and this means the market — is what brings about civilization and it is what has brought about all the improvements in human conditions we are enjoying today .
The Medium of Exchange — Money
The definition of money is very simple .
Money is the general medium of exchange used on the market .
Money , the medium of exchange , is something that individuals choose in order to facilitate the exchange of commodities .
Money is a market phenomenon .
What does that mean ?
It means that money developed on the market , and that its development and its functioning have nothing to do with the government , the state , or with the violence exercised by governments .
The market developed what is called indirect exchange .
The man who could n't get what he wanted on the market through direct exchange , through barter , took something else , something that was considered more easily negotiable , something which he expected to trade later for what he really wanted .
The market , the people on the market , the people in organizing the division of labor and bringing about the system in which one man produces shoes and another produces coats , brought about the system in which coats can be exchanged against shoes , but only practically on account of the difference of the importance and the value , by the intermediary of money .
Thus the market system made it possible for people who could not get today what they needed , what they wanted to buy on the market , to take , in return for what they brought to trade , a medium of exchange — that means something that was more easily used on the market than what they brought to the market to exchange .
With a medium of exchange , the originators of the exchange can attain satisfaction finally by acquiring those things which they themselves want to consume .
Money is a medium of exchange because people use it as such .
People do n't eat the money ; they ask for the money because they want to use it to give it away in a new contract .
And this barter or trade is technically possible only if there is a medium of exchange , a money , against which he can exchange what he has for the things he wants and needs .
All the mutual givings and receivings that take place on the market , all these mutual exchanges that lead to the development of money , are the voluntary achievements of individual people .
Through a long evolution , governments , or certain groups of governments , have promoted the idea that money is not simply a market phenomenon , but that it is whatever the government calls money .
But money is not what the government says .
The idea of money is that it is a medium of exchange ; somebody who sells something and is not in a position to exchange again immediately for the thing he wants to consume gets something else which he can exchange for this at a later date .
This " something else " is a medium of exchange , because the man who sells , let us say , chickens or eggs , does not , or can not get directly what he wants himself to consume , but must take something else which he uses at a later date in order to get what he needs .
If people say that money is not the most important thing in the world , they may be perfectly right from the point of view of the ideas that are responsible for the conduct of human affairs .
But if they say that money is not important , they do not understand what money does .
Money , the medium of exchange , makes it possible for everybody to attain what he wants by exchanging again and again .
He may not acquire directly the things he wants to consume .
But money makes it easier for the individual to satisfy his needs through other exchanges .
In other words , people first exchange what they have produced , for a medium of exchange , something which is more easily exchangeable than what they have produced ; then through later exchanges , they are able to acquire the things they want to consume .
And this is the service which money renders to the economic system ; it makes it easier for people to acquire the things they want and need .
The Role of the Courts and Judges Government interference with the market and with money occurs only in cases in which individuals are not prepared to do what they voluntarily promised to do .
Having chosen for himself the field in which he wants to work , he must barter or trade what he himself has produced in order to survive , in order to obtain the things he needs to live .
If the acts of exchange are such that not everybody gives and receives the goods and services contracted for at the same time , difficulties can arise .
The value and the meaning of the things which are given away and those which are received are never equal or identical , not only in size and quality but also , what is still more important , as to the time period over which an exchange is to be carried out .
If people enter into a contract , if both parties decide that something must be done immediately , there is as a rule no reason for any disagreement between the parties .
Both parties to the exchange receive immediately the thing they want to acquire for what they give away .
The whole act of exchange is then finished ; there are no further consequences .
But most exchanges are not of this kind .
In reality there are many exchanges wherein both parties do not have to deliver immediately what they are obligated to deliver .
If the parties to a contract , to an exchange , want to postpone the settlement , the execution , of their contract , differences of opinion can arise , some very serious differences of opinion , concerning the correctness of one or the other party 's contribution .
Translated from the more abstract language used by lawyers and economists , that means that if one man has entered into a contract with another man wherein he has promised to do something at a later date , the question may arise when that time comes whether this promise was really executed correctly according to the tenets of the contract .
Money is a medium of exchange , a phenomenon that developed out of the market .
Money is the result of an historical evolution that , in the course of many hundreds and thousands of years brought about the use of exchange through the intermediary of a medium of exchange .
Money is the generally accepted and generally used medium of exchange ; it is not something created by the government ; it is something created by the people buying and selling on the market .
But if people do n't comply with their voluntarily accepted agreements , then the government has to interfere .
And in any interference of the government , the government has to find out before it interferes whether there really was a violation of voluntarily entered contracts .
Such contracts are the results of agreements , and if the people do not comply with what they have promised then it is the state that has to interfere in order to prevent individuals from resorting to violence .
The government is called on to protect the market against people who do n't want to comply with the obligations which they have to fulfill under the market , and among these obligations is the obligation of making payments in definite sums of money .
If somebody wants to appeal for government interference against other people because these other people failed to comply with what they had accepted voluntarily as an agreement , then it is the duty of the government , of the courts , of the judges , to determine what money is and what it is not .
Now what governments did , what governments had done for thousands of years , we could say , is to misuse the position this gives them in order to declare as money what is not money , or what has a lower purchasing power per individual piece .
The market , the real social institution , the fundamental social institution , has one terrific weakness .
The weakness is not in the institution of the market but in the human beings who are operating on the market .
There are people who do not want to comply with the fundamental principle of the market — voluntary agreement and action according to voluntary agreement .
There are people who resort to violence .
And there are people who do not comply with the obligations which they have voluntarily accepted in agreement with other people .
The market , the fundamental human social institution cannot exist if there is not an institution that protects it against those people who either resort to violence or who are not prepared to comply with the obligations which they have voluntarily accepted .
This institution is the state , the police power of the state , the power to resort to violence in order to prevent other people , ordinary men , from resorting to violence .
Now , violence is a bad thing .
The fact that violence is necessary , that it is indispensable in some situations , such as in settling disputes concerning contracts , does not make the institution imposing the violence , the government , a good institution .
Nevertheless , the idea prevails , more or less throughout the whole world that , on the one hand , government , the institution that resorts to violence , is a great and a good thing , and that , on the other hand , the market , the system of voluntary social cooperation , though perhaps necessary — although most people do n't even realize this — is certainly not something which must be considered good .
Now everything that human action has achieved is the outcome of the voluntary cooperation of men .
What the government does , or what the government ought to do , is to protect these activities from people who do not comply with the rules that are necessary for the preservation of human society and all that it produces .
As a matter of fact , the government 's main function , or let us say even its only function , is to preserve the system of voluntary action or cooperation among people by preventing people from resorting to violence .
What the government has to do with respect to this medium of exchange is only to prevent people from refusing to comply with the commitments they have made .
This is not a function of building something ; it is a function of protecting those who are building .
Among the things refractory individuals sometimes do is to fail to fulfill their obligations under market agreements .
To say it very simply , an individual made an agreement , and yet this individual does not comply with his obligations under that agreement .
Then it is necessary to resort to government action .
What can you do if the other party to an agreement says , " Yes , I know .
I received something from you under an agreement by which I was bound to give you something in exchange .
But I shan't give it to you .
I am a bad man .
What can you do about it ?
You must just grin and bear it . "
Or it is possible that the person who has to deliver at a later time says , " I 'm sorry but I cannot , or I will not , deliver . "
This makes the whole market system of exchanges , the whole system based upon the voluntary actions of individuals , break down .
If a man has offered in a contract to deliver potatoes in three months , for instance , the question may come up when he delivers whether what he gives the buyer really is potatoes in the meaning of the contract .
The party who was bound to deliver potatoes may have delivered something that the second party does not consider potatoes .
Then the second party says , " When we made an agreement concerning potatoes we had something else in mind .
We had something in mind that had certain qualities which these potatoes do n't have . "
Then it is the duty of the government , of the judge whom the government appoints for this purpose , to find out whether or not these questionable potatoes are really what was understood by the contracting parties to be " potatoes . "
They must not be spoiled ; they must be of a certain character ; they must be potatoes according to commercial usage ; and so on .
They may be potatoes from the point of view of a professor of botany but not potatoes from the point of view of the businessman .
This is something which trade usage determines everywhere .
The judge cannot be familiar with everything that is going on in the world and , therefore , he very often needs the advice of an expert .
The expert must say whether or not the potatoes in question should really be considered the kind of potatoes meant in the agreement .
And then it is the business of the judge to consider the expert 's advice and to determine whether what has been delivered really is potatoes or whether they are something else .
Agreements concerning products such as potatoes — or anything else for that matter , wheat , for instance — which are made regularly on the market through the intermediary of a medium of exchange , popularly called " money , " can be violated , as we have seen , on the commodity side .
But they can also be violated on the side of the money .
That means that a conflict , a difference of opinion , may arise between the two parties to a contract concerning the money which has to be paid to comply with the contract .
And then the government , the judges , must determine whether what is offered under the name of money in this case is really what the people had in mind when they made the contract .
Government was not directly involved in the development of money ; the task of the government in this connection is simply to see that people fulfill the terms of their contracts with respect to the money .
Just as the judge can say what is , or what is not , meant in the contract by the term " potatoes " or " wheat , " so under special conditions , to preserve peaceful conditions in the country , the judge must determine what was meant when the parties to a contract mentioned " money . "
What did the people use as a medium of exchange ?
What did they have in mind in their contract when they said , " I will pay you certain units of ' money ' when you do what you have promised . "
Whether these units are called dollars , or thalers , or marks , or pounds does n't matter ; the government has only to find out what the meaning of the contract was .
This is what government has to decide .
The government does not have the power to call something " money " which the parties did n't have in mind as money when concluding their contract any more than it has the power to call non-potatoes " potatoes , " or to call a piece of iron , let us say , " copper . "
It is not that the government says what money is originally ; it is just that it must say what is meant by " money " in the case of the contract that is in conflict .
I have to say all these things in order to point out something people do not seem to know today , namely that money is not created by government .
People today do n't know this because the étatist , statist , ideas about the market and about money have destroyed knowledge of how money is created .
It is only in dealing with the problem of whether or not the money obligations in contracts have been filled that the government or , let us say , the judge , has anything to say about money .
It is only in this way that the government comes into touch , originally into touch , with money — just as it comes into touch with everything else , that is with potatoes , wheat , apples , motor cars , and so on .
Therefore , it is not true that money is something derived from the government , that the government is sovereign with regard to money , and that it can say what money is .
It is not true that the government 's relationship to money is different from what it is to other things .
Money is a product of market agreements just as is everything else that enters into exchange agreements .
If a judge were to say that whatever the government calls a horse is whatever the government calls a horse , and that the government has the right to call a chicken a horse , everybody would consider him either corrupt or insane .
Yet in the course of a very long evolution , the government has converted the situation that the government must settle disputes concerning the meaning of " money " as referred to in contracts , into another situation .
Over centuries many governments and many theories of law have brought about the doctrine that money , one side of most exchange agreements , is whatever the government calls money .
The governments are pretending to have the right to do what this doctrine tells them , that is to declare anything , even a piece of paper , " money . "
And this is the root of the monetary problem .
This makes it possible to do anything with money , to falsify it , or to debase it , in any way you want so long as you have the government , its judges and its executioners on your side .
And therefore a system developed which is very well known to everybody .
The government presumes that it is the government 's right , duty and privilege to declare what money is and to manufacture this money .
This system brings about a situation in which it is possible for the government to do anything it wants , anything that can be done with money .
And this creates a situation in which the government uses its power to print and to coin money for such purposes as increasing the means , the purchasing power , with which it appears on the market .
Gold as Money Now , we must realize that historically people everywhere used at the beginning a definite type of commodity as a medium of exchange .
Sometimes you find mentioned in books what kinds of goods and commodities were used in different countries at different ages as a general medium of exchange , as money .
People once chose various kinds of commodities as media of exchange , as intermediaries between sellers and buyers .
These commodities which they chose were commodities which were available in limited quantities only .
If something is available in sufficient quantity to meet all possible kinds of demand , or can be increased in quantity in such a way as to meet all possible kinds of demand , then it does n't have any value in exchange .
Only something that is available in a limited quantity can have exchange value , can be considered as valuable by people .
Over centuries traders eliminated everything else from among the various articles and commodities used as media of exchange until only the precious metals — gold and silver — remained .
All other commodities were eliminated as media of exchange .
When I say that the other things were eliminated from being used as money , what I mean is that people in making agreements eliminated them ; people in making agreements rejected other things as media of exchange and turned to using only gold and silver ; they specified gold and silver in the contracts they made when trading with other parties .
Thus we must realize that the evolution to gold and silver money was brought about by private persons .
Then silver also disappeared as a medium of exchange in the last centuries and the fact remained that the commodity gold was used as the medium of exchange .
The function of the government consisted of producing small pieces of this medium of exchange , the weight and content of which was determined by the government offices and acknowledged by the laws and by the courts .
I cannot enter into the whole history of money .
But what resulted was the gold standard .
The system of the gold standard , the gold exchange standard , is practically the only monetary system in the world .
This was not done by governments ; it was done through the market ; it was done by parties exchanging on the market .
In the history of money , which is identical with the history of government attempts to destroy money , we must distinguish two great periods .
And these two periods are not separated from one another by some monetary fact or by some specific monetary problem — they are separated from one another by the great invention made in the 15th century by a man named Gutenberg .
If the governments need more money — and they always need more money because they do n't earn it — the simplest way for them to increase the quantity of money since Gutenberg is just to print it .
Just as the government says " dollar " — but let us not use the term of a country with money which still functions today — let us say " ducats . "
You have agreed upon a definite quantity of ducats .
And then , because the government does n't want to restrict its expenditures , it declares : " What I have printed in my printing office , in my government printing office and called a Ducat is also a Ducat , the same thing as a gold Ducat . "
These things started when there were private banks to which the government gave privileges .
At the time you made this agreement a Ducat meant a definite quantity of gold .
But the government now says it is something else .
When the government does this , the situation is similar to what it would be if you agreed to deliver a horse to another party but instead of a horse you delivered a chicken , saying , " This is all right … I say that this chicken means a horse . "
It is such a system that destroys the markets , you know .
I want to say something about the reason why the gold standard was adopted in the first place and also why today it is considered as the only really sound system of money .
It is because gold alone makes the determination of the purchasing power of the monetary unit independent of the changes in ideas of governments and political parties .
Gold has one advantage .
It can not be printed .
It can not be increased ad libitum [ at pleasure ] .
If you think that you , or an institution with which you are connected does n't have enough gold money , you cannot do anything about it that would increase the quantity of gold money in a very simple and cheap way .
The reason why there is the gold standard , why the gold standard was accepted , is that an increase in the quantity of gold costs money .
Gold is restricted ; it is limited by nature ; the production of an additional quantity of gold is not cheaper than the acquisition of such a quantity by exchanges on the market .
That means that the metal gold was used as a medium of exchange .
Governments and writers for governments make fun of the fact that the world , the nations of the world , consider gold as money .
They say a lot of things against the gold standard .
But what they say is not what matters .
What matters is that , without any interference on the part of a central authority , without any government action , individuals chose gold as " money " through the process of trading on the market .
People make jokes about the uselessness of gold .
It is just a silly yellow metal .
We can't eat it , they say .
It is only good for dentists and for unimportant things like jewelry .
There are people who say , " Why gold ?
Why use precisely this yellow metal as money ?
Leave the gold to the dentists .
Do n't use it for monetary purposes . "
Now I do not have the right to talk about the dentists ; I use the dentists only as an illustration .
Whether they want the gold is another question .
Lord Keynes called the gold standard a " barbarous relic . "
Many books say that the government had to step in because the gold standard failed .
But the gold standard did n't fail !
The government abolished the gold standard by making it illegal to hold gold .
But still today , all international trade is calculated in gold .
Critics have no valid arguments against the gold standard because the gold standard works while the paper standard of the government does not work , not even in a way which the government itself considers satisfactory .
The advantage of this gold money system , as of every system of non-governmental money , is that an increase in the quantity of money does not depend on decisions of the government .
The advantage of the gold standard is that the quantity of gold available is independent of the actions , the wishes , the projects and , I would say , of the " crimes , " of the various governments .
Gold may not be an ideal money , certainly not ; there are no ideals in the world of reality .
But we can use gold as a medium of exchange because the quantity of gold is by and large limited and the production of additional quantities requires expenditures that do not influence the purchasing power of the already existing gold to a greater extent than such changes are occurring daily again and again in everything .
We can therefore live , we can therefore exist , with the system of gold money .
With gold money , there is no danger that a great revolution in prices will be brought about .
The advantage of the gold standard is not that gold is yellow and shiny and heavy , but on account of the fact that the production of gold , like the production of everything else , depends on actors who cannot be manipulated by the government in the way in which the government can manipulate the production of government paper money .
When the government prints a piece of paper , it does n't cost more to print " 100 " than it does to print " 10 " or " 1 " on this same piece of paper .
And the market situation , the situation for all human exchanges , the whole economic system is undermined , destroyed , by the governments when they consider it advisable to increase the quantity of money by increasing the quantity of government money .
The monetary crisis , the monetary problem which faces the world today is due to the fact that the governments think they are free to do anything they want with regard to money , you know .
Not only do individuals sometimes fail to fulfill promises they have made , but governments do the same .
They have already used practically all possible methods of trying to evade the necessity of paying what they have promised .
And this is the problem which we have now .
Legal tender legislation made it impossible for anybody to refuse to accept the paper money .
Gold clauses were written into some contracts by some people in the attempt to protect them against the legal tender laws which would force them to accept paper .
To give an example , there is a country in Europe , a very nice country with a great history , considered even today as one of the most civilized countries of the world .
I do n't want to give the name of the nation , but let us call it Utopia .
This country issued a loan , a public loan .
On every page of this loan there was inscribed : " This government promises to pay 20 pieces of Utopian gold money , that is a definite quantity of gold coins in the coinage of this nation , that amount in gold , or an equivalent quantity in American dollars redeemable in gold according to the McKinley standard . "
The man who bought this obligation , this letter of indebtedness , would have said : " I am really protected against all accidents .
It has happened in the past that a country did not pay the same weight of gold which it had promised to pay .
But now I have the promise not only of being paid in gold , but I also have the power to choose .
I can ask them to pay me in the Utopian national currency , or the equivalent in American dollars , which are redeemable in gold . "
Then in 1933 the United States changed the " price " of gold , as you know ; it reduced the ratio of gold to the U.S. dollar .
In 1935 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that , as the bondholders had received payment in legal tender notes , they could not show damage and would not be paid in gold .
This country of Utopia said , " We also accept this new ' price . '
We will pay you , the bondholder , only the lower quantity of gold according to the new American law , a law which did n't exist at the time we sold you this obligation when we bound ourselves to pay to you . "
That means the right of governments concerning money is considered as something quite special today , something which is not subject to the general conditions and practices of the market economy .
This precisely is the reason for the monetary problem which we now have .
All this was possible only on account of the fact that government is the institution that determines what the agreements between the citizens mean , what the content of these agreements are .
Government has the power to force people who , according to their government 's declaration , do not comply with their agreement to pay the sums required .
And as the government assumes , necessarily , that the courts should have the power to declare whether or not the parties have complied with an agreement concluded between them , so do the governments presume that they alone have the power to declare what money is and what money is not .
Just as the courts have to determine if there is a conflict between the parties to an agreement as to whether a certain thing referred to in a contract is wool , for instance , or is not wool , so do the governments presume to say whether a certain thing is money or is not money of a certain definite quantity .
And in this way , again and again , governments have destroyed the markets of the world .
And in destroying the markets they have gone so far as to destroy completely the system of money , making it necessary to develop a new monetary system .
What we have to realize is this :
Every kind of human arrangement is connected in some way or other with money payments .
And , therefore if you destroy the monetary system of a country or of the whole world , you are destroying much more than simply one aspect .
When you destroy the monetary system , you are destroying in some regards the basis of all interhuman relations .
If one talks of money , one talks about a field in which governments were doing the very worst thing which could be done , destroying the market , destroying human cooperation , destroying all peaceful relations between men .
The fact is that with the gold standard it is possible to have a monetary standard that cannot be destroyed by the governments .
There is no reason to give to the governments greater influence over monetary problems .
While it is really absolutely correct to say that it is just an accident that it is precisely gold and not something else that serves this monetary purpose , the fact is that with the gold standard it is impossible for governments to destroy the monetary system .
On the other hand , there is nothing easier for governments to do than to destroy a system of money which is based upon too much confidence in the government .
Gold Inflation
The gold standard is due to an accident , a geological accident , I would say , that there is only a limited quantity available .
Because its quantity is limited , it has value on the market so that we can deal with it as money .
The main thing with regard to money is the question , how to restrict , how not to increase , its quantity .
You know gold too can increase in quantity even if you have the gold standard .
In the last 200 years it happened again and again that the increase , that the discovery of new fields in which gold , additional quantities of gold , could be produced , brought about a slight drop in the purchasing power of every gold unit as against the purchasing power of the gold unit which would have remained in the absence of this new discovery .
This same tendency toward higher prices was then brought about not only by an increase in the quantity of paper money but also by an increase in the quantity of precious metals .
For instance , in the years 1848 to 1849 , there was discovered gold in California and Australia .
For a definite period a new quantity of gold , above the regular yearly increase in the production of gold , was flowing into the market .
Lots of people went to these gold fields , tried to mine gold , and when they did find gold they spent it .
The result , therefore , was that these gold miners took away from the markets more produced goods than they had taken before .
If , for instance , a poor man , who had not formerly consumed very much , went to California or Australia , and had some success in gold mining , he was then able to buy things with his gold and to live in a very comfortable manner .
Within a very short time , within a few months or years , there developed towns in California , places where the gold miners lived very agreeable lives .
The gold miners received in exchange for the gold real things .
Where only a short time before there had been nothing but forests and swamps , there were cities , houses , furniture and imported bottles of champagne .
And where did all these things come from ?
From the rest of the world .
And what did the rest of the world , the producers and suppliers of the goods and services get in exchange for the things the gold miners bought ?
Higher prices !
They received gold , of course , but they had to pay more for the things they wanted to buy .
The effect of these great gold discoveries was that the purchasing power of each individual piece of gold was now lower than it would have been in the absence of the gold discoveries .
You can , if you want , call it " inflation ; " it brought about effects similar to those of a paper money inflation .
That is , in the middle of the 19th century the new gold discoveries brought about what people considered at that time as a price revolution , or something like that .
But the production of additional money , gold money , was limited ; it was almost without any quantitative influence upon the great markets of the whole world .
When the only real money which was used was gold money or bills which were redeemable , convertible into gold , bills giving you the right to get a quantity of money , then as the quantity of gold was increasing , there was a drop in its purchasing power .
And adjustments were taking place which were necessary in order to bring this in order .
But this drop in purchasing power was limited because the additional quantities of gold were very soon integrated into the whole monetary system and there were no farther extraordinary increases in the quantity of money .
Now these gold discoveries are exceptional cases and we do not have to deal with them .
People may make jokes about the gold standard , suggesting that one should leave the gold to the dentists , that gold is absolutely unnecessary for money , and that besides it is a waste of money and work to use as money something that has to be produced at such a high cost as gold .
But the gold standard has one quality , one virtue ; it is that gold cannot be printed , and that gold cannot be produced in a cheaper way by any governmental committee , institution , office , international office , or so on .
This is the only justification for the gold standard .
One has tried again and again to find some method to substitute these qualities of gold in some other way .
But all these methods have failed , and will ever fail precisely as long as the governments are committed to the idea that it is all right for a government that has not collected enough money to pay its expenses by taxing its citizens , or from borrowing on the market , that it is all right for such a government to increase the quantity of money simply by printing it .
Now there is a doctrine that says there is not enough gold .
The reason why these critics of gold are against the gold standard is due to their belief that the quantity of money must be increased .
Now the quantity of money adjusts itself necessarily through prices to the demands of the public .
Yet , there are authors , professors , textbook writers , who tell us there is not enough money and they suggest a paper currency and regular yearly increases in the quantity of money .
They do n't know what they are talking about .
Some of these textbook authors give another figure in every new edition of their textbooks by which they want to increase the quantity of money .
In one edition they say 5 % , in the next edition they say 8 % , and so on .
If a professor says that we should have a paper currency and that every year the government should add 8 % , or 10 % , or 5 % additional new money , he does not give us a full description of what has to be done .
This is perhaps an interesting fact to help us realize , let us say , the mentality of these authors , but it is not the problem which we have to deal with .
The question is how the government should bring this money into circulation , to whom should it be given .
What we have to realize is that the increase in the quantity of money cannot be neutral with regard to the conditions of the various individuals .
It is , of course , rather puzzling that one has no other method of organizing the system of exchanges than by the use of a definite metal , a yellow metal , gold .
One may ask the question : " What would have happened if there had n't been any gold ? "
Or one may ask the question : " What will happen one day , " nobody can say anything today about it , " if people discover a method to produce gold at such a cheap price that gold will no longer be useful for the monetary purpose ? "
To this question , I answer : " Ask me again when this is the case . "
Perhaps —
I do n't know , nobody knows — perhaps one day people will discover a method of producing gold out of nothing , or , let us say , out of non-gold .
Perhaps gold will become as plentiful as air , and free to everyone .
If everyone could have as much gold as he wanted , it would have no value on the market .
No one would then be willing to take such a value - less commodity in trade for other goods or services and it would not then become a " medium of exchange . "
If you have sleepless nights and have nothing else to think about , you could think about what will happen , you know , if one day gold could be produced in such a cheap way as , let us say , paper can be produced today .
It could happen !
But nobody thinks it will happen .
It probably will not happen .
But if it does happen then people will have to deal with the new problem .
And perhaps they will solve it ; perhaps they will not solve it ; we do n't know that today .
But it is useless today to speculate what will happen , if this should happen .
And as we do n't know anything about what the conditions will be at that time , we can say , " Let us wait .
Let us wait to see whether really one day gold will be so abundant that it can no longer serve monetary purposes . "
All right .
If this should happen , the people living then — at that time — would have a problem to solve .
But today we have another problem .
Our problem is to keep the quantity of money from being increased and its purchasing power from being decreased through inflation .
Inflation
The first rule , or the only rule which we have to teach to everybody in explaining the problems of money is that an increase in the quantity of money brings about for the group , for the people , for the society , for the king , for the emperor who does it , a temporary improvement of the situation .
But if so , why do it today only and not repeat it tomorrow ?
This is the only question .
And this is the problem of inflation .
The problem is not to increase the quantity of money .
The problem is to increase the quantity of those things which can be bought with money .
And if you are increasing the quantity of money , and you are not increasing the quantity of things which can be bought with money , you are only increasing the prices which are paid for them .
And in time , if the increase in money continues , the whole system becomes a system without any meaning and really without any possible method of dealing with it .
Unfortunately we are living in a period in which many governments say , if we do n't have enough money for something and if we do n't want to tax people because the people do n't want to pay taxes for this purpose , then let us add a little bit , a little bit of paper money , not very much , just a little bit , you know .
I would like to attack the problem from another point of view and say : " There is nothing in the world less fit to serve as money than paper , printed paper . "
Nothing is cheaper .
And practically what we have to say is that the governments are destroying the whole economic system of the market economy by destroying the monetary system .
One could compare this printing of paper money , and people have , with what has happened in the field of the use of various drugs .
Just as when you start to use certain drugs you do n't know when to stop nor how to stop , it is the same with the printing of paper money , the governments do n't know when nor how to stop .
Prices are going up because there is an additional quantity of money , asking , searching for a not - increased quantity of commodities .
And the newspapers or the theorists call the higher prices , " inflation . "
But the inflation is not the higher prices ; the inflation is the new money pumped into the market .
It is this new money that then inflates the prices .
And the government asks , " What happened ?
How should one man know ?
How should I , the man in the department of finance , know that this additional money is really spent and that this spending must raise prices because the quantity of goods did not increase ? "
The government is very innocent .
It does n't know what happened , you know , because this happened in another department of the government .
And the governments try to find somebody who is responsible — but not the government .
They consider the man who asks for higher prices responsible .
But he must ask for higher prices because there are now more people wanting to buy his produce , you know .
He has 100 units to sell each at 5 pieces of money .
And now people are coming — not with 500 but with 600 pieces of money in their pockets — and the buyers must , therefore , in order to prevent other men from getting the things they want , pay higher prices .
Now we have the inflation .
Years ago , many , many years ago — 60 years ago — I wrote my first essay dealing with the problems of money .
It was a study about the inflation in Austria and the way in which one day the government decided to abandon the inflation and to return to stable money in spite of the very heavy opposition of the party that was dedicated to the brilliant old system of inflation .
I gave this essay to my teacher , Böhm - Bawerk , for publication in his economic magazine which he published with some friends .
And one of his friends , a former Minister of Finance , Dr. Ernst von Plener , having read the manuscript , invited me to talk with him about the manuscript , about the problem .
He was very interested in view of the fact that he was one of the Ministers of Finance dealt with in this essay .
We had a very interesting conversation and at the end of this conversation , Dr. von Plener said , " It 's a very interesting study that you have given to our magazine .
But I am astonished that a young man like you is interested in a problem of the past like inflation .
There was really , in the 19th century , in almost every country of the world , inflation .
But it will not return .
This will never come again .
Can you imagine that the British Empire , Germany , France , the United States , will go off the gold standard ?
No ! Impossible !
And the fact that these countries will keep to the gold standard will force all the other nations also to remain with the gold standard . "
I said , " I would like to be of your opinion .
But as I look around in the literature about money and what is being written and published every day , also in the United States , also in England , and so on , about this problem , then I see , or I believe I see , a tendency toward a return to these problems of inflation . "
And I think I was right !
Twenty years later , after the First World War , after all those things that had happened after the War , Dr. von Plener told me , " Remember our conversation .
You were right and I was wrong .
But your opinion would have been better advice for these countries . "
I admitted that without any difficulty .
And I would have to admit it today again .
In the years after the First World War , American economists frequently visited Vienna and I had the pleasure of talking with them , and explaining inflation and conditions as they prevailed at that time in Austria and in other European countries .
And , as you know , when people are talking about economic problems , they are talking and talking until finally it is late in the evening , very late in the evening .
And so it was .
Then I told them , " I will now give you an explanation as to why conditions in the country are not so satisfactory .
I will take you for a little walk to the center of the city , past a definite building . "
This was at 11 o'clock or midnight .
And we went .
It was very quiet .
But then they heard a noise , the sound of the printing machines that were printing banknotes day and night for the government .
The result in Vienna was very modest you know ; the American dollar which had been five Austrian crowns became 14,000 or 17,000 Austrian crowns .
The inflation was bad , you are right .
But this was a very modest inflation ; the achievement of inflation in Germany was much greater you know .
It took billions of marks you know to make one U.S. dollar .
You consider this a joke , but it was a tragedy of course .
For the people whose property it destroyed , it was a catastrophe .
Inflation today is probably the most important phenomenon in political life and political conditions .
Fortunately there is still in this country , and I hope it will succeed one day , a very reasonable opposition against inflationary measures .
But for many governments it is simply a question of being in a situation of needing more money and they think it is perfectly reasonable to increase the quantity of money .
If we want to have a system of money that works and operates , one must not increase the quantity of money without realizing at every step that one is approaching a very dangerous point , the point at which the whole thing breaks down .
You will say that this is something very general ; what reference does it have to the problems of daily policies , monetary policies .
It has a very important reference .
The reference is that when you are operating with something that can be a deadly poison , not always but it can be , then you must be very careful .
You must be very careful not to go to a certain point .
This is something which one may also say about all the medicines that influence the nerves and minds of people .
The doctor saves the lives of some people by giving them some chemical in a quantity which he precisely determines and knows .
And if the quantity were increased up to a certain point , then the same chemical would be a deadly poison .
We have a similar situation with inflation .
Where does inflation start ?
It starts as soon as you increase the quantity of money .
And where does the danger point begin ?
That is another problem .
The question cannot be answered precisely .
People must realize that you cannot give a statesman advice : " This is the point up to which you may go and beyond this point you may not go , and so on , you know . "
Life is not as simple as that .
But what we have to realize , what we have to know when we are dealing with money and monetary problems , is always the same .
We have to realize that the increase in the quantity of money , the increase of those things which have the power to be used for monetary purposes , must be restricted at every point .
The real problem is that we have a quantity of money in most countries , including the United States , a quantity that is continually increasing .
And the effect of this increase is that prices of commodities and services are going up and people are asking for higher wages .
And the government says this is " an inflationary pressure . "
I see this word a hundred times everyday in the newspapers , but I do n't know what " an inflationary pressure " is .
There is no such thing as " an inflationary pressure . "
Nothing is inflationary except an increase in the quantity of money .
Either there is an increase in the quantity of money , or there is no increase in the quantity of money .
There is a practical solution from the theoretical point of view — the gold standard .
As long as we are using as a medium of exchange the precious metal gold , we have under present day conditions no special problems to deal with .
But as soon as we are increasing the quantity of paper money , as soon as we say , " A little bit more , it does n't matter , and so on , " then we are entering a field in which the problems become very different .
We can have today a rather satisfactory system of monetary payments when we accept the idea that gold can be used as a medium of exchange without any restrictions .
But then we may say theoretically from the point of view of clear fine theories , this is not very satisfactory .
Perhaps !
But it is very satisfactory from the point of view of the operation of a monetary system and the market .
And this is what counts .
Inflation Destroys Savings
Everything that is done by a government against the purchasing power of the monetary unit is , under present conditions , done against the middle classes and the working classes of the population .
Only these people do n't know it .
And this is the tragedy .
The tragedy is that the unions and all these people are supporting a policy that makes all their savings valueless .
And this is the great danger of the whole situation .
The conditions under which people are living in the industrial countries of the west , which today means in practically all the countries where the standard of civilization has made some progress since the 16th or 17th century , the masses are in a position , fortunately , in the years in which they are able to work , in which they are in full health , to provide for the state of affairs as it will prevail in later years when they will either be absolutely unfit to work or when their capacity to work will have decreased on account of old age or other changes .
Under conditions as they are today , these people can only provide for their old age practically by either entering into labor contracts which give them a pension for their later age , or they can save a part of their income and invest it in such a way that they can use it in later years .
These investments can be either simple savings deposits with banks , or they can be life insurance policies or bonds , for instance , government bonds which appear in many countries as perfectly safe .
In all these cases the future of these people who are providing in this way for their old age , for their families and children is closely connected with the purchasing power of the monetary unit .
The man who owns an agricultural estate , the producer of oil or of foods , or the businessman who owns a factory is in a different position .
When the prices of the products which he is selling go up on account of the inflation , he will not be hurt in the same way in which other people are hurt by the inflation .
The owner of common stock will see that , by and large , most of this common stock is going up in price to the same degree as the prices of commodities are going up on account of the inflation .
But it is different for people with fixed incomes .
The man who retired 25 years ago with a yearly pension , let us say of $ 3,000 , was by and large in a good situation or was believed to be in a good situation .
But this was at a time when prices were much lower than they are today .
I do n't want to say any more about this situation and the consequences and effects of inflation for the people .
What I want to point out is that the greatest problem today is precisely this , although the people do n't realize it .
The danger is due to the fact that people consider inflation as something which hurts other people .
They realize very well that they too have to suffer because the prices of the commodities they are buying go up continually , but they do n't realize fully that the greatest danger for them is precisely the progress of inflation and the effect it will have on the value of their savings .
All over Europe today you see unrest due to the fact that the European masses are discovering that they have been the losers in all these financial operations which their own governments have considered as a very wonderful thing .
And , therefore , also from the point of view of making it possible for the masses to enjoy the improvement of economic conditions and to make them partners , real partners , in the great development of industrial production that is going on practically now already in all countries of Europe and North America , even including Mexico , it is necessary to abandon the policy of inflation .
The great unrest that is today characteristic of everything that is going on in Europe , the revolutionary ideas of the masses , especially of the sons of the middle classes who are studying at the universities , are due to the fact that the European governments , with the exception perhaps of the government of the little country Switzerland and other such very small countries , have in the last sixty years again and again embarked upon a policy of limitless inflation .
When talking about conditions in France , one should not overlook what inflation actually means .
The French were right when , in the nineteenth century and in the beginning of our century , they declared that the social stability and the welfare of France is to a great extent based upon the fact that the masses of the French population are owners of government - issued bonds and therefore consider the financial welfare of the country , of the government , as their own financial advantage .
And now this has been destroyed .
Frenchmen who were not in business themselves , i.e. , the majority of the population , were fanatical savers .
All their savings were destroyed when the tremendous inflation reduced the value of the franc to practically nothing .
The French franc may not have declined completely to zero , but for a Frenchman , who had $ 100 before and then had only one dollar — for such a Frenchman , the difference was not very great .
Only a very few people can still consider themselves owners of some property when their property is reduced to 1 % of what it was before .
In talking about inflation , we should not forget that over and above the consequences of destroying a country 's monetary standard , there is the danger that depriving the masses of their savings will make them desperate .
For decades there were only a very few who would agree with me in this position .
Even so , I was astonished to read today in Newsweek that the majority of the people in the nation are not interested in the preservation of the purchasing power of the monetary unit .
Unhappily , the article did not say that the destruction of the savings of the masses was a much more serious matter than the " famous " war now being waged on poverty .
It is ridiculous for the government to finance a " war on poverty " by taxing , inflating , and spending , and so sacrificing the savings of the masses who are trying to improve themselves through their own efforts .
This is one of the many contradictions which we have in our political , not our economic , system .
To explain what I have in mind , consider the dreadful contradiction of the American government when it says : " We have to wage a war against poverty .
Certainly many people are poor and we must make them wealthier . "
And yet this government taxes the people in order to make bread more expensive .
You will say , " So , bread is more expensive ; this is an exception . "
But it is not an exception !
The American government spends also billions of tax money in order to make cotton more expensive .
Cotton goods are certainly not luxury goods ; they are perhaps luxury goods when compared with bread , but the government does the same thing , it follows the same policy , with bread .
The real war on poverty was the " industrial revolution " and the industrialization of modern factories .
At the beginning of the nineteenth century , shoes and stockings were luxury items for most of the people of continental Europe ; they were not articles of daily wear .
And the condition of these people was not improved by taxing , by taking money or shoes from the rich to give to the poor .
It was the shoe industry , not the riches of the government , that improved the condition of the poor , that made a revolutionary change in the peoples ' condition .
A statesman may say , " If I had more money to spend I could do things which would make me very popular in my country . "
The government tries to make itself popular by doing these things , but the technique it uses is to spend ; and then it tries to ascribe to itself the good results of an expenditure .
An expenditure is not always good .
Sometimes an expenditure is just buying bombs and throwing them into a foreign country .
But if the expenditure is beneficial , let us say if it makes it possible to improve some things in the country , then the statesman says , " Look , you never had such a wonderful life as you have under my regime .
There are some bad people , some inflationists , some people who are profiteers , but I have nothing to do with them .
This is not my fault . "
And so on .
Our economic situation depends largely on the relation of the government and the ruling political party or parties to the labor unions .
We have " inflation , " in the sense of higher prices , built into our economic system because the unions every year , every two years , or in exceptional cases every three years , ask for higher wages .
The great majority of workers want continually higher wages and they assume wages can be manipulated ad libitum , at will , by the government .
The unions have the power , by using violence , with the aid of certain laws and of certain institutions in Washington , to force people to agree to their wage demands .
If wages do not continue to go up , no one knows what will happen .
The only possible solution to the inflation problem is an open opposition to the unions and to the idea that higher money wages are the only means for improving the condition of the masses .
Union members should also realize that their conditions would improve if the money prices of the things they wanted to buy went down , even if their money wages did not rise .
I do not want to say anything more about this problem except to add that the government started it when it began to increase the quantity of money by printing it .
To give an example of how inflation destroys savings , there was in a European country a poor boy educated in an asylum for orphans , very well educated because when he had finished school and his life in the orphanage he emigrated to the United States .
In the course of a long life he accumulated a considerable fortune by producing and selling something which was very successful .
When he died , after living 45 years in the United States , he left a considerable fortune of $ 2,000,000 .
Not everybody leaves such a fortune .
this was certainly exceptional .
This man made a will according to which this $ 2,000,000 was to be sent back to Europe to establish another orphan asylum such as that in which this man had been educated .
This was just before World War I .
The money was sent back to Europe .
According to the usual procedure it had to be invested in government bonds of this country , interest to be paid every year to keep up the asylum .
But the war came , and the inflation .
And the inflation reduced to zero this fortune of $ 2,000,000 invested in European Marks — simply to zero .
To give another example , a German who in 1914 owned a fortune which was the equivalent of US $ 100,000 had left from that fortune nine years later one - half cent perhaps , something like that , or five cents — it does n't make any difference ; he had lost everything .
And there were similar experiences in the European universities .
For instance , lots of foundations were set up in the course of centuries by people who wanted to make it possible for poor boys to study at the university and to achieve what they had achieved from the good education they had gotten at these universities .
And what happened ?
In all these countries , in Germany , France , Austria and Italy , there came great inflations .
And these inflations again destroyed these investments .
For whose benefit ?
For the benefit , of course , of the government .
And what did the government do with the money ?
It spent it ; it threw it away .
People still believe , however , that destroying the value of the monetary unit is something that does not hurt the masses .
But it does hurt the masses .
And it hurts them first .
There is no better way to bring about a tremendous revolution than to destroy the savings of the masses which are invested in savings deposits , insurance policies , and so on .
An example of what I mean was furnished by the president of a bank in Vienna .
He told me that as a young man in his twenties he had taken out a life insurance policy much too large for his economic condition at the time .
He expected that when it was paid out it would make him a well - to - do burgher .
But when he reached his sixtieth birthday , the policy became due .
The insurance , which had been a tremendous sum when he had taken it out thirty five years before , was just sufficient to pay for the taxi ride back to his office after going to collect the insurance in person .
Now what had happened ?
Prices went up , yet the monetary quantity of the policy remained the same .
He had in fact for many , many decades made savings .
For whom ?
For the government to spend and devastate .
If you talk about a catastrophe of the money , you need not always have in mind a total breakdown of the currency system .
Such a thing did occur in this country in 1781 with the so - called " Continental Currency . "
And it occurred in many other countries later , for instance , the most famous inflation , the breakdown of the German mark currency in 1923 .
These changes are not the same , nor to the same degree in various countries .
But one should not exaggerate the difference in the effects brought about by the greater inflations as against the smaller inflations .
The effects of the " smaller inflations " are also bad .
We must realize that in the market economy , in the capitalistic system , all interhuman relations that are not simply personal and intimate , all interpersonal relations , are expressed , made , counted in money terms .
A change in the purchasing power of money affects everybody and not in such a way that you can say it is beneficial if the purchasing power of the money is going up or down .
All our relationships , the relations between individuals and the state , and between individuals and other individuals , are based on money .
And this is true not only for the capitalistic countries .
It is true for all kinds of conditions .
For instance , in predominantly agricultural countries in which the small - or medium - sized farm prevails , it is usual , necessarily usual , that at the death of the owner of such a farm , one of his children takes over the farm and the other children , the brothers and sisters inherit only a part of the farm .
The man who gets the farm has to pay to the others in the course of his life , step - by - step , the share of the inheritance which is theirs .
That means that the man who inherits the farm gets no more and no less than the other members of the family .
But when this is arranged by transferring the property to one heir and giving the others claims in money terms against this heir , claims to be settled in the course of the years , this means that everyday , if there is an inflation in progress , the share of the man who got the farm is increasing and the shares of the other brothers and sisters are sinking .
We have had in this country , continually now for several years , an outspoken inflationary increase in the quantity of circulating money .
However , conditions are influenced by this situation .
There has been a general rise in prices .
You hear about it ; you read about it ; people compare prices and talk about it enough .
Yet I should n't exaggerate what has happened already to the dollar .
What has happened to the dollar is still not something that makes a catastrophe unavoidable .
If you were to go to certain other countries — Brazil or Argentina , for instance — you would be in a country which also has inflation , but a much bigger inflation .
And if you ask a man in Brazil what he considers a stable money which does not drop in purchasing power , he would say , " The U. S. dollar … that 's wonderful ! "
Of course , when compared with his country 's money .
The problem of money , the practical problem of money today in the whole world is precisely this :
The governments believe that in the situation which I have pointed out before , when there is a choice between an unpopular tax and a very popular expenditure , there is a way out for them — the way toward inflation .
This illustrates the problem of going away from the gold standard .
Money is the most important factor in a market economy .
Money was created by the market economy , not by the government .
It was a product of the fact that people substituted step - by - step a common medium of exchange for direct exchange .
If the government destroys the money , it not only destroys something of extreme importance for the system , the savings people have set aside to invest and to take care of themselves in some emergency ; it also destroys the very system itself .
Monetary policy is the center of economic policy .
So all the talk about improving conditions , about making people prosperous by credit expansion , by inflation , is futile !
Inflation and Government Controls Human cooperation can be organized according to two different models .
One is the model of absolute rule by one ruler only , the socialist model — everything is organized under the leadership of a leader , der Führer .
The term is not very much used in the Anglo - Saxon language because people did not think of it as a system that can really work .
But in the countries in which socialism prevails the term , der Führer , the leader , is very well known .
In those countries everything depends upon this autocratic regime ; everybody has to obey the orders issued from one central authority .
People who like the system call it " order ; " people who do n't like it call it " slavery . "
This system in which people must obey the orders issued from a central authority is very well known to anybody who has served in an army .
For the army , it is the only possible system .
If one criticizes the centralized system , we must not forget that it is suitable only for a special purpose , for the special end which it can attain .
The characteristic of the market is that government does not issue orders that the people must obey ; it does not control prices ; prices and wages are determined by demand and supply on the market .
This system is the system that brought about the constitutions and all those commodities and services which together can be called modern civilized life .
The opposite of the market is the abolition of the market and its substitution by the socialist or communist state .
That means planning , central planning , where everything is determined by decrees and orders of the government .
Government officials cannot ignore public opinion ; they cannot ignore the ideas and practices of the people .
The government is never in a position to make any laws it wants .
It can not afford to take into consideration only the views of the people who are running the government .
So laws tend to follow accepted practices and theories .
And that is true in the field of money too .
With respect to money , government must accept and acknowledge the money that has evolved out of the actions and ideas of individuals .
Let us take the following political situation .
The government wants to spend more than it has spent up to yesterday , but it does n't have the money .
And it does n't want to tax more , or for political reasons it simply cannot tax more .
Nor can it borrow the money , because from their point of view conditions for borrowing appear unsatisfactory .
The government wants to spend more and does n't want to tax the people .
The government wants to appear as Santa Claus , which is a very agreeable situation , a more popular situation than that of a tax collector .
Therefore , the government does not tax the people to get the money for its new expenditure ; it inflates ; it prints the money .
The important point to remember regarding inflation is that , while the money in circulation is increased , other things remain unchanged .
This inflation is very cheap , you know ; it is a very cheap procedure .
What happens then ?
Prices go up .
The government , of course , wants a way out , a solution , so it is apt to try price - fixing .
The government fails to recognize the fact that if the public really obeys its price - fixing orders , sellers will sell their entire supply of commodities to regular customers at the former or fixed prices with the result that those into whose pockets the additional money goes will find nothing to buy .
I want to give a typical example of how government price controls work .
In the First World War and again in the Second , the German government and the English , among others , embarked upon inflation as a means of financing the war .
The addition of new money to that already in circulation brought about an up - trend in prices which the government did not like .
The government wanted business as usual .
But it was obviously not business as usual .
Therefore , the German government , as well as others , resorted to price controls .
Now , if prices are fixed below what they would have been in the unhampered market , high cost producers are bound to suffer losses .
The government starts , let us say , by fixing the price of milk .
As a result , the higher - cost producers cease bringing milk to the market and convert their milk into other end products , butter , for example .
Thus , the quantity of milk on the market not only does not increase , but actually decreases , precisely the opposite of what the government wanted .
The government wanted milk to be more readily available to the average family , but the quantity of milk decreases .
When the government approaches the producers for an explanation , their answer is that they would have suffered losses in producing milk because of the price they had to pay , let us say for fodder , and , therefore , they turned their milk production into butter for which there was no fixed maximum price .
The government then price - fixes fodder .
And then the same story is repeated with fodder .
Thus , the government continues step - by - step until it reaches what the Germans in the First World War referred to as the " Hindenburg Plan , " a complete socialization of everything .
The German government broke down at the end of the War .
But several years later the Brüning government reinstated price controls which Hitler carried to their final conclusion .
Price controls transformed private ownership and private production into a system of complete government control of everything .
German communism , national socialism , under Hitler did not legally expropriate the owners of the means of production , but every economic step was determined by government .
There were still entrepreneurs , although the name " entrepreneurs " was eliminated ; they were called " shop managers . "
They were at the head of business organizations , but they had to comply completely and exactly with the government orders .
They had to buy raw materials at prices set by government , sell to other firms at prices determined by government , and employ workers assigned to them by government .
There is no third economic system which makes it possible on the one hand to have a free market and on the other hand to avoid socialism or communism .
Interference with the market inevitably brings about effects which , from the point of view of the interfering authorities , are even worse than the state of affairs they wanted to alter .
In order to make the system work the authorities go farther step - by - step until they bring about a situation under which the initiative of everybody else is destroyed , and everything depends on the authorities , upon the leadership of government .
The reason we do not have price controls here today is because of the experiences in other countries .
Again and again the government repeats that we need to control prices .
Yet it does not tell the cigarette manufacturers that it is forbidden for them to raise the price of a pack by one cent .
Instead the government tries to talk with the cigarette manufacturers and with the representatives of a thousand other firms so as to pressure them .
While the government has not as yet embarked on price control it has n't really done anything to prevent the present system from operating in a way it does not like .
As a matter of fact , quite the contrary .
It has built inflation into our present system — inflation even in the popularly - accepted meaning in which the government uses the term , that is higher prices .
We see , therefore , that the problem of money is much more than only the problem of the organization of the market .
The market is today fighting for its independence and existence .
The government tries to interfere with the market and we are now just one day , one year , nobody knows how far away from what is called control of prices .
And that means the abolition of the market .
Money , Inflation , and War Now , one may say that there are situations when the government is forced to increase the quantity of money , when it is the highest wisdom on the part of the government to proceed in this way .
Such a situation would be when the country is menaced by invasion by foreign armies .
What can the government do then ?
It must spend more .
And as the people are not paying enough in taxes and the government can't tax them any more because they do n't have more money , the government has to print money .
To see if this reasoning is correct , let us now talk about historical problems .
What does this mean that there are some situations in which you cannot avoid inflating ?
One talks about one particular case — war !
Now , please !
In a war governments needs armaments and various other things in order to defend the country — I do n't want to enumerate them .
All these things must be produced and they cost money .
If the citizens are not prepared to supply the armaments or to give the money to pay for the armaments , then their country will be defeated in the war , and the country will become dependent .
But an increase in the quantity of paper money does not change this .
There can be certain conditions under which the government inflated and you can say the situation was such that the alternative to inflation , to increasing the quantity of money , was also very bad .
When the American colonies were fighting against England in the War of Independence , they proceeded to inflation .
The alternative , let us assume , would have been defeat , because certainly in the eyes of the men responsible for this inflation , for this increase in the quantity of money , this was the alternative .
You can say that , if it was really possible to preserve the independence of what later became the United States through inflation , then the inflation was justified .
The catastrophe could n't be avoided then .
But the catastrophe , the breakdown of this currency in 1781 after the Revolutionary War , did not mean the same thing that it would have meant years later when the economic conditions changed .
In the years of the Revolutionary War the American colonies were a predominantly agricultural country ; most of the people were owners or workers of an agricultural piece of land and could survive the catastrophe which the breakdown of the American currency , the Continental Currency , meant after the Revolutionary War .
Getting food was not then a matter of going to the market .
They did n't use money to buy food or hardly any other things .
When the Continental government inflated in 1781 , the man who had a small farm and who worked with his family on this farm and had a few dollars , he lost these few dollars because of the inflation , but that did n't affect him very much .
Therefore , the whole problem of inflation was only of minor importance for the Americans at the end of the Revolutionary War .
We cannot compare conditions today in the United States with those in the United States of 1781 .
Today we no longer have the simple system which existed at that time under which the money economy meant very little for most people .
We have had other such examples in the past .
But under the conditions of a highly developed society , under the division of labor under the conditions of society in which practically everybody depends on working for other people and is paid by money and uses this money in order to buy things , under these conditions which I do not have to describe because they are known to everybody , a breakdown of the currency would mean something quite different .
There is no excuse for a government that resorts to inflation today saying , " But , do n't forget , we have an old tradition of inflation .
We are an independent nation today because we had an inflation in the War of Independence , in the Revolution . "
You can not compare conditions .
There was also , for instance , the great problem of the United States , the greatest historical problem for the United States , the Civil War in the 1860s .
There were the Northern States and the Southern States .
And the Southern States were in a very bad situation because they had very little industry .
Their agricultural production was great , but their industries were not in a position to produce the needed armaments .
From the first day of the Civil War , this was a very unfortunate situation for the Southerners especially as the Navy of the North was in a position to prevent trade between the Southern States and the European countries which would have been in a position to deliver armaments to the South .
Now it is impossible to improve a country 's military situation by inflation , even in a country in which all the materials required for the war are available .
Therefore , even from the point of view of the necessities of a situation in which a country is fighting for its survival , inflation as such is not a measure to improve conditions .
Now the shortage of armaments could be affected in no way by the fact that the secession government increased the quantity of money .
But if you were a statesman in the Southern States and you were already approaching defeat , and somebody asked you , " Do n't you know that printing money , banknotes , more and more dollar bills of the southern quality , will destroy this system ? " this southern statesman would have answered , " Why are you talking about the money ?
The problem now is whether the Southern States , our system , which is more important than anything else in the world , should survive or not .
Our war , or our rebellion , " it depends on how you looked upon this problem , " is finished . "
He could print money to try to get what was needed to keep on fighting .
And so he printed the notes , and more and more notes .
And they went to zero .
With the outbreak of World War I , many governments that had not resorted to inflation previously and had provided all the money they needed by taxation , started printing additional banknotes , paper notes .
The effect necessarily was an upward movement of prices .
The governments were probably not so naive that they did not know what their new methods of providing money for the government spending would bring about .
The governments knew that the policy of adding enormous quantities of new additional money into the market would necessarily bring about a tendency toward higher prices .
But what did the government do ?
With the outbreak of the war , with the change in their policies , they also began making laws which punished people who , according to the ideas of the government , were asking higher prices for commodities than they had asked before .
What the governments of some countries , of many countries , did in this regard is just unbelievable — I would say it was a " swindle " — they introduced a new crime , a new method of punishing citizens .
They declared that there was a special crime of profiteering .
And they began to imprison people .
Why ?
Because , these governments said , these people were profiteers ; they were asking more than they had before , more than the government thought necessary .
I do n't want to say that inflation is a vice and call it " immoral . "
I do n't care for this method of criticizing inflation .
But seriously , there is one thing about inflation that we can know for sure .
You cannot tell today whether or not people in the government tomorrow or the day after tomorrow will not choose for some reason to increase the quantity of money , that is to inflate .
They may have an excuse .
They will say : " Inflation is bad .
There should never be any question of inflation . "
And then they will add : " Yes , but we did n't take into account the conditions of an important war .
Really this situation did n't exist before . "
And then they will increase the quantity of money .
In one of the many belligerent countries of the last fifty years , there was one Minister of Finance who , when asked " Why do you inflate ?
Is it not a crime that you are destroying the currency of your country by issuing more money and therefore raising prices ? " answered , " In time of war , it is the duty of every citizen of every branch of the government and of every part of the country to contribute as much as possible to the defense of the country .
From this point of view , as Minister of Finance , I contributed by printing money . "
The Germans before the first World War were highly intelligent and very patriotic .
But unfortunately for decades and decades the government and all the professors it had appointed to the universities had taught very bad economics , especially monetary economics .
Sixty years ago , a German professor , a teacher of economics of great renown , G. F. Knapp , declared : " Money is what the government says it is .
Money is a government product .
The government is sovereign and free to do what it wants . "
He was not saying something new .
The only new thing was that a professor was saying it , that all the people in the government said , " All right , " and that even those who did not say " all right " acted as it they considered it all right .
That meant that the governments claimed the privilege to declare what people had in their minds when they made agreements concerning money .
It was not remarkable that the professor said this , you know — professors sometimes say things that are not remarkable .
But what was very remarkable was that the people accepted it .
An American economist , B. M. Anderson , predicted Professor Knapp 's influence would be such that students would probably " have to read his book if they wished to understand the next decade of German history … .
Look at your German theory , look at the German so - called economic doctrine on money and then you will see what will happen to the German money . "
And he was perfectly right !
The result came very soon .
When Germany went to war , the government did n't realize , and still less did the people realize , that what one needs to fight the war is not paper money but arms and various other things .
So they printed paper money .
And they printed paper money day and night .
The result was that the German paper money from pre-World War I deteriorated in value .
The parity with the American dollar in 1914 expressed in German marks was 4.2 as it had been for 60 , 80 , and 100 years before .
You know what the cost of a postage stamp is .
The German monetary policy of increasing the quantity of money , printing it continually , until a German postage stamp in the early 20's of our century cost several million marks .
Imagine the situation that developed in 1923 when someone who bought a stamp in order to mail a letter to the next village had to pay several hundred million marks .
Twenty million marks was more than the wealth of the richest people in Germany in the earlier period .
At the end of this inflation , nine years later , the dollar was 4.2 billion marks , something which is purely fantastic because there are no people who have an idea , a living idea , of what a billion is .
This was the outcome of the economic doctrine that money was a creation of the government .
The fact that the government had printed money , that the government had increased the quantity of money , did not improve the situation of the German armed forces or the German resistance .
It was simply an attempt to deceive the people in Germany and outside of Germany about the effects of the war .
It is true that the Reichsbank printed more and more paper money .
But the significance of this famous German inflation of 1923 consisted in the fact that these pieces of paper had legal tender value .
Now what did this mean ?
The government assumed the right to say , not only what money was , but also to decree what people were bound to accept as money .
Legal tender legislation makes it impossible for anybody to refuse to accept the paper money .
In the same way , the American dollar inflation today [ 1969 ] consists of the fact that the paper dollar has legal tender value and at the same time that gold holding is made illegal .
Holdings of gold were confiscated and it has been made illegal to deal with gold .
The Constitutional Side of Inflation
When we talk about these things we must not forget that they do not have only an economic side ; they also have a constitutional side .
You may say that government is the most important institution .
The government is very important in many regards .
Perhaps one overrates the importance of the government , but one does not overrate the importance of good government .
Modern constitutions , the political systems of all nations that are not ruled by barbarian despots , are based upon the fact that the government depends financially upon the people , indirectly upon the men that the voters have elected for the constitutional assembly .
And this system means that the government has no power to spend anything that has not been given it by the people , through the constitutional procedures which make it possible for the government to collect taxes .
This is the fundamental political institution .
And it is a fundamental political problem if the government can inflate .
If the government has the power to print its own money , then this constitutional procedure becomes absolutely useless .
Our whole political system is based upon the fact that the voters are sovereign , that the voters are electing Congress and other such institutions in the various states that rule the country .
We call the United States a democracy because the rule of the country is in the hands of the voters .
The voters determine everything .
And this distinguishes the system , not only from the despotic systems of other countries , but also from the conditions as they prevailed in earlier days , in countries that already had parliamentary institutions and parliamentary government , at that time .
However , there has developed , especially in the last decade , a problem of constitutional law , that is whether the government must get the approval of the people through Congress when it wants to spend , or whether the government , because it is established and has at its disposal a number of armed men , is free to spend as it wishes , simply by increasing the quantity of money .
People must realize that the question is " Who should be supreme ?
The parliaments elected by the voters , who can restrict government spending by refusing to grant the power to tax ?
Or institutions that want to override the interests of the people by increasing the quantity of money to expand government spending and so do away with the prerogative and independence of the individual voter ? "
If we do not succeed in restoring the monetary system that makes the individual independent to some extent of the interference of government institutions , government banks , government monetary authorities , government price ceilings , and so on , we will lose all the achievements of the free market and of the free initiative of the individuals , whatever methods of constitutional law we follow .
If the government can inflate whenever it wants to spend , it can take away from the people without their agreement everything , their purchasing power , their savings , and so on .
From this point of view there disappears even the fundamental principle which everybody sees as the difference between a Communist government and a government based on the idea of individual freedom , the preservation of free markets and the ability of the people to control the government .
If you look at the constitutional history of England in the 17th century , you learn that the Stuarts had problems with the British Parliament .
The conflict consisted precisely in the fact that the Parliament was not prepared to give to the King of England the money he needed for purposes of which the Parliament did n't approve .
The people disapproved of a great part of the government expenditures and Parliament was not anxious to impose taxes .
The Stuart kings wanted to spend more than Parliament was prepared to give them .
If the King at that time , in 1630 let us say , had asked one of those who are considered experts today in government finance , " What can I do ?
I do n't have the money ! " the " expert " would have said , " Unfortunately , your family , the Stuarts , came too early to their position as rulers .
Two hundred years , three hundred years later , it would be much easier for such a government as you want to rule the country .
A printing press would have been sufficient to make it possible for your government to spend all the money it needed to have an army and the other things needed to protect the King against the people . "
But the poor Stuarts were living in an age in which the technique of producing paper money had not been developed to a considerable extent .
Charles I could n't inflate , you know .
There was no solution for him ; he could not engage in deficit spending .
This was the undoing of the Stuart family and the Stuart regime .
And in the conflict which originated out of this , one member of the Stuart family lost his life in a very disagreeable way — Charles I lost his head .
And the Stuart family as such lost the crown of England .
What the poor Stuarts did n't have was the facility of the printing press as it exists today .
The monetary problem we have to struggle with today is the problem of paying for government expenditures which are not accepted or , let us say , not approved , by the people .
The conduct of government affairs , public affairs , is not different from the conduct of the financial and monetary conduct of private affairs .
If the government wants to spend , it has to collect the money ; it must tax the people .
If it does n't tax , but increases the quantity of money in order to spend more , then it brings about an inflation .
The difference between the conditions in 18th century England and the conditions in other countries , let us say for instance in Russia , consisted of the fact that the Russian government was free to take away from its subjects what it wanted while the British government was not .
The British government had to comply with the provisions of a set of laws that limited the amount of money the government had the right to collect from its citizens .
And it had to spend this money precisely according to the wishes of the people .
All our constitutional laws and our system of government are based upon the fact the government is not permitted to do anything that violates this system of laws representing the moral and actual ideas and philosophies of our people .
But if the government is in a position to increase the quantity of money , all these provisions become absolutely meaningless and useless .
If it is said that the government has to spend , is entitled to spend , a definite amount of money for keeping people in prisons , this means something .
There is a definite reason for its spending .
All our legal provisions are influenced to some extent by the fact that this is the amount of money which is given to the government for this purpose .
But if the government is in a position to increase the quantity of money to use for its own purposes , then all these things become merely a theoretical expression of something which has practically no meaning at all .
We must not forget that all the protection given to individuals through constitutions and laws disappears if the government is in a position to destroy the meaning of every interhuman relation by undermining the system of indirect exchange and money which is called the market .
And this is much more important than any other problems we talk about today .
It is the interference of the government with violence that has spoiled money , that has destroyed money in the past , and that is perhaps destroying it again today .
Some years ago you could frequently read quotations saying that Lenin said that the best method to destroy the free enterprise system would be to destroy the monetary system .
Now a professor in Germany has demonstrated that Lenin never said this .
But if Lenin had said this , it would have been the only correct thing that he ever said .
The monetary problem which we have in this country , which you have in every country today , is the same — to keep the budget in equilibrium , to balance income and outgo , revenue and expenditure without printing an additional quantity of banknotes , without increasing the quantity of the monetary units .
This is not only a problem of economics .
It is also the fundamental problem of constitutional government , you know .
Constitutional government is based upon the fact that the government can only spend what it has collected in taxes .
And it can only tax the people if the people accept it by the vote of their representatives in parliament .
And in this way the voters are the sovereigns .
The problem of monetary management in a modern country cannot , therefore , be separated from the constitutional problem , from the doctrine that says that all problems of government , all governmental matters are decided ultimately by the vote of the people .
Whether you call this democracy or popular government does n't make any difference .
But there is no monetary or budgetary problem that can be separated from the constitutional problem of who rules the country , who determines ultimately what has to be done in the country .
Capitalism , the Rich and the Poor
It is a very popular assumption , criticized only very rarely by people , that the capitalistic system brings about satisfactory conditions for a minority of profiteers , while the masses become more and more impoverished .
Of all the enormous problems connected with the monetary crisis , I want to deal with this problem especially because the most popular , or one of the most popular , ideas of Marxism is that the system of capitalism brings about the progressive impoverishment , the progressive deterioration of the economic state of affairs of the masses , for the benefit of a shrinking number of people who become richer and richer from year to year .
People believe that what is going on with these monetary problems today concern the well - to - do and that simple people are not so much interested .
I want to show you how erroneous this idea is .
It is thought that when the government inflates and as a result lowers the purchasing power of the monetary unit , this is of advantage to the masses , to the great majority of the people , and that only the rich are suffering .
If you do n't want to use the term " suffer , " let us say have to pay higher prices for things .
Now this idea , that the interested people are not the masses , not the majority of the people , but only the wealthy people and that it is only the wealthier and richer people that are concerned , is based on an ancient doctrine .
This doctrine was perfectly correct in the days of Solon ( c.638-559 B.C. ) of Athens , or in the days of ancient Rome , of the Gracchi brothers ( d.121 and 133 B.C. ) , or in the Middle Ages .
In the pre-capitalistic ages the rich people owned land and were , therefore , wealthy .
They could save , increase their possessions by investing in real property , houses , businesses , landed property .
Or they could increase their fortunes by dealing in a more conservative way with the forests which they owned .
On the other hand there were people who were poor , very poor , people who had nothing , who might occasionally earn a small

Top Bush Administration officials pressured underlings to use torture tactics at Guantanamo RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday April 2 , 2008

Print This Email This Of Guantanamo interrogators :
 You could almost see their dicks getting hard as they got new ideas . 
" Torture at Guantánamo was sanctioned by the most senior advisers to the president , the vice president , and the secretary of defense , according to the international lawyer and professor of law at University College London Philippe Sands , who has conducted a forensic examination of the chain of command leading from the top of the administration to the camp at Guantánamo , " Vanity Fair will report on newstands today .
The article directly contradicts the administrations account to Congress , which placed responsibility on military commanders and interrogators on the ground for the practices banned by the Geneva Conventions .
Excerpts from the magazine 's release follow .
The full story is available here .
Sands reports that these senior advisers face a real risk of criminal investigation if they set foot outside the United States , despite the Military Commissions Act , signed into law by President Bush in 2006 .
The hitch is that their immunity is good only within U.S. borders , and rather than protecting them , the act may lead to an eventual investigation by foreign governments .
For some , the future may hold a tap on the shoulder .
Sands consulted a judge and prosecutor in a major European city , both of whom are familiar with these sorts of cases .
The prosecutor called the act very stupid ,  explaining that it would make it much easier for investigators outside the U.S. to argue that possible war crimes would never be addressed in their home country .
 It s a matter of time ,  the judge told Sands .
 And then something unexpected happens , when one of these lawyers travels to the wrong place .
Sands talks with everyone from high level members of the administration to soldiers on the ground at Guantánamo , among them : Douglas Feith , former undersecretary of defense , General Richard Myers , former joint chiefs chairman , and Lieutenant Colonel Diane Beaver , who was charged with writing a document providing legal authority for harsh interrogation .
Also in Sandss article : DOUGLAS FEITH ON HOW THE ADMINISTRATION EVADED THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS :
Feith confirms that the logic of the law was not followed with respect to Geneva , rather it deliberately created a legal black hole into which the detainees were meant to fall and that was the point .
 Didnt the administrations approach mean that Genevas constraints on interrogation couldnt be invoked by anyone at Guantánamo ? 
Sands asked Feith .
 Oh yes , sure ,  Feith replied .
 Was that the intended result ?   Absolutely . 
Sands writes that he asked again : Under the Geneva Conventions , no one at Guantánamo was entitled to any protection ?
 That s the point ,  Feith reiterated .
As he saw it , either you were a detainee to whom Geneva didnt apply ( al - Qaeda fighters , because they werent part of a state ) ; or you were a detainee to whom Geneva applied but whose rights you couldnt invoke ( members of the Taliban , because they hadnt worn uniforms or insignia ) .
What was the difference for the purpose on interrogation ?
Sands asked .
Feith answered with a certain satisfaction :  It turns out , none .
But that s the point .
When Sands asks Feith whether he was at all concerned that the Geneva decision might have diminished Americas moral authority , Feith tells Sands ,  The problem with moral authority  was people who should know better , like yourself , siding with the assholes , to put it crudely . 
According to Sands , Feiths arguments were so clever that General Richard Myers , joint chiefs chairman , continued to believe that Genevas protection remained in force , and was well and truly hoodwinked ,  a seasoned observer of military affairs tells Sands .
MEETING OF HIGH -LEVEL ADMINISTRATION LAWYERS ON SEPTEMBER 25 AT GUANTÁNAMO TO DISCUSS TACTICS : A delegation of the administrations senior lawyers , including Dick Cheneys chief counsel ( later his chief of staff ) David S. Addington , White House counsel ( later attorney general ) Alberto Gonzales , Pentagon general counsel Jim Haynes , and the C.I.A.s John Rizzo arrived at Gitmo on September 25 .
 They wanted to know what we were doing to get this guy [ Mohammed al - Qahtani , allegedly a member of the 9/11 conspiracy and the so - called 20th hijacker ] ,  Major General Michael Dunlavey , who ran Joint Task Force 170 , which oversaw military interrogations , tells Sands , and Addington was interested in how we were managing it .
They brought ideas with them which had been given from sources in D.C.
They came down to observe and talk . 
Throughout this period , says Dunlavey , Rumsfeld was directly and regularly involved .
LT .
COLONEL DIANE BEAVER ON WASHINGTONS ROLE IN DEVISING TACTICS , AND JACK BAUERS INFLUENCE : Sands reports that Beaver , who was charged with writing a document providing legal authority for harsh interrogation , confirms new details of the crucial meeting that took place at Guantánamo , and she tells Sands she kept minutes  at other brainstorming sessions in which new techniques were discussed .
The younger men would get particularly excited , she says :  You could almost see their dicks getting hard as they got new ideas . 
Beaver also notes that ideas arose from other sources , such as the television show 24 .
Jack Bauer , the main character , had many friends at Guantánamo , says Beaver :  He gave people lots of ideas . 
It was clear to Sands that Beaver believed that Washington was directly involved in the interrogations , and her account confirms what others tell Sands that Washingtons views were being fed into the process by people physically present at Guantánamo .
BEAVER ON HER ROLE AT GUANTÁNAMO : Sands reports that Beaver was set up as a fall guy of sorts .
Someone more fully schooled in the relevant law might have questioned what she was being asked to do .
 It was not my job to second - guess the president ,  Beaver tells Sands .
Despite other memos prepared by administration lawyers , none other was cited as bearing on aggressive interrogations .
Beaver tells
Sands she was insistent that the decision to implement new techniques be properly written up , and that the paper trail to the top be clear .
 I wanted to get something in writing ,  she tells Sands .
 That was my game plan .
I had four days .
Dunlavey gave me just four days .
Beaver tells
Sands that she never imagined her work would not be vetted by someone higher up the chain .
What she didnt know at the time , according to Sands , was that those same people had already made their decisions , had the security of legal cover from the Justice Department , and , although confident with that protection , had no intention of soiling their hands by weighing in on the unpleasant details of interrogation .
GENERAL RICHARD MYERS AND A FORMER PENTAGON OFFICIAL ON HOW THE HAYNES MEMO DID NOT GO THROUGH THE USUAL CHANNELS OF APPROVAL : Myers confessed to Sands that he was troubled that normal procedures had been circumvented with regard to the Haynes Memo [ An action memo written in November 2002 listing proposed techniques of aggressive interrogation ] .
 You dont see my initials on this ,  he tells Sands , as he holds the paper .
 You see Ive just discussed  it ,  he says , noting a sentence in the memo to that effect .
 This was not the way this should have come about . 
He tells Sands of the intrigue that was going on around the time of the memo ,  that I wasnt aware of ,  he says ,  that was probably occurring between Jim Haynes , White House general counsel , and Justice . 
A former Pentagon official provides further confirmation that the memo got special handling , telling Sands that Lieutenant General Bantz Craddock , Rumsfelds senior military assistant , noticed the memo was missing a buck slip , an essential component that shows a documents circulation path , and which everyone was supposed to initial .
There was no signature from the general counsels office , so it went back to Haynes who signed off with a note that said simply ,  Good to go . 
Philippe Sands is an international lawyer at Matrix Chambers and a professor at University College London .
This is his first article for Vanity Fair , and is based on several years of reporting .
Sands is the author of numerous books a full account of this article will appear in Torture Team : Rumsfelds Memo and the Betrayal of American Values ( Palgrave Macmillan ) , out in May 2008 .

( CNN ) -- Ross
Perot is jumping back into the political fray , this time with a stern warning that the country better start paying attention to the national debt .
Former presidential candidate Ross Perot says the growing budget deficit must be addressed immediately .
The former presidential candidate has reemerged with a Web site spotlighting the soaring budget deficit : more than $ 9.3 trillion and growing .
" We live in the greatest country in the history of man .
We 've been so successful for so long that we now take our success for granted , " Perot says in a video posted on PerotCharts.com .
" Not since the Great Depression have we seen an economic crisis of the magnitude that we are facing today , " he says .
He says the purpose of the site , which is not affiliated with any political party , is " to provide accurate information to every citizen about the serious economic problems facing our country . "
True to his style , he uses charts to detail the rise in government spending , the federal budget and the growing national debt , among other things .

Perot challenged then - President George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton with his deficit charts during his presidential run in 1992 and won almost 20 percent of the vote .
Perot 's not running for president this time around , but political analysts say his push to make the deficit a priority might not go over well with John McCain and Barack Obama .
" It gives Obama an opportunity to talk about economic issues , and he is more comfortable than McCain on those themes , but it may force him to talk about those issues in an uncomfortable way -- taxes and spending that he'd rather not discuss , " said Stu Rothenberg , a political analyst .
The national debt has continued growing , presenting a threat to baby boomers hitting retirement with needs for Medicare and Social Security .
" We are leaving our children and grandchildren with a burden they cannot possibly manage , " Perot says on the site .
" Over time , our standard of living , our national security , our standing in the world and the value of our currency could all be threatened .
The sooner we confront these issues , the better , " the site says .
David Walker , the former U.S. comptroller general and nation 's top accountant , consulted with Perot on the need to cut spending in Washington .
" Washington has to learn the first rule of holes .
When you 're in a hole , the first thing you do is stop digging .
It has n't learned that yet , " he said .
The challenge for Perot is to get voters interested in a problem facing future generations with sky - high foreclosure rates and gas prices affecting this generation .
On the site , Perot urges visitors to contact their representatives and senators so that they will take action .
Perot , a Texas billionaire , was known for using catchy phrases and simplified fiscal charts during his campaigns in 1992 and 1996 .
Bill Clinton won both terms .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - The U.S. military will not free a Pulitzer Prize - winning Associated Press photographer held since 2006 unless its own review board approves , a spokesman said on Thursday , after an Iraqi panel ordered his release .
The U.S. military has accused Bilal Hussein , an Iraqi , of working with insurgents in Iraq and held him without charge .
He was seized two years ago in Ramadi , capital of Anbar province , and is being held in Baghdad .
An Iraqi judicial committee ordered Hussein ’s release and dismissed terrorism - related accusations against him , the AP said on Wednesday .
The news agency said a four - judge panel ruled Hussein ’s case fell under a two - month - old amnesty law .
But Lieutenant Commander Kenneth Marshall , spokesman for U.S. military detention facilities in Iraq , said the law did not apply to people in U.S. military custody .
“ He is still in U.S. custody .
I can confirm that , ” Marshall told Reuters .
AP has repeatedly called for the release of Hussein , 36 , who was part of its photo team that won a Pulitzer prize in 2005 .
The news agency had said it was unclear if Hussein would face further obstacles to his release , saying the Iraqi panel may still be reviewing another allegation against him .
“ If the amnesty is granted ( by the Iraqi panel ) on both counts , he remains in detainee status , ” Marshall said .
“ He would then most likely be reviewed as a detainee and he would be released if not seen to be an imperative threat to the security of Iraq . ”
In November , U.S. military spokesman Major - General Kevin Bergner said Hussein ’s case had been reviewed several times by a board that periodically reviews the files of detainees .
Hussein was still deemed a “ security threat ” , he had said at the time .
Those reviews generally take place every six months .
Many of the 23,000 detainees in U.S. military custody have not been charged but remain in jail because they are deemed a security risk .
The AP said the Iraqi panel ’s decision covered various allegations by the U.S. military , including claims Hussein had bomb - making material , conspired with insurgents to take photographs synchronized with an explosion and offered to secure a forged ID for a militant evading capture by the military .
The committee might still be reviewing a separate allegation that Hussein had contacts with the kidnappers of an Italian citizen , it added .
Hussein is just one of several Iraqi journalists who have been held by the U.S. military without being charged .
Reuters journalists have also been detained by the U.S. military for months and later released without charges .
The AP said Hussein was being held at Camp Cropper , a U.S. detention facility near Baghdad ’s airport .

-- Alexandre Julliard julliard@winehq.org
On Wednesday night , CNN's Jessica Yellin talked to Anderson Cooper about Scott McClellan 's tell - all memoir and agreed with the former press secretary that White House reporters " dropped the ball " during the run-up to war .
But Yellin went much further , revealing that news executives — presumably at ABC News , where she 'd worked from July 2003 to August 2007 — actively pushed her not do hard - hitting pieces on the Bush administration .
[ UPDATE : Yellin now says it was MSNBC execs , not ABC ]
" The press corps was under enormous pressure from corporate executives , frankly , to make sure that this was a war presented in a way that was consistent with the patriotic fever in the nation and the president 's high approval ratings , " Yellin said .
" And my own experience at the White House was that the higher the president 's approval ratings , the more pressure I had from news executives — and I was not at this network at the time — but the more pressure I had from news executives to put on positive stories about the president , I think over time .... "
But then a shocked Cooper jumped in , asking , " You had pressure from news executives to put on positive stories about the president ? "
" Not in that exact ....
They would n't say it in that way , but they would edit my pieces , " Yellin said .
" They would push me in different directions .
They would turn down stories that were more critical , and try to put on pieces that were more positive .
Yes , that was my experience . "
UPDATE : TVNewser reports that Jessica Yellin is going to post a blog item shortly on CNN.com that will clarify her remarks .
From what I 'm hearing , she 'll write that it was MSNBC execs , not ABC that she was referring to last night .
Yellin worked at MSNBC during the run-up to war , but then moved on to ABC that summer , where she stayed for four years .
UPDATE 2 : Yellin confirms this .

( or how I learned to stop worrying and embrace the deadlock )
Topics : concurrency , multicore processors , Common Lisp
Author : Marijn Haverbeke
Date : June 5th 2008
I think that , over the past year , I 've read some thirty articles that start with the solemn or anxious announcement that the future of programming will be multicore , and that one way or another , we will have to get used to it .
I 'll try not to write another one of those .
In fact , it appears that multicore processors are also pretty good single - core processors , and most applications are , for the foreseeable future , comfortably single - threaded .
And in a lot of cases , they should be .
So is there any pressing reason to take notice of this new - fangled hardware ?
[ I ]t looks more or less like the hardware designers have run out of ideas , and that they ’re trying to pass the blame for the future demise of Moore ’s Law to the software writers by giving us machines that work faster only on a few key benchmarks !
That is from none less than Donald Knuth , in a recent interview .
Nonetheless , I have ( belatedly , I 'll admit ) started to get excited about incorporating the kind of ' multi- threading for the sake of multi- threading ' that multiple cores encourage into my programs .
Why ?
This might not be a very convincing reason for the serious , result - oriented programmer , but parallel programming , it turns out , is very amusing .
Sure , there are dead - lock death - traps , race - conditions , and a general dangerous sense of non-determinism .
But there is a logic to all of it , and a working parallel program can be a thing of beauty .
That kind of beauty , and the complexity that tends to go with it , is what got me into this business in the first place .
( It was n't my love for hunching over keyboards or a deep dislike of sunlight , in any case . )
This infatuation started ― predictably enough ― with Erlang .
Erlang is kind of hip , makes you think about concurrency in a whole new way , and is entirely dissatisfactory as a programming language .
I wo n't go too deeply into that last point , since taking cheap shots at other people 's work tends to hurt one 's credibility , but the un-polished and limited feel of the language offended my delicate linguistic sensibilities , and prevented me from investing too deeply into it , with the result that I am still ( also somewhat grudgingly , perhaps ) doing most of my work in Common Lisp .
Common Lisp has no integrated , light - weight , multicore - friendly threads .
In fact , in only recently started having widespread support for OS - level threads at all .
This support comes , invariably , in the form of shared memory , locks , and semaphores ( bordeaux - threads provides a pleasant portable wrapper ) .
While these allow just about any kind of concurrent program to be written , they are fairly tedious and error - prone to work with .
CL - MUPROC builds a message - passing system on top of them , which allows a more pleasant programming style .
Every CL - MUPROC process is an OS thread though , so you wo n't want to create thousands of them .
Another approach for getting away from mutexes , one that has been generating a lot of noise recently , is software transactional memory .
If that does n't mean anything to you , I 'd recommend watching this video of Simon Peyton Jones explaining the idea .
I was surprised to find that there apparently exists a CL - STM ( are n't we CLers creative when it comes to naming projects ) .
Seems to have been inactive since early 2007 , and as I understand it , STM is rather hard to get right , so I 'm not sure I 'd risk building something serious on this ... but it appears to work .
The Clojure people seem to be making good use of STM in any case .
On a related note , SBCL exports a symbol sb - ext : compare - and - swap , which can be used to do small - scale transactional tricks , and is often an order of magnitude faster than the equivalent locking solution .
Here is a very simple concurrency - safe stack .
The macro is a convenient wrapper that helps use compare - and - swap in a ' transactional ' way .
( defmacro concurrent - update ( place var &body body ) `( flet ( ( action ( , var ) , @body ) ) ( let ( ( prev , place ) ) ( loop : until ( eq ( sb - ext : compare - and - swap , place prev ( action prev ) ) prev ) : do ( setf prev , place ) ) prev ) ) ) ( defun make - cstack ( &rest elements ) ( cons : stack elements ) ) ( defun push - cstack ( element stack ) ( concurrent - update ( cdr stack ) elts ( cons element elts ) ) ( values ) ) ( defun pop-cstack ( stack ) ( car ( concurrent - update ( cdr stack ) elts ( cdr elts ) ) ) )
Stacks are represented as cons cells , since compare - and - swap can only be used on a limited set of ' places ' ( cars , cdrs , svrefs , symbol - values ) , and not on things like instance or struct slots .
Writing a queue is only slightly more complicated .
Making popping threads block when there are no elements available , on the other hand , is decidedly tricky .
( I think I have a working implementation ... it is much faster than the locking variant , but it is so complicated that I 'm not convinced it is correct .
If you can recommend any good books or papers on low - level concurrency techniques , please drop me an e-mail . )
In the book How to Write Parallel Programs , which is old ( 1992 ) but still relevant , the authors distinguish three models of concurrency : Message passing ( as in Erlang ) , shared or distributed data structures ( as in Java ) , and ' live ' data structures , where computations turn into values after they finish running .
These are all fundamentally equivalent , in that a program using one of them can always be transformed to use another , but some programs are much more natural when expressed in the right model .
STM , which had not been invented at the time the book was written , would probably qualify as a special case of shared data structures .
One of these models , live data structures , has never been very popular .
This might be related to the fact that they offer none of the control - flow advantages that the other models have ― you spawn a process , and then later you can read the value it produced , but this only buys you something when there is a direct advantage to computing values in parallel .
On single - core machines , there is n't , but on multicores , this might be a very pleasant way to speed up some CPU - bound programs .
On first seeing Haskell 's par operator , which implements something like this , I was duly impressed .
You just pass two computations to a little operator and , under the right circumstances , you get your results twice as fast .
Now , without further ado , I 'd like to present my new library : PCall ( for parallel call ) .
It implements a thread pool and a few simple operators to get behaviour not unlike that of Haskell 's par .
As a silly example , it can get two seconds worth of sleep in only a single second !
( time ( let ( ( a ( pexec ( sleep 1 ) ) ) ( b ( pexec ( sleep 1 ) ) ) ) ( join a ) ( join b ) ) )
The code behind this is rather humble and simple , but it seems to work well .
See the project page for more details and examples .
This kind of ' local parallelism ' makes it relatively easy to verify that the tasks are using their data in a safe way ― you typically just make sure that no tasks write to the same location or read anything another task might write .
One issue that keeps coming up with this style of parallelism , an issue that the book I mentioned above also discusses , is finding the right granularity when splitting up tasks .
Wrapping up a computation in a function , putting it into a queue , having some thread find it and execute it , and then reading out the results ... that is obviously more work than just directly executing the computation .
Thus , if the computation is small enough , you are making your program slower by parallelising it .
The solution suggested by the book is to provide a ' granularity knob ' ― some setting that controls the size of the computation chunks that get delegated off to other processes .
When mapping some function over a list , you could for example provide a way to control the amount of elements each task takes care of , and vary that based on the amount of available processors and the amount of computation the given function requires .
In some cases , the granularity adjustment could be done automatically by profiling the running code .
I guess that is usually more trouble than it is worth , though .
There are also situations where different environments call for completely different approaches .
Having a central lock on something works well when there are ten threads occasionally accessing it , but becomes a bottleneck when there are a thousand .
Optimistic transactions that fail when another thread interferes with their data have the same problem :
They fall apart when there are too many processes .
On the other hand , complex schemes that minimise the amount of conflict between threads also carry an overhead , and are often counterproductive when there are only a handful of threads .
This is a less pleasant side of concurrent programming :
There often is no right solution .
In sequential programs , you can weight program complexity against efficiency , and often feel you 've hit some sweet spot .
In concurrent programs , the sweet spot on my dual - core system might be completely stupid on both an old single - core system and a flashy sixteen - core server .
Despite of this , and the claims by various people that threading is ' just too hard ' , I rather suspect we 'll be able to work it out .
As in other complicated fields , it is mostly a matter of finding better abstractions .
I hope PCall can provide an abstraction suitable for some problems ( though , at this point , I 'm not even a hundred percent convinced there are no race conditions left in the library ... do help me test it ) .
The San Francisco Chronicle reports that lawmakers are still looking for answers about Attorney General Michael Mukasey 's strange tale of an unmonitored terrorist phone call .
Mukasey gave the account at a speech in San Francisco last month as part of an emotional plea to legalize warrantless wiretapping .
But House Judiciary Committee members say this is the first they have heard of such a call .
As Chronicle reporter Bob Egelko has shown in his ongoing investigation , Mukasey 's story is difficult for many experts to understand .
Our legal analysis shows that the government had the authority to listen in on the call that Mukasey describes .
Now , some members in Congress are speculating that the phone call may have already been investigated -- and found to have been actually intercepted , but simply not passed on to other intelligence agencies .
We 're pleased that both reporters and lawmakers are taking a hard look at Mukasey 's story .
Congress has some tough decisions to make about surveillance law in the coming months , and Americans should not lose their civil liberties to make up for the government 's own failures .

Electronic eyes soon will focus on Richmond city streets in a $ 1.4 million attempt to curb crime and blight .
Crews began installing a system of 26 wireless cameras and their infrastructure around the city last week that police hope to use for everything from snaring evidence in shootings at high - crime corners to catching illegal dumpers , graffiti artists and crosswalk - running motorists .
The move comes after years of urging from neighborhood groups and elected officials eager to reduce street violence .
It also comes over the past concerns of privacy advocates such as the American Civil Liberties Union .
The project uses modern technology and , unlike camera systems in some other cities , includes built - in room to grow , Deputy Police Chief Ed Medina said .
“ Some other cities have chosen to just slap up some cameras without any future planning involved , ” Medina said .
“ But we ’re looking toward tomorrow .
Ours has built - in capacity for expansion ” and improvement .
Some of the cameras will sit on power poles at high - traffic intersections , public parks or high - crime corners .
Others — some as small as a tube of lipstick — are portable and hideable , and can be used by detectives and code enforcement for targeted police operations .

Jon Perr wrote a great piece yesterday about the Lieberman / Hagee deal and asked if Joe still believed Hagee was Moses .
I guess we received our answer because Joe Lieberman has confirmed that he will speak at Pastor Hagee 's big Summit after McCain disavowed him .
Sen .
Joe Lieberman says he 'll speak at a July conference hosted by Rev. John Hagee , whose endorsement was recently rejected by Republican John McCain because of Hagee 's controversial remarks about religion .
Lieberman , one of presumed GOP presidential nominee McCain 's strongest supporters , said Wednesday while Hagee 's comments were unacceptable and hurtful , he will judge him on his life work fighting anti-Semitism and building bridges between Christians and Jews .
Lieberman , I - Conn. , will speak at Hagee 's " Christians United for Israel " summit in Washington .
McCain last week repudiated the months - old endorsement by the preacher after an audio recording surfaced in which Hagee said God sent Adolf Hitler to help Jews reach the promised land .
Will the media jump all over him ?
And if not , why ?
Rabbi David Saperstein has a great piece posted in Newsweek asking other Jewish leaders to back off from supporting Hagee .
So why is Lieberman still supporting Hagee after he hurt McCain 's presidential run ?
He obviously knew about his extreme behavior and opinions for a very long time .
Has Lieberman received funds from Pastor Hagee ?
I 'd like someone to investigate that .

With day after day of bleak news regarding the credit crunch — and in particular , articles that constantly remind us that the Fed 's recent actions have n't been tried since the Great Depression — the average American is understandably perplexed .
And although what I 'm about to admit may not surprise many readers , it nonetheless may worry them further :
Most economists do n't have a clue what 's going on , either .
It has become fashionable to compare our current economic crisis to the stagflation of the 1970s ; I 've done so myself .
Yet beyond the weakening dollar and stalling output that characterized that period and today , there is another similarity : during both the 1970s and today , the orthodox monetary prescriptions were ( and are ) not working as the textbooks said they should .
The Federal Reserve 's toolkit of interventions were ( and are ) not able to deliver .
Although my article so far sounds like a wiser - than - thou criticism of everybody else , I should admit that I too was caught off guard by the present situation .
Just as the orthodox Keynesians were baffled in the 1970s by stagflation , so was I ( as were many other free - market economists ) surprised by the way things have played out during the present crisis .
Back in the 1970s , the Keynesians were surprised to find that no matter how much extra money they pumped into the system , unemployment remained stubbornly high .
This upset their conventional worldview , which held that the Fed could choose an easy - money policy ( yielding high inflation but low unemployment ) , or a tight - money policy ( yielding low inflation but high unemployment ) .
When confronted with stagflation , the Keynesian analysis and prescriptions became obsolete ; the economy was suffering the worst of both worlds , with high inflation and high unemployment .
There is something analogous happening in our present credit crunch .
In short , the textbook understanding of how the Fed manipulates short - term interest rates has n't been true since August 2007 .
In principles of macroeconomics ( or what seemed to be Naptime 101 when I taught this class ) , we economists lecture gullible students with the following story :
When the Fed wants to lower the federal funds rate ( i.e. , the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of reserves on deposit with the Fed ) , it engages in an " open market operation . "
The Fed buys assets such as Treasury securities from the banks , and in return increases their reserve deposits held at the Fed .
Because some banks now have more reserves than they did before , they are willing to lend them out at a lower interest rate .
Now if the Fed wants to raise the federal funds rate , it sells Treasury securities to the banks in order to destroy some of their reserves .
( See here for a more elaborate explanation . )
Generally speaking , the above textbook description of Fed operations matches the actual facts , " which is nice " ( as Bill Murray might say ) .
As Figure 1 shows , when the Fed wants to raise interest rates , it sucks reserves out of the system , and when it cuts rates , it pumps reserves in :
Figure 1 : Total Bank Reserves vs. Federal Funds Target Rate
Monthly , Jan. 1990 – Dec. 2006
Source : St. Louis Fed ( Reserves and Target )
Figure 1 beautifully illustrates the Austrian Business Cycle Theory explanation of the housing bubble and consequent bust .
In response to the dot - com crash and ensuing recession in 2000 – 01 , Greenspan 's Fed slashed interest rates down to a shocking 1 % by June 2003 , and then held them there for a full year before ratcheting rates back up .
The libertarian 's gut instinct is to say that this pumped phony money into the housing bubble , and the quick uptick in total reserves seems to accord with this explanation .
( Note that the massive spike in late 2001 was because of the September 11 attacks ; the Fed was afraid a panic would cause the financial system to seize up and wanted to nip such fears in the bud . )
Now with the daily announcements of the Fed pumping in tens of billions into the financial sector — not to mention cutting the target rate 300 basis points since September — one would surely think that the Fed was trying to inflate its way out of the crisis .
As is its wont , the Fed presumably is printing new money like crazy , in an effort to paper over its past mistakes .
The massive injections might get the economy through 2008 or 2009 without a major recession , but this ( according to standard Austrian Business Cycle Theory ) is why it 's a mistake !
The huge misallocations of capital during the last round of monetary pumping need to be corrected , and a recession is the only way to move workers and other resources into more appropriate channels , where they can best contribute to consumer satisfaction .
There 's just one problem with this explanation : total bank reserves have been falling since the summer .
Let me repeat that : during this time of financial crisis , when banks are very jealous of their assets and are doing whatever they can to bolster liquidity , the Fed has slashed its target rate from 5.25 % down to 2.25 % while removing bank reserves from the system .
See for yourself :
Figure 2 : Total Bank Reserves vs. Federal Funds Target Rate
Monthly , Mar. 2007 – Feb. 2008
Source : St. Louis Fed ( Reserves and Target )
Figure 2 is very surprising .
( It was to me , at least , when I first saw the numbers behind it . )
It 's true , the conventional relationship held up from October 2007 to January 2008 , when total reserves increased as the Fed lowered its target .
But this was only after total reserves had fallen sharply from August through October .
No matter how you slice it , total reserves are lower today than they were for most of last summer , even though there is a liquidity crunch and the target has been reduced 300 basis points .
( Note that in theory , this figure of total reserves includes all of the recent hanky panky allowing institutions to borrow in unconventional ways . )
Whatever else it signifies , Figure 2 underscores the problems with central bank planning .
In today 's environment , it 's not even clear what constitutes a monetary " loosening . "
Apparently the demand for bank reserves has fallen sharply since the summer .
Had the Fed wished to maintain the federal funds rate at 5.25 % , it would have had to suck large amounts of reserves out of the system .
Now would that have been a tightening , or just standing pat ?
On the other hand , many people ( myself included ) had viewed the large rate cuts as a reckless " easy money " policy , the same bad medicine that got us into trouble back in the early 2000s .
Yet even a libertarian economist could very plausibly argue that the Fed was simply following other short - term market interest rates down , and it would have been an intervention to prop rates up in this environment .
In truth , there 's no obvious right or wrong answer to this question .
It would be akin to asking , " How many cars should the Soviet planners have produced in 1983 ? "
One is tempted to say , " Ideally , the number of cars that would have been produced if there had been a capitalist economy , " but not only is that impossible to know ; it 's not correct .
The very existence of a centrally planned apparatus changes the real economic data , and so changes what the " correct " number of cars should have been , even if we could agree on the criteria for correctness .
In the same way , it 's a bit pointless for libertarian economists to argue about the second - best Fed policy ( short of Bernanke abolishing the Fed and resigning ) .
In retrospect we can clearly see that Greenspan 's policies during the early 2000s were disastrous , yet it is not so obvious in our present environment what the Fed ought to do with interest rates .
We can all agree that bailouts to particular investment banks are a bad idea , not only for general reasons of private property , but also because of the moral hazard issue .
But given that the Fed exists and has to make a decision with its control of reserves , what should it have been doing since last summer ?
With some analysts predicting negative nominal yields on Treasury securities ( because it might actually be safer to keep your wealth in short - term government debt , rather than holding it as cash in the bank ) , the normal rules of thumb may be inappropriate .
As the Fed itself has discovered , the conventional tools are n't working the way the textbooks say they should .
I personally still think we will ultimately see a massive injection of new fiat money , especially if and when the mortgage - backed securities serving as collateral for Fed loans fail to deliver .
In that case , the Fed will either have to eat large losses and pass them along to the taxpayers , or it will print up the difference .
Regardless of how this crisis ultimately unfolds , the one thing we can conclude with certainty is that none of this would have happened had the politicians left money and banking to the private sector .

WASHINGTON , June 7 ( UPI ) --
The treasurer of the National Republican Congressional Committee paid the mortgage on his Maryland home with stolen money , federal prosecutors said Friday .
The allegations were made in court papers filed seeking forfeiture of the house in Bethesda , The Washington Post reported .
Prosecutors said Christopher Ward , who was dismissed in January , often diverted money from the committee to his personal use when he had to make payments on his mortgage or for remodeling .

The committee asked the FBI to begin an investigation after Ward allegedly admitted faking audits on NRCC accounts .
He has not been charged with a crime , the newspaper said .
Prosecutors said Ward took money from accounts set up for the President 's Dinner , the National Republican Senatorial Committee 's major fundraising event .
He allegedly paid almost $ 200,000 in contractors ' bills with committee money and diverted $ 72,000 to his mortgage payments .
Federal investigators say Ward 's embezzlement dates back at least to 2003 .
ハッシュテーブルからエントリーを検索する処理は，一般に定数時間で済むとされている。つまり，どんなにエントリーが増えても検索の速さは変わらない，ということ。データ構造の教科書には必ず載っていることだね。
でも実際には，ハッシュの衝突が起こった場合に，速度の低下が発生する可能性がある。例えば，一般的なチェイン法（オープンハッシュ）だと，衝突したエントリーに関して線形検索を行うことになるから，衝突が多ければ多いほど，定数時間からは遠のいてしまう。
この速度低下を防ぐ方法はいろいろある。なかでも cuckoo hashing （カッコウ・ハッシング）は仕組みが面白い。こいつは，エントリーの検索を必ず定数時間で済ませてくれるという優れものなんだ。
Cuckoo hashing では ，２つのハッシュ関数と，２つのテーブルを用いる。ここでは，２つのハッシュ関数をそれぞれ
h1 , h2 として，２ つのテーブルを T1 , T2 としよう 。
例として，ハッシュテーブルに x を挿入してみる。まず， T1 上の h1 ( x ) が空いてるかどうかを調べる 。
空いていれば，そこに x を入れてしまう 。
空いてない場合はどうする？ 例えば y が先に入っているとしよう 。
そういう場合は， y を追い出して x を突っ込んでしまう。「 x と y をスワップする 」といった方がいいかもしれない。
次に ，T2 上の h2 (y ) が空いてるかどうかを調べる 。
空いていれば，そこに y を入れてしまう 。
空いてない場合はどうするか？ 例えば z が先に入っているとしよう 。
そういう場合は， z を追い出して y を突っ込んでしまう 。
そして ，T1 上の h1(z ) が空いてるかどうかを調べる。
空いていれば，そこに z を入れて，空いてなければ，それを追い出して z を入れて …… というように， 「 先約がいたら追い出して，追い出されたやつをもう一方のテーブルに突っ込んで」という処理を，全部がどこかに納まるまで繰り返す。
こうしてできたテーブルでは， x は T1[ h1 ( x ) ] か T2[ h2 ( x ) ]
のどちらかに入っていることが保証される。つまり，この２つを探すだけで，必ず
x を見つけることができるというわけ。
挿入処理の擬似コードは以下のようになる。
この擬似コードを見てみると，ループ回数に制限を設けていることが分かると思う。「全部がどこかに納まるまで繰り返す」と書いたけれど，実は循環参照が生じると無限ループに陥ってしまう可能性があるんだ。だから実際には，適当な回数ループしてしまったら潔く諦めて，ハッシュ関数を取り替えたうえでテーブルの再構築を行うようにしている。この再構築のコストが cuckoo hashing における最大の弱点といえる 。
… …と， こんな感じの cuckoo hashing , 見ての通り挿入処理にかなりのクセがあるのだけれど，検索が必ず固定時間で終わるというのは面白い。ちょっと怖くて自分で使う気にはなれないけどね。なにかのときのために名前だけは覚えておくよ。

The problem with pursuing justice with the Bush administration is the utter lack of respect for the rule of law that they exhibit regularly .
In the case of the prosecution and incarceration of former Alabama governor Don Siegelman , Karl Rove initially told the House Judiciary Committee that he would only speak to them in private , not under oath and with no transcript .
Then he changed his mind and said he'd only respond to their questions in writing .
Well , that 's just not good enough for HJC member Rep. Robert Wexler ( and frankly , it should n't be good enough for anyone .
Can you imagine telling a judge that you 're not going to come in to testify in a case , but he can ask you questions in writing ? ) and he told host Dan Abrams and Don Siegelman that no matter what obstacle the White House throws in his way , he 'll keep pursuing justice for Siegelman .
We would much prefer Mr. Rove voluntarily agreed to appear before the House Judiciary Committee , as would any other American citizen .
But my view is that if he refuses to come voluntarily , we must first subpoena him , and if he refuses to honor the subpoena then the full House of Representatives must hold Mr. Rove in Contempt of Congress .
And then we must ask the Attorney General to enforce the Contempt of Congress subpoena or citation .
And if the Attorney General refuses to do so , which Mr. Mukasey said previously before the Judiciary Committee that he would , then I believe , reluctantly , we need to literally uphold the checks and balances that this administration has so abused and then we need to go the extraordinary step of issuing an Inherent Contempt of Congress .

Several legs of the relay have been disrupted by human rights protests A major Buddhist temple has withdrawn from plans to host Japan 's opening stage of the Olympic torch relay .
Zenkoji Temple , in the city of Nagano , had been due to serve as the starting point for the parade on 26 April .
An official said the monks were worried about safety but also linked the decision to concern over recent unrest in Tibet .
Meanwhile the torch has arrived in Thailand in preparation for a parade through the capital city , Bangkok .
The relay has been dogged by protests over Tibet , with chaotic scenes in London , Paris and San Francisco .
Security row In Japan , the torch is to be paraded 18.5 km ( 11.5 miles ) through Nagano , which hosted the 1998 Winter Olympic Games .
The decision by the temple to withdraw was announced after talks with city officials .
" We needed to think about security , being a temple with national treasures and many visitors , " a temple official told Reuters news agency .
" We also had to take into account the many messages of concern that we , as a Buddhist temple , received from residents all over the country and from our followers after growing international focus on the Tibet issue . "
Kunihiko Shinohara , of Nagano 's organising committee for the relay , said that the starting point for the parade would be changed .
" We respect the temple 's decision , " he said .
The city has already cancelled one event planned around the relay because of security concerns .
There is also a row brewing with China about whether or not its security officials will be allowed to run alongside , reports the BBC's Chris Hogg in Tokyo .
Japan says its own security measures will be sufficient , but China has asked Japan to accept that its people should be in place to deter any demonstrators .
On Thursday , the Indian leg of the relay , in the capital , Delhi , took place under tight security .
At least 100 pro-Tibet activists were arrested .

What does it mean to be human ?
And can science illuminate the answers ?
A star - studded panel of scientists gathered to discuss those heady themes last night at the World Science Festival in New York City .
Here are their answers in convenient nutshell form :
Marvin Minsky , artificial intelligence pioneer :
We do something other species can't : We remember .
We have cultures , ways of transmitting information .
Daniel Dennett , cognitive scientist :
We are the first species that represents our reasons , and can reason with each other .
" The planet has grown a nervous system , " he said .
Renee Reijo Pera , embryologist :
We 're uniquely human from the moment that egg and sperm fuse .
A " human program " begins before the brain even begins to form .
Patricia Churchland , neuroethicist :
The structure of how the human brain is arranged intrigues me .
Are there unique brain structures ?
As far as we can understand , it 's our size that is unique .
What we do n't find are other unique structures .
There may be certain types of human - specific cells – but as for what that means , we do n't know .
It 's important not only to focus on us , to compare our biology and behavior to other animals .
Jim Gates , physicist :
We are blessed with the ability to know our mother .
We are conscious of more than our selves .
And just as a child sees a mother , the species ' vision clears and sees mother universe .
We are getting glimmers of how we are related to space and time .
We can ask , what am I ?
What is this place ?
And how am I related to it ?
Nikolas Rose , sociologist : Language and representation .
We are the kind of creatures that ask those questions of ourselves .
And we believe science can help answer .
We 've become creatures that think of ourselves as essentially biological – and I think we 're more than biological creatures .
I 'm not sure biology has answers .
Ian Tattersall , anthropologist :
It 's not " what is human , " but what is unique : our extraordinary form of symbolic cognition .
Francis Collins , geneticist :
What does the genome tell us ?
There 's surprisingly little genetic difference between human and chimpanzee .
Yet clearly we 're different .
There 's brain size and language .
A language - related gene , Fox P2 , evolved most rapidly in the last few million years .
How did we develop empathy ?
Appreciate our mortality ?
And we should admit that there are areas that might not submit to material analysis : beauty , inspiration .
We should n't dismiss these as epiphenomenal froth .
Harold Varmus , physiologist : Intrigued by our ability to generate hypotheses and make measurements .
Paul Nurse , cell biologist :
Is excited about the ability of science to answer this question .
Antonio Damasio , neuroscientist :
The critical unique factor is language .
Creativity .
The religious and scientific impulse .
And our social organization , which has developed to a prodigious degree .
We have a record of history , moral behavior , economics , political and social institutions .
We 're probably unique in our ability to investigate the future , imagine outcomes , and display images in our minds .
I like to think of a generator of diversity in the frontal lobe
\– and those initials are G - O - D .
What do you think , Wired Science readers ?
What does it mean to be human ?
I 'll save my own answer for later , with one caveat : this is a semantically tricky question .
It 's really several questions :
What is unique to humanity now , what will be unique about humanity in the future , and what is important about humanity .

Wikipedia contributors are n’t forced to verify their sources before posting anything , but if they were , it would greatly improve the quality of the online encyclopedia .
Here ’s a very good example of such a dumb error :
On March 31st , blogger Patrick Curl from There ’s a Blog in my Soup , published an April Fool ’s prank saying ProBlogger Darren Rowse is filling for bankruptcy .
For those who do n’t know Darren , he ’s the man behind ProBlogger , one of the biggest blogs in the blog - and - make - money online niche .
Darren has more than 45,000 RSS subscribers !
Guess what happened next ?
Someone who read the prank went to Wikipedia and updated Darren Rowse ’s page , reporting the man is going bankrupt ( see the very last line ) !
The information has no references , but still , it is still there as I am typing this post .
If it ’s gone by the time you read this , just check out the page history and look for the March 31st version @ 17:01 .
Guys , it should be illegal to post April Fool ’s jokes on March 31st ;-)
The Royal Thai Police have released the sketch of a man suspected of stealing 200,000 baht from the Ladprao branch of the Government Savings Bank ( GSB ) in Bangkok several weeks ago .
According to a report on the newsclip .be Japanese language
Thai news site , this sketch is based on the recollections of eyewitnesses , who say the suspect wore a motorcycle helmet at the time of the robbery .
Seen him ?

NEW DELHI —
The latest bane of office productivity is Scrabulous , a virtual knockoff of the Scrabble board game , with over 700,000 players a day and nearly three million registered users .
Fans of the game are obsessive .
They play against friends , co-workers , family members and strangers , and many have several games going at once .
Everyone seems to love the online game — everyone , that is , except the companies that own the rights to Scrabble : Hasbro , which sells it in North America , and Mattel , which markets it everywhere else .
In January , they denounced Scrabulous as piracy and threatened legal action against its creators , two brothers in Calcutta named Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla who run a software development company .
Both Hasbro and Mattel said they were hoping for a solution that would not force them to shut down the game .
Jayant Agarwalla , 21 , said they did not create Scrabulous to make money , even though they now collect about $ 25,000 a month from online advertising .
They just wanted to play Scrabble on their computers , and their favorite ( unauthorized ) site had started charging , he said .
“ Our family has been playing the game for 50 years now , ” he said , and received a set when the game first came out in India .
His mother encouraged him and his 26 - year - old brother , Rajat , to play as a learning tool , often with a dictionary by the board .
Scrabulous , which most users play on the Facebook social - networking site , has a board that looks just like Scrabble , and the same number of letter tiles with the same point values .
Players can send invitations to others on Facebook or search for strangers to play with by posting messages .
There is no time limit for moves or games .
Scrabulous keeps track of player statistics , and it does not allow fake words .
It cannot , however , prevent players from cheating .
One method is an unaffiliated online “ helper ” program , which generates a list of possible words based on the letters a user has .
Two game companies , RealNetworks of Seattle and Electronic Arts of Redwood City , Calif. , say they have signed deals with Hasbro to create online versions of the company ’s games .
Both say their versions of Scrabble will be out shortly .
But Scrabulous has already brought Scrabble a newfound virtual popularity that none of the game companies could have anticipated .
The threat of legal action has not gained the companies many admirers .
Many Scrabulous fans , some of whom say they bought the board game for the first time after playing the online version on Facebook , call their approach heavy - handed and out of touch .
“ The big thing that Hasbro is missing is that this is targeting a young audience that in general is not into board games , ” said Venkat Koduru , the 15 - year - old founder of the Facebook group “ Save Scrabulous . ”
Mr. Koduru had three Scrabulous games going as of Wednesday .
He has gathered names of more than 1,000 people who have pledged to never buy a Scrabble board if Hasbro and Mattel shut down the online game .
Other groups devoted to saving the game have recently been created on Facebook , including “ Please God , I Have So Little : Do n’t Take Scrabulous Too . ”
Tens of thousands of fans have joined in , threatening to boycott Hasbro and Mattel products .
Iain Morgan , 34 , a music producer in London who goes by the name Iain Easy , is playing 25 games of Scrabulous at the same time .
The funny thing is , he said , he was never a fan of the original board game .
Mr. Morgan , who is the host of a Facebook group called “ Help , I ’m a Scrabulous Addict , ” attributes the game ’s popularity to “ all these people who are bored at work in their office , ” and added that the game keeps him in regular contact with his mother .
The legal questions concerning Scrabulous are complicated by the interests of the companies that own the rights to Scrabble .
Harold Zeitz , senior vice president for games at RealNetworks , said Friday that he was working closely with the Agarwalla brothers to bring the official Scrabble game to Facebook users .
Hasbro , meanwhile , said in a statement that Electronic Arts was planning to release an online version of Scrabble this spring .
And Mattel , which signed a deal with RealNetworks last July , says that settling with the Agarwallas would set a bad precedent .
Neither Hasbro nor Mattel would disclose the number of Scrabble board games they have sold since Scrabulous started becoming popular last year .
Hasbro estimates it sells one million to two million Scrabble boards a year in North America .
To some online marketing experts , Scrabulous represents a turning point for the board game industry , which has struggled for years to recreate itself as new generations turned alternatives like the Xbox and the GameBoy .
“ If you ’re Hasbro or Mattel , it is n’t in your interest to shut this down , ” said Matt Mason , a consultant to the entertainment industry and author of “ The Pirate ’s Dilemma : How Youth Culture Is Reinventing Capitalism . ”
The board game industry will be forced to adapt , Mr. Mason predicts , just as the music industry has adjusted to unauthorized downloads of songs .
“ If something ’s already out there and proven , the companies should go with it , ” he said .
For their part , Mattel and Hasbro are trying to protect their franchise as consumers turn increasingly to the Internet for entertainment .
They say they consider Scrabble a crown jewel and are working on marketing campaigns for the game ’s 60th anniversary this year .
The plans include adding anniversary labels to Scrabble packaging and introducing a folding edition of the deluxe Scrabble board .
Scrabble began as Lexico in 1931 , the creation of an out - of - work architect , Alfred Mosher Butts .
He determined the frequency of each letter in the game and its value by reviewing the front page of The New York Times .
His patent was denied , and it was 17 years before he found a manufacturer , which renamed the game Scrabble .
It took many more years before Scrabble became popular , thanks in part to a Macy ’s chairman who was a fan , according to the game ’s official history .
The Scrabble brand in North America was passed from manufacturer to manufacturer .
It landed with Hasbro in 1989 .
The British game maker J. W. Spear & Sons owned the rights outside North America until the company was bought by Mattel in 1994 .
The board game has had a core group of close - knit , intense fans for decades .
They attend tournaments , refer to amateurs as “ living room players , ” and memorize lists of two - letter words .
Until Scrabulous landed on Facebook , no one could have mistaken the game , which had only a few thousand users , for a fast - growing phenomenon .
The Agarwallas introduced their first Scrabble knockoff Web site , bingobinge.com , in August 2005 , and renamed it Scrabulous.com a year later .
In May 2007 , one of the site ’s users suggested they adapt the game as a Facebook application , and it took off .
After 25 years with the National Scrabble Association , John D. Williams Jr. , the executive director , said he had seen numerous copyright infringements of Scrabble , but the Scrabulous program on Facebook was the most “ widespread and intense . ”
Dozens of other Web sites offer unauthorized versions of Scrabble , but most force users to play in real time or require clunky downloads to play .
“ People believe it to be in the public domain , like chess , ” Mr. Williams said .
“ The idea that Scrabble belongs to a corporation is something that people do n’t or are unwilling to accept . ”
The Agarwalla brothers are avid players themselves — Jayant had 14 Scrabulous games going as of Saturday , and Rajat was playing 19 .
Jayant , who is responsible for the game ’s player interface and customer support , said , “ People rarely find time to sit down anymore with their family and friends , to invite people over , to prepare the tea and biscuits . ”
Even though it is easy to cheat at Scrabulous , he says he thinks few players actually do .
“ You may be doing it for personal glory , but it really takes the fun out of the game , ” he said .

From FreeThoughtPedia
Despite the argument from some theists that the United States was founded on Christianity , the separation of church and state remains of paramount importance , not just for atheists but to protect the practice of religion from state interference as well .
Unfortunately , it seems the most outspoken patriots on this issue are , ironically , the freethinkers .
Atheists care about religion because religion is not some innocuous or mostly - benevolent force in society .
Quite the contrary .
Religion infringes upon the daily lives of all citizens , whether or not they believe .
Churches are tax - exempt , yet they typically consume disproportionally more of public - funded resources .
Time has clearly shown religion to be a significant factor in war , murder , suppression of scientific progress and humanitarian aid , and oppression of women , minorities and others with different beliefs .
Religion is " in our face "
Some believe a person 's spiritual beliefs are private and personal and those people do n't raise the ire of non-theists , but there 's a huge amount of pro-religious propaganda that permeates everyday life .
From the seemingly innocuous " God bless you " when you sneeze , to pro-life bumper stickers , daily affirmations , religious billboards , churches every few blocks , " In God we trust " on every dollar bill , blinking religious signs , the President mentioning God every so often , faith - based initiatives and more .
It 's rare to walk anywhere in public and not see some religious advertisement every few moments .
Imagine if the cause of non-belief were promoted to even one hundredth this degree ?
Theists would be totally outraged .
Yet if an atheist decides to react to the overwhelming pro-religion propaganda that 's in his face on a daily basis , he 's labeled as " angry " , " militant " , " intolerant " and " extremist " or even " blasphemer " and eligible for a jail sentence in some countries .
If you promote your superstitious beliefs in a public space , it 's only fair that we have a right to respond to them .
Religious beliefs shape political decisions in spite of scientific consensus
In the US , Republican John Shimkus ( R - Ill . ) , who will seek the Energy and Commerce Committee chairmanship , maintained in 2009 that we do not have to worry about climate change because God promised in the Bible not to destroy the world again after Noah 's flood . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
Atheists are actively discriminated against
In many states people who do n't believe in god are discriminated against by law .
There are numerous examples of institutionalized and political prejudice against non-theists .
Many taxpayer / government - funded institutions such as the Boy Scouts actively discriminate against non-believers .
Many civic groups , such as the Masons , refuse membership to atheists .
They allow their members to believe in a wide variety of superstitious , mythological entities from Allah to Yahweh , but if you reject all that , you are not welcome .
Even American presidents have condoned intolerance towards atheists :
" No , I do n't know that atheists should be considered as citizens , nor should they be considered patriots .
This is one nation under God . " -- George H. Bush , August 27 , 1987
In this clip , CNN has a debate about atheists with no actual atheists as part of the debate
Mainstream media suggests that atheists should not be accommodated in American society . [ 3 ]
Religion imposes its own arbitrary moral values in the form of laws restricting peoples ' freedom
Religiously - motivated " blue laws " restrict what all people can do on certain days .
It seems inappropriate to tell store owners they can't sell certain products on a certain day of the week .
In some areas of the country , and specifically outside the United States , it is illegal or dangerous to open your business on Saturday or Sunday , where such days may be considered holy days based on local mythology .
In many jurisdictions , the sale of alcohol is prohibited .
The motivation behind these " dry counties " is based on religion .
And in many other areas , you cannot purchase alcohol or other goods on Sunday .
Abortion is illegal in many areas of the country , even though many other forms of killing of creatures is often celebrated .
This is also religiously motivated and inconsistent .
Atheists are forced to subsidize religion
Churches do n't pay a fair share of taxes , if at all .
This increases the overall tax burden for everybody else , and ironically churches are the last institutions that need financial support from the government .
Religion is promoted throughout a number of inappropriate , secular mediums , from being stamped on money to embedded into daily pledges expressed by students .
George W. Bush has carried this injustice even further by implementing an Office of Faith - Based Initiatives in government and taking even more taxpayer dollars and giving it to church groups .
Religion curtails freedom of speech and freedom of expression
Even moderate theists who respect the separation of church and state , help protect the extremist factions by not allowing religious debate in the public sector ; a show such as Richard Dawkins ' " The Root of All Evil ? " would never be shown on network television in America .
Religion is actively and aggressively promoting war , conflict , oppression and prejudice
Religion has played a primary role in most wars and death in the history of human civilization
Many religions actively promote racism , sexism , even slavery and terrorist activities
The Sept. 11th attacks on the United States could not have been perpetrated had the attackers not been motivated by religion and its promise of rewards for noble sacrifices like suicide bombing
Religion undermines social responsibility
Judeo - Christian religions directly promote the idea of supernatural " forgiveness " of sins , allowing people to commit horrible and immoral acts and think that through prayer and prostration to god , their transgressions can be forgiven .
What motivation is there to be a decent human being in the first place if you can ask your god to forgive you at any time ?
Humans are taught through religion that everything , " is part of god 's plan " and ultimately beyond their control .
Religiously - motivated 12 - step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous suggest to people that they are not in control of their own actions and must depend upon some supernatural force to keep them clean .
Ultimately its a reason why these programs fail most of the time -- people are not taught to bear personal responsibility for their own actions .
Religion promotes meaningless gestures such as " prayer " as an alternative to more substantive actions to help fellow members of the community .
Religion stifles progress in all areas of science and society
Religious ideology is behind efforts to curtail advances in stem cell research , perhaps one of the most promising medical fields in our lifetime , capable of curing many diseases
Catholics in Africa are actively discouraging condom use , in an area where AIDS is out of control , and therefore directly contributing to the spread of this deadly disease
Creationists and other religious people are intent upon perverting school curriculum to reflect their dogmatic view of the world , regardless of whether their views are truthful or scientific .
They insist on re-writing textbooks that young children are using to include propaganda that promotes their ideological doctrine and often conflicts with reality .
One of the best presentations on this subject is by an Internet activist who goes by the name " Imrational " on YouTube :
What about moderate / liberal theists / theism ?
Many people argue that atheists pick on all theists when the fundamentalist / extremist ones are mostly at fault and the majority of theists are more benign and beneficial to society .
This is wrong .
ALL theists and ALL forms of theism are harmful and destructive .
The points outlined above are not specific to fundamentalist extremists ;
They are common among virtually all theistic denominations .
Contrary to what most may believe , moderate theists are the most destructive .
This is because they provide the cover ( as well as the breeding ground ) for the fundamentalists .
They are the major force that will not allow open and honest debate on theism to exist in the public mainstream media .
There are many great documentaries on science and theology that will never air in the United States because theists , even moderate and liberal ones , would not tolerate such discussion .
This is because theism really does n't have much of a legitimate , rational leg to stand on .
The very fact that theists would rather not have their beliefs critiqued further underlines the reality that their beliefs are most likely not rational and that theists are most likely unable to defend them in an open forum .
For this reason , Atheists cannot pick and choose certain factions of fundamentalists to rail against .
In truth , all theists -- from extremists to liberals -- are part of the same deluded group .
They all create the same problems for our society , and it would be intellectually dishonest to claim otherwise .
Sam Harris gives another great presentation on this issue , going beyond the basics to explain why even moderate and liberal theists should be considered a threat to freedom , science , rationality and peace :
What 's wrong with Christianity ?
Christians follow a book of fables concocted by a Bronze Age desert tribe , attributing to it the answers to everything important in our world and denying well reasoned , testable , scientific discoveries and advancements until forced , after decades , centuries even millenia of naysaying , war , oppression , executions and banishments from society of people who dare to question the complete inerrancy and / or relevancy of said book of Bronze Age fables .
Christians ascribe their individual sets of beliefs , occasionally moderated , often exacerbated , by clergy , to an invisible , inerrant and all powerful " friend " who lives in their minds .
Not coincidentally , each person believes that " God " believes exactly the same way they do , yet each person has a different set of beliefs .
Real world decisions with very serious consequences are made based on these commonly shared fantasies .
Christianity teaches people to simply believe what they 're told and to develop cognitive systems for confirming ideas that they MUST hold , even if it conflicts with observable reality .
The result is that reality is distorted to conform to their ideas of " God " and not the other way around .
Many Christians believe in a " literal " interpretation of the Bible , as though every page contained therein , not one more , not one less , is the unquestionable , literal word of the entity that created and runs the universe .
This is so utterly ignorant of the facts of linguistics , namely the fact that each person is reading a different translation that has been filtered through two to three languages .
Moreover , there is no way that modern people have any sort of definitive understanding of all of the nuances of ancient Greek , Hebrew and Aramaic .
Yet , somehow , the New International Version , or " God forbid " the King James Version is word - for - word literally inerrant .
And then there were all of those " books of the Bible " that were arbitrarily tossed out for political or other reasons .
Emboldened by this sense of grandiosity and righteousness , from many peoples ' experience , a vast majority of Christians feel completely comfortable passing judgment upon other people , including other Christians , and are willing to use whatever means are at their disposal to cause them to conform to a " righteous path " ( see : that which each individual in his head thinks is appropriate , and with which God inevitably agrees ) .
Sure , there is Biblical scripture that cautions against such judgments .
But if you 're going to make a statement about what Christianity is , or what Christians are , generally , the only meaningful measure is how the scripture , culture and customs as a whole are interpreted and implemented .

' Heathrow is my home ' :
Meet one of the 100 homeless people who live at the airport
With pink lipstick and freshly brushed hair , an attractive woman queues to buy a cup of coffee at a restaurant overlooking the departure hall of Britain 's biggest and busiest airport .
It is just before 7 am , and the passengers ahead of her at Costa will soon be rushing to catch their flights all over the world .
Yet Eram Dar has no passport and no ticket .
What 's more , she is n't in a hurry to go anywhere .
Eram 's home is Heathrow 's Terminal One .
Over the past year and a half , she has lived at the airport with all her possessions in a blue canvas bag .
Today , she plans to do a bit of window shopping at the airport 's stores and , perhaps , buy a bowl of pasta for lunch .
She often finds a discarded newspaper and reads it to while away the day .
No place to go : Eram Dar says ' Heathrow is like a good hotel '
As night falls , she will sleep on the floor between an American Express currency exchange booth and a Wall 's ice - cream vending machine on a corridor that leads to Terminal One from the underground .
She says simply and in a middle - class English accent : ' Living at Heathrow is like being in a good hotel .
It is warm , very clean and you do n't get bothered .
I think I 'm very lucky to be here .
' I sleep in the same spot every night , if another person has n't grabbed it first .
Sometimes the airport passengers peer down at me as they walk by .
The night cleaners mop and brush around me .
I just close my eyes and put my scarf over my head to block them all out . '
Eram is one of an astonishing number of people who , it was revealed this week , live at Heathrow .
It is a scenario reminiscent of Stephen Spielberg 's film , The Terminal , which starred Tom Hanks as a stateless Eastern European tourist who sets up home at New York 's JFK airport after his own country is erased from the map by war .
However , what is happening at Heathrow is not the stuff of Hollywood fiction .
The fact is the homeless are flocking to British airports as never before .
Over the past three months , it has been discovered that 111 people are sleeping permanently at Heathrow , and the numbers are growing - 20 homeless are believed to be living at Gatwick and more are expected .
Airports are seen as warm , comfortable havens and safer than sleeping rough .
Yet charity workers say the homeless have to play a 24 - hour - a - day cat - and - mouse game to avoid detection by police and airport security and being thrown out onto the streets .
Peter Mansfield - Clark , a director of the charity Crawley Open House , based near Gatwick airport , explains : ' These people take a rucksack with them with a change of clothes .
They use the toilet areas to wash or shave and make themselves look tidy .
' They 'll often be in travel gear , so they appear as if they 're waiting to go off somewhere or have just come back .
If you look the part , you 've a chance of being able to sleep without anyone disturbing you . '
Some of the homeless deliberately put on floral shirts , as though they are about to fly to a holiday in the sun , to help escape suspicion .
Eram sleeps in the bus station near terminal 3 if she is evicted from the airport
Most also have a suitcase on wheels , which makes them fit in with the crowds .
Some even pose as businessmen in suits , hiding behind newspapers if the security staff come their way , or lie on benches covered with a coat as if they are waiting for a delayed flight .
This week I spent two nights at Heathrow , after the London - based charity Broadway was brought in by the British Airport Authority to help the airport 's homeless .
Howard Sinclair , chief executive of Broadway , told me : ' It 's not as hard as living on the streets .
That 's why the homeless go there . '
One of them is Harben , a 51 - year - old Indian who came to Britain 23 years ago .
I met him as he was walking into the departure lounge of Terminal Two , about to settle down for the night .
He was wearing a thin cotton jacket and rain - soaked trousers .
In his left hand was a white bag , containing a camel - coloured wool overcoat with a Harrods label inside .
He says he found it under a bench at the airport a few weeks ago .
He lives at Heathrow by choice , and has done since his luck ran out six months ago after his marriage broke down , when he left the family home and struggled to keep his plumbing business going .
' When I found Heathrow , it was good news for me because , since my marriage broke up , I had nowhere else to go , ' he says .
As darkness falls over Heathrow , and the last planes take to the skies , the airport goes quiet for the night .
Harben creeps into his favourite place , behind the rows of sleeping passengers lying on benches in the Terminal Two lounge .
He lies on the floor , a few feet away from an internet cafe .
He covers himself in the Harrods coat and begins to snore .
But not for long .
Soon , a security man comes over and wakes him .
Harben is marched to the door and pushed out into the rain .
' Now , do n't come back again ! ' he is told brusquely .
I follow him towards the central bus station , at the heart of Heathrow .
There , he lies down on a wooden bench .
The bus terminal is noisy and drafty .
It adjoins Terminals One , Two and Three and is always busy .
Here , there are a dozen people asleep on benches .
Some will be waiting for early morning buses home .
Others are the homeless .
One man , with a curly mop of hair , has a big blue suitcase standing beside him as he sleeps .
He keeps his hand on it , protectively .
I see him on the first night , and in exactly the same position the second night .
' We call him Michael , ' says a bus station official , with a shake of his head .
' He keeps all his possessions in that blue suitcase .
' You watch - at six o'clock , when the buses start arriving , he will walk off trailing the case behind him to the wash rooms .
I do n't know what he does during the rest of the day .
But he 'll be back tonight after nine . '
So what of Eram ?
It was during my first night at Heathrow that I found her .
She was asleep , lying on the floor on a turquoise blanket and wearing a purple dress .
' She sleeps here every night , ' says the male cleaner .
' Tomorrow morning , when the passengers start to come into the airport , she 'll get up because of the noise of the trolleys .
You 'll have to wait to speak to her . '
At last Eram sits up .
It is 6.30 am and a passenger has just bought an ice - cream from the machine beside her head .
There is a jangle of coins , and then a thud as the carton drops down .
It is enough to wake the dead .
' I could n't help hearing that , ' she tells me .
Soon , she is relating the story of how she became one of Heathrow 's homeless .
Many of the homeless like ' Michael ' ( above ) have suitcases to make it seem like they are going on holiday
Eram was born into a middle - class home in Enfield , a suburb of North London .
Her father was an entrepreneurial businessman with an insurance broking business .
Her mother was proud to be a housewife .
She had four half - sisters and a one half - brother .
' My mother was strict when I was a teenager .
I was n't happy at home because of that .
' My parents settled in Britain from Kenya before I was born .
They are Asians and they did n't want me going out and learning the English ways .
It meant arguments , although I understand now they only wanted the best for me . '
Eram went to a good school , St Andrew 's secondary in Enfield .
She passed five O - levels and studied law , intending to become a solicitor .
In the end , she did not finish her training and became a legal secretary .
With a good income , she moved out of home and rented her own flat .
But , then she became ill .
' I 've had skin problems , psoriasis , since I was 16 , ' she explains .
' It flared up 20 years later and I could n't go to work very easily .
It was all over my arms and my hands . '
She pulls up her sleeves to show me .
' I had problems paying the rent , and then I was evicted by the private landlord .
I ran back to my flat from the court and packed my bag .
I only took what I could carry . '
By now , Eram 's father had died , her mother had Alzheimer 's disease and she was put in sheltered council housing .
The family house had been sold .
Meanwhile , her four half - sisters did n't want to help , and her elder half - brother had emigrated to Canada .
Sipping her coffee at Costa , overlooking the departures hall , she explains : ' I had no one really .
One friend , called Harry , that was all .
I left my big suitcase with him and moved onto the streets taking my blue bag .
It took me some years to hear about Heathrow .
' I liked it here immediately .
I have never felt lonely because there are so many people .
I do n't mix much with the other homeless , although they are of all ages and from every walk of life .
I am not the only middle - class one here .
' We all recognise each other , but I just like to keep myself to myself .
The airport feels quite secure .
In fact , you could say that it 's cheap and cheerful . '
Eram goes to the local library in Hounslow to borrow books .
Somehow , she has acquired a Freedom Pass ( normally available to the over - 60 s but also given to the homeless in London ) which means she can travel anywhere in the city by bus .
Once a week , she travels to the Samaritans headquarters in central London to collect a Giro cheque of £ 60 in benefits .
The money has to be paid there , because she has no place of abode or proper address .
' The cash goes nowhere , ' she says .
' Buying food at the airport is expensive .
I do n't eat anything at breakfast because , if I do , it makes me feel more hungry .
' Once a week , normally when I get the Giro cheque , I splash out and buy a big meal of pasta .
It keeps me going .'
Sometimes , there is a police sweep to rid the airport of the homeless .
Eram has been marched out and driven away before .
' The officers left me on the Bath Road , just nearby , and I came back again , ' she says with a hint of laughter .
' The builders who work overnight at the airport are very kind and do n't report the homeless to the authorities .
The cleaners turn a blind eye , too .
' In the mornings , when I get up , I wash and change my clothes so I do n't stand out from the crowds .
I look like a passenger most of the time .
Sometimes , people ask me which flight I am about to catch .
' I try to make plans for the future , but that 's difficult when you have next to nothing and live at an international airport .
Yet most of the time I am happy . '
Is she just putting on a brave face ?
Eram is 42 , although she looks ten years younger .
She has no family , no boyfriend , almost nothing apart from the contents of the blue bag .
It does n't seem much of a life .
' I do n't really see a different future , ' she admits , slowly and in a quiet voice .
' I try to count my blessings .
I do n't take drugs , I do n't drink , I do n't have any mental problems .
I am not down and out , yet .
In fact , I could be living at Heathrow forever . '

Democratic Convention Watch is now at http://www.DemocraticConventionWatch.com
With the looming 5/31 meeting of the DNC Rules & Bylaws Committee , it seems that there is increasing pressure to find a workable solution that allows all sides to get most of what they want while saving face .
It may be that no one wants to find out how the RBC would try to cut the baby of Florida and Michigan in half , so it 's in everyone 's interests to find a solution that works .
In Michigan , a proposal has gathered the support of Michigan 's Democratic party ( including the governor and the state 's Congressional delegation ) to apportion the delegates 69 /59 , giving Clinton a 10 delegate " win " as the best possible solution given that Obama did n't even appear on the ballot in Michigan .
Clinton has recently rejected the proposal , saying she wants the delegates seated " as is " .
This stance seems a bit odd , given that a. ) the current results would give Clinton a 73 - 55 advantage , which is only 8 additional delegates than the compromise proposed ( assuming that the 55 assigned to " Uncommitted " actually became Obama delegates ) , and b. ) that the RBC is most likely to decide to cut Michigan 's delegation in half unless a compromise is reached .
In Florida , the Obama campaign is starting to quietly suggest it can live with a compromise that gives Clinton another 10 delegate lead ( the results were 113 - 74 for Clinton , a stronger 29 delegate win ) .
Murkying the waters is Edwards - now that he has endorsed Obama his delegates are starting to switch to supporting Obama as well .
Giving Edwards ' 13 FL delegates to Obama cuts Clinton 's advantage to just 16 .
It appears that in Florida consensus is building that the RBC may just leave the election results in place and cut the delegation in half .
The result of this would be Clinton 56.5 , Obama 37 and Edwards 6.5 ; cutting Clinton 's lead to either 19.5 or 13 depending on Edwards ' delegates .
Given the really small numbers involved here , I 'm surprised Clinton is taking such a strong line against a compromise , given the likely reality .
Obama is under political pressure to have a compromise in Florida worked out by May 20th , when he has a rally planned in Tampa .
So where does that leave things ?
Michigan : A compromise plan endorsed by the state Democratic party that is being sent to the Rules and Bylaws committee is the most likely solution given Obama did n't appear on the ballot .
Hillary ends up with a +10 delegate count and the Michigan superdelegates come into play .
Florida :
No clear compromise plan in place , so I 'd say the convention wisdom is the RBC cuts Florida 's delegate count in half and leaves the election results in place , giving Hillary a +19.5 delegate bump , and the Edwards delegates become new quasi-supers , courted by both camps .
The situation is still very fluid but will likely come to a conclusion on or before the 5/31 committee meeting .

There are many reasons why large organizations , public and private , struggle with information technology ( IT ) development .
One , which I ’ve already discussed here and here , deals with finding and hiring the best engineers you can .
But even if you do find and hire excellent IT engineers , the real question is : can you hold onto them ?
There is an anti-pattern that I ’ve seen in large organizations which I have come to call “ the Dead Sea effect ” .
The Dead Sea , of course , is a large body of water between Israel and Jordan , located well below sea level .
The Jordan River empties into it ; water leaves only by evaporation , which means that over the eons , the Dead Sea has become very salty ( e.g. , 8 x saltier than the ocean ) .
As such , it is generally unable to support life , except when spring floods temporarily lower the salinity .
Many large corporate / government IT shops — and not a few small ones — work like the Dead Sea .
New hires are brought in as management deems it necessary .
Their qualifications ( talent , education , professionalism , experience , skills — TEPES ) will tend to vary quite a bit , depending upon current needs , employee departure , the personnel budget , and the general hiring ability of those doing the hiring .
All things being equal , the general competency of the IT department should have roughly the same distribution as the incoming hires .
But in my experience , that ’s not what happens .
Instead , what happens is that the more talented and effective IT engineers are the ones most likely to leave — to evaporate , if you will .
They are the ones least likely to put up with the frequent stupidities and workplace problems that plague large organizations ; they are also the ones most likely to have other opportunities that they can readily move to .
What tends to remain behind is the ‘ residue ’ — the least talented and effective IT engineers .
They tend to be grateful they have a job and make fewer demands on management ; even if they find the workplace unpleasant , they are the least likely to be able to find a job elsewhere .
They tend to entrench themselves , becoming maintenance experts on critical systems , assuming responsibilities that no one else wants so that the organization can’t afford to let them go .
I ’m painting with pretty broad strokes here , yet I ’ve seen this same effect taking place in different companies and different IT shops .
Large companies tend to lose the really talented IT engineers and hold onto the less talented ones , when they should been actively seeking to do just the opposite .
And the effect tends to be self - reinforcing : the worse an IT shop becomes , the harder it is to get really talented and effective IT engineers to join it and the harder it is to retain them if they do .
It can reach a point that the really good talent only comes in as entry - level personnel who do n’t know any better — but once they do wise up , they ’re gone .
======= SOME RESPONSES TO COMMENTS =============
The discussion over at Slashdot , as well as the comments below , have raised excellent issues , though some misunderstand or mischaracterize what I ’m talking about above .
Here ’s a response to the main themes that I see coming up there .
The Dead Sea effect is n’t unique to IT .
True enough , though I could say the same thing about just about any project management issue regarding IT .
What is unusual about IT ( shared with other engineering disciplines ) is the degree to which individual talent and other factors affect productivity and quality .
And what is unique about IT ( as opposed to , say , civil / mechanical / chemical engineers , architects , etc. ) is that there is no standard ( state - run ) professional certification , so there is no assurance of minimum education and competency .
This is obvious / common sense / trivial .
So are most of the problems in IT .
Fred Brooks and Jerry Weinberg pretty much nailed down all the essential issues in IT project and personnel management more than 30 years ago ; yet , amazingly , the problems have n’t all gone away !
There is a profound lack of professional and institutional memory in IT ; almost everyone who writes about IT project / personnel management ( myself included ) is looking for new ways to cast or explain the core issues in a touching hope that maybe this time someone will actually listen and fix them .
The Dead Sea effect is just the Peter Principle ( or a corollary thereof ) .
No , it is n’t .
The Peter Principle is that a given person rises ( is promoted ) to her / his level of incompetence ( I ’m actually old enough to remember when ‘ the Peter Principle ’ first came out ) .
This has nothing to do with promotion within the IT organization ; it has to do with self - selected removal from that IT organization , not due to a lack of promotion or opportunity , but just because there are greener pastures elsewhere .
Not all IT shops are like this .
I would certainly hope so .
In fact , there are IT organizations where just the opposite occurs ; the quality of the IT engineers is quite high , and engineers who are mediocre or disruptive either do n’t get hired or do n’t last long if they are .
I worked in one such IT group ( Pages Software ) for five years .
During that time , we had only one voluntary departure ( the network admin ) ; we had two others who were dismissed due to problems , and a few others who were ( painfully ) cut in downsizing .
( On the other hand , here are some thoughts on why people would leave an outstanding ( and lucrative ) IT organization like Google . )
Not everyone ‘ left behind ’ is incompetent .
Again , this syndrome does n’t apply to all IT groups , and it does n’t apply to the same extent to all IT groups .
Turnover in IT personnel is common ( though it can be reduced by intelligent management ) , and just because good engineers have left a given IT group does n’t mean that the rest are , in fact , residue .
What I ’m talking about here is a very real syndrome , typically found in large corporations and government organizations , but it ’s certainly not universal .
The IT hiring process is broken .
Amen .
Not only is the IT hiring process broken in many organizations , the entire approach to IT is often broken .
It is rife with empire - building , ‘ heroic ’ project management , and an ‘ interchangeable code monkeys ’ mindset .
As mentioned in the comments section below , Ruby Raley and I wrote an article for Cutter IT Journal that stated that an approach modeled after professional sport teams could well be far more effective , but no one has yet hired me to try it out .
On the other hand , I would argue that this is to a large extent the approach we took as Pages , which is why we had such a great and effective IT group with so little turnover .
The problem is a failure of leadership .
Again , amen .
I wrote an entire book about that over a decade ago ( The Art of ‘ Ware , M&T Books , 1995 ) , which I ’m currently revising .
This does n’t describe / encompass all the problems in professional IT shops .
If it did , life would be much easier .
Again , note that I ’ve written a bit on the subject .
I ’m currently working on revised versions of two of my books ( The Art of ‘ Ware [ Version 2.0 ] and Pitfalls of Modern Software Engineering ) while writing a new one ( Surviving Complexity ) , from which this posting on the “ Dead Sea effect ” is a very , very tiny extract .
Thanks for the great comments and the feedback ; I wish I could get you folks to do this for all sections of all of my books .
For real - world examples of this phenomenon , just spend some time reading The Daily WTF ( a site I highly recommend for all IT managers ) .
In particular , their “ Tales from the Interview ” category gives some interesting insights from both sides of the hiring process .
Also , Alex Papadimoulis , who runs The Daily WTF , has put forth his own proposal for dealing with IT turnover .
I especially like his concept of the Value Apex .
Be sure to read his article ; here ’s my response to it .. bruce ..

President Bush , who recently revealed he gave up playing golf on Aug. 19 , 2003 because it “ sends the wrong signal ” during a time of war , has ended his near five - year sacrifice .
The Wounded - Courier has obtained a rush transcript of the president ’s discussion to air tonight on Fox News ’ Special Report with Brit Hume .
The following is an excerpt from that interview :
BRIT HUME : Mr. President , why did you decide to take up golf again ?
PRESIDENT BUSH : Well , Brit , I ’ve proven my solidarity with our troops and their families .
I have n’t hit the links for longer than the longest tours of duty of any of our brave fighting men and women .
And , quite frankly , I think this country has sacrificed enough .
BRIT HUME : A tremendous sacrifice indeed , Mr. President .
I ’m sure our citizens will breathe a sigh of relief knowing that our progress in the war on terror is such that their commander - in - chief can once more safely bestride golf courses across America .
PRESIDENT BUSH : Exactly , Brit .
The long national nightmare is over .
Tomorrow morning , I plan to eat a healthy egg white omelet , maybe a little yogurt and fresh fruit , then I ’m off to play a good eighteen holes .
( laughs )
Maybe more if these ol ’ battle - scarred knees allow it .
BRIT HUME : Is it fair to say you ’re picking up golf again , sir , should be seen as not only evidence the surge has been successful but also a rallying cry to those young men and women who continue to put themselves in harm ’s way so their president can play golf with peace of mind ?
PRESIDENT BUSH :
Well , I ’m sure there are those out there who wo n’t make that connection for partisan reasons .
But , you know , we ’re in the political season .
So politics has taken over .
I know that .
But , look , I ’m confident the American people will see this as what it is – a clear victory against the killers who have no respect for the civilized game of golf .
A sport our forefathers fought and died for so that we might play today .
BRIT HUME : Mr. President , were there any moments during your near five - year cessation of playing when you did n’t think you ’d make it ?
Any times that specifically tried your soul or caused you to doubt your mettle ?
PRESIDENT BUSH : Hmm .
You know , not off the top of my – well , there was one very trying time , after Hurricane Katrina .
I was flying in Air Force
One above the wreckage below and one of my staffers informed me that he ’d forgotten to Tivo the previous night ’s American Idol .
I ’ve never told anyone this , Brit .
But flying over the devastation of the Gulf Coast at that moment , the thought of not being able to return as soon as possible to the White House and wind down with Ryan , Simon , Paula and Randy and a pint of Chunky Monkey … well , I was just devastated .
That ’s when , you know , you lean on your faith .
Because you ’re thinking , “ What kind of god would cause me to miss Idol . ”
I ’ll admit I almost played a few holes that day .
BRIT HUME : But–
PRESIDENT BUSH : No , no , I did n’t .
I told the American people I do n’t waver .
In other words , I ’m not a waverer .
No , I went mountain biking instead that day .
I made a promise to our courageous soldiers .
A botched Tivo job was n’t going to cause me to break that sacred oath to them and the American people .
BRIT HUME : Truly inspiring , Mr. President .
Positively Churchillian .
PRESIDENT BUSH : I should also mention golf was n’t the only sacrifice I made in honor of our troops and their families .
Another thing I gave up during this difficult time was lollipops .
I ’m a big fan of lollipops .
But you can imagine , a president in a time of war walking around with a stick hanging out of his mouth … well , I did n’t think it sent the right signal either .
Also , that candy Bit O’ Honey .
It ’s taffy - like but nutty , with just a touch of honey .
But it ’s a little too chewy during wartime .
You know what I mean ? ”
BRIT HUME : Of course , Mr. President .
It ’s difficult , for example , to warn Iran about engaging us in Iraq when you ’re occupied with a gluey yet delicious glop of Bit O ’ Honey waging sweet jihad in your mouth .
PRESIDENT BUSH : Exactly .
It ’s hard work not getting the Bit O ’ Honey caught between your teeth .
But I think Americans also know at this point in the war that even if they see their president with a stick , you know , dangling from his mouth or , uh , chewing so vigorously on something that he can’t speak , that their country is still secure from those who wish to do us harm .
So in other words , Brit , the golf , the lollipops , the Bit O’ Honey – all these options are back on the president ’s table .
BRIT HUME : Mr. President , you might even say this Operation Bit O’ Honey , if you will , is a Trojan horse , a clever tactic to lull terrorists into a false sense of your inattention so they lower their guard .
PRESIDENT BUSH :
Well , you know , I wo n’t reveal security measures that safeguard the homeland .
But let ’s just say I ’ve also got a Charleston Chew in my pocket and I intend to use it during this afternoon ’s press conference .
BRIT HUME ( winks ) : I understand , sir .
Well , before moving on to the completely unfounded rumors about a planned US attack against Adolf Hitler incarnate Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , let me just say , sir , I for one am deeply impressed with your golf sacrifice .
I can only imagine the comfort our troops will take in knowing during a time of war that their president gave up golf for nearly five years .
Long enough for a sitcom to go into syndication , sir .
A remarkable sacrifice that few , if any , Americans can claim to have made as our sons and daughters continue to shed their blood so that democracy may flourish in Iraq .
PRESIDENT BUSH :
Well , thanks for your kind words , Brit .
BRIT HUME : You ’re very welcome .
And may I say , Mr. President , on behalf of our fighting forces and their families , we salute your courage .
If your face does n’t grace Mt. Rushmore by 2009 , they should tear that stony heap down .
PRESIDENT BUSH : Boy , you ’re tough .
( laughs ) I ’ll give ’em to 2010 .
BRIT HUME :
You ’re combination of compassion and strength , sir , makes me wish I had opposite sex parts .
In an ideal world , I ’d conceive your child , buy an obscure island and dedicate the rest of my life to cloning you .
PRESIDENT BUSH : An interesting idea .
I suggest , though , ( laughs ) you take out the gene that gave me bad knees .
Really messes with your golf game .
( The full interview will run tonight at 6 p.m. on Fox News . )

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - The United States and Europe should cut back on production of biofuels because they are hurting food supply at a time of rising prices , an adviser to U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon said on Monday .

Biofuels derived from crops have come under attack in recent weeks on fears they compete with food for farming land and help to push up food prices , worsening a global crisis that is affecting millions of poor .
“ We need to cut back significantly on our biofuels programs , ” said Jeffrey Sachs , a prominent U.S. academic who is a special adviser to Ban on anti-poverty goals .
“ ( They ) were understandable at a time of much lower food prices and larger food stocks but do not make sense now in a global food scarcity condition , ” Sachs told a news conference .
High food and fuel prices have sparked protests and riots in poor countries across the world in the past few months .
Many governments have introduced food subsidies or export restrictions to counter rising costs .
“ In the United States as much as one third of maize crop this year will go to gas tank .
This is a huge blow to the world food supply , ” Sachs said before talks in Brussels with EU lawmakers .
EU leaders pledged last year to increase the proportion of biofuels used in petrol - and diesel - consuming land transport to 10 percent by 2020 as part of measures to tackle climate change .
Governments are now working on draft EU laws .
Faced with growing unease among EU states over food prices and the biofuels ’ green credentials , the European Commission has stuck to the target , but EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said last month it would be subject to strict conditions to prevent social harm .
The United States is the world ’s biggest producer of biofuels .
The fuels are made from crops like corn , wheat , sugar and palm oil , which refiners turn into ethanol or oil to replace gasoline and diesel .
Supporters say they are the only renewable alternative to fossil fuels and generally result in lower greenhouse gas emissions .
Mexicans are spending more on bribes than they were just a few years ago .
They paid the equivalent of about $ 2.6 billion in bribes last year , according to the nonprofit group Transparency Mexico .
That ’s 42 % more than two years earlier and an average of more than $ 24 for each of the country ’s 105 million people .
Much of the money went to have garbage collected , parking tickets fixed or to get parking spots from the legions of informal attendants who block spaces , then charge for them .
Corruption in Mexico is rife and the informal economy huge .
If a driver is stopped for a traffic infraction , it ’s often cheaper and easier to pull out a wallet than face all the paperwork involved in paying the fine at a police station .

Bribes are paid for a wide range of activities , Transparency Mexico found .
People shell out to have telephone service installed and loans approved , to prevent illegally parked cars from getting clamped and to sell merchandise on the street without a permit .
The survey showed that an estimated 197 million bribes were paid nationwide last year , a jump from 115 million in 2005 .
But though people paid more bribes , they spent less on each .
The average bribe was about $ 13 , compared with $ 17 in 2005 .
The poll was based on interviews in December with 16,000 people around the country .
It has a margin of error of less than 1 percentage point .

So the project got his 10th birthday this year .
So much time passed , so much changes in our lives , it 's fun to think about how and when I first discussed the project with Pixel while walking in some french mountains together 10 years ago ...
Little changes in the top 5 on the last 4 years : Groovy 100 % , Ocaml 100 % , Python 85 % , Ruby 66 % , Guile 47 % .
The total combined lines of raw material written by contributors ( *.data ) is 108,000 lines , with Ocaml even longer than original Perl implementation !
Thanks a lot again to all the contributors , Pleac is somehow great thanks to all of you !
200704 .
The project has been making rapid progress of late .
Significant additions have been made to both OCaml and Guile with both languages now over 40 % complete , as they have been made to Tcl , PHP , Pike and REXX , where these languages are now well over 30 % complete .
Haskell is undergoing a reimplementation so as to better conform to standards , and code has been added to each of C , C++ , and Common LISP , with each of these languages now near 10 % complete .
Special mention should be made of Python , a language which has made slow , but steady , progress to now be about 85 % complete , as it should be made of Groovy , which is the latest PLEAC language addition , one which has made remarkably rapid progress , having achieved 100 % completion in a matter of months .
The top 5 are now Groovy ( 100 % ) , Python ( 85 % ) , Ruby ( 63 % ) , Guile ( 43 % ) and OCaml ( 41 % ) .
According to Sourceforge statistics , we have 2,000 page views a day .
200501 .
The project is evolving well .
Python and Ruby contributions have been coming in steadily ( both now over 60 % ) , sizable contributions have been made to Tcl ( 25 % ) , Ocaml ( 24 % ) , Ada ( 26 % ) and Pliant ( 9 % ) .
Pike has also picked up as of late ( 14 % ) .
R has been added .
To simplify using and creating example scripts , an include system has been implemented , allowing scripts and data to live in seperate files , which makes them easier to be accessed and used .
Standalone scripts are also accessible as links from the web presentation .
And if you 're curious of statistics , you can have a look at the graphics showing evolution over time ( available upper in the Status section ) .
200307 .
The project is slowing down a bit , but still alive : there are contributed additions , some languages get beginning of implementations ( forth , common lisp , pike ) .
This main - page sees an average of 50 visitors per day .
200110 .
The project is in good shape : we now have decent versions in Python ( 43 % ) , Merd ( 30 % ) , Guile ( 27 % ) , Ruby ( 25 % ) , Haskell ( 21 % ) , Tcl ( 17 % ) , and Java ( 14 % ) .
It can already be used to make basic comparisons between languages , and begins to be referred in some programming language mailing lists .
We also have starting implementations in languages which are not part of the industry standards , but still very important for a programmers ' culture , namely OCaml ( 7.29 % ) , Erlang ( 1.86 % ) and Pliant ( 1.71 % ) .
200108 .
Project registered in Freshmeat .
Versions status are : Merd 30 % , Ruby 25 % , Haskell and Python around 10 % .
200105 ( project founding ) .
The project has been accepted by SourceForge .
Great !
Time to work on the generic sourcecode - colorized web pages , and to begin implementations in Ruby and Merd .
Contribute
To contribute to this projet , you may implement the Solutions shown in the Perl Cookbook in your language of choice , writing them in a simple description language made of @@PLEAC@@_KEYWORD sections :
If you 're adding a new part for an existing programming language ( already some done in PLEAC for that language , for example Ruby ) , follow what 's in this simple sample .
If you 're adding a new programming language ( nothing done in PLEAC for that language ) , follow what 's in this sample .
In all cases , please subscribe to the discussion mailing - list and post your submission there , so we can discuss and include your work .
You may pay particular attention to the results produced by your code .
Given merits and drawbacks of the Perl language , main aim of the project is to solve exactly the same problems in other languages ; indeed , when a resembling keyword of another language does n't behave the same way , be sure to underline this within comments in your source , and provide us with the solution in order to solve exactly the same problem , and produce exactly the same output .
Each time new contents is uploaded to this web site , all description language sources are copied under the " code " links in the Status section upper , and compiled into " html output " .
There is a mailing - list logging the CVS commits ( see SourceForge documentation on this topic ) , you can subscribe in order to be informed and discuss the commits .
Building the project
To generate the sgml and build the html outputs off the source from nightly tarball or directly via an anoymous CVS checkout , you 'll need the relevant building software .
Here are the typically needed packages :
make ruby sgml - common sgml - tools openjade docbook - style - dsssl docbook - dtd31 - sgml emacs emacs-X11
Additionally , find `htmlize.el ' and put it in your ~/etc /emacs .
All right , you 'll probably suffer to successfully compile the stuff ;p .

Dear Ms. :
I write this in response to your communication indicating your concerns on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 ( FISA ) now before the Senate .
This bill has passed the House of Representatives .
This legislation contains multiple sections , including one that deals specifically with liability for telecommunications companies .
However , the primary intent to this new bill is to modernize our intelligence gathering capacity .
The technology and communications industries have seen vast changes in the past thirty years since FISA was first written in 1978 .
This has changed the way surveillance is conducted , and the original law cannot adequately address these procedures .
This is precisely why FISA needs to be modernized .
It is important to understand the consequences if the Senate does not pass this bill .
We would either have to extend the temporary surveillance bill passed last August - which should not happen - or allow surveillance on certain foreign targets to expire which would lay the Nation bare and decrease our ability to identify and protect against terrorist threats .
Neither of these options is acceptable .
I strongly believe that this bill is substantially better than the version the Senate passed in February 2008 , which I opposed .
It is also a major improvement from the Protect America
Act that passed in August 2007 , which had few privacy protections and was never intended to be a permanent solution .
This bill :
o Includes provisions I authored that make clear that FISA is the exclusive ( or only ) authority for conducting surveillance inside the United States .
This is crucial as it requires that all future Presidents must act only within the law .
FISA would be the only legal authority for conducting surveillance on Americans for intelligence purposes , and only legislation that specifically provides wiretapping authority in the future would be an exception to FISA .
o Requires the government to obtain a warrant before surveillance can begin .
This applies to all Americans - anywhere in the world .
The Protect America
Act allowed surveillance for up to six months before getting a warrant .
This bill ends all warrantless surveillance of U.S. persons .
In this sense it is precedent setting .
o Bans reverse targeting , which was a concern under the Protect America Act .
Reverse targeting would allow the government to collect the contents of telephone calls and e-mails of an American by conducting surveillance on the people with whom they communicate .
This is prohibited in this bill .
oRequires that the government implement procedures approved by the Court for minimization .
If an American 's communication is incidentally caught up in electronic surveillance while the Government is targeting someone else , minimization protects that person 's private information .
This has been a hallmark of FISA for 30 years , but court review and approval of minimization procedures was not included in the Protect America Act .
It is here .

Intelligence contractor SITE is firing back at the Telegraph , after the UK publication ran an article claiming that the contractor mistook Fallout 3 images for pictures generated by terrorists .
Advertisement
SITE released a statement to clarify its position , stating that it never claimed the images were produced by terrorists , although it did n't admit to knowing from the start that they were video game images .
Said the contractor :
SITE reported to its subscribers that extremists posted the image to a password - protected forum affiliated with al - Qaeda .
This is entirely accurate .
Moreover , this information was part of a report describing the general atmosphere in this forum with regard to extremists ' discussions on weapons of mass destruction , making its context all the more important .
This report in its entirety is also completely accurate .

It also does n't like that the Telegraph called it " red faced , " either , and says the publication never actually read the report , and nor does it subscribe to its services .
Hit the jump for the contractor 's full statement :
Bush sends Congress Colombian trade deal
President Bush sent Congress a controversial free - trade agreement with Colombia on Monday , stepping up the pressure on Democratic leaders to act against the will of many in their rank - and - file .
" Congress needs to move forward with the Colombia agreement , " Bush said , " and they need to approve it as soon as possible . "
In sending the trade deal to Congress against the wishes of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) , the Bush administration is trying to use the rules governing these agreements as a means to propel it forward despite strong misgivings by members of the majority .
Under Trade Promotion Authority , Congress must act within a specific timeframe to vote on the deal .
Those rules dictatate that lawmakers have a total of 90 legislative days to approve the measure , presumably forcing Congress to act before the next election .
But many Republicans aides and outside lobbyists suggest Democrats will re-write chamber rules to suspend or alter TPA .
" The need for this agreement is too urgent , the stakes for our national security are too high , to allow this year to end without a vote , " Bush told reporters on Monday .
The president and other Republicans have argued the trade deal would provide a critical boost for one of the few U.S. allies in the region .
Democrats , meanwhile , argue that Colombia 's history of violence against labor organizers and the poor working conditions for many of the country 's workers make it a bad trading partner .
The trade deal reared its head on the presidential campaign trail late last week when the Wall Street Journal reported that Mark Penn , a top strategist for Democratic Sen .
Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York , met with Colombian officials in his capacity as the head of public relations giant Burson - Marsteller , which had been retained to advocate on the country 's behalf .
Clinton opposes the free - trade agreement , and Penn quit as her top strategist on Sunday night after his firm was fired by the Colombian government earlier in the weekend .
The deal faces stiff opposition on Capitol Hill , primarily from congressional Democrats .
Even some backers of the pact were pushing the administration to suspend consideration of the deal until they agreed to terms on legislation that would increase assistance for unemployed workers whose jobs left the country .
The House is the biggest hurdle , but even the Senate could prove nettlesome .
" There are enough votes to pass it in the Senate , " Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) told Bloomberg TV last week before calling it " a flawed agreement for our country . "
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) has said he will not bring the deal for a vote before his committee until the administration works with him on trade assistance for the workers whose jobs have gone overseas .
Bush on Monday said he and his administration will continue working with Baucus and others to agree to terms on Trade Adjustment Assistance legislation in order to clear the way for the Colombia deal .
CLARIFICATION : Bush signed a letter Monday sending the agreement to Congress , but the administration will not actually send the trade deal to be ratified until Tuesday because the House is out of session today .
Some time ago , Dominus pointed out to me that " singer , " " finger , " and " ginger " look like they should rhyme but have entirely different pronunciations .
I was amused but did n't know what to do with that information until Jim sent me a forwarded version of the following poem .
That version was titled " English Is Tough Stuff " and included a false claim that the intent was to help multinational NATO personnel pronounce English .
Actually , the poem was written by a Dutch writer named G. J. Nolst Trènitè ( 1870 - 1946 ) , also known as " Charivarius . "
One version on the Web gives a tentative date of 1922 ; a German site states that it appeared in Trènitè 's Drop Your Foreign Accent — Engelse Uitspraakoefeningen ( 5th revised edition , H. D. Tjeenk Willink & Zoon , 1929 ) .
I 'm going to take the chance that it was indeed first published in 1922 and is thus out of copyright .
The poem is mostly a list of English words which either look like they should rhyme but do n't , or have very different spellings but rhyme anyway .
The most interesting thing about it is the way that it 's been changed by the folk process : punctuation , " and "s , and some spellings vary quite a bit among the versions on the Web , and there are a dozen couplets that are in some versions but not others .
My guess is that an American read the poem and thought , " Some of these lines just do n't make any sense ! " , not realizing that it uses British pronunciations ....
Also , some pronunciations have changed since the poem was written , making some lines rather confusing .
The following version is my best guess at what the original might have been , combining elements from multiple versions and massaging the result slightly for scansion .
I 've added explanatory notes to some lines .
Note added in 2019 : in 2018 , I posted more information about the original poem .
It turns out that many of my assumptions in the following version were wrong , but I ’m leaving my version here for historical reasons .

UC defends $ 2.1 million deal for police chief UC BERKELEY
Top campus cop retires with lump sum , then is rehired
UC Berkeley officials are defending an unusual arrangement that allowed Police Chief Victoria Harrison to retire last year with a $ 2.1 million package and then return to the same job right away for more money .
" No laws were broken , " Cal spokeswoman Marie Felde said Thursday .
" That 's very clear . "
UC spokesman Paul Schwartz said the retirement package was consistent with university policy and reflected benefits she rightfully earned .
" She did not receive anything special , " he said .
The two were reacting to a Contra Costa Times story published Thursday that said the chief of the UC Berkeley Police Department received " improper perks " and that administrators broke or bypassed UC and federal rules .
In an interview with The Chronicle , Harrison said she was stunned by the uproar over what she saw as a difficult decision on her part , but one that allowed her to keep working in a place she loves .
" I 'm now 54 , " Harrison said .
" I think I 've got a few good years left in me , and I want to continue to contribute to the big U . "
Harrison started her career at UC Santa Barbara in 1973 and came to Cal in 1985 .
Five years later , she took over as chief .
In June 2007 , however , she found herself in a quandary .
She 'd been eligible for full retirement for more than a year , with a pension that would have paid her as much as she was earning by working .
" I was at 100 percent of my salary , " she said .
" People kept asking me , ' When are you going to retire ? '
They were telling me I was crazy .
And I was told that a job at another municipal police department was mine . "
The problem was that she did n't want to leave , and her boss , Vice Chancellor Nathan Brostrom , did n't want her to go .
The police chief said they explored her options and scoured retirement plans , " reading the fine print . "
They discovered that " if you take the lump sum payout , you 're not considered retired . "
Harrison got a $ 2,130,259 lump sum from the retirement plan .
She will also receive $ 4,621 a month for 10 years , totaling $ 554,520 , from a deferred compensation plan .
Before her retirement , Harrison was earning a base salary of $ 161,527 .
Combined with unused vacation pay and a stipend for her work as associate vice chancellor for public safety , her total compensation had amounted to $ 205,000 a year .
Under the terms of the rehiring , her base pay was $ 175,000 , which increased to $ 181,125 two months later .
In addition , she is receiving $ 12,700 annually for working with Cal 's athletic director and on special projects - for a total of almost $ 194,000 a year .
On the other hand , Harrison said , she forfeited a monthly pension as well as health insurance and other benefits that would have lasted a lifetime .
" When I leave , I 'll have to be self - insured , " Harrison said .
" If I do n't do a good job investing all that money , I could be out on the street with a tin cup .
I did a lot of soul - searching about whether I was willing to take that risk . "
Harrison wanted to keep her 61 unused sick days and the university allowed it as an exception to policy , Schwartz said , because of " extenuating campus circumstances " - they did n't want to lose Harrison .
Schwartz also acknowledged that the university violated its policies by discussing rehiring before Harrison had retired .
He said her " pending employment offer from an outside agency " prompted them to disregard the rules .
However , he insisted no federal rules were broken .
Although the Internal Revenue Service states that such discussions should n't take place before normal retirement age , that age is 50 rather than 60 in the case of safety employees such as Harrison , Schwartz said .
The university also is permitting Harrison to work full time , although its guidelines say recall appointments should be part time - 46 percent or less .
Schwartz said campuses are authorized to determine the amount of work time based on their needs .
" In this case , UC Berkeley determined a full - time appointment was warranted given a range of campus safety issues confronting the campus , including an increase in violent crime and tree - sitting protesters , " Schwartz said .
From UC 's perspective , it all seemed like a good solution .
" She did n't want to keep working a job and not be paid , " Felde said .
" Everything was carefully and deliberately reviewed before the offer was made . "
Others , however , find the deal disturbing , especially in light of a recent UC scandal in which millions of dollars in extra compensation and questionable perks were bestowed on top executives without disclosure to UC regents or the public .
" The lesson for us as students dealing with tuition hikes is this : UC wo n't give us accountability , " said Jessica Schley , a 23 - year - old junior at Cal and editor of the Berkeley Undergraduate Journal .
" We 've got to demand it . "
Bob Stern , president of the Center for Governmental Studies , a Los Angeles nonprofit , said , " It 's pretty amazing to me .
It 's like they have a tin ear .
The university has done things by themselves without any oversight .
They think they can do things other state agencies can't do . "
He said it seemed clear that UC had n't learned any lessons from the compensation debacle .
" They must have really wanted her to stay , " he said .
" But nobody is irreplaceable .
I 'd sure like to have that same deal here . "
After the Chicago Transit Authority pulled an ad campaign for Grand Theft Auto IV last month , a representative of the city dismissed the notion that Take - Two Interactive could sue the CTA for an abridgment of its First Amendment rights .
" The CTA has the right to regulate and establish guidelines for advertising on its properties , " the authority representative told GameSpot at the time .
However , today GameSpot confirmed a Reuters report that Take - Two has filed suit against the CTA , alleging not only a violation of its free - speech rights , but also a contractual agreement .
" Although we prefer to resolve these issues amicably , " a Take - Two spokesperson said in a statement , " the CTA has refused to discuss with us its outrageous decision to pull advertising for the critically acclaimed game Grand Theft Auto IV while running ads for other forms of popular entertainment with similar content , including mature - themed TV shows and R - rated movies . "
The suit was filed against the CTA as well as Titan Outdoor LLC , its external advertising agent .
Take - Two is asking for an order that the CTA run the ads again , and pay at least $ 300,000 in damages .
The six - week campaign of 385 ads was barely underway when the CTA decided to yank the advertising spots .
A CTA representative said at the time that the decision to pull the campaign was made not because of complaints over the GTA IV ads , but due to complaints over a series of ads that Take - Two ran in 2004 for Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas .
That campaign was worth $ 90,000 to the CTA , and due to the fact that the ads had run their course by the time it became an issue , they did n't need to be pulled .
According to a CTA representative , the Grand Theft Auto IV campaign cost Take - Two Interactive $ 316,000 , but the city 's take of that would have been at most $ 205,400 after Titan had taken its cut .
After the ads were pulled , the CTA said that Take - Two would not be charged for the aborted campaign .
PHOENIX ( Reuters ) - Frustrated by a steady flow of illegal Mexican immigrants into Arizona , Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio has decided to take matters into his own hands .
Maricopa County Sheriff , Joe Arpaio , ( C ) talks with investigators in Mesa , Arizona in this December 10 , 2002 file photo .
REUTES / Jeff Topping
Arpaio dispatches teams of sheriff ’s deputies into Hispanic communities where they stop people and arrest anyone who cannot prove he or she is a legal U.S. resident .
Now he faces an onslaught of criticism from Hispanic activists , local lawmakers and the Phoenix mayor , who call his crackdown on immigrants a clear case of racial profiling in which only people who look Hispanic are targeted .
“ What right does a mayor or a police chief , or anyone like that , have to tell me what my priorities are ? ”
Arpaio said in a recent interview .
“ I ’m the elected sheriff .
I tell them what their priorities are . ”
But Mary Rose Wilcox , a county supervisor and longtime Hispanic activist says , “ All he is doing is going after everybody with a brown face . ”
“ There ’s no doubt in my mind that this is racial profiling .
None . ”
Across the country , state and local officials have taken steps to curb illegal immigration .
More than 240 immigration - related measures were passed last year .
Arpaio says he has received an outpouring of support for his effort in the form of letters and donations of about $ 25,000 from the public to help fund the initiative .
Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon said the sheriff ’s “ made - for - TV stunts ” have not stopped illegal immigration and violate the basic civil rights afforded all people in the United States .
“ It ’s a single standard , ” Gordon said .
“ If you ’re brown , you ’re going to be pulled over , and if you ’re white , you ’re not .
It ’s as simple as that . ”
Under the U.S. Constitution , all citizens must be treated equally under the law and the government cannot conduct unreasonable searches and seizures without probable cause .
In April , Gordon sent a letter to the U.S. Attorney General calling for an investigation into Arpaio ’s patrols .
U.S. Justice Department officials are “ monitoring the situation , ” department spokeswoman Jamie Hais said .
She declined to be more specific .
LACK OF LEADERSHIP
Immigration , specifically what do about 12 million illegal immigrants living in the United States , is a divisive issue , but it has largely dropped out of the political debate this election year .
A bid to push a comprehensive immigration overhaul through Congress was nixed by Republican lawmakers last year and the issue is barely mentioned by Republican presidential candidate John McCain or Democratic rival Barack Obama , who both supported the U.S. Senate bill .
In the absence of federal action , states and localities are beginning to take action .
Despite criticism , Arpaio has vowed to continue his patrols and other measures designed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants .
“ They just do n’t want me enforcing the illegal immigration laws .
They think they can intimidate me .
They can ’t , ” said Arpaio , a Republican , who is running for re-election in November .
Gordon said Arpaio should spend his time and limited resources pursuing other more serious criminals like drug and human traffickers , and violent criminals .
The mayor said Arpaio ’s tactics have not reduced crime in the region or curbed illegal immigration .
Instead , Gordon says the sheriff has soured community relations and sparked fear among Hispanic citizens and immigrants .
“ His Band - Aid publicity stunts are n’t going to solve illegal immigration , ” he said .
“ It does n’t do anything to stop the flow .
All it does is make for good TV . ”
If gas and milk price hikes seem steep , check out health insurance premiums .
They have increased 10 times faster than incomes in recent years , a study shows .
Workers with job - based coverage for their families saw earnings rise 3 % from 2001 to 2005 , while their health insurance premium contribution increased 30 % , according to the study by researchers at the State Health Access Data Assistance Center at the University of Minnesota .
The average cost nationally of family coverage during the period increased nearly $ 2,500 , to $ 10,728 from $ 8,281 .
The average cost for job - based family coverage in California increased more than $ 2,650 , to $ 10,551 from $ 7,898 .
“ Providing insurance coverage takes a bigger bite from the family budget every year , ” said Risa Lavizzo - Mourey , chief executive of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , which helped fund the research .

Mohit Ghose , a spokesman for America ’s Health Insurance Plans , the trade group representing the insurance companies , said the study showed the need for controls on the rising costs of drugs , medical devices and hospital care .
He said it should encourage regulators and lawmakers to give insurers the flexibility to offer plans with fewer mandated benefits , resulting in more affordable premiums .
“ The aim is keeping them in , ” Ghose said .
“ The worst - case scenario would be that employers would drop coverage altogether . ”
The study found that was already a big problem .
Between 2001 and 2005 , more than 30,000 of the 3.6 million private - sector employers offering health insurance as a benefit to workers dropped it .

As a result , the number of people in private - sector jobs that offered health insurance benefits declined by more than 4 million , and the number of people with private insurance fell by 2.4 million , or 6 % , the study found .
The study is one of several out this week examining problems with and the erosion of private health insurance .
On Monday , another study warned that the worsening economy would put pressure on government health coverage programs , such as Medi-Cal .
Each percentage - point rise in the nation ’s jobless rate could add 1.1 million people to the ranks of the uninsured , according to the study by the Urban Institute for the Kaiser Family Foundation .
That study also found that 7 % of Americans said they or someone in their household decided to marry in the last year so they could get healthcare benefits via their spouse .

The University of Minnesota study released Tuesday found that the proportion of insurance premiums workers paid for job - based family coverage between 2001 and 2005 held steady at 24 % , with employers picking up the balance .
The latest study was fresh evidence of the need for reform , said Anthony Wright , executive director of Health Access California , a statewide healthcare consumer advocacy coalition .
In California , “ even though health reform stalled earlier this year , the need and urgency for reform has not , ” Wright said .
“ Californians continue to face increasing costs and they worry if their coverage will be there for them when they need it .
We need reform to provide Californians more security so they have the healthcare they care so much about . ”

A lot of personal finance books , after repeating the mantra of spend less than you earn , talk about how it is n’t the amount of money you make , it is how you use it .
I agree with that , to a point , but there truly is a point where the amount of money you make is actually a factor .
If that was n’t the case , anyone who has started truly paying attention to where their money goes would have fully funded retirement accounts and emergency funds and whatever else we gave value to in life .
That is n’t to say there is a hard and fast number that one must make to be able to get by in our present society .
The cost of living varies so much from place to place and region to region that it is impossible to narrow things down to “ If you make X and use it wisely and contribute Y to your retirement savings , you will be able to live comfortably and have a long and prosperous retirement . ”
And there are always people who can stretch our assumptions and do more with so little that our brains ca n’t even absorb it .
But there ’s a limit to frugality .
There ’s a limit to saving and to investing and that limit is what we earn .
We can downgrade our house , or rent where that is more appropriate , we can bike to work and limit food to the healthy essentials and nothing more , have no entertainment budget , and still , we might not be able to meet every arbitrary possible goal for savings and retirement .
If we only earn $ 2000 a month , it is hard to imagine being able to contribute $ 2200 to retirement every month .
The good news in this is that with effort , creativity , and a little luck , we can earn more .
We may just have to let go of the assumptions that we have to fit a specific mold and earn money only through a traditional 9 - 5 job .
There are opportunities to be creative and turn hobbies into income streams , different part time alternatives , and other ways we can bring in a little extra income , if only we open our minds to exploring them .
My own income streams consist of nothing that would fit into a “ traditional ” mold , yet I manage to bring in enough money every month to greatly enhance our debt reduction goals .
At some future point , that may allow us to hit retirement contribution limits I never thought possible .
For example , the maximum amount we can contribute to retirement theoretically through a 401K and 2 Roth IRAs is about $ 25,500 a year .
If we contributed that solely with my spouse ’s income , he ’d bring home almost but not quite enough to pay our mortgage payment every month ( which is equal to the typical 3 bedroom rental in our area ) and nothing else .
But with my income , made up of various income streams that allow me to stay home with my young children and avoid the expense of daycare , we may have a shot at at least approaching that contribution limit in the future if we choose .
Boiling down the argument to “ it ’s not what you make , it ’s what you spend ” is oversimplifying the issue and not giving due credit to all the middle class families like ours who truly do n’t make a whole lot of money every month .
But do n’t let that stop you – seek ways to make you life truly guided by what you choose to spend and not spend .
The amount of income we can earn is certainly not limitless , but it may be more than we previously imagined .

The Dubya White House has admitted that it has no backup tapes for administration emails sent and received between March 1 , 2003 and May 22 , 2003 .
But it says that 's not a problem .
Last October , two separate government watchdogs sued the George W. Bush administration in an effort to recover millions of messages that seem to have disappeared from White House servers .
Previously , the White House hemmed and hawed when asked if the emails were available on backup tape .
But late Monday , in response to a suit from the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) , it finally acknowledged that some of its backups do not exist .
This is hardly surprising .
The administration is n't exactly organized when it comes to email .
According to court filings , Duyba IT workers liked to recycle backup tapes prior to October 2003 .
With its Monday declaration ( PDF ) , the White House also says that it prefers to ignore a court order ordering the preservation of its backups .
You see , the administration is now claiming that those millions of emails did not go missing - even though it has previously said that they did .

What Are the Pros and Cons of the Most Popular Web Browsers ?
If you regularly use the internet , odds are you have a favorite browser .
Whether you enjoy it for speed , convenience , or just out of habit , you ’ve become accustomed to using it .
Yet how does your favorite browser compare to some of the other top contenders ?
What are the pros and cons of different web browsers ?
Keep reading for a full breakdown of 5 different web browsers .
Google Chrome
Google Chrome is by far the most popular web - browser , with more than 4 billion visits in the first 3 months of 2020 .
Chrome also dominates the market , with 49.3 % market share .
So what do its fans like ?
Google Chrome is fast and straightforward to use .
While some other browsers may feel clunky and unintuitive , Google Chrome feels simple and streamlined .
It also offers in - depth customization options , offering different extensions that allow you to personalize it towards your needs .
If advertisements annoy you , download an extension to block them .
Download an extension to boost your productivity , and then another to help manage your tabs .
Chrome runs on almost all platforms , with the exception of Windows phones .
It also comes fully integrated with the Google ecosystem , letting you enjoy Google Drive and Google Docs easier than on other browsers .
So what do it ’s critics have to say ?
Many people find Google Chrome to be a memory hog , requiring a lot of RAM to do even the most basic of tasks .
This is even more evident when downloading files or running games .
Some users also do n’t like the idea of Google and the company ’s browser having access to all of their data .
Apple Safari
Apple fans will recognize Safari as being the default browser on their products .
iPhones , iPads , Macs , and any other Apple device all come with Safari preinstalled .
Apple Safari represents 31.6 % of the market .
In line with Apple ’s design , Safari offers its users a simple and clean interface .
This is the embodiment of what Apple users expect .
Yet it ’s not just well - designed , it ’s also speedy and has a quick response time .
If you ’re an Apple user , you ’ll enjoy its ability to sync with your other Apple products .
“ Handoff ” even lets you open a tab on your iPhone , then sync it over to your Mac with a tap .
You can also make purchases with Face ID , and use other Apple features , such as Keychain .
Yet similarily to other Apple products , Safari lacks some of the deeper customization options that its competitors offer .
Some browsers also offer more privacy options than Safari .
Internet Explorer / Edge
Internet Explorer used to have a near - monopoly over the internet landscape , controlling 96 % market share in 2002 .
Now , it ’s down to 5.7 % and continues to decline .
So what happened ?
Before other competitors existed , Internet Explorer was the go - to choice for a stable and reliable platform .
Yet as time passed , it failed to keep up with the optimization of its competitors .
Today , users of Internet Explorer find it to be outdated with slow processing speed .
Although it used to be the default browser for many , it has failed to keep up with the times .
In 2017 , Microsoft released their new browser , Microsoft Edge .
Edge has since struggled with growing its user base .
It is trying to establish itself as a solid contender separate from Internet Explorer .
If you just switched from a PC to a Mac , you may be wondering : is there Internet Explorer 11 for Mac ?
The answer is yes !
Mozilla Firefox
Mozilla released Firefox in 2004 .
Like Internet Explorer , Firefox ’s popularity has also waned in recent years .
Now , it represents around 3.5 % of the market share .
If you ’re a user who desires high levels of customization options , Firefox might be the browser for you .
Firefox is open source and was made to be free to use .
This mindset remains visible when using it years later .
Firefox even supports Chrome extensions .
Fans of Firefox also enjoy how it is less of a resource hog than other browsers , such as Chrome .
If you ’re someone who often has many tabs open , Firefox has a leg up over its competitors .
10 tabs open in Firefox use 437 MB , while the same number open in Chrome requires 533 MB .
So why is not as popular as it used to be ?
Although Firefox is speedier when working with different tabs , Safari and Chrome are faster when using 1 or 2 tabs .
Other browsers also offer better synchronization across different devices , while Firefox does not .
Opera
Do you know which of the different web browsers invented tabs , cloud storage for passwords and bookmarks , mouse gestures , and speed dial ?
No , it was n’t Chrome .
Nor was it Safari , Firefox , or even Internet Explorer .
It was Opera !
Opera entered the world in 1995 , making it over two decades old .
Although it ’s used by only around 2 % of internet users , it pioneered the path to intuitive internet .
Today , almost all of its contenders use features that it has developed .
Today , Opera is still a flexible browser .
It compresses web pages together , showing you only the content that you need to see at the moment , therefore not demanding as much RAM .
It also has a built - in VPN , as well as excellent malware protection .
So when looking at the different types of web browsers and their features , where does it fall short ?
Like other older browsers , it still lacks proper syncing between desktops and mobile devices .
It can also take some time to find useful extensions .
Which of the Different Web Browsers Do You Use ?
Regardless of which of the different web browsers you use , there are a variety of different pros and cons with each one .
Yet in the end , it comes down to personal preference .
After looking at the different pros and cons of different web browsers , which do you think is the best ?
Which do you use ?

Jerome Kerviel was initially thought to have acted alone .
The rogue trader at the heart of a multi-billion euro scandal at French bank Societe Generale may have had help from a colleague , a report has said .
Another trader could have assisted suspect Jerome Kerviel according to an internal investigation at the firm .
Rogue trades discovered earlier this year cost the firm 4.9bn euros ( $ 7.7bn ; £ 3.9 bn ) and led to an 82 % fall in its profits last year .
Preliminary findings had suggested that Mr Kerviel had acted alone .
The report , compiled by three independent directors , said that " several " of Mr Kerviel 's fraudulent transactions were processed by an unnamed assistant trader .
An electronic message indicated the assistant knew the result of Mr Kerviel 's " fraudulent transactions " , the report said .
Wrongdoing denied
The bank 's management was accused of being " negligent " in not identifying the problem , the report said .
It also found that Mr Kerviel 's direct supervisor was inexperienced , with insufficient support to do his job properly .
" The fraud was facilitated , or its detection delayed , by supervisory weaknesses over the trader and the market activities checking , " it said .
" The trader 's hierarchy , which constituted the first control level , showed itself negligent in the supervision of his activities . "
Mr Kerviel 's supervisor " showed inappropriate tolerance to the positions taken " , it added .
Mr Kerviel , who is on bail , faces charges including a breach of trust , fabricating documents and illegally accessing computers .
He has denied any wrongdoing - saying that the bank was fully aware of his transactions .

The progress Congress was making on the Patent Reform Act ( S. 1145 ) has stalled and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has pulled the bill from the floor schedule .
The lack of progress is disappointing .
Despite its flaws , the proposed legislation would make important and necessary changes to the patent law .
In particular , the bill would limit damages for infringement so that they bear some relationship to the actual value of the damage to the patent owner .
S. 1145 would also have clearly defined situations in which defendants would be liable for willful infringement , which can result in treble damages for the losing party .
Until the recent Federal Circuit Court of Appeals decision in In re Seagate Technology , the law allowed defendants to be found liable for willful infringement if they merely knew of the existence of the patent .
As a result of that case , enhanced damages are now only available for willful patent infringement that is at least " objectively reckless . "
One of the basic goals of the patent system is to get inventors to reveal the secrets of their technology — in published patent applications — so that others could build on it .
The low threshold for a finding of willfulness , coupled with the threat of treble damages , chilled innovation by discouraging competitors from even reading each other 's patents .
In addition , many companies , especially small businesses , preferred to license patents of questionable validity rather than risk litigation .
The Wall Street Journal reported that negotiations between Senate Judiciary Committee members stalled over changes in the way damage awards would be made in patent infringement suits .
Intellectual Property Watch also suggests that a political fight over the confirmation of federal judges may have played a role in the postponement .
At least the troubling portion of the draft committee report on post - grant review and third - party reexamination — the process by which the EFF Patent Busting Project fights bogus patents — is now off the table .
Third - party reexamination allows organizations like EFF to protect the public interest , so we actively sought , with the community 's help , to retain the procedures that provided for reexamination practice .
There 's no schedule for when the bill will return .
Most sources are reporting that the bill is not dead , but it appears that the committee members will have to resolve their differences before patent reform is to continue .
Encouragingly , the committee chairman , Senator Leahy , expressed a strong interest in following through , saying in a statement : " Thousands of hours have been spent in negotiations to address the concerns of 100 Senators , hundreds of Representatives , and dozens of stakeholders . [...]
I have said repeatedly that the time for patent reform is now .
Unfortunately , some have yet to fully grasp this fact , and have stalled meaningful reform . "
The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has reached a record high , according to new figures that renew fears that climate change could begin to slide out of control .
Scientists at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii say that CO2 levels in the atmosphere now stand at 387 parts per million ( ppm ) , up almost 40 % since the industrial revolution and the highest for at least the last 650,000 years .
The figures , published by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) on its website , also confirm that carbon dioxide , the chief greenhouse gas , is accumulating in the atmosphere faster than expected .
The annual mean growth rate for 2007 was 2.14 ppm – the fourth year in the past six to see an annual rise greater than 2 p pm .
From 1970 to 2000 , the concentration rose by about 1.5 ppm each year , but since 2000 the annual rise has leapt to an average 2.1 ppm .
Scientists say the shift could indicate that the Earth is losing its natural ability to soak up billions of tons of carbon each year .
Climate models assume that about half our future emissions will be re-absorbed by forests and oceans , but the new figures confirm this may be too optimistic .
If more of our carbon pollution stays in the atmosphere , it means emissions will have to be cut by more than currently projected to prevent dangerous levels of global warming .
Martin Parry , co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's working group on impacts , said : " Despite all the talk , the situation is getting worse .
Levels of greenhouse gases continue to rise in the atmosphere and the rate of that rise is accelerating .
We are already seeing the impacts of climate change and the scale of those impacts will also accelerate , until we decide to do something about it . "
· Martin Parry will be speaking at the Guardian Planning for Climate Adaptation conference on May 19
Cardinal Murphy - O'Connor urges deeper understanding between believers and non-believers The Archbishop of Westminster has urged Christians to treat atheists and agnostics with " deep esteem " .
Believers may be partly responsible for the decline in faith by losing sense of the mystery and treating God as a " fact in the world " , he said in a lecture .
Cardinal Cormac Murphy - O'Connor called for more understanding and appreciation between believers and non-believers .
But the leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales said that Britain must not become " a God - free zone " .
The cardinal 's lecture at Westminster Cathedral comes after a spate of public clashes over issues such as stem - cell research , gay adoption and faith schools .
Mystery of God He expressed concern about the increasing unpopularity of the Christian voice in public life , saying : " Our life together in Britain can not be a God - free zone and we must not allow Britain to become a world devoid of religious faith and its powerful contribution to the common good . "
Later , he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme why he thought it was dangerous to be governed by reason alone .
He said saying that " supposedly faithless societies " ruled only by reason were like those created by Hitler and Stalin , ripe for " terror and oppression " .
Proper talk about God is always difficult , always tentative .
Cardinal Murphy - O'Connor
Last year , Cardinal Murphy - O'Connor complained of a " new secularist intolerance of religion " and the state 's " increasing acceptance " of anti-religious views .
To stem this tide , he said Christians must understand they have something in common with those who do not believe .
God is not a " fact in the world " as though God could be treated as " one thing among other things to be empirically investigated " and affirmed or denied on the " basis of observation " , said Cardinal Murphy - O'Connor .
" If Christians really believed in the mystery of God , we would realise that proper talk about God is always difficult , always tentative .
" I want to encourage people of faith to regard those without faith with deep esteem because the hidden God is active in their lives as well as in the lives of those who believe . "
There 's absolutely no reason to take seriously someone who says , ' I believe it because I believe it ' .
Richard Dawkins , scientist ' Imaginary friend ' But Richard Dawkins , scientist , staunch atheist and author of books including The God Delusion , told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the cardinal 's comments carried no weight .
Referring to God as an " imaginary friend " , Mr Dawkins said : " When talking to a politician you would demand proof for what they say , but suddenly when talking to a clergyman you do n't have to provide evidence .
" There 's absolutely no reason to take seriously someone who says , ' I believe it because I believe it . '
" God either exists or he does n't .
It 's a matter of the truth . "
Speaking later on Radio 4 , Cardinal Murphy - O'Connor answered those criticisms .
He said : " I think there are a number of people in this country who would like to marginalise religion .
" They would much prefer not to see religion as neutral , but to neutralise it .
" And there are unbelievers who construct their own God in order to demolish him . "
Of claims that faith has no basis in reason , he replied : " To believe in God is not unreasonable . "

Honda has developed a gadget that they say could make walking easier for the elderly and others with weak leg muscles .
The aptly named Walking Assist Device is a 6 lb. motorized belt with hip sensors that gauge how much help the wearer will need .
The motor then gives the wearer an appropriate boost , lengthening his or her stride enough to make walking easier on the legs .

The device 's lithium - ion battery only last two hours on a charge , so do n't expect Grandma to run a full marathon , but some time moseying around the retirement village while looking all cyberpunk will surely make her coolest geriatric in Del Boca Vista .
The Walking Assist Device will be demoed this week at Intex Osaka — the press release for that is below .

Mr. Robins directed the protracted public - private effort to create the New Jersey system from 1988 through 1994 .
He noted that those residing in the tens of thousands of new units within walking distance of light - rail stops  and others due to open at Liberty Harbor North and Gull ’s Cove in Jersey City  now have an easier alternative than driving for getting to work , going shopping or taking in a show .
The Jersey City planner Robert Cotter , one of many local officials , planners and light - rail riders who contributed to the study , told the researchers that he was increasingly seeing vacant spaces in parking areas set aside for employees at office buildings in his city .
Yet Mr. Robins  like Jamie Lefrak , a principal of the Lefrak Group , builder of the Newport residential / office / retail complex  expressed amazement that the light rail was ever built .
“ We established a route through what were essentially fallow areas , ” he said , using a more genteel term for stretches that Mr. Lefrak described as “ places most people would not want to go . ”
The light - rail passage in turn attracted developers to rehabilitate those places , while providing new mobility for the large , mostly immigrant , community already established in Union City , which has relatively few car owners .
Census figures rank Union City , perched atop the Palisades , above Hoboken , as the most densely populated city in the country .
“ When the station was built at Bergenline Avenue , ” Mr. Robins said , “ it was very meaningful for the people there .
Not only was the commute time to jobs in New York and New Jersey chopped by as much as 75 percent , but they suddenly had a convenient way to get to the shopping mall at Newport . ”
He called Union City ’s turnaround one of the most heartening results of his work on the creation of the system .

Canada ’s health system beats U.S. in cost and results
by Ross Eisenbrey
When the Clinton administration tackled health care reform in 1993 , Canada ’s national health care system — which operates without a private insurance industry — was held up as a model by progressives and a disaster by conservatives .
The United States rejected any positive lessons from the Canadian single - payer model in 1993 , and we are living with the results of that decision today .
As the chart below reveals , the cost gap between the United States and Canada has only widened since 1993 , and per capita health care expenditures in the United States are now almost double those in Canada ( $ 6,401 vs. $ 3,359 ) .
Canada ’s per capita health expenditures rose about 65 % from 1993 to 2005 , while costs in the United States rose by over 90 % .
Yet infant mortality in the United States is higher and life expectancy at birth is less than in Canada .
It is also noteworthy that despite Canada ’s much lower expenditures on health care , Canadians consult with physicians far more often than do Americans .
The average number of physician consultations per capita was 6.0 in Canada , versus 3.8 in the United States .

The figures show households facing the early stages of repossession
The number of homeowners facing repossession orders after failing to keep up with mortgage payments is up , says the Ministry of Justice .
It says the number of orders made by the courts in England and Wales at an early stage of the repossession process rose 17 % in the first quarter of 2008 .
There were 27,530 orders made , up from 23,438 in the same period of 2007 .
The credit crunch has led to more expensive repayments for new mortgages and a cut in the availability of deals .
Claims and orders
The number of mortgage possession claims - the first stage of the repossession process when homeowners are threatened with action - was also up .
There were 38,688 claims in the first three months of the year compared with 33,344 in the same period of 2007 , a rise of 16 % .
This was also 7 % higher than the final three months of 2007 .
See a regional breakdown
This stage comes before mortgage possession orders , when a court grants an order for possession of a home .
Most of these do not end with a property being repossessed , mainly because the borrower presents the court with a case for not proceeding or the lender comes to an arrangement with the borrower .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The government are being urged to help those who are most irresponsible Hugh , UK The Ministry of Justice figures show that the increase in the numbers of orders made was greatest in Wales - up 26 % in the first three months of the year compared with the same period last year .
There was a 23 % rise over the same period in the North West , and increases of 22 % in the Midlands , 9 % in the South East , 11 % in the South West and 1 % in the North East .
The BBC 's economics editor Stephanie Flanders says that the number of repossession claims and orders has been rising sharply since 2005 , partly because a long period of rising house prices has given lenders an interest in prodding homeowners to sell .
However , she adds that the great majority of these orders will not result in a house being repossessed , but clearly lenders are resorting to the courts more readily than they did in the past .
Tighter household budgets
The number of actual repossessions , across the UK and by private lenders only , is shown in figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders ( CML ) published twice a year .
It is important to recognise we are dealing with an entirely different situation in the market from what was experienced in the early 1990s
Housing minister Caroline Flint
Help for homeowners
More in trouble than figures show The data for the first half of 2008 will be published in August .
The CML predicts that there will be 45,000 repossessions in 2008 , up from 27,100 in the previous year .
The CML says there are 11.8 million outstanding mortgages in the UK .
But Caroline Davey , from housing charity Shelter , told BBC News that banks and building societies were not doing enough to keep repossession figures down after pulling 100 % mortgages from the market .
" I think the lenders have to take a real share of the responsibility here , " she said .
" Those lenders have now retracted all of those mortgages .
But what they have n't done is put their hands in their pockets to help the many thousands of people who are struggling , having taken on mortgages that they simply can't afford . "
The number of people missing mortgage repayments is also partly due to the rise in household bills owing to the increasing price of food and fuel .
The availability of credit has also been cut .
Help for homeowners
The figures come on the day the government has given details of plans aimed at helping homeowners who are struggling to pay their mortgages .
It said there will be more free legal advice for those at risk of repossession , along with specialist training for debt advice agencies .
Housing Minister Caroline Flint said : " It is important to recognise we are dealing with an entirely different situation in the market from what was experienced in the early 1990s .
" The fundamentals of the housing market remain strong with high employment , low interest rates , and long - term demand for homes from first - time buyers . "
But Shadow Housing Minister Grant Shapps said : " We called on the Government to provide greater debt advice more than 18 months ago and in the last three months David Cameron has urged mortgage lenders to warn borrowers when cheap rates were coming to an end .
" While we welcome the government belatedly getting on board , it is too little , too late and does nothing to help the 27,000 families who have already experienced repossession . "
He said the Prime Minister should ditch Home Information Packs and axe stamp duty for first - time buyers on properties up to £ 250,000 .
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable called on lenders to examine " all possible alternatives " before seeking a repossession order .

" Repossession claims have skyrocketed since last year .
Many families could well end up losing their homes in the months ahead , " he said .
" This Government must stop having vague discussions with mortgage lenders and instead clearly lay out the procedures which must be followed before a property can be repossessed . "
Howard Archer , UK economist at Global Insight , said : " A significant number of people have had to stretch themselves to the absolute limit to get into the housing market in recent times as prices soared .
" This means that they are particularly vulnerable to any adverse shock to their finances . "

April 25 , 2008  -- Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former President Jimmy Carter went to the Middle East in pursuit of peace , but instead he found himself in a war of words with the U.S. secretary of state .
The controversy has come down to a simple question :
Who is telling the truth , Jimmy Carter or Condoleezza Rice ?
Rice said that the State Department urged Carter not to travel to the region , but that if he did , he should not meet with the Palestinian group Hamas , which the United States considered a terrorist organization .
" We counseled President Carter against coming to -- against going to the region , and particularly against having contacts with Hamas , " Rice told reporters earlier this week .
" We wanted to make sure that there would be no confusion and that there would be no sense that Hamas was somehow a party to peace negotiations . "
In response to that , Carter has essentially called Rice a liar .
" I saw all kinds of statements out of the State Department that said they begged me not to come , they urged me not to come , " Carter said in an interview with Steve Inskeep on National Public Radio .
" All of this is absolutely false .
They never once asked me not to come . "
So , what did happen ?
Both sides agreed that Carter placed a call to Rice before his trip .
She responded by putting him in touch with Assistant Secretary of State David Welch , the top State Department official on Middle East issues .
Welch then spent a half hour on the phone with Carter talking about his upcoming trip .
Welch also had pretrip conversations with Carter 's staff .
Rice said the message given to Carter was crystal clear .
" We certainly told President Carter that we did not think meeting with Hamas was going to help the Palestinians who actually are devoted to peace . "
Carter insisted that Welch was actually " quite positive " about the trip and never asked him not to meet with Hamas or not to make the trip .
The one man who should know who is telling the truth is David Welch .
But Welch did n't want to call a former president or a current secretary of state a liar .
He is a lifelong foreign service officer who has served high - level diplomatic positions in both Democratic and Republican administrations .
All he would say about his conversation with Carter is it was " a professional , pleasant conversation " and " I did counsel him about our concerns about Hamas . "
But Welch would n't say whether he asked Carter not to meet with Hamas .
" I 'd prefer just to leave it right there , " he told National Public Radio .
In a written statement , the Carter Center claimed that " no one " in the State Department " even suggested " the former president not meet with Hamas .
That seemed to be contradicted by the public record .
In fact , on April 10 , more than a week before Carter left for the Middle East , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said publicly that the State Department did not want Carter meeting with Hamas " because U.S. government policy is that Hamas is a terrorist organization , and we believe it is not in the interests of our policy or in the interests of peace to have such a meeting .

As anonymous American officials continue to leak information suggesting Iran 's involvement in Iraq to the New York Times , even Iraq has begun fighting back .
A top Iraqi official said Sunday there was no conclusive evidence that Shiite extremists have been directly supplied with some Iranian arms as alleged by the United States .
Asked about reports that some rockets made in 2007 or 2008 and seized in raids against militias were directly supplied by Iran , government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh replied : " There is no conclusive evidence . "
The Times was among those that led the charge .
They also reported that bombs supplied to Iraq were found to have been of Iranian manufacture .
In Monday 's edition , the Times Michael Gordon reported that " militants from the Lebanese group Hezbollah have been training Iraqi militia fighters at a camp near Tehran , according to American interrogation reports that the United States has supplied to the Iraqi government . "
" An American official said the account of Hezbollahs role was provided by four Shiite militia members who were captured in Iraq late last year and questioned separately , " Gordon added .
He did not supply the name of the official , as is standard in articles concerning American intelligence .
On Sunday , Iraq spokesman al - Dabbagh said Iraq does not want trouble with any country , " especially Iran . " al - Dabbagh 's comments were picked up by Iranian news agencies .
The U.S. accuses Iran of financing and training Shiite militants in Iraq and of funneling lethal weapons into the country .
Iranian officials have denied the allegations .
Al - Dabbagh said Iraq wants friendly ties with Iran and stressed both countries share common interests .
" We can't ignore or deny we are neighbors .
We do not want to be pushed in a struggle with any country , especially Iran , " he told a news conference .
" We are fed up with past tensions that we have paid a costly price for because some parties have pushed Iraq ( in the past ) to take an aggressive attitude to Iran . "
But he also said a crackdown on Shiite militants will not stop , despite word that Iran will not restart security talks with the United States until the fighting is halted .
A five - member Iraqi delegation returned Saturday from Tehran where they held meetings aimed at halting the suspected Iranian aid to militiamen .
The Iraqi delegation was said to have carried documents and other material implicating the Quds Force in supplying weapons and training Shiite fighters .
U.S. military officials have said the evidence includes caches of weapons that have date stamps showing they were produced in Iran this year  including mortars , rockets and armor- piercing roadside bombs known as explosively formed penetrators , or EFPs .
According to officials familiar with the meeting , the delegation received a frosty reception from Iran , which questioned the origin of the documents .
The officials asked not to be named for security reasons .
Iran 's
Fars news agency reported that Iranian negotiators told their Iraqi counterparts that as long as the U.S. carried out attacks against the Mahdi Army in Sadr City , Iran would not restart talks with the Americans .

Cleaver 's bluntness
In an unusually frank interview on Canadian public radio , CBC , Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver of Kansas City -- a Hillary supporter and superdelegate -- gives a sense of how tenuous Clinton 's hold on many black superdelegates is .
" If I had to make a prediction right now , I 'd say Barack Obama is going to be the next president , " he said just after 18:00 .
" I will be stunned if he 's not the next president of the United States . "
He does n't back off his support for Clinton , and has criticism for Obama :
" He is articulate - in the black tradition , he would probably be mediocre , but in White America ... " he said , a bit dismissively , of Obama 's speaking style , going on to joke about the word " articulate . "
" For White Americans , it 's like , this guy can speak , " he said .
He also said he was " outraged over the outrage " at the Wright controversy .
Earlier in the interview , he was asked about the race going all the way to the convention .
" If I do the party line , I 'm supposed to say -- and maybe I 'll say just so if anybody hears it they can say well , ' Cleaver did the party line before he told the truth , ' -- we believe that a contest going all the way to the convention is good for America , " he said .
In fact , he continued , it would be the " tragedy of tragedies . "
He made a football analogy of his support for Clinton .
" Even though I do n't expect the Kansas City Chiefs to beat the Indianapolis Colts , I cheer for the Kansas City Chiefs , " he said , and goes on to cast it in terms of friendship and personal loyalty .
If he switched to Obama , " There would be African - Americans cheering , " Cleaver said .
" But I would have difficulty shaving in the morning , unless I could shave without looking in the mirror . "

Shoes is a cross-platform , tiny graphics and windowing toolkit for the Ruby programming language written by Why .
You can find more information on Shoes here .
Objective :
To build a teeny - weeny mp3 player .
Step 1 : Let us first download Shoes .
We shall be using stable build file shoes - 0.r396-curious.exe .
Step 2 : Next , we start writing the code for our teeny - weeny mp3 player .
To begin with , we just have 6 lines of code but which provides enough functionality .
< span style=" color:blue " >#my_mp3player01.rb Shoes.app do button ( ' play ' ) { @v.play } button ( ' pause ' ) { @v.pause } button ( ' stop ' ) { @v.stop } @v = video " C:/rubyprograms/mp3player/ruby.mp3 " end</ span>
On Windows , run Shoes from your Start Menu .
Enter the C:/ rubyprograms / mp3 player folder and select my_mp3player01.rb .
A screen pops up :
Now click on play .
That ’s it !
A Shoes application is simply a Ruby block : Shoes.app{ … } The Shoes.app part means “ open the main Shoes window . ”
Inside the block , we describe what ’s inside the window .
Let ’s add three buttons to our application that when pressed play / pause / stop our MP3 .
The last statement uses the video method to setup a Shoes : : Video object .
Shoes supports embedding of QuickTime , Flash video ( FLV ) , DivX , Xvid and various other popular video formats , and some audio formats such as MP3 , WAV and Ogg Vorbis .
For more information , open the built - in Manual and read Elements Video section .
Step 3 : Change Window size .
Add background colors and caption .
< span style= " color:blue " ># my_mp3player02.rb Shoes.app : width => 300 , : height => 165 do background green background rgb( 255,208,208 ) , : radius => 24 caption ' My original tiny MP3 player ! ' button ( ' play ' ) { @v.play } button ( ' pause ' ) { @v.pause } button ( ' stop ' ) { @v.stop } @v = video " C:/rubyprograms/mp3player/ruby.mp3 " end</ span>
We have added just three more lines .
The background method draws a Background element with a specific color , gradient or image .
Shoes backgrounds are actual elements , not styles .
Hence Shoes layers background elements .
It ’s not the same as HTML .
For more information , open the built - in Manual and read Slots Element section .
Also see “ Nobody Knows Shoes ( NKS ) ” – Backgrounds & Borders and Smooth Corner Cuts .
The caption method is one of the TEXT BLOCKS .
Try to run the following sample code :
< span style= " color:blue " ># textsize.rb Shoes.app do banner " Banner
" title " Title
" subtitle " Subtitle
" tagline " Tagline
" caption " Caption
" para " Para
" inscription " Inscription
" para " Specific font size " , : size => 48 end</span >
For more information , see NKS – the 1st chapter of 10 essentials .
Step 4 : Oh !
We need to layout the elements .
< span style= " color:blue " ># my_mp3player03.rb Shoes.app : width => 300 , : height => 165 do background green background rgb( 255,208,208 ) , : radius => 24 caption ' My original tiny MP3 player ! ' flow : left => 0 , :top => 120 do button ( ' play ' ) { @v.play } button ( ' pause ' ) { @v.pause } button ( ' stop ' ) { @v.stop } @v = video " C:/rubyprograms/mp3player/ruby.mp3 " end end </ span >
In this case , we can use flow { … } Shoes has a fundamental concept : stacks and flows .
We need to understand the concept completely for layouting elements inside the window .
Read this page carefully .
Now try to run the above program – my_mp3 player03.rb by replacing the word ‘ flow ’ to ‘ stack ’ and see the result ( shown below ) .
Step 5 : Want to listen other mp3 files ?
< span style= " color:blue " ># my_mp3player04.rb Shoes.app : width => 300 , : height => 165 do background green background rgb( 255,208,208 ) , : radius => 24 caption ' My original tiny MP3 player ! ' flow : left => 0 , :top => 120 do button ( ' select ? ' ) {@v = video ask_open_file} button ( ' play ' ) { @v.play } button ( ' pause ' ) { @v.pause } button ( ' stop ' ) { @v.stop } end end</ span >
We can use built - in methods ( also called : Kernel methods . )
In this case , we can use ask_open_file method which pops up an ‘ Open file … ’ window .
For more information , see the built - in Manual for Built - in Methods section .
Step 6 : Need to control select button depending on the situation .
< span style= " color:blue " ># my_mp3player05.rb Shoes.app : width => 300 , : height => 165 do background green background rgb( 255,208,208 ) , : radius => 24 caption ' My original tiny MP3 player ! ' flow : left => 0 , :top => 120 do button ' select ? ' do tmp = @file ( @v = video ( @file ) unless ( @file = ask_open_file ) .nil ? ) if @file.nil ? || !@v.playing ?
@file ||= tmp end button ( ' play ' ) { @v.play } button ( ' pause ' ) { @v.pause } button ( ' stop ' ) { @v.stop } end end</ span >
As we write the program code , we need to consider several cases .
Here , we have to handle the following cases :
if user does n’t select the MP3 file yet
if the MP3 is playing
if the user pressed the cancel button on the select window
Step 7 : Want to display mp3 file name and runtime per second ?
< span style= " color:blue " ># my_mp3player06.rb Shoes.app : width => 300 , : height => 165 do background green background rgb( 255,208,208 ) , : radius => 24 caption ' My original tiny MP3 player ! ' stack : left => 0 , :top => 70 do @l = para ( '' , : stroke => white ) animate do @l.replace strong " #{@file} : #{@v.time.to _i / 1000} sec " unless @file.nil ?
end end flow : left => 0 , :top => 120 do button ' select ? ' do tmp = @file ( @v = video ( @file ) unless ( @file = ask_open_file ) .nil ? ) if @file.nil ? || !@v.playing ?
@file ||= tmp end button ( ' play ' ) { @v.play } button ( ' pause ' ) { @v.pause } button ( ' stop ' ) { @v.stop } end end</ span >
To display the runtime per second , we can use the animate method : animate ( fts ) { … }
The block will run fts times per second .
fts is a option .
If no number is given , default is 10 .
For more information , see the built - in Manual : Slots Element section .
The para method sets up a Shoes : : TextBlock object .
In this case , it is assigned to @l .
We can use the replace method in the block of the animate method to replace and redisplay the specific string such as the mp3 file name and the time position of the mp3 .
The time method shows the time position in milliseconds – so transform it into seconds .
Step 8 : Want dancing loogink ( Her ( the creature ) name ) in the background while MP3 is playing ?
< span style= " color:blue " ># my_mp3player07.rb $ BASE_PATH = " C:/rubyprograms / mp3player / " Shoes.app : width => 300 , : height => 165 do background green background rgb( 255,208,208 ) , : radius => 24 caption ' My original tiny MP3 player ! ' stack : left => 0 , :top => 30 do @img = image $ BASE_PATH + " loogink.png " n = 0 animate ( 5 ) do @img.move ( ( n+=1 ) % 300 , 10 - rand ( 10 ) ) if !@file.nil ? && @v.playing ?
end end stack : left => 0 , :top => 70 do @l = para ( '' , : stroke => white ) animate do @l.replace strong " #{@file} : #{@v.time.to _i / 1000} sec " unless @file.nil ?
end end flow : left => 0 , :top => 120 do button ' select ? ' do tmp = @file ( @v = video ( @file ) unless ( @file = ask_open_file ) .nil ? ) if @file.nil ? || !@v.playing ?
@file ||= tmp end button ( ' play ' ) { @v.play } button ( ' pause ' ) { @v.pause } button ( ' stop ' ) { @v.stop } end end</ span >
We can use the same structure of Step 7 .
The image method sets up a Shoes : : Image object .
In this case , it is assigned to @img .
We can use the move method in the block of the animate method to move the object .
For more information , see the built - in Manual : Elements Image section .
As you can see , if you know Ruby programming , you can easily learn Shoes to quickly build UIs .
I ’d like to take this opportunity to thanks Anita Kuno from Canada who created the oogink.png and ruby .mp3 files used in this blog post .
Conclusion : Some ideas to personalize this MP3 player :
use your favorite photo as a background
display the name of the song playing –
You can learn how to extract the name of the song from a mp3 file in the excellent course conducted by Satish Talim at FORPC101
If you come up with any new idea , do write your original mp3 player and please do let me know .
Have fun with Ruby !
Divers in France have found the oldest known bust of Roman dictator Julius Caesar at the bottom of the River Rhone , officials have said .
The marble bust was found near Arles , which was founded by Caesar .
France 's culture ministry said the bust was from 46 BC , the date of the southern town 's foundation .
The ministry described the bust - which shows a lined face and a balding head - as typical of realist portraits of the Republican era .
It said other items had been found at the same site , including a 1.8 m ( 6ft ) marble statue of Neptune from the first decade of the third century AD , and two smaller statues in bronze .
Divers taking part in an archaeological excavation made the discovery between September and October 2007 .
Luc Long , the archaeologist who directed the excavations , said all the busts of Caesar in Rome were posthumous .
A group of republican senators assassinated Caesar in 44BC .
" I suspect the bust was thrown in the river after he was assassinated because it would not have been good at that time to be considered a follower of his , " said Mr Long .
Some of the objects found in the river will be displayed in a museum on ancient Arles , the culture ministry said .
Gay Rights and the Prosecution of Alan Turing June 28 , 2008
Roscoe , N.Y .
In January , 1952 , English mathematician and computer pioneer Alan Turing was arrested for having sex with another man .
The law that Alan Turing broke was the infamous Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885 .
Section 11 prohibited " any act of gross indecency with another male person " and specified that offenders " be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years , with or without hard labour . "
The term " gross indecency " was not specifically defined in the law , but it was understood to mean any sexual contact other than that denoted by the quaint English legal term " buggery . "
Oral sex or mutual masturbation would fall under the category of " gross indecency . "
Section 11 was controversial from its very beginning .
The Criminal Law Amendment
Act of 1885 described itself as " An Act to make further provision for the protection of women and girls , the suppression of brothels , and other purposes . "
The law raised the age of consent for girls from 13 to 16 , and contained several provisions intended to prevent women from exploitation , such as being drugged in brothels or abducted into prostitution .
Section 11 was added to the Act just a week before it was passed .
At the time it was noted that the acts prohibited by Section 11 had never been illegal in England before when performed in private , and that the law could easily be abused through blackmail .
The most famous victim of Section 11 was playwright and poet Oscar Wilde , who served two years hard labor from 1895 to 1897 .
His health severly compromised by the prison term , Oscar Wilde died three years after his release at the age of 46 .
By the time of Turing 's conviction , alternatives to imprisonment were offered in the form of hormone treatments called " organotherepy " but more commonly known as " chemical castration . "
Experiments with treating gay men with hormones had begun in the 1940s .
At first it was believed that homosexuality was caused by insufficient " maleness , " so the treatment involved testosterone .
As we know now , increased levels of testosterone are associated with aggressiveness ( sexual and otherwise ) , so it 's not surprising to learn that the experimental testosterone treatments did not have the anticipated effect !
By Turing 's time , they had switched to estrogen treatments .
The implant they gave Turing for a year rendered him impotent and caused his breats to grow .
The early 1950s were a terrible time to be identified as a gay person .
As part of my research in writing The Annotated Turing : A Guided Tour through Alan Turing 's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine , I wanted to get a good understanding of what it was like .
Of course I got some great information from the concluding chapters of Andrew Hodges 's biography Alan Turing : The Enigma ( Simon and Schuster , 1983 ) .
I also found a fascinating book by historian David K. Johnson about the situation in the United States entitled The Lavender Scare : The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government ( University of Chicago Press , 2004 ) , and which I discussed in a blog entry two years ago ..
The title plays off the concept of the " Red Scare " initiated by Senator Joseph McCarthy and others to weed out communists in the State Department .
There actually were n't very many communists in the State Department , but there were plenty of closeted gay people working in the U.S. government and they were fired by the hundreds .
The term " security risk " used during this period was basically a euphemism for " homosexual . "
I was hoping to find something similar to The Lavender Scare but about England .
I am now convinced that such a book does not exist , but I did benefit a great deal from H. Montgomery Hyde 's The Love That Dared Not Speak Its Name : A Candid History of Homosexuality in Britain ( Little , Brown and Co. , 1970 ) , published in England under the title The Other Love .
This book covers a much broader period of time but provided me with background on Section 11 and details regarding the early - 1950s persecution of gay people in England .
As a result of his conviction , Turing 's job options were certainly diminished .
Any type of security clearance would be out of the question .
( At the time , his crucial work on breaking codes used by the German military during World War II was still top secret . )
He would no longer be able to visit the United States .
A 1952 law prohibited admission to the U.S. of " ‘ aliens afflicted with psychopathic personality , " which was interpreted to mean homosexuality .
Alan Turing committed suicide in June , 1954 , at the age of 41 .
He left behind no note , and his suicide has some mysterious aspects , but it is generally assumed that it was related to the humiliation he suffered from his prosecution under Section 11 .
That certainly seems like a long time ago !
Today we are as appalled by the 1950s persecution of gay people as much as we are appalled by the discrimination against persons of color during the same period .
As a society , we have made significant moral progress since that time , and I am encouraged by these trends .
In Europe and North America , discriminatory laws against gay people have largely been repealed .
Full marriage equality — certainly an important milestone in the progressive historical advancement of human rights and individual dignity — is becoming a reality .
Today five countries ( Canada , Belgium , the Netherlands , South Africa , and Spain ) offer full marriage equality for gay couples , and Norway will join their ranks next year .
Marriage equality in the United States will probably proceed one state at a time until some kind of tipping point is reached , or the U.S. Supreme Court makes a definitive decision .
Today only Massachusetts and California have full marriage equality .
Here in New York , Eliot Spitzer was recently elected Governor with a platform that included marriage equality .
Although he 's gone now , his successor David Paterson recently affirmed that same - sex marriages outside the state will be recognized here ( which is , of course , the normal procedure except that some states have specifically gone in the opposite direction ) .
A fascinating article in the New York Times last month described Governor Paterson 's long affinity with gay people , and indicated that he is also a supporter of marriage equality .
But are we really so removed from the laws that drove Oscar Wilde and Alan Turing to their early deaths ?
Not really .
It was as recently as 2003 that the United States Supreme Court decision Lawrence v. Texas struck down state laws prohibiting gay sex .
( In 1998 , based on a false report of a man with a gun , the Harris County police entered the home of John Lawrence and found him having sex with another man .
Rather than apologize profusely and quickly leave as normal people would have done , the police arrested the two men and charged them under Texas 's Homosexual Conduct law . )
At the time of Lawrence v. Texas some 13 other states had laws prohibiting homosexual sex acts , and even after the decision many of these laws are still on the books .
What scares me is the real agenda of the people behind the movement opposing marriage equality .
It seems that for some of these people , the real motivation has nothing to do with " marriage " or " family " or " children " or " home " or " values . "
It 's really all about gay sex , and the Lawrence v. Texas decision plays a major role in their worldview .
For example , one of the best - known and acknowledged nationwide leaders of the movement opposing marriage equality is James C. Dobson , head of the organization Focus on the Family .
It is quite clear from reading Dr. Dobson 's book Marriage under Fire : Why We Must Win This Battle ( Multnomah Publishers , 2004 ) that the real problem for him is the Lawrence v. Texas decision — in short , that the Supreme Court 's decision in giving gay people the legal right to have sex also implies the legal right to marriage .
I will quote at length ( pages 39 to 41 ) without ellipses so you can get a proper sense of Dobson 's not - so - hidden agenda :
And now the nation 's courts have wreaked havoc on the institution of marriage .
In one decision after another , the judiciary has torn into the fabric of the home .
I wo n't review all those unfortunate cases at this point , but there is one that stands above the rest .
On June 26 , 2003 , the U.S. Supreme Court considered the legality of homosexual behavior and found that , lo and behold , the Constitution guaranteed a right to sodomy .
Yep , it was tucked right there ( somewhere ) in the original document .
With this ruling , our Founding Fathers must have rolled in their graves .
Our august justices " made up " this new constitutional right and used it to strike down the Texas law prohibiting sodomy .
The case is now known as the infamous Lawrence v. Texas decision .
Very few Americans agreed with the decision , but they were never asked .
They no longer determine their own destinies .
Abraham Lincoln said in the Gettysburg Address that ours is a government " of the people , by the people , and for the people , " and yet " the people " have now been co-opted by an unelected and unaccountable judiciary , appointed for life , that determines all the great moral issues of our day .
Each time the Supremes meet , it 's as through they are holding a " Constitutional Convention , " because the foundational document becomes whatever any five of these justices say it is .
This is called an oligarchy — a government by the few — and it is taking us ever further down the road to moral relativism .
Writing for the majority in the Lawrence case , Justice Anthony Kennedy — whom I consider to be the most dangerous man in America because of his determination to rewrite the Constitution — stated that , speaking of the prohibition of sodomy , the law 's " continuance as precedent demeans the lives of homosexual persons . "
By ruling that sodomy is a constitutionally protected " right , " the highest court in the land declared , in effect , that considerations of morality and decency were irrelevant .
It was this regrettable decision that has created the present turmoil throughout the nation .
It has emboldened rogue commissioners , mayors , and legislators to begin overriding laws prohibiting homosexual marriage .
They have been passing out marriage licenses like candy .
These minor bureaucrats now have things going their way , and they are going to strike while the iron is hot .
This is why we are in the state of peril that faces our nation today .
Like Adolf Hitler , who overran his European neighbors , those who favor homosexual marriage are determined to make it legal , regardless of the democratic processes that stand in their way .
The logic in these paragraphs is so tortured that I can hardly believe that Dr. Dobson actually believes anything he 's writing here .
The only " rights " Lawrence v. Texas has eliminated are those of a government to decide what consenting adults can do in the privacy of their bedrooms !
Dr. Dobson seems to feel his rights have been restricted , yet the " rights " that he wants is the power to use the government to enforce his own narrow view of proper sexual behavior .
That concept should scare heterosexuals and homosexuals alike !
The introduction of Adolf Hitler in Dr. Dobson 's argument is astounding .
Surely Dr. Dobson knows which side of the gay rights debate the Nazis were on !
Surely Dr. Dobson knows that laws prohibiting gay sex in Germany were almost repealed during the Weimar Republic , and that when the Nazis gained power they actually strengthened the laws and made homosexual sex a felony rather than a misdemeanor .
Surely Dr. Dobson knows that homosexuals were imprisoned by the Nazis in concentration camps , and that they had their own special triangle to identify them ( notice the 5th column ) :
It could be argued that the extremist views of Dr. Dobson do not represent the mainstream of the movement opposing marriage equality , and that most people really do not want to reinstate laws that prohibit gay sex .
I do n't know .
But I have not heard anyone on the anti-equality side actually denounce Dr. Dobson 's position on this issue .
I am forced to asume that Dr. Dobson 's ugly and immoral views are actually quite prevalent .
Anyone who proposes the reinstatement of laws that prohibit consensual sexual contact between adults must consider the consequences of these laws , and that means to be familiar with the people who have been their victims .
Alan Turing might still be alive today — he would have turned 96 earlier this week — had it not been for a law that made him a criminal , and which stripped him of his dignity and freedom .
The best way to prevent these laws from coming back is to give gay men and women the fullest protection of the law , and that means full marriage equality .
JIANGYOU , China ( CNN ) -- A Chinese police officer is being hailed as a hero after taking it upon herself to breast - feed several infants who were separated from their mothers or orphaned by China 's devastating earthquake .
Police officer Jiang Xiaojuan , 29 , was feeding nine babies at one point .
Officer Jiang Xiaojuan , 29 , the mother of a 6 - month - old boy , responded to the call of duty and the instincts of motherhood when the magnitude - 7.9 quake struck on May 12 .
" I am breast - feeding , so I can feed babies .
I did n't think of it much , " she said .
" It is a mother 's reaction and a basic duty as a police officer to help . "
The death toll in the earthquake jumped Thursday to more than 51,000 , and more than 29,000 are missing , according to government figures .
Thousands of children have been orphaned ; many others have mothers who simply can't feed them .
At one point , Jiang was feeding nine babies .
" Some of the moms were injured ; their fathers were dead ... five of them were orphans .
They 've gone away to an orphanage now , " she said .
Watch the officer care for babies »
She still feeds two babies , including Zhao Lyuyang , son of a woman who survived the quake but whose breast milk stopped flowing because of the traumatic conditions .
" We walked out of the mountains for a long time .
I had n't eaten in days when I got here , and my milk was not enough , " said that mother , Zhao Zong Jun .
" She saved my baby .
I thank her so much .
I can't express how I feel . "
Liu Rong , another mother whose breast milk stopped in the trauma , was awed by Jiang 's kindness .
" I am so touched because she has her own baby , but she fed the disaster babies first , " Liu said .

Jiang has became a celebrity , followed by local media and proclaimed on a newspaper front page as " China 's Mother No. 1 . "
She 's embarrassed by the fuss .
" I think what I did was normal , " she said .
" In a quake zone , many people do things for others .
This was a small thing , not worth mentioning . "

There has been a huge outpouring of support from families who want to adopt babies orphaned by the quake .
But that process takes time , and there are mouths to feed .
Jiang misses her own son , who 's being cared for through the emergency by in - laws in another town , but she is aware of the new connections she 's made .
" I feel about these kids I fed just like my own .

( CNN ) --
The video is hard to turn away from .
A sobbing 16 - year - old sits in her bedroom and , staring into a camera , says she has been raped .
Crystal , 16 , of Florida posted a video on YouTube pleading for help after she allegedly was raped .
" Hi , my name is Crystal . ... I need some help .
I did n't want to do it this way , but it 's the only way I know that 's going to work , that someone out there in the world is gonna listen to me . "
The teen , whom CNN interviewed but is not identifying by her last name , is among dozens of young people who are turning to social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace to talk about sexual assault .
For an online generation , the Web offers what traditional counseling does not .
It 's a chance to communicate without having to face someone or fear their judgment .
Some people are seeking legal advice and medical information , and many younger victims believe that they can warn others about their accused attacker , counselors say .
There also are people like Crystal , whose case was dropped by the Orange County , Florida , state attorney 's office , who feel slighted by the justice system .
" Young victims , particularly girls , turn inward .
They are going to reach out and try to connect in the isolation of their dorm room or their bedrooms , " said Jennifer Dritt , the director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence .
" Most young women feel like they want somebody to know that someone did this to them . "
One in four American women under the age of 25 report that they have been sexually assaulted , according to the nation 's largest rape crisis counseling organization , RAINN , the Rape , Abuse and Incest National Network .
" We noticed that this trend of posting details of an attack really picked up speed a few years ago , " said Scott Berkowitz , RAINN 's founder and president .
" A rape survivor 's intention may be to reach out , and we encourage that , but this is a dangerous way to do it . "
Advocates worry that victims are divulging too much information .
CNN found several Facebook and MySpace profiles on which young people say they have been raped .
The postings include their names , photographs and hometowns .
But Crystal is probably one of the few who have gone so far as to post a plea for help on YouTube .
Because anything posted on the Web is available forever through an Internet search , a rape survivor must consider how they would feel if that information were dredged up in the future , counselors said .
By making themselves -- or their IP address -- available , victims open themselves to unreliable and unprofessional advice and the harsh judgment of their peers .
Perhaps worst of all , they could give their perpetrator a chance to find them again or gain more satisfaction .
In April , RAINN teamed with online security company McAfee Inc. and launched an anonymous and secure chat service where assault survivors can communicate with trained professionals .
IP addresses are not tracked and transcripts of conversations -- which look like instant message boxes -- are not recorded .
The service has helped more than 10,000 people , Berkowitz said .
Go to RAINN 's Web hotline
But counselors said survivors are going to look wherever they can to find help and comfort , particularly when they do n't get it through the court system .
Fewer than 5 percent of reported cases in Florida make it to a prosecutor 's office , Dritt said .
Whether because of lack of forensic evidence or because many are he said / she said accounts , rape cases can be very difficult to try .
" What you hear from every rape crisis center from Pensacola to Key West is that there are hardly ever any prosecutions , " she said .
" Most sexual violence is acquaintance rape , and unfortunately , a lot of juries still think that if a victim had a relationship with their attacker , then they can not be raped by that person . "
Stacy , 25 , worried about that when she was raped by a man she knew as a friend in 2001 while attending Ohio State University .
Although she has spoken publicly numerous times about her experience , CNN is not using her last name in keeping with its policy of not identifying sexual assault victims .
As is typical of younger survivors , Stacy spent the days and weeks after her assault struggling to assure her friends and family that she was OK .
She reported the assault to university authorities , but her attacker continued to go to class .
She grew increasingly depressed and anxious .
Her grades plummeted , and she gained weight .
" I thought that people who had never been assaulted would never understand .
I thought I had no one to talk to , but then I realized , I had the Internet , " she said .
" Sometimes , talking to people who were not close to me was refreshing because there was no judgment to face .
If you talk to someone online , there 's no judgment , right ?
How can they judge you when they do n't even know you ? "
She began instant messaging in chat rooms but quickly realized that many people who initially seemed sympathetic were only pretending .
" The next thing you know , they are making it seem like they are turned on .
They were asking me for details of my rape .
It was very disturbing , " she said .
" I had to block several people .
After that , I thought the worst of the world .
I thought everyone was a perpetrator , and I trusted no one . "
After years of face - to - face therapy , Stacy began to heal and feel more confident .
She partly credits RAINN , which she found via an Internet search , for helping her recover .
Other female students came forward to say they , too , had been assaulted by her attacker .
He was expelled from the university and pleaded guilty to a lesser charge -- sexual imposition , a misdemeanor -- and was placed on probation .
Stacy watched Crystal 's video .
" That 's just heartbreaking , " she said .
" I feel really sad for her because no one seems to have explained that the justice system is n't always going to help .
I understand why she 's outraged .
That 's exactly how I felt , too . "
Orange County authorities charged the 23 - year - old man Crystal accused of assaulting her with lewd or lascivious battery .
According to court documents , Crystal and the man both said they had an ongoing sexual relationship .
The prosecutor , who declined to comment to CNN , concluded that the teen and the 23 - year - old had consensual sex , according to the case file .
Florida law states that a 15 - year - old can not give consent to sex .
And though Crystal was 15 at the time of the alleged forced encounter , the prosecutor wrote that the case would not be prosecuted because Crystal was " a mere 1 month away " from turning 16 , when it would be " legal to give consent , " according to documents .
A spokeswoman for the Orange County state attorney 's office declined to comment further .
Stacy had some advice for Crystal : Get counseling and keep talking .
" You 're not always going to get what you want from the court system , " she said .
" So you 've got to think about yourself , figure out who you are and realize that you 're stronger than what he did to you . "
CNN 's Special Investigations Unit's Abbie Boudreau and Scott Zamost contributed to this report .

Theophilus Van Kannel of Philadelphia was granted a patent on August 7 , 1888 on the revolving door .
It took eleven years for the first actual revolving door to be installed , at Rector 's , a restaurant on Times Square in Manhattan .
Since then , revolving doors have adorned the entrances to large offices and hotels around the world .
Now , for the past year , they have become focal points with the addition of advertising .
Below are six examples of both successful and unsuccessful recent ad campaigns using revolving doors :
Revolving Door Ad 1 . The Blender , Canada
Taxi Canada cooked up this creative campaign for McCain Foods in Spring 2007 to publicize its new Smooth - eez blended drinks .
The revolving doors in Toronto and Calgary were designed to give the sense of being inside a blender .
According to Irfan Kahn , associate creative director at Taxi Canada , kids were immediately drawn to them .
Overall , the campaign was so successful , they are thinking of repeating this Spring .

Revolving Door Ad 2 . Child Labor , Netherlands
March 26 , 2008 , one hundred children demonstrated and visited embassies and the Dutch House of Parliament to raise awareness the child labor issue .
In support of their efforts , World Vision pasted life - sized adhesives of children on automatic revolving doors in Amsterdam .
Above the child , the copy reads : " You ca n't ignore child labour . "

I would agree .
It 's impossible to ignore the imploring faces of the children .
The remainder of revolving door ads were released in Spring 2007 .
The fact that there have been so few repeated makes me wonder at their effectiveness .
Revolving Door Ad 3 . Keeps Going and Going , Turkey
From Healthy
People , we get these revolving door adhesives which impart the image of a man appearing to run around and around .
The focus was on Pharmaton 's " everlasting energy " and the goal was to direct consumers to the " End Fatigue " website .
Frankly , running endless circles seems quite fatiguing to me .

Revolving Door Ad 4 . Front and Back , Phillipines
BBDO Guerrero Ortega strategically placed these Mitsubishi stickers on automatically revolving doors , allowing consumers to interact with the front and back of their vehicle .
The consensus seems to be that the ads make it look like the people are being forced to push the car , as though it had broken down .
My opinion , this does n't make for a great message .

Many thanks to Amy Gifford for the significant amound of work she did on this piece .
Last month , a Beijing - based billionaire splashed out £ 250,000 on 27 bottles of wine – a far cry from what the man and woman in the street spends in China .
What they drink is largely the £ 1 - a - bottle home - grown brands from big wine companies like Changyu , Great Wall , Dynasty , Huaxia and Vini Suntime , the latter one of China 's fastest - growing wineries , established by the People 's Liberation Army .
These days , most city dwellers in the People 's Republic can afford a bottle of local putao jiu ( " grape alcohol " ) – though needless to say , the expensive stuff bought by the Beijing entrepreneur did not come from China .
It was Romanée - Conti , the world 's most expensive wine .
Despite the glaring inequality between the prices of everyday Chinese plonk and the increasingly popular French imports , one thing is clear : wine , whether of the Chinese or imported variety , has become a booming business in China with consumption growing each year by a healthy 10 - 15 per cent .
Health was one of the kick - starters of the new boom when the red - wine - is - good - for - your - heart mantra was being chanted the world over in the mid-1990s .
Before that , the first Great Leap Forward was made in 1978 , when the country opened its doors to the outside world .
Overseas companies like Rémy Martin ( Dynasty ) , Pernod - Ricard ( Dragon Seal ) and Seagram ( Summer Palace ) teamed up with locals , bringing technical know - how , modern equipment and European vine varieties with them to steer the Chinese sweet tooth towards drier but fruity Western - style wines .
The second Great Leap Forward came as a result of government encouragement of winemaking in the early 1990s .

Most vineyards in China are state or collectively owned and subdivided into individual units of less than half a hectare .
With more than 100 wineries opening since 1996 , there are nearly 500 wineries now in the country .
Changyu is the big one in Shandong , south - east of Beijing , where a similar latitude to California combined with a maritime climate makes this , monsoons notwithstanding , one of the most suitable regions for wine production .
In the north - west province of Xinjiang , where winters are bitterly cold , Vini Suntime manages 10,000 hectares of vineyards .
Three hundred kilometres east of Beijing , Hebei province is home to Bodega Langes , a 200 - hectare vineyard - hotel - vino - therapy spa owned by the Austrian crystal family Swarovski .
In Shanxi province south - west of Beijing , Grace has established a reputation for quality wine also based on premium French grapes .
The latest growth area is Yunnan , China 's south - west highland province , where extensive plantings of cabernet sauvignon and other classic French varieties supplement the local Chinese grapes , Rose Honey and Crystal .
The Chinese plan to expand wineries such as Dynasty , Changyu and Great Wall to cope with the growing shelf space of the burgeoning supermarkets .
Since China drinks almost all the wine it produces , and its thirst for wine appears insatiable , the one dark cloud on the horizon comes from critics who suggest that Chinese brands are poor value for money .
Hardly surprising when imported bulk wine can still be blended with native - grape wines to end up labelled cabernet sauvignon or chardonnay .
Sure , Chinese wine needs to up its quality , but as its consumers start to switch from tea and beer to wine , both domestic wines and imports from Mouton Cadet to Mouton Rothschild look like becoming a staple of the Chinese diet .
At yesterday ’s Papal Protest ( sponsored by American Atheists ) , several people gathered to hold “ peaceful demonstrations … to protest the papal agenda for cultural , social and political hegemony . ”
Herb Silverman , the president of the Secular Coalition for America , was one of the attendees and speakers .
These were his remarks ( reprinted with permission ) :
A Catholic News Service article mentioned that Pope Benedict XVI will be paying close attention to what people have to say in the United States .
“ This pope is a great listener , ” said papal spokesman Father Federico Lombardi .
Well , I think this is just terrific , because I hope he will listen carefully to our words and perhaps even act on some of them .
This is what I would say to the pope if I have the opportunity to meet him .
Pope Benedict , I would first like to defend you against some scurrilous allegations .
I do n’t believe the pope is the Antichrist , as many Christians do — including Pastor John Hagee , Sen .
John McCain ’s spiritual advisor , who also called the Catholic Church the whore of Babylon and a cult .
It is not the whore of Babylon , and is no more a cult than is Mormonism , Islam , Jehovah ’s Witnesses , Scientology , or any other religion that values faith more than reason .
I was thrilled when you said , “ A world marked by so much injustice , innocent suffering and cynicism of power cannot be the work of a good God .
A God with responsibility for such a world would not be a just God , much less a good God . ”
Unfortunately , you did n’t claim these as your own words , but as arguments used by atheists .
Still , I give you credit in this instance for accurately portraying my view .
As a card - carrying member of the American Civil Liberties Union , I support your free speech right to promote your beliefs , just as I supported the rights of the American Nazi Party ( the American version of the Hitler Youth ) to march in Skokie years ago .
I have always felt that the best counter to bad or hateful speech is good speech , not censorship .
If you agree with these free speech views and the importance of dialogue with those with whom you may disagree , I hope you will invite some of us to the Vatican to better understand our perspective .
I would like to express my appreciation to Ellen Johnson and American Atheists for bringing diverse groups together for this event .
As President of the Secular Coalition for America , we also encourage different nontheistic groups to put aside the 5 % on which they disagree and cooperate on the 95 % with which we agree .
So , Pope Benedict , I consider it progress that you , too , have begun to look for ways to cooperate rather than continue fighting against factions with whom you have doctrinal differences .
Unfortunately , your cooperation with other Christians is for the purpose of defending the faith against secularism , which you declare to be a fundamental problem of modern society .
You have even made it the goal of your papacy to counteract secularism , claiming that atheism was responsible for some of the greatest forms of cruelty in history , citing leaders like Stalin and Mao .
I would point out that the cruelty under such regimes was made possible not because its leaders were atheists , but because its leaders were granted unquestioned power and loyalty .
Dissenters were banished , imprisoned , or killed .
Such actions , whether propagated by secular or religious regimes , are inexcusable .
Democratic countries that tolerate dissent are the countries most likely to promote human rights for all people .
These happen to be the secular governments you decry , not the theocratic governments you apparently would like us to emulate .
You have the right , Pope Benedict , to argue that our secular country should become more theocratic , but we have an important ally : our Constitution , our godless U.S. Constitution , which gives us the right to worship one , many , or no gods .
We proudly promote freedom of conscience for all people .
We will defend secularism against theocratic attacks , whether such attacks come from fundamentalist Islam or from your Church .
Such attacks motivate us even more to keep our government secular .
You said you are greatly disturbed because atheists put their faith in human reason and freedom .
I , too , would be greatly disturbed if human reason and freedom had led to atheist Crusades , atheist Inquisitions , atheist Witch Burnings , or atheist Suicide Bombers .
You said in an encyclical that many people reject religious faith because they no longer find the prospect of an eternal afterlife attractive .
Not true .
We do n’t find an eternal afterlife unattractive , we just find it unbelievable .
You say that fear of God is ultimately at the root of modern atheism .
But how can we fear a god whose existence we do n’t accept ?
We do fear many of God ’s defenders , those inspired by God to destroy infidels and heretics .
You also decry moral relativism , which undermines your pronouncements on absolutism .
Yes , we generally are tolerant of other points of view coming from those who wish us no harm .
We are also willing to change when new evidence warrants .
Otherwise , we might be stuck defending some outlandish claims written thousands of years ago .
We are mindful of the words of Lord Acton , speaking about papal absolutism : “ Power tends to corrupt , and absolute power corrupts absolutely . ”
Even your Church has shown inclinations toward relativism .
In 1990 , as Cardinal Ratzinger , you were still maintaining that the actions of the Church at the time of Galileo were justified because it took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo ’s teaching .
However , in 2000 , your predecessor finally apologized for the Church ’s treatment of Galileo .
Though several hundred years late , after such overwhelming scientific evidence that even your Church could no longer deny , this is still progress away from absolutism .
Your Church also apologized in 2000 for excesses in the Inquisition , for Witch Burning , and for its silence during the Holocaust .
Now , Pope Benedict , I would like to suggest that you take action on a few obvious items so that a future pope ( if the papacy still exists ) does not have to apologize for them .
If you care about human rights , please support stem cell research that likely one day will lead to cures for many diseases .
And stop denigrating gays and lesbians simply because they want a loving sexual relationship .
Even though you oppose a woman ’s right to choose , at least drop your opposition to the use of condoms .
You must realize that comprehensive sex education programs make abortions more rare .
Do you want a future pope to apologize for all those who died from AIDS because your Church preferred death without condoms to life with condoms ?
Your Church can look rather foolish when its reasons keep changing while your conclusions remain the same .
It used to accept the wisdom of St. Bonaventure , who said : “ Since only the male was made in the image of God , only the male can receive the godlike office of priest . ”
After such claims of female inferiority became a bit embarrassing , even to the Church , the story changed to , “ Only males can hold positions of leadership in the Church because all the apostles were male . ”
By that reasoning , I am more qualified to be pope than you .
All the apostles were married Jews , just like me .
So either your Church must again change its reasoning , Pope Benedict XVI , or I would like future consideration to become Pope Herb I .

( Natural News )
In response to a petition by the Center of Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) , the FDA held its first hearing to consider whether and how to regulate the salt content of processed foods .
Excessive salt intake has been linked to high blood pressure , which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease .
According to the American Medical Association , a 50 percent salt reduction in processed and restaurant foods in the United States could save 150,000 lives per year .
While salt supplies sodium , an essential nutrient , the average U.S. sodium intake is far above the recommended healthy level .
National dietary guidelines recommend that sodium intake be capped at 2,300 mg per day , and that the middle aged , elderly and African Americans of all ages consume an amount closer to 1,500 mg .
But average sodium intake in the United States is approximately 4,000 milligrams per day , 77 percent of it coming from processed and restaurant food .
Bread and cheese are the two biggest single contributors , supplying 10.7 percent and 5.5 percent of the average person 's daily sodium intake , respectively .
Many restaurant dishes and frozen entrees supply more sodium in one serving than a person should consume in full day .
CSPI cites the Denny 's Lumberjack Slam Breakfast , which contains 4,460 mg , as well as " a typical Reuben sandwich ( 3,270 mg ) , or an order of beef and cheese nachos with sour cream and guacamole ( 2,430 mg ) . "
The Swanson 's Hungry Man XXL Roasted Carved Turkey contains 5,410 mg of sodium - more than twice the recommended daily maximum - while the Marie Callender 's Classic One Dish Chicken Teriyaki contains 2,200 mg.CSPI has also discovered that the sodium content of foods varies widely by brand or country .
For example , Contadina tomato paste contains 237 percent more sodium than the same product by Hunt's , even though the former company 's tomato sauce contains 33 percent less sodium than the latter's .
McDonald 's Chicken McNuggets contain more than twice as much salt in the United States as they do in the United Kingdom .
But not all salt is bad for you .
" No one seems to make the distinction between processed white salt and full - spectrum coarse sea salt , " said consumer health advocate Mike Adams .
" Unprocessed seat salt provides eighty or more trace elements that are vital for human health .
The problem is not that people are eating too much salt , it 's that they 're eating fake salt , devoid of nutrients . "

Starting with this entry on Neutral Milk Hotel ’s
In the Aeroplane over the Sea , about once a month I ’ll be writing up my favorite albums and hopefully be able to include a couple of songs off of each .
[ odeo=http://odeo.com/audio/17151283/view]
The influential late 90s indie rock group Neutral Milk Hotel was the brainchild of Jeff Mangum , one of the original members of the Athens , Georgia Elephant 6 collective that includes members of The Apples in Stereo , The Olivia Tremor Control , and Of Montreal .
Mangum was the singer and primary songwriter for the band , whose other members included his friends from other E6 bands .
In 1996 , NMH released On Avery Island , an uneven but interesting concept album that touched upon many of the themes later explored on the follow - up .
Two years later would come Mangum ’s opus In The Aeroplane over the Sea , a brilliant and beautiful album influenced by his obsession with The Diary of Anne Frank and about coming to grips with mortality in the wake of her death and a failed relationship with his father .
Mangum uses a lot of sexual and religious imagery to explore these themes and calls back to them throughout the entirety of the album .
It is a true album rather than just a collection of songs , and it is at its best when listened to straight through .
There are standout tracks but there is n’t a single weak track and the consistent musical and lyrical themes add up to a exceptional example of cohesive storytelling .
The album opens with the 3 - part “ The King of Carrot Flowers ” , which showcases the different styles that Mangum employs on the album .
Part 1 is a sparse , hauntingly beautiful tale of a dysfunctional childhood , part 2 an mournful ode to Jesus Christ and part 3 an almost punk - rock story of abortion , swimming and a synthetic flying machine .
Next comes the title track , “ In the Aeroplane over the Sea ” , a song about life , death and Anne Frank , and one of the the best songs I ’ve ever heard .
At the close , Mangum seems to be addressing Anne , singing “ When we meet on a cloud / I ’ll be laughing out loud / I ’ll be laughing with everyone I see / Ca n’t believe how strange it is / To be anything at all . ”
He follows with the 1st part of “ Two - Headed Boy ” an ethereal song that seems autobiographical about a misfit who turns to radio and music to find the love he ’s missing in his life .
The album uses the instrumental “ The Fool ” to segue to the high - powered “ Holland , 1945 ” , a love song for Anne Frank and another great song that shows the album ’s musical versatility .
Mangum sings with such emotion throughout the album that you can hear how much of himself he has put into the album .
A lot of the songs feature heavy distortion and a lot of noise and background instruments , which contrasts well with Mangum ’s distinct wail , and the faster songs like “ Holland , 1945 ” and “ Ghost ” particularly make good use of this effect .
[ odeo=http://odeo.com/audio/16207/view]
The short “ Communist Daughter ” leads into the 8 - minute epic , “ Oh Comely ” that hits upon essentially every theme in the album .
Another one of my favorites , “ Ghost ” follows , with another instrumental , “ Untitled ” bringing it to the album ’s closer , the second part of “ Two - Headed Boy ” , which begins with Mangum pleading , “ Daddy , please , hear this song that I sing . ”
It ends with him essentially telling himself ( about Anne Frank )
“ But do n’t hate her / When she gets up to leave . ”
The album ends with Mangum getting up and putting his guitar away , apropos given what he then did with his career .
In the ten years since the release of In the Aeroplane over the Sea , Mangum has practically walked away from recording or performing , save for a few guest appearances on friends ’ albums and at their concerts , which only adds to his growing legend as another example of an artist who disappeared at the peak of his career .
There are persistent rumors that Mangum will release another Neutral Milk Hotel album , and while that may destroy the romanticism of his image , I can only hope for more music from the mind behind In The Aeroplane over the Sea .
It is a truly remarkable album and fully deserves its cult classic status .

Wild sex is a staple of nature films , but there is one sex scene David Attenborough has never narrated : the mating ritual of yeast .
That 's right : yeast .
Sex is n't just limited to lions , birds of paradise , and aphids ; single - celled fungi do it too .
Although most people do n't like to hear the words ' fungus ' and ' sex ' used in the same sentence , yeast mating is a remarkable phenomenon and worth a closer look .
You can see this amazing scene , played out billions of times every day in wine vats and under oak trees , captured on film .
As is the case with most wild mating rituals , filming yeast sex requires great patience - yeast are slow to commit and even when they do , they do n't rush things .
The beginning of foreplay itself takes several hours , as you can see below :
It may look like not much is happening in this scene , but there is some remarkable activity going on .
The whole process begins with pheromones : the two sexes , evocatively called a and α , send amorous signals to each other in the form of small peptides , called mating factors .
Although the mating factors are too small to see under a microscope , you can see their effects as the yeast become aroused .
After several hours , you can see the formation of what biologists discreetly call the " mating projection " as a yeast cell starts to get ready for action .
( As you watch the video again , pay careful attention to the behavior of the yeast in the top- center of the picture ) .
As foreplay progresses , the cells continue to elongate , a behavior termed " shmooing " .
No , that 's not derived from the word ' smooching ' , it 's actually a highly technical term coined by yeast biologists in reference to the 1940 's cartoon character , whose shape bears a striking resemblance to an aroused yeast :
As yeast shmoo and find a mate , the final process of yeast sex begins , and the two partners fuse their cells .
This climactic scene of fungal ecstasy has unfortunately been censored from the video footage , but one intrepid researcher , who offers tantalizing glimpses of hot petri dish action on his blog , caught an intimate shot with his voyeur cam :
Other than the well - known scientific obsession with the sexual practices of other species , why are scientists interested in yeast mating ?
While yeast wo n't help you learn how to be a better lover , genetically , we can learn a lot about sexual reproduction from yeast .
The fact that even some single - celled eukaryotes reproduce sexually is a powerful testament to the evolutionary advantage of sexual reproduction .
Just why sex is evolutionarily a good thing is still debated among biologists .
( Note that I said evolutionarily - biologists are perfectly aware of non-evolutionary reasons why sex is a good thing . )
One suggestion is that the genome shuffling that goes on in sexually reproducing organisms ( recall that when you pass on one copy of your chromosomes to your kids , its a mixture of genetic material from both your father and your mother ) enables a species to more efficiently ' try out ' different combinations of mutations , some harmful , others beneficial , combinations which are then tested by natural selection .
Yeast undergo meiosis , with its attendant chromosome recombination , just like human germ cells do .
Thus , many of the evolutionary consequences of sex can be studied much more easily in yeast than in species like wildebeasts and humans .
( For a whole series of Nature articles on the evolutionary benefits of sex , check here . )
There is an even more compelling reason to study yeast mating that has nothing to do with sex itself .
The biological events that occur inside a yeast cell in response to mating pheromone is a classic example of a widely shared signaling pathway , a reusable information - processing module of the kind I wrote about here .
In this case , the information - processing module is called a MAP kinase pathway ; this is a pathway that plays a tremendously important role in human biology , including normal biology and diseases like cancer .
The yeast MAP kinase pathway is so similar to the human version , that you can replace the yeast pheromone receptor with a human hormone receptor , add human hormone , and thereby prompt the yeast mating response .
The MAP kinase pathway is such an important pathway , and yeast are so easily studied , that many research groups focus on yeast mating , including the Alpha Project , a group trying to produce a detailed computer model of this system .
Boeing engineers can model their engines much , much better than biologists can model cellular systems , so scientists currently focus much of their modeling efforts on simple , genetically tractable organisms like yeast .
What can we really learn by making computer models of yeast mating ?
Like Boeing engineers , scientists are interested in knowing ' what happens if we tweak this , or rewire that , or remove this component ? '
At Boeing , they can do their tweaks on a computer and predict , with very high confidence , what 's going to happen in the real engine .
In biology , we can't yet - we actually have to go make all of the tweaks and see what happens .
We consider ourselves lucky if we can do all of the experiments , feed everything that happened back into a computer model , and get the computer model to ' retrodict ' what should happen .
We do n't yet know what variables are important and which are not , or what level of abstraction is best for building a computer model , and we do n't really know why , over the course of evolution , the MAP kinase pathway was put together the way it is .
My hope is that once we understand that , we 'll know how to build models of human cells that can lead to true predictions of what will happen when you tweak the system with a drug .
That 's heady stuff , based on studies of fungal sex .
Biologists will take any experimental system they can get , no matter how strange ( or depraved ? ) , if it will promise them a chance of learning something new about ourselves .
In a comment to tarran ’s post about the morality of armed rebellion , co-contributor Stephen Littau makes this point :
I would caution anyone who would want to begin or support an armed revolution against the government to study the French Revolution .
There is always a chance that such actions can make matters worse , even if the revolution is successful .
The French Revolution did not have the same success as the American Revolution .
I would say that the outcome of the American Revolution is the exception , not the rule .
Which leads to the question — why is the American Revolution the historical exception rather than the rule ?
Why did n’t we devolve into tyranny the way France did , or Russia , or most of the third - world , or , for that matter , post - Communist Russia ?
Why did n’t France and Russia become like us ?
In response to Stephen ’s comment , I said the following :
I ’ve often wondered what it was that made the American Revolution different from the French Revolution , the Revolutions of 1848 , the Russian Revolution , or any of the countless number of third - world revolts against colonialism after World War II .
It ’s more , I think than just the fact that the American Colonies in the 18th Century were blessed with some incredibly wise men , though they clearly were .
I think it comes down to the philosophical basis that they were working from .
The American revolutionaries had Smith and Locke and the writers that followed them .
The French had who ?
Voltaire ?
In 1848 it was Marx .
In Russia it was Marx and Lenin .
And , in the third - world it was Marx , Lenin , and Ho Chi Minh .
When you build your revolution on a foundation of sand , it ’s bound to fail in the end .
But that just leads to the question of why the ideas of the American Revolution stopped at the Atlantic .
After all , the French Revolution occurred only 13 years after the Declaration of Independence was signed and the same year that George Washington took office as President of the United States under a new Constitution .
There were some founders , such as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison , who thought that the French Revolution was the beginning of the flowering of liberty on the European Continent .
It was n’t until the Reign of Terror and then the reign of Napoleon that they came to realize that their hopes had been dashed .
After that came the Revolutions of 1848 , inspired mostly by various forms of socialism and ending in little more than yet another cycle of European wars .
The Russian Revolution , inspired by Marx and lead by Lenin , was never a prospect for true freedom and that was confirmed by the terror of Josef Stalin .
And , finally , the colonial revolutions that followed World War II were perhaps doomed to fail when they turned for inspiration to the same ideas that had led to the Gulag Archipeligo .
So , was the American Revolution just an historical accident ?
Just plain dumb luck ?
And , if it was , what does that mean for the future of any fight against statism ?
Cameron is not only destroying Gordon Brown , but risks destroying himself .
For the most part , the British electorate are decent people .
If David Cameron is not careful , voters will start to come to the conclusion that for all his cleverness , he is an arrogant and perhaps a nasty man .
Is David Cameron being too nasty to Gordon Brown ?
That 's what Peter Oborne apparently thinks , writing in the Mail yesterday about the increasingly brutal and personal attacks on the PM from the Tory front bench .
It 's uncivilised , he thinks , unnecessary , demeaning to politics and , ultimately , will turn people off both parties even more .
If such a thing were possible .
I have some sympathy with this argument .
Attacking the man rather than his policies is , apart from anything else , rather lazy , especially when there 's so much in the current government 's policies so richly deserving of attack .
And Gordon Brown , for all his faults , is hardly the socially - handicapped monster of Blairite mythology .
Surrounded by a coterie of loyalists he may be , but the likes of Ed Balls are loyal for a reason .
Brown has genuine qualities .
He has deep convictions , but ( unlike Blair 's ) convictions based on thought rather than instinct .
He has an intellectual grasp that Blair always lacked .
Had it not been for the sequence of unlucky events , and , even more so , the plotting of his enemies , he might have continued the success of his first two months in office - a period when , let it not be forgotten , most people were heartily glad to see the back of Blair .
All this is easy to overlook .
With the economy worsening and opinion polls nose - diving , Gordon Brown is taking most of the blame .
His backbenchers are revolting ( most backbenchers are ) .
Some are openly pining for the glorious days of Tony , which is to say that they wish it were still 1997 .
Blairites , led by Charles Clarke , seem actually to want Brown to fail in order to vindicate their conviction that Tony alone had the ability to run Britain .
Some , in contrast , want the socialist policies that they thought would manifest themselves once Brown took over .
All , though , are worried about their seats , a fear that paradoxically makes their defeat more likely .
Dr Johnson famously observed that if a man know 's he is to be hanged in a month , it concentrates the mind wonderfully .
When it 's a whole group headed for the long - drop , on the other hand , the opposite seems to happen .
They start arguing with each other over who bought the rope .
A victory by Ken Livingstone next week might produce a small respite , but with commentators increasingly drawing parallels with the last , calamitous days of John Major 's government the natural human instinct to seek a scapegoat has kicked in .
And as the anthropologist Sir James Frazer used to maintain , the most potent sacrifice is the king himself .
It 's hard to imagine , though , that replacing Brown with , say , David Miliband would have a positive impact on Labour 's situation .
Whatever his manifold faults , Gordon Brown is by far the best thing the party has got .
That , in fact , has always been the problem .
There 's very little talent in depth .
How else could you end up with a cabinet most members of which have either been to school with each other , been related to each other , or shared one another 's bed ?
To some extent , all the Tories need to do is sit back and enjoy the fun .
But only to some extent .
They also need to have a properly thought - through programme for government , and evolving such a programme , together with the accompanying narrative , is vital .
As Boris Johnson is likely to discover to his disadvantage .
This does n't mean , however , that they should expect Labour malcontents to do all the work .
Apart from anything else , the opposition would be failing in their duty if they did n't resort to every weapon in their armoury to finish off this discredited government before it manages to do any more damage to the economy , the constitution , the rule of law , civil liberties and the democratic process itself .
Morally and intellectually bankrupt it is , worse , incompetent .
The Tories should certainly be doing everything they can to point these things out .
After all , Labour has it coming .
As Oborne admits , Blair ( advised by Alastair Campbell ) destroyed the reputation of the fundamentally honest ( if not terribly competent ) John Major with utter ruthlessness .
They gave no quarter , and were not above bare - faced lies of a sort Cameron has not yet attempted .
During the 1997 election campaign , the Labour lie machine went into overdrive , for example misrepresenting a moderate scheme for the long - term reform of pensions as a threat to the income of people already retired , or claiming , over and over again , that the dastardly Tories were about to abolish the NHS .
They deserve no sympathy whatever .
Where criticism is valid , though , is the contrast between Cameron and co's savaging of Brown and their kid-gloves treatment of Blair .
For a whole decade , Blair got away with evasions , misstatements and rhetorical absurdities that no previous PM would have got away with .
He manipulated patronage , lied about the opposition and launched at least one illegal war ; yet his own estimation of himself as a " pretty straight sort of guy " with the highest of motives and an almost mystical bond with the British people was never seriously challenged by the opposition .
His most formidable and successful opponents were on his own backbenches .
The up and coming generation of Conservative politicians were , and to a large extent remain , in thrall to him : to his awesome political skills , naturally , but also to the Blair myth .
The idea that he was a strong leader who knew what he was doing , whereas Brown is vacillating and has no plan .
In fact , Blair 's plan - domestically , at least - was always Brown 's plan .
The mirage on which his successive election victories were based - the supposed strength of the economy , and the real ( if it turns out temporary ) rises in living standards - were Brown 's doing also .
So were the mistakes : the hideously complex and philosophically obnoxious system of tax credits , for example , the ever - rising taxes .
Tony Blair got in just in time , just as Gordon Brown got out of the Treasury just in time .
If the financial crisis had happened a few months earlier , it would have done irreparable damage to them both .
In truth , the Blairite regime was rarely more than an illusion .
It was , however , a remarkably good and effective illusion , and as long as nothing too obvious happened to disturb it the phantasmagoria continued to float in mid-air .
If Brown had come to power sustained by a record of solid achievement - whether the credit for that record be Brown 's or Blair 's - his government would not have evaporated so soon .
But it was n't , and it did , and the game is up .
In his bleaker moments , which must be most of the time , Gordon Brown almost certainly realises this .
But do David Cameron and his sidekick George Osborne ?
I see little reason to discourage them from launching the most ferocious attacks on Brown 's personality of which they are capable .
Just so long as they do n't actually believe them .
Metal Gear Solid 4 creator Hideo Kojima has said his comments about being limited by the PS3 hardware were taken out of context as a result of Japanese to English translations .
He is , apparently , more than happy with what he had to work with and what he achieved , and points to the cultural difference in modesty for skewing the facts .
" I am Japanese , so I try to be modest .
I 'm an especially modest person .
I do n't wish to brag about it and say , ' I am the amazing Metal Gear guy ' , or say , ' This is the best one ' , just like how Americans brag [ about ] stuff like this , " said Kojima in a translation on the PlayStation.com forums ( translated by Kotaku ) .
" Westerners do not have a tradition of modesty , so the statements are translated correctly but the original meaning is totally different . "
Kojima had originally said that conceptually the PS3 had appeared to be a dream machine with endless possibilities , and he had planned Metal Gear Solid 4 and its innovations with this in mind .
However , soon he had to cut back on his original vision once he ran into the " restrictions " of the Cell processor .
The reality was taking just " one step " rather than 10 .
Apparently this was misconstrued .
This is what he really wanted to say :
" Let 's say this developer is making a new kind of car .
He claims it can fly .
And when you claim it can fly then the expectation grows so the developer sets his goals higher .
The expectation is that if the car can fly then it should reach MACH speed .
But it does n't stop there ; it soon gets to ' it should go into space ' , " said Kojima .
" However , the developer will end up going to the public and saying that the car reaches MACH speed but it fails to go into space .
But he should n't give up , because for a car to even reach MACH speed and fly is revolutionary .
I wished to transfer my thoughts like this , but it did n't work out very well . "
The result is that Kojima may not do any more interviews with the English press , at least until his anger subsides .
" MGS4 is n't exactly my property so I do n't have total control over it and sometimes I get confused with it .
Some may be disappointed with the way I say things , but I am releasing this game with confidence , " concluded Kojima .
Metal Gear Solid 4 is due out around the world on 12th June .

Bob Barr , the former Republican congressman from Georgia , today won the Libertarian Party 's 2008 presidential nomination on the sixth ballot .
He defeated Mary Ruwart of Texas , 324 to 276 , at the party 's convention in Denver .
Wayne Allyn Root , Barr 's choice for vice president , won that nomination on the second ballot , beating Steve Kubby of California , 289 to 255 .
Kubby , a crusader for medical marijuana , had also sought the presidential nomination and endorsed Ruwart when he was eliminated from that race .
Root had run for the top spot as well , and he endorsed Barr when he was eliminated , indicating that he hoped to be the Georgian 's running mate .
In her remarks following her loss , Ruwart did not mention Barr .
Barr , in contrast , was complimentary toward her and her campaign .
Root , also a former Republican , pointed out the difference between Washington , D. C. , and his hometown of Las Vegas .
He said that the drunks in Las Vegas gambled with their own money .
Barr , a former federal prosecutor , was a member of the famed Republican U. S. House class of 1994 .
In 1992 , he had narrowly lost Georgia 's Republican primary for U. S. senator to the late Paul Coverdell , who went on to unseat the incumbent Democrat , Wyche Fowler .
The bottomline is that these high - achieving singles believe in action and effort more than coincidence and fate .
You create your fate .
Not just in their work but also in other areas of their lives , elite singles have now learned to hustle hard to achieve success and not to be content with just waiting for it - may it be with careers , opportunities , dreams or their perfect match .
This is why these services include personality tests that determine the characters of each person in order to better match them with those members who will complement their behavior and attitude .
Once you get older , and preferably wiser , you realize that physical attraction , sexual compatibility , and similarity in hobbies , likes and dislikes , are no longer the most apt determinants needed for a commitment with someone .
More than these factors , more men and women are now looking for partners with the same drive for success and intellectual level , mostly reflected by their income range , profession and degree .
The singles that are looking into the future as opposed to just having fun with whoever is available today , cares about these factors as it will likely be a bigger issue than the presence or absence of abs once they build a family of their own .
Sites like these do not only use gender , age and looks to match singles but look into the other factors such as residence , profession , and level of education .
Another great thing about these services is that you do not have to pay any fees upfront , but could join for free to view the singles and get an overall feel of the site before even committing .
Dating is now easier .
The internet and dating sites like these made it possible for high - achieving singles to meet like - minded people , without the need for agonizing and time - consuming first dates , and increased their chances of finding a long - term partner who live the same busy lives as they do .
This decreases the conflict if ever they have a commited relationship as they have the same goals and understand the demands of the lifestyle they chose .
Today , because of technology and innovative companies , there are now solutions to this dillemma of elite singles .
The arrival and growth of elite dating platforms like Elitesingles Academicsingles made a way for elite singles to no longer compromise and choose between their career and a relationship .
Stories of lovers bumping or catching each others ’ eyes in a coffee shop are getting fewer each day .
Even the once frowned - upon stories of meeting at a bar or being set - up for a blind date do not happen often anymore because singles have become more cautious where they spend their time and who they spend it with .
Between the juggling of work and play , of personal , professional and social life , there is just less and less time to be on the hunt for the love of your life .
This demanding life is also why more and more people stay single until they ’re 40 or even beyond .
And though this high - achieving mindset is beneficial for companies , careers and the economy , it is becoming damaging to the work - life balance and the emotional satisfaction of those whose dreams include their own kids and a husband or wife someday , aside from the businesses , publications and PhDs under their name .
More often , these people become successful but very sad singles as they realize as they age that they have no one to share their successes with .
With the demands of today , most single professionals no longer have the time for activities outside of their careers , sometimes not even for their families and friends .
The world has become a complicated place to live in and there always seems to be so much more work to be done , more friends to meet , endless hobbies to pursue , infinite dreams to achieve , unlimited places to visit and more stuff to buy meaning more money to earn , and time has never been as limited and precious as it is today .
As a result , singles have less and less time to meet new people and more so , date and have a relationship with someone .
Simply , you see no future from dating people outside of your own league but dating from inside your league is almost impossible because of the very demanding lifestyles you all live .
If you are one of them , you might have felt tired from dating a string of unemployed boys who cannot understand the demands of a great career , or a simple job at that .
You might have been suffocated from the gorgeous but underachieving girl you dated who had no other dream than to own a luxury bag , but does n’t even know how to work for one .

When dating a partner compatible with your lifestyle is one of the hardest criteria to meet .
If you are an educated and ambitious business man / woman , you need someone that will understand these traits and bring them out in you .
A relationship with a partner that holds you back is never going to work .
You will find yourself frustrated .
This is because they are not your equal and a healthy relationship requires balance .
You are an elite single an affluent , educated man or women , with life worked out .
You know where you are going and what you are doing .
Elite singles can find dating a troublesome game .
You meet people from all walks of life , but what you really want is someone on the same path as you .
The elite are not common , and you are tired of wasting your time with people that just want to scrape by .
An elite single has a winning mentality and views life a certain way .
When you have this mentality , people in your dating pool can seem dull .
You want a partner that can communicate with you on an intellectual level .
Maybe what your relationship needs is a little healthy competition , or someone passionate and opinionated .
We live in an exciting time for elite singles .
If you want to get serious about online dating , there are now services , which cater specifically to elite singles .
The internet is the new way to meet likeminded people and elite single dating sites have become popular in the UK .
One of the largest , of these sites is elitesingles .co.uk .
The site is growing rapidly to accommodate 18,000 new members each week .
Which just goes to show , that elite singles need their own dating pool .
There is a nearly even ratio of men to woman , with slightly more woman joining weekly .
Elitesingles.co.uk supports same sex dating and allows men to search for men , and woman for woman .
The registration is always free .
There is no risk involved if you do n’t like this site .
The site is curated to attract elite singles , looking for a long - term committed relationship .
Their team is selective and removes users that are not a good fit , for the site .
You can think of it as dating Darwinism , or playing mum .
However , it works and they have populated their site with professional people .
70 % of members hold at least a bachelor ’s degree .
You might think it is a little superficial to use a degree as an indicator of a good match , but society puts so much emphasis on having a degree , that you can make assumptions about the people that chose not to get one .
Degree holders are , on average , more successful .
Elitesingles.co.uk creates on average 2000 new couples each month , in more than 20 countries .
This is done with their intelligent matchmaking technology .
It profiles members to deliver up to seven compatible matches a day .
When you first join the site , you fill out an introductory personality profile .
The smart profiling system uses your personality profile and your search inputs to deliver compatible matches .
This means the site is always receiving more information about what you are looking for , and every search is bringing you closer to a match .
The introductory personality profile is based on the ‘ Five Factor Model ’ a theory of five broad dimensions used by psychologist , to quantify a personality .
It is not an exact science , but it will definitely point you in the right direction .
It calculates your levels of openness , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , all of which are important traits , for a partner to share .
There are more than 200 questions in the profile , so it will take some time .
However , it means that every member on the site has answered 200 questions about themselves , and the site is matching you based on a lot of data .
There are polar yes or no questions and others use a scale to judge relative importance .
The questionnaire ends with open - response questions , in which you can talk a little about yourself .
Honesty is always the best policy .
If you give weighted responses , answering what you think people want to hear , you are less likely to find someone compatible .
It can make your profile seem generic .
As we , all have similar preconceptions about what we think people want .
I wanted to talk briefly about the exceptional dating advice offered on Elitesingles.co.uk .
The Magazine is a section of the site , which includes advice from professionals .
There is everything from renowned psychologists giving you tips , to happening local bars , great for a first date .
It is a great resource , and even if you never join the site , I would still advise you read some of the great articles on there .
After the introductory personality profile , you enter your search parameters and begin looking for a match .
It is a well thought out system , which deliver compatible matches , but do n’t take my word for it .
There is no sign up risk .
You can get a feel for the site by creating an account .
Academicsingles.co.uk is another site where elite singles in the UK can find one another .
The focus of this site is education .
If you are a brainy single looking for an equal then this site has 50,000 singles in the UK waiting for you .
There is more woman than men on the site and you can sign up for a membership at no risk to your bank balance .
It is similar to Elitesingles .
co.uk in that it also requires members fill out an introductory personality profile , although it does not ask nearly as many questions .
There are pros and cons to this .
Elite singles are busy , by definition , and might not have time to fill out a 200 strong questionnaire .
However , the results are not going to be as personalised .
I found the questions a little bit superficial , as opposed to the personalised questions asked on Elitesingles.co.uk .
I liked the amount of contact requests , which I got on my Academicsingles .co.uk profile , and found this a different approach to the 6 which I got on my Elitesingles .
co.uk account .
Dating is a numbers game , there is no doubt about that , and both the quantity and the quality approach will get you to where you want to be .
It is not about the numbers , but the people behind them , and there are educated , motivated professional on both sites , which is what you are looking for .
To properly test out both these sites , I went on a date with a member from both of them .
I am the first to admit that this is anecdotal evidence , and cannot be used to say that one of these sites is better than the other .
Disclaimer over let us begin .
I fall right into the target market .
I am busy writer who maintains several blogs .
There is a cost for doing what you love , and pay it in full , with an eighty hour work week .
I work weekends , and this leaves me with no time , left to go out .
I decided to try both these websites , partially to review them , and partially because I was cultivating a genuine curiosity , into online dating .
Straight of the bat Elitesingles .co.uk has a nicer interface .
The website is user friendly and easy to navigate .
It needs to be , because no sooner have you decided to join , than you are answering hundreds of questions about yourself .
I am no expert , but from my experience there are a wide variety of people that you can love for many different reasons , and this hyper specific match making implied that I was compatible with one type of woman .
I met a lovely girl named Jeanne , on Elitesingles.co.uk .
She was a little odd but in a funny , cheerful way .
We went to one of the local cafes , recommended to me by a local magazine .
I spend a lot of time by myself , taking to a word processor , so my social skills are a little rusty .
It was a great relief to find we had common ground , to talk about .
She was a journalist and her work had sculpted her into one of the most interesting people , I had ever met .
She knew a little about everything , and this opinionated , passionate woman was a little gem .
The premise behind the website appeared to be working .
I had found my intellectual conversation partner , and was really enjoying myself .
She asked if I wanted to go on a second date , but I explained to her that I am leaving the country soon , to go travel South East Asia , true story , and it would be a fruitless endeavour .
We parted ways as friends who had formed a genuine human connection .
Academicsingles.co.uk , introduced me to a fellow blogger named Susan .
We spoke at length about our profession , and how we so rarely had time to do what we were doing .
The conversation did not have the diversity as it has had with Jeanne .
That is not to say she was not a lovely woman .
I felt that she was just as compatible , although a bit shyer .
I really enjoyed this conversation , and because she had a bigger meal insisted on paying for lunch , so no complaints there .
To wrap things up , on both elite dating sites , I met phenomenal woman .
The kind of females , which I could search bars , for the rest of my life , and never find .
I will be using them again at some time in the future and recommend that you go check them out .
Three decades have passed since the movie Jaws sent terrified bathers scrambling out of the ocean .
But as any beach lifeguard knows , there 's still nothing like a gory shark attack to stoke public hysteria and paranoia .
Two deaths in the waters off California and Mexico last week and a spate of shark - inflicted injuries to surfers off Florida 's Atlantic coast have left beachgoers seeking an explanation for a sudden surge in the number of strikes .
In the first four months of this year , there were four fatal shark attacks worldwide , compared with one in the whole of 2007 , according to the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville .
' The one thing that 's affecting shark attacks more than anything else is human activity , ' said Dr George Burgess of Florida University , a shark expert who maintains the database .
' As the population continues to rise , so does the number of people in the water for recreation .
And as long as we have an increase in human hours in the water , we will have an increase in shark bites . '
Some experts suggest that an abundance of seals has attracted high numbers of sharks , while others believe that overfishing has hit their food chain .
' I 'm not saying it does n't happen , but it 's a convenient excuse , ' Burgess said .
Another contributory factor to the location of shark attacks could be global warming and rising sea temperatures .
' You 'll find that some species will begin to appear in places they did n't in the past with some regularity , ' he said .
New Smyrna Beach , Florida , is called the shark attack capital of the world .
It has had more recorded incidents per square mile than any beach on Earth .
So far this year there have been 10 attacks on surfers , including three in three days last week , although officials say most of the wounded were able to make their own way to hospital .
' It 's more like a vicious dog bite , half a dozen stitches , a few bandages , that sort of thing , ' said Scott Petersohn , a captain with the Volusia County Beach Patrol , which covers 47 miles of coastline including New Smyrna Beach .
' The sharks that inflict the most damage here , the black tips , can be about two or three feet long .
There are some bigger ones along our coast , tiger sharks and bull sharks , but there 's a sustainable food supply for them .
People are not on the menu for sharks . '
At Solano Beach , California , where 66 - year - old David Martin was killed last week by a great white shark estimated to be 4.5 metres long , and off the Mexican coast near Acapulco , where 25 - year - old American tourist Adrian Ruiz fell victim to a suspected tiger shark , there were conflicting claims .
Meanwhile , the wildlife protection group Wildcoast has accused the Mexican authorities of ' international shark hysteria ' over the slaughter of at least 10 near the beach at Troncones on the Pacific coast where Ruiz died .
A navy spokesman said a 200 - metre line with baited hooks was set up to catch any sharks threatening the beach .
' They more than likely had nothing to do with the attack .
Since sharks are threatened in Mexico , this is the worst type of vengeance security imaginable , ' said Aida Navarro , the group 's wildlife conservation programme manager .
' It 's the equivalent of stepping on to the plains of the Serengeti when you step into the water , ' Burgess said .
' It 's not like a swimming pool .
This is a wilderness experience and with it comes a certain amount of risk .
' What 's needed is some kind of system to prevent people and sharks coming together in a dangerous way . '
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) , which sits in The Hague , released Mr. Ojdanic on compassionate grounds until 12 May .
His release is subject to strict conditions , including 24 - hour electronic surveillance by the Serbian authorities .
Mr. Ojdanic , who also served as Defence Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , is on trial with five co-defendants for an alleged campaign of terror and violence directed against Kosovo Albanians and other non-Serbs living in Kosovo in 1999 .
A Conversation with Manfred von Thun
SA : May I begin by asking you about the origins of Joy ?
You come to programming language design by way of philosophy .
How exactly did that come about ?
Or are these activities unrelated ?
MvT :
The relation is mainly historical , and certainly not logical .
My first fifteen year period in academia , first as a student and later as staff , was a comedy ( ? ) of errors .
I enrolled in Psychology and Philosophy because " I wanted to know how the human mind works " .
But rats and stats in Psychology and logic and scientific method in Philosophy quickly changed my directions .
In particular , I became interested in the justification of induction , and I wrote my PhD in the field of inductive logic and logical probability .
After my appointment here at La Trobe I had to catch up with deductive logic and have been teaching it at various levels .
I have also taught courses in philosophy of science , philosophy of psychology , cybernetics , and of course various bits in first year philosophy .
In 1978 two of us logicians started using the university 's new DEC10 computer .
My colleague soon settled on Snobol , and I on Pascal .
We had no help at all , and at that time for me there was just the Pascal User Manual and Report and Wirth's Algorithms + Datastructures = Programs .
I was particularly fascinated by the miniature compiler for the PL0 language .
Most of my Symbolic Programming in Pascal , which I wrote over quite a number of years , was influenced by Wirth .
I have given courses at all levels for the Computer Science Department .
SA : All your programming in Pascal was procedural .
So how did you get into functional programming ?
How did Joy evolve ?
MvT :
In the early 1980's I came across the famous Backus paper " Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style , " and I was immediately intrigued by the higher level of programming in his FP .
From my deductive logic I also knew about Quine 's predicate functors and about Tarski's cylindric algebras .
Like Schoenfinkel 's and Curry 's combinatory logic , Backus elimiminates not only assignable variables but also formal parameters , and Quine eliminates variables of quantification .
I designed a strange little logic programming language based on some of these ideas , and implemented it in Prolog .
It had some rather useless features - among others a " Wheatstone bridge " combinator which takes five binary relations to produce a new binary relation .
Joy then evolved from this in an entirely haphazard way :
First I restricted the binary relations to unary functions , and this of of course was a dramatic change .
Second , to allow the usual arithmetic operations with their two arguments , I needed a place from which the arguments were to come and where the result was to be put - and the obvious place was a stack with a few shuffling combinators , originally the four inspired by Quine .
Third , it became obvious that all these combinators could be replaced by unary functions , with only function composition remaining .
Finally the very different distinctively Joy combinators emerged , which take one or more quoted programs from the stack and execute them in a specific way .
Along the way of course , lists had already been seen as just special cases of quoted programs .
This meant that programs could be constructed using list operations and then passed on to a Joy combinator .
SA : So Joy emerged after a tortuous history .
But by now it is quite stable .
How would you describe its main features ?
MvT :
The language Joy is a purely functional programming language .
Whereas all other functional programming languages are based on the application of functions to arguments , Joy is based on the composition of functions .
All such functions take just a stack as argument and produce a stack as value , but there are a few which additionally take files and the file system as argument and value .
Because of the stack , much of Joy looks like ordinary postfix notation .
However , in Joy a function can consume any number of parameters from the stack and leave any number of results on the stack .
Moreover , there are some stack functions which shuffle the top few elements of the stack around .
So , although for example the program 2 3 + is an arithmetical expression in postfix notation and also in Joy notation ( leaving 5 on the stack ) , the Joy program 5 dup * ( leaving 25 ) is not arithmetic because dup is neither a number nor an arithmetic operator .
That is why I say that much of Joy " looks like postfix " .
In reality this is what Billy Tanksley so appropriately called " concatenative notation " .
The semantics of this notation is summed up by : " The concatenation of appropriate programs denotes the composition of the functions which the programs denote " .
In such languages the application operation of the lambda calculus is uniformly replaced by composition .
What distinguishes Joy from ( the functional subsets of ) Forth and Postscript is the datatype of quoted programs .
Many
Joy functions expect quoted programs on top of the stack and execute them in different ways , effectively by dequoting .
This is similar to Lisp 's eval , but in Joy there are many of them , each performing the job of higher order functions .
But whereas in other languages the higher order functions take abstractions as arguments , the combinators of Joy take quoted programs from the stack .
As a result , there are no named formal parameters , no substitution of actual for formal parameters , and no environment of name - value pairs .
Consequently Joy has an exceptionally simple algebra , and its programs are easily manipulated by hand and by other programs .
Many programs first construct another program which is then executed by one of the combinators .
SA : In Joy , a primitive like + operates on the stack .
Should we think of this operation as replacing the top two elements x y with their sum x+y , or as two successive operations : first replace y with the unary function _+y and then replace x with x+y ?
MvT :
You spoke of " replacing " and " and then " , which are imperative or procedural notions and hence have no place in a purely functional language .
So the official answer has to be : the program 2 3 + denotes the composition of three functions , and the program 5 denotes one function and it is identical with the composition of the other three .
How the addition is performed internally is a different matter , it might be by pattern matching , or by two push operations followed by an add ( the obvious stack implementation ) , or any other ( invisible ) method that gives the right result .
But you also said " Should we think ... " , and that requires a different answer .
Indeed imperative or procedural thinking can be very useful for Joy , both for explaining the meaning of the Joy primitives and also when writing programs .
Here one should be eclectic and pragmatic - use whatever works .
I would tend to use your first mode of thinking , and only sometimes the second .
Two other modes would use message passing : a ) send the parameterless addition message to the pair 2 3 , or b ) send the addition message with parameter 3 to the number 2 .
Maybe Forth programmers know more about the psychology of stack programming .
SA : You mention the combinators of Joy .
What exactly is a combinator , and how do those of Joy differ from the combinators of Schonfinkel and Curry ?
MvT : Combinators are second ( or even higher ) order functions which take first ( or higher ) order functions as parameters .
They may return another function or instead immediately apply that function to some argument ( s ) .
When we say " John loves Mary and conversely " , this might be analysed as " ( loves AND CONVERSE ( loves ) ) ( John , Mary ) " .
Here CONVERSE is a unary combinator ( corresponding to the passive transform " John is loved by Mary " ) , and AND is a binary combinator .
Similarly , " Bob admires himself " might be analysed as " SELF ( admires ) ( Bob ) " , where SELF transforms the binary admires predicate into a unary one .
These combinators are not restricted to predicates ( functions which yield a truth value ) .
For example , the unary squaring function might be defined with the binary multiplication function by SELF (* ) .
In Schonfinkel 's and Curry 's system combinators similar to these serve to shuffle arguments of functions around , a job which in the lambda calculus is done by variables .
SA : K programmers should understand this .
We would define SELF as a function which takes a binary function f and returns a unary function which applies f[ x ; x ] :
SELF :{[ f ] {f [ x ; x ] }} g:SELF [ * ] g [ 3 ]
9
MvT :
If a parenthesis free notation such as postfix is used , then there are two possibilities : either use SELF as a higher order function as before , or work on a stack , using a stack function dup :
5 SELF (*) 5 dup *
Joy , like Forth uses the latter .
Note that dup is not a second order function at all .
The same two possibilities would arise for prefix notation .
In the same way the effect of CONVERSE can be achieved by a stack function swap .
All the functions involved now are strictly speaking unary functions from stacks to stacks .
Even multiplication is unary , although one can of course continue to think mainly in terms of how many parameters a function expects on the stack .
SA : Yes , I think a similar choice exists for K .
We can define ' sqr ' as either SELF [ *] or as the unary function
sqr :*.
2 #
which makes two copies of its argument , and then applies * " dot - wise " , mapping the first copy to *'s first argument , and the second copy to *'s second argument .
MvT :
But there are combinators which do not simply shuffle arguments around .
One of these is the mapping function which applies a function to all members of a list to produce a list of results .
In a fantasy notation :
MAP ( SELF (* ) ) ( [ 1 2 3 4 ] ) = [ 1 4 9 16 ]
Or in postfix and in concatenative Joy notation :
[ 1 2 3 4 ] MAP ( SELF ( * ) ) [ 1 2 3 4 ] [ dup *] map
Whereas MAP above is a second order function , Joy 's map is just an ordinary unary first order function from stacks to stacks - it expects a list and what in Joy is called a quoted program on top of the stack , and it returns a stack with a single list on top , the list [ 1 4 9 16 ] .
SA : This is where Joy and K diverge .
For us , ' each ' really is second - order : it takes a function and returns a function which applies to each element of a list .
We are taught to understand
sqr '2 3 4
as having the structure
( sqr ' ) 2 3 4
Apply ' each ' to ' sqr ' , and apply the resulting function to 2 3 4 .
It is even more obvious in classical APL , where functions such as ' sqr ' are not first class .
You can operate on a function only by feeding it as on operatand to one of a handful of " operators " , such as / , and then immediately applying the resulting function to data .
In K , +/ is a first class function , which can be assigned and passed into other functions as an argument .
MvT : Joy has a large number of such combinators which are really first order functions that do the work of second order functions because they expect one or more quoted programs on top of the stack .
Consider the conditional IF - Then - Else combinator , where the if - part produces a truth value and the then - part and the else - part are again functions ( and not statements ) .
IFTE ( ifpart , then - part , else - part )
In Joy there is a combinator ifte with the most common syntax
[ if - part ] [ then - part ] [ else - part ] ifte
which expects three quoted programs on top of the stack .
But actually quoted programs which map and ifte expect on top of the stack do not have to be pushed just before the combinator - they can be the result of stack shuffling or construction .
Similar to ifte is a combinator linrec for linear recursion which can eliminate the need for many recursive definitions that would otherwise clutter up the symbol table and the programmer 's mind :
[ if - part ] [ then - part ] [ rec1 - part ] [ rec2 - part ] linrec
The implicit recursion occurs between the [ rec1 - part ] and the [ re c2 - part ] quoted programs .
There is a similar combinator for binary ( tree - ) recursion that makes quicksort a one - liner :
[ small ] [ ] [ uncons [ >] split ] [ swapd cons concat ] binrec
SA : This seems quite powerful !
Over the years , APL developers have experimented with a variety of recursion operators , hoping that , just as the classical adverbs such as ' reduction ' , ' scan ' , and ' each ' enabled us to factor out explicit loops , so the new operators would help eliminate at least some explicit recursion .
For example , in K , we can define a function ' apply_to_atoms ' which takes a monadic function f and returns a g which , applied to a list , recurses to the atoms and applies f :
apply_to_atoms :{[ f ] {:[ @x ; f x ; _f'x ] }} f:2*! : g:apply_to_atoms f A :( 1 2;(3 2 4 ; ( 5 6 ) ) ) A ( 1 2 ( 3 2 4 5 6 ) ) g A ( ( ,0 0 2 ) ( ( 0 2 4 0 2 0 2 4 6 ) ( 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 10 ) ) )
But it 's never been clear what the " best " set of K - recursors might be , partly because K functions can take any number of arguments , and partly because recursion can involve more than one function .
To what extent to do you think the recursive combinators of Joy will replace explicit recursion ?
APLers are familiar with the fact that it often takes time and one or two " aha 's " before a problem breaks apart into an " array " solution , a program without loops and counters .
And some problems are stubbornly , perhaps essentially loopy .
It seems to me that a certain way of thinking needs to be acquired , analogous to " array thinking " in APL , which would let the programmer factor out the recursion pattern of problem such as quicksort .
I 'm thinking here of the way the nested recursion combinator arose as you contemplated Ackermann 's function , which most programmers would have said required explicit recursion .
MvT : Yes , the recursion combinators are very powerful indeed .
To have just one linear recursion combinator seems only possible in a language in which all functions have the same arity ( like in Joy , where all are unary ) .
I do not have a proof for this claim , except that I have not been able to define one for Lisp or Scheme , and if it were possible it would surely be in the literature .
Maybe it can be done with clever macros .
The same is true for tail recusion as a special case of linear recursion , and also for binary and nested recursion .
But probably it is not true that all recursion patterns can be captured by a small fixed menu of recursion combinators , especially the mutual recursion patterns .
As an example , one might look at the intricate and highly specialised mutual recursion that occurs in the definition of the Lisp functions eval and apply .
For those cases ordinary explicit recursive definitions seem unavoidable .
On the other hand , I would estimate that at least 50 % of recursions in Joy can be handled by the list combinators map , filter and fold , of the remainder at least 50 % can be handled by the more general linear recursion combinator .
What is left can often be handled by the binary and nested recursion combinators , and finally a small percentage does need explicit recursion .
As far as programming practice is concerned though , I have to confess that earlier on I sometimes caught myself first thinking recursively and only later using a combinator to remove the recursion .
It does not happen much nowadays , the combinators do become second nature .
SA : In APL we are used to thinking of programs as special datatypes , distinct from lists , arrays , and quotations .
But in Joy , lists and programs are the same datatype .
[ 10 20 30 ]
is a list with three elements , but it is also an example of a Joy program .
Can you spend a moment explaining how this works ?
MvT :
If you ask primary school children to do the sum : " 5 + 0 - 0 + 0 " they will be perplexed and find it hard .
Indeed , some problems are difficult because they really are so easy .
In Joy , as in Lisp and some other list processing languages , lists can be heterogeneous , the elements can be of all sorts of types .
So this is a perfectly acceptable list :
[ 11 22 true London Peter Santa - Claus foo dup *]
This list might have been the result of concatenating three lists :
[ 11 22 true ] [ London Peter Santa - Claus foo ] [ dup *]
The first list would normally be described as containing two numbers and a truth value , because that is the ordinary meaning of the symbols .
Now consider the second list - are its members a city , two persons ..?
No , sorry , there is no Santa - Claus , just having a symbol or name does not create a thing to which the name refers .
What about foo ?
It is a standard symbol for nothing in particular .
Finally in the third short list , what does it contain ?
two symbols or the two functions which they normally stand for ?
If the latter , then with an appropriate definition even foo from the other list might stand for something .
So , it is not at all easy to say what a list really is .
But it is straightforward to understand concatenation of lists .
Much the same with all the other operations on lists : taking its first members , deleting its first member , sticking something on the stack in front of a list , writing out a list or any of its members .
But the stack is as problematic as any other list : what is the result of taking the first element of [ 11 22 ] or of [ London Peter ] or of [ Santa - Claus foo ] or of [ dup * ]?
Taking the first of a list leaves something on the stack , but what is it ?
the number 11 , the city London ( too big ! ) , Santa - Claus ( sorry ) , the duplication function ?
I think that we have to say that strictly speaking all lists and all stacks just contain representations of something that may or may not refer to something in reality .
In Joy , as you remarked , some lists like [ 11 22 true ] can be executed by a combinator , and this one in particular results in three things being pushed onto the stack .
Another that can be executed is [ dup * ] , and , as we say , " it expects a number on the stack and replaces it by its square " .
But in our pedantic mode we should rephrase that .
In describing Joy I have used the term quotation to describe all of the above , because I needed a word to describe the arguments to combinators which fulfill the same role in Joy as lambda abstractions ( with variables ) fulfill in the more familiar functional languages .
I use the term list for those quotations whose members are what I call literals : numbers , characters , truth values , sets , strings and other quotations .
All these I call literals because their occurrence in code results in them being pushed onto the stack .
But I also call [ London Paris ] a list .
So , [ dup *] is a quotation but not a list .
SA : It 's interesting how K and Joy partition these concepts in different ways .
In K , strings can be used to quote code :
" 2+3 "
As you would expect , it does n't evaluate unless you apply " eval " :
. " 2+3 " 5
But a list evaluates immediately , so one can use K expressions to build lists " from within " .
For example
( !5;!3 )
builds a list whose first item is 0 1 2 3 4 and whose second item is 0 1 2 .
But in Joy , supposing that we had the program
3 enum [ 0 1 2 ]
we could n't use it in the following context :
[ 5 enum 3 enum ]
since this is a program .
Instead , we would construct the list out of its parts :
5 enum 3 enum unit cons
Of course , as you pointed out earlier , it is this very feature which allows the Joy programmer to construct programs out of simpler components .
MvT :
You want the infra combinator , I think .
It expects a list and above that a quotation .
It then treats the list as a temporary stack and executes the quotation on that .
More often than not the list that is supplied is actually an empty list .
Example :
[ ] [ 2 3 + 4 5 *] infra [ 5 20 ]
Now if enum is already implemented as you described , producing a list , and if [ 5 enum 3 enum ] is already on top of the stack , then all you need is just [ ] swap infra , which will leave [ [ 0 1 2 3 4 ] [ 0 1 2 ] ] on the stack .
Of course if you want the two sublists concatenated , then you do an extra [ concat ] infra first , or in this case simply flatten .
SA : Programming in Joy over the last few years , I 've come to think of the operators as falling into two classes : those which produce new information from data , such as + and cons , and those which move items on the stack into position where the informational operators can do their work , such as swap and dup .
Languages with variables appear to have a productivity advantage here , since one can simply invoke data by name .
Billy Tanksley has proposed closing the gap with something he calls " shuffle notation " , where " before " and " after " stack patterns are specified .
For example , if the stack is
.. 10 20 30
and you want :
.. 20 20 30 10 10
then you could say :
" abc - bbcaa " shuffle
which would have the same effect as :
rolldown [ dupd ] dip dup
What 's your take on this and similar efforts to deal with the problem of " stack noise " ?
MvT : Indeed , conventional languages with named formal parameters in definitions of functions can simply use the name to pick up the value of the corresponding actual parameter .
For functions with many parameters this is indeed an advantage .
But these languages need to carry around an environment of name - value pairs .
Joy tries to avoid the latter completely , but pays a price when there are many parameters .
One possibility would be to do what Forth does : when appropriate allow named formal parameters .
An interesting alternative is Billy Tanksley 's solution or some syntactic variant of that .
It does not introduce formal parameters to be used in the body of a function , and also it need not be used just at the beginning of a definition .
So it deserves very careful attention .
The proposal in effect defines an infinity of possible stack shuffling operators .
Currently Joy has 12 inbuilt stack shuffling operators , a few others defined in the standard library and other , deeper shufflings can be expressed using the dip combinator .
Two possiblities arise : 1 ) replace all the current Joy mechanisms by the new shuffle operator , or 2 ) allow both , and leave it up to the programmer to select what fits best .
To make any decision one would want to see some programs expressed in the old and in the new notations .
I have not done any experiments along these lines .
One other consideration concerns efficiency .
The shuffle operator ( or any syntactic variant ) requires a before - after after string to be examined - and that means interpreting its pattern .
A simple minded implementation would be slow .
An only slightly more sophisticated one would look for common patterns , and replace for example " a - aa " shuffle by dup .
It would use the interpreted form only in the less common but tricky cases , like your example .
On the other hand , this decision might well be left to the programmer .
So , my answer is not very definite at all , sorry .
SA : It might be interesting to explore algorithms which translate shuffle notation into a fixed vocabulary of stack - shuffling words .
Are there small bases for which efficient algorithms exist ?
What if we allow the stack diagrams to express structural transformations , e.g. :
[ ab ] c -- [ ac ] [ bc ]
I imagine that Brent Kerby would have opinions on this matter ( and quite possibly an algorithm or two ! )
MvT : Yes , Brent Kirby has done very interesting work on a combinatory algebra for concatenative languages , see his paper from the main page of Joy .
For Joy itself the following seems to be an adequate base for shuffling the stack : the three simple operators swap dup and pop , together with the combinator dip .
( This combinator expects a quotation on top of the stack and below that another value .
It pops the two , saving the value somewhere , executes the quotation , and then restores the saved value on top .
So , for example , [ swap ] dip will interchange the second and third element on the stack . )
But I do not have a proof that these four primitives are indeed complete in the sense required .
However , if the transformations also take apart lists on the left of the transformation pattern , or construct lists on the right of the transformation pattern , then the list operations will be needed .
In fact it helps to think of your transformation [ ab ] c -- [ ac ] [ bc ] to be composed of two transformations , firstly [ ab ] c -- abc and secondly abc -- [ ac ] [ bc ] .
Then the first has to take the list apart , and in general the list operators first and rest should be adequate for that , but uncons and unswons would also help .
The second transformation has to construct two lists , and in general the list constructors [ ] ( empty list ) and cons should do , but swons might also be useful .
Both kinds of component transformations would also need some of the four general primitives mentioned earlier .
An actual implementation would presumably collapse the two component transformations back into your original .
I have not done any work on implementing this sort of thing for Joy .
If I were to do so , I would look at the by now well understood implementations of pattern matching that are used in languages such as Prolog , Miranda and now in Haskell .
An older book by Peyton - Jones describes this in detail .
For a while I used to think that these transformations would re-introduce something like lambda variables into Joy , and that there is a problem of what the scope of the introduced variables would be .
But I was wrong , the scope is just the right side of the transformation , so the variables cannot actually occur elsewhere in the Joy program .
So if somebody wants to volunteer ...
SA : I 'm curious about Joy 's internals .
For example , in APL and its descendants , at least some of the bulk datatypes are implemented in consecutive memory locations without any links , and for that reason APL does n't require garbage collection .
I know that K uses a reference - counting mechanism .
Since the typical K application uses a small number of large objects , this is quite efficient .
So what choices have you made for Joy , and for what reasons ?
MvT :
Yes , the implementation of bulk datatypes in consecutive memory locations is in many ways ideal simply for efficiency reasons .
I have often wondered what kind of a cousin of Joy might be implemented like that without sacrificing efficiency elsewhere .
One worry of course concerns adding a new first element to a very large array : it requires copying the entire array .
So , if this happens often , much effiency is lost .
But must it happen often ?
Presumably the APL experience shows that it need not be a concern at all for a vast number of applications .
Then there is the possibility of a mixed implementation : mostly consecutive , but some links .
This may or may not require memory management in some way , either as mark - sweep , or copying , or reference counting .
The last cannot handle circular structures , but that may or may not matter .
At any rate there seem to be many possibilities for languages similar to APL , J and K but with a concatenative syntax to explore .
You yourself , Stevan , have done some interesting work in this field with cK , a concatenative version of K .
I look forward to seeing more of it , not the least because it would offer an implementation that is more efficient than the current Joy because of the way bulk datatypes are handled .
At the same time , I see no reason why a more sophisticated implementation of Joy could not use the same method wherever possible .
This is perhaps the best place to mention Billy Tanksley 's work , which is inspired by the consecutive memory implementation of the stack of the Forth language .
Since in Joy the stack is a sequence just like lists and other quotations , there is a possibility of using consecutive memory locations wherever possible and using links only where necessary .
So I think Billy 's work is a step in this direction , and I welcome it .
But you also asked about the choices made in the implemention of Joy , and for their reasons .
My background had been very much in logic and other symbolic processing , and the structures one needs there tend to be trees of some sort .
So I have had rather little use for arrays in consecutive locations , except for implementing trees .
I had used Prolog a fair bit , but Lisp I only studied in detail from a purely theoretical perspective .
It was clear to me from the outset that a uniform linked implementation for Joy would be simultaneously simple and sufficiently general .
Since Joy then had no assignments or other destructive updates , and hence no possibility of circular lists , memory management by reference counting was a possibility that I did consider quite carefully .
In the end I decided against it , largely on the grounds that a problem would arise if I ever wanted to allow circular lists .
I knew that the problem would not be insurmountable , but for a first implementation it looked like a lot of work .
It so happens that Joy is still purely functional and hence has no destructive updates of any kind , so a simple reference counting memory management would still be possible .
That would have the advantage of not requiring occasional hiccups for memory management and hence better suitablitity for real time work .
On the other hand , it is known that reference counting is more CPU intensive , spreading the total work more continuously .
Whether Joy will remain purely functional for ever ( look what they did to the original Lisp ) , I do not know at this stage .
SA : What is the current status of Joy ?
What are the plans for the future development ?
MvT
After several proof - of - concept implementations , the current implementation , written in unadorned C , evolved smoothly from one that was started 1995 .
In early 2001 John Cowan added files , floating point numbers and access to standard C functions , and he did a lot of cleaning up .
He also added the option of not using my original garbage collector but using the professional BDW collector , an improvement which allowed space used for strings to be reused .
This extended the functionality of Joy tremendously , and I a very grateful for all the work he did .
Since then Nick Forde has also added a number of features , and I thank him for that .
The current implementation is essentially an interpreter .
It translates ( compiles ) the external ASCII form of programs into internal tree code which is then interpreted in a rather conventional manner .
No attempt is made to do any optimisation , and my earlier " clever tricks " I always came to regret fairly soon because they interfered with my garbage collector .
There is a growing list of general and special purpose libraries , ranging over many kinds of possible programming applications , and most of my work in the last few years has been on those .
For the immediate future I plan to examine and test the so far rather underutilised module system , by writing libraries for some specialised types such as big sets , trees and dictionaries of arbitrary basetypes .
Several other people have published other more or less complete Joy interpreters , written in ML and in Scheme , in the " concatenative " mailing group .
At this point in time I have no plans to write a full compiler .
A first version of such a compiler would presumably use C as an intermediate language and leave the generation of machine code to the C compiler .
I would very much welcome if somebody were to take up the task .

No yuks as Stewart presses Iraq War architect on honesty David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday May 13 , 2008

Print This Email This Former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas J. Feith , who was at the heart of the Bush administration 's selective cherry - picking of intelligence to make its case for the invasion of Iraq , appeared on The Daily Show on Monday to promote his new book about the run-up to the war .
The central premise of Feith 's book , which he repeated over and over to Jon Stewart , is that although there were errors in some of the administration 's claims about the dangers posed by Saddam Hussein , the people making those statements were not being intentionally dishonest and did not set out to mislead the American public .
" The administration had an honest belief in the things that it said , " Feith insisted .
" Some of the things that it said about the war that were part of the rationale for the war were wrong .
But errors are not lies and I think much of what the administration said was correct and provided an important argument that leaving Saddam Hussein in power would have been extremely risky -- even though the president 's decision to remove him was extremely risky . "
Stewart pointed out in response that painting a rosy picture of how quick and easy the war would be while downplaying the risks was itself a form of dishonesty .
" You said something that I thought was interesting , " he noted to Feith .
" ' The common refrain that the postwar has been a disaster is only true if you had completely unrealistic expectations . '
Where would we have gotten those expectations ? "
" If you knew the perils but the conversation that you had with the public painted a rosier picture , how is that not deception ? "
Stewart asked .
Feith attempted to counter this by suggesting that because " the recent history has been very unhappy in a lot of ways ... people look back and I think they misremember a lot , " but he finally resorted to claiming once more that " there were statements ... that in looking back you wish you would have made differently ... I do n't think any of them were deception .
I think they were errors . "
" You do n't think it was a purposeful strategy ? "
Stewart asked .
" This is an administration very sophisticated in the arts of propaganda and public relations . "
Feith insisted that far from being sophisticated , the administration was actually very bad at propaganda .
He then went on to summarize his version of what led up to the war : " What the president decided after 9/11 was we should not focus only on the group that hit us , we should be trying to prevent the next attack .
...
The administration ... became persuaded by the facts that Saddam Hussein was an extremely serious danger .
...
There was a moment when the president wanted to focus on diplomacy .
...
Ultimately the diplomacy failed .
...
The administration grossly mishandled the public explanation . "
" You removed the ability for the American public to make an informed decision , " responded Stewart .
" Once you have removed that , then you no longer have , I think , the authority . "

Transcript via closed captions :: jon : welcome back to the show , everybody .
my guest tonight was the undersecretary of defense for policy from 2001 - 2005 .
his new book is called " war and decision : inside the pentagon at the dawn of the war on terrorism . " please welcome to the show doug feith .
sir. welcome .
i appreciate you being here .
i know you and i disagree somewhat on the war , but we may agree .
what 's your favorite baseball team . :: the philadelphia phillies . :: jon : oh , man .
we really disagree .
mets .
" war : indecision . " what if it boils down to that , i like the mets , you like the phillies .
the whole thing falls apart .
it seem like in reading it sort of the basic idea of the book -- and tell me if i'm wrong -- that a lot of what we know about the run-up to the iraq war , a low of the conventional wisdom is wrong .
this idea that , i think it 's something that you might take offense to that we were misled into war somehow .
( one person applauding ) . :: jon : settle down .
it will be a long ten minutes , lady .
the idea we 're misled in a war is wrong .
now , from this side of it , i always felt like we were misled .
so , let 's bridge that gap in ten minutes .
what makes you say we were not misled ?
what was so honest about .... :: i think the administration had an honest belief in the things that it said .
some of the things that it said about the war that were part of the rationale for the war were wrong .
errors are not lies .
i think much of what the administration said was correct and provided an important argument that leaving saddam hussein in power would have been extremely risky even though the president 's decision to remove him was extremely risky .
:: jon : let me stop you there because the president 's decision to remove him was extremely risky .
that 's not the sense , i think , that the american people got in the run-up .
( applause ) the sense that you got from people was not ... the sense was , we 'll be greeted as liberators .
it will last maybe six weeks , maybe six months .
it will pay for itself .
all these scenarios that were publicly proffered never happened .
you said something that i thought was interesting .
the common refrain that the post war has been a disaster is only true if you had completely unrealistic expectations .
where would we have gotten those expectations ?
( laughing ) :: well , there were a lot of things that did not go according to expectations .
we know that the war has been bloodier and costlyier and lengthyier than anybody hoped .
but the president had an extremely difficult task .
after 9/11 , there was a great sensitivity to our vulnerability .
and the president had to weigh -- and what i do in the book is i look at the actual documents where secretary rumsfeld was writing to the president and powell and rice and the vice president and general myers and others .
i talk about what they said to each other and what they were saying back to secretary rumsfeld .
what you see is there was a serious consideration of the very great risks of war .
i think that many of them were actually discussed with the public .
but to tell you the truth , looking back one thing is absolutely clear .
this administration made grocerors in the way it talked about the war .
some of them are very obvious like the .... :: jon : that was all we had to go on .
you know , that was ... i guess the difference in my mind is if you knew the perils but the conversation that you had with the public painted a rosier picture , how is that not deception ?
that sounds like ... when you 're sell ago product .... ( applause ) what it sounds like for me .
sorry .
the fact that you seem to know all the risks takes this from manslaughter to homicide .
it almost takes it from like with the cigarette companies .
if they come out and say , no , our products i think are going to be delicious .
you go back and you look and they go , well , they actually did talk about addictiveness and cancer .
is n't that deception ? :: i do not think -- and i think when people read this book , i think people will be surprised , to be reminded of what was actually said .
i think a lot of people 's perceptions of what were said are filtered through , you know , the recent history .
and the recent history has been very unhappy in a lot of ways .
we 've had a very serious losses in iraq , more than anybody anticipated .
people look back and i think they misremember aate lot .
one of the reasons i wrote this book is that almost all the other books that are out there on iraq are based on anonymous sources or they 're based on interviews with people who are pretending that they remember what happened years before .
and what i wanted to do was bring forward the written record so that people can actually be reminded of what was said within the government and what was said publicly . :: jon : maybe the disconnect is the written record within the government differs so greatly .
all respect , i think i remember pretty clearly the general tenor of what the government was saying to the people in the run-up to the war .
it was , the president specifically , the risk of going in , we have two choices : to do nothing .
the risk of doing nothing is far greater than the risk of going in .
but the risks of going in were never quantifyd publicly the way they were privately .
in fact , the opposite .
they undersold them .
donald rumsfeld , your boss , consistently went out there and said , looting ?
it 's one guy with a vase .
i watch these reports .
violence ?
henny - penny , the sky is falling .
these are what we were getting over and over again .
dick cheney saying the insurgency is in its last throes .
a consistent drum beat , a willful , i think -- and you can tell me if i'm wrong -- selling of the positive and pushing back of the negative . :: some of the criticisms you 've made are valid .
i criticized some of the ... there were statements that everybody in the administration -- myself included -- made that in looking back you wish you would have made differently , you would have call fied differently .
i do n't think any of them were deception .
i think they were errors . :: jon : you do n't think it was a purposeful strategy , andrew card said you do n't want your new product in august .
they had the white house iraq group that went through this is an administration very sophisticated in the art of propaganda and public relations . :: i disagree with that . :: jon : really ? :: i think this is an administration ... i strongly disagree .
i think that .... :: jon : being bad at it does n't mean you 're sophisticated .
you know what i mean .
( applause ) :: i think that the administration thought through a lot of these problems reasonably well although there were errors in the thinking - through also .
but they talked about them not at all well .
i think the administration 's strategy was in many ways better than it sounded .
part of what .... :: jon : that 's a good point .
when we come back we 'll talk about the reasoning behind that because that 's actually a very interesting point .
we 'll be right back with doug feith .
( applause ) , , .. , , .. captioning sponsored by comedy central captioned by media access group at wgbh access .
wgbh.org welcome back .
we 're talking to douglas feith undersecretary of defense to president bush .
it 's very difficult to get into sort of an argument of whether or not iraq was the right next move in the war on terror .
that 's another whole issue that i'll still come down on the bad news i think you guys decided it was a good move .
the one thing i think we can look at is there was no momentum for a war in iraq .
the momentum had to be generated somewhere .
afghanistan had its own momentum .
we were attacked from there .
bin laden was taking refuge there with the taliban .
to get the country to mobilize to war in iraq took effort . :: i think you 're looking at it differently from the way we looked at it . :: jon : i believe that is correct . :: i think that is correct . :: you 're looking at it from the point of view that the administration came in hell bept on going to war . :: jon : no , no , no .
i'm looking at it as iraq and a war did n't have its own momentum .
it had to draft behind another ... did you ever watch auto racing ?
you know when a guy sneaks in there and he starts to draft behind a lead car .
afghanistan had its own momentum .
the administration had to work very hard to create the case .
it was a prosecution , if you will . :: i really do n't think you 're talking about it the way any of us in the government thought about it . :: jon : no ? :: the way we approached this was the main thought that the president had after 9/11 was that the standard approach that we had taken for years , the law enforcement approach -- find out who did it and go and arrest them and prosecute them -- was not adequate to the challenge after 9/11 .
what the president decided after 9/11 was we did n't have ... we should not focus only on the group that hit us .
we should be trying to prevent the next attack .
it was n't that the administration built the case .
it 's that the administration seriously considering what needed to be done to prevent the next attack became persuaded by the facts that saddam hussein was an extremely serious danger and that removing him was important to america 's national security . :: jon : i'm saying that the facts were not presented to the american people because in making the prosecution they seemed to downplay the negative side .
anything that went towards not making the case was brushed aside .
anything that would take away the momentum .
why did n't you call your group ... you called it the office of special plans .
why did n't you call it what you had originally thought to call it , which was .... :: the office of northern gulf affairs . :: jon : why did n't you call it that ? :: there was a moment when the president wanted to focus on diplomacy and he did n't ... ( laughing ) . :: jon : i remember that moment . :: it was more than a moment .
it was a period of months . :: jon : there was a reason you said why you did n't call it that .
:: the president did n't want to put out a signal that he had decided to go to war when he in fact had not decided to go to war .
so he wanted to emphasize that he was trying to find a diplomatic resolution of the problem .
now the diplomacy was backed up by a threat of force .
then ultimately the dip diplomacy failed when hussein did n't make an honest declaration on his chemical and biological . :: jon : the decisions made were based on the sales aspect of this war in the administration . :: to tell you the truth , what i would say is the administration should really be criticized for the opposite which is that the administration grossly mishandled the public explanation . :: jon : that 's what i'm saying . :: then we agree on that .
it grossly mishandled it .
i do n't think it was dishonesty .
i think it was ... it was . :: jon : just because your intentions are good and noble and you believe it to be the right move for the country does n't make dishonesty .
you remove the ability for the american public to make an informed decision .
( applause ) once you have removed that , then you no longer have , i think , the authority because what you 've done is you 've told us what part of the argument you think is appropriate for us to know about .
but i do appreciate it .
the book is very footnoted .
it makes for slow reading .
but it 's interesting .
thank you .
( cheers and applause ) douglas feith .

In New York , the notorious gun-grabber Michael Bloomberg wants to censor the Second Amendment .
“ New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has moved from outrage to atrocity , said the Second Amendment Foundation , by asking anti-gun activist federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein to ban any reference to the Second Amendment during a civil lawsuit trial beginning May 27 against Georgia gun dealer Jay Wallace , proprietor at Adventure Outdoors , ” reports PR Newswire .
But the “ billionaire demagogue who considers himself so far above the law , ” as Alan Gottlieb , founder of the Second Amendment Foundation , characterizes Bloomberg , wants to go after the First Amendment , too .
Bloomberg wants a gag order slapped on the case .
In “ Mikey ’s world … a fair trial is one in which a defense attorney is muzzled , and the defendant is already guilty until proven innocent .
Bloomberg missed his calling .
Instead of being mayor of an American city , he should have been the administrator of a gulag . ”
Reports the New York Sun :
City lawyers , in a motion filed Tuesday , asked the judge , Jack Weinstein of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn , to preclude the store ’s lawyers from arguing that the suit infringed on any Second Amendment rights belonging to the gun store or its customers .
In the motion , the lawyer for the city , Eric Proshansky , is also seeking a ban on “ any references ” to the amendment .
“ Any references by counsel to the Second Amendment or analogous state constitutional provisions are likewise irrelevant , ” the brief states .
In other words , New York is a Constitution free zone .
But then so is much of the rest of the country , thanks to Bush , who considers the Constitution “ just a goddamned piece of paper . ”
Bush and his coterie of Straussian neocons need to get rid of the Second Amendment in particular because militarized police states do n’t go far if people have guns .
Come marital law , Bush and crew may want to begin with New York , Chicago , and D.C. , where restrictive gun laws rule .
Short of some draconian law , it will be hard going out here in the hinterlands .
Bloomberg ’s senator , Hillary Clinton , would have us believe she is a defender of the Second Amendment .
She recently sent out a mailer with a picture of a 66 Mauser rifle — printed backwards — declaring her support , or rather Obama ’s lack of support for the Second Amendment .
It is funny , though , how the elite , who run Hillary and Barack and John the robot alike , are fond of sending cryptic messages to the commoners .
“ The Mauser costs about $ 2,200 , and sports a double trigger , an accessory rarely found on American guns , but more typical of Western Europe , where the firearms market is more geared to custom guns for the aristocracy , as opposed to America ’s off - the - racks guns for the masses , ” writes Dave Kopel .
Clinton has a nearly perfect gun-grabber record in the Senate and now she wants you to believe she is a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment .
If we examine her political literature , it appears she supports the right of the ruling elite to own fancy hunting rifles .
Once Clinton or Obama take over , we can expect stunts like the one Michael Bloomberg is pulling to become common place .
Recall Hillary ’s hubby signed into law background checks and an assault weapons ban .
He wanted a national licensing program for all gun owners , but that ran into a lot of opposition .
Hillary will pick up where Bill left off .
Bloomberg ’s attempt to squash the constitutional rights of a gun shop owner in Georgia is simply another angle gun-grabbers will take up with frothy zeal if a “ liberal ” — as in neoliberal — gets into office .
Here ’s how Bloomberg runs his scam , according to a Liberty Coalition letter sent to Michael J. Sullivan , acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives :
Bloomberg has organized a multi-state vigilante - style campaign against federal gun dealers .
Bloomberg ’s gambit is simple — without any federal or state law enforcement authorization , he sends people to federal firearms dealers to break federal law by providing false information on the federal ATF Form 4473 firearm transfer form , and then purchasing guns for persons prohibited by law from taking possession of guns ( a so called ‘ straw sale ’ ) .
Bloomberg then files a civil lawsuit against the dealer in a New York court while using a covertly made video tape of the transaction to blackmail the dealer into ‘ settling ’ on terms where the City of New York ’s ‘ Special Master ’ will supplant ATF supervision of the dealer and peruse Americans ’ confidential federal gun transfer records at will .
Expect more of this funny business after Clinton - Obama , Obama - Clinton get in the White House .
And if you think McCain will save the Second Amendment , think again — there is a strong possibility Mike DeWine will become his attorney general if the McManchurian candidate is selected .
DeWine is a darling of the gun-grabbers with a Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence endorsement .
“ When he ran for the Senate in 1994 , he backed the Clinton Gun Ban , ” writes the Buckeye Firearms Association “ In 2006 , Human Events Online named DeWine among the Top 10 anti-gun U.S. Senators .
And shortly before his defeat , DeWine took a position in opposition to legislation which barred gun manufacturers , distributors , dealers or importers from frivolous lawsuits designed to put them out of business . ”
Call it the Bloomberg tactic , an end - run around the Second Amendment .

TJX , parent corporation of TJ Maxx and notorious for the recent colossal credit card breach of 2006 ( we were n’t told until 2007 , but I digress ) , is a U.S. public company .
As such , they are required to file a quarterly report to the SEC called a 10-K .
TJX ’s 10 - K provides a chilling account of the breach , from discovery through disclosure to law enforcement , and finally the public .
It details what they know and do n’t know .
Here is how the long narrative begins …
COMPUTER INTRUSION
We suffered an unauthorized intrusion into portions of our computer systems that process and store information related to customer transactions that we believe resulted in the theft of customer data .
We do not know who took this action and whether there were one or more intruders involved ( we refer to the intruder or intruders collectively as the “ Intruder ” ) , or whether there was one continuing intrusion or multiple , separate intrusions ( we refer to the intrusion or intrusions collectively as the “ Computer Intrusion ” ) .
We are engaged in an ongoing investigation of the Computer Intrusion , and the information provided in this Form 10 - K is based on the information we have learned in our investigation to the date of this Form 10 - K .
We do not know what , if any , additional information we will learn in our investigation , but that information could materially add to or change the information provided in this Form 10 -K .
… the above contains some of the legalese ( the terms “ Intruder ” and “ Computer Intrusion ” used throughout the report ) .
The report continues with a description of the discovery …
Discovery of Computer Intrusion .
On December 18 , 2006 , we learned of suspicious software on our computer systems .
We immediately initiated an investigation , and the next day , General Dynamics Corporation and International Business Machines Corporation , leading computer security and incident response firms , were engaged to assist in the investigation .
They determined on December 21 , 2006 that there was strong reason to believe that our computer systems had been intruded upon and that an Intruder remained on our computer systems .
With the assistance of our investigation team , we immediately began to design and implement a plan to monitor and contain the ongoing Computer Intrusion , protect customer data and strengthen the security of our computer systems against the ongoing Computer Intrusion and possible future attacks .
On December 22 , 2006 , we notified law enforcement officials of the suspected Computer Intrusion and later that day met with representatives of the U.S. Department of Justice , U.S. Secret Service and U.S. Attorney , Boston Office to brief them .
At that meeting , the U.S. Secret Service advised us that disclosure of the suspected Computer Intrusion might impede their criminal investigation and requested that we maintain the confidentiality of the suspected Computer Intrusion until law enforcement determined that disclosure would no longer compromise the investigation .
With the assent of law enforcement , on December 26 and December 27 , 2006 , we notified our contracting banks and credit and debit card and check processing companies of the suspected Computer Intrusion ( we refer to credit and debit cards as “ payment cards ” ) .
On December 27 , 2006 , we first determined that customer information had apparently been stolen from our computer systems in the Computer Intrusion .
On January 3 , 2007 , we , together with the U.S. Secret Service , met with our contracting banks and payment card and check processing companies to discuss the Computer Intrusion .
Prior to the public release of information with respect to the Computer Intrusion , we provided information on the Computer Intrusion to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission , U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission , Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Federal Privacy Commissioner .
Upon the public release , we also provided information to the Massachusetts and other state Attorneys General , California Office of Privacy Protection , various Canadian Provincial Privacy Commissioners , the U.K. Information Commissioner , and the Metropolitan Police in London , England .
On January 13 , 2007 , we determined that additional customer information had apparently been stolen from our computer systems .
On January 17 , 2007 , we publicly announced the Computer Intrusion and thereafter we expanded our forensic investigation of the Computer Intrusion .
On February 18 , 2007 , in the course of our ongoing investigation , we found evidence that the Computer Intrusion may have been initiated earlier than previously reported and that additional customer information potentially had been stolen .
On February 21 , 2007 , we publicly announced additional findings on the timing and scope of the Computer Intrusion .
… so that ’s the timeline on the discovery .
Their actions in terms of quickly involving law enforcement and banking at all levels is laudable and appropriate .
Then again , they knew that this was a serious situation , and they ’d be criticized for slow response later if they did n’t act quickly .
The report continues by describing the timeline of the intrusions :
Timing of Computer Intrusion .
Based on our investigation to date , we believe that our computer systems were first accessed by an unauthorized Intruder in July 2005 , on subsequent dates in 2005 and from mid-May 2006 to mid-January 2007 , but that no customer data were stolen after December 18 , 2006 .
… short and to the point .
Next , TJX talks about the systems affected .
This is where it gets interesting , because we get the impression that they are n’t really sure which systems were compromised , or from which systems data was stolen :
Systems Affected in the Computer Intrusion .
We believe that information was stolen in the Computer Intrusion from a portion of our computer systems in Framingham , MA that processes and stores information related to payment card , check and unreceipted merchandise return transactions for customers of our T.J. Maxx , Marshalls , HomeGoods and A.J. Wright stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico and our Winners and HomeSense stores in Canada ( “ Framingham system ” ) and from a portion of our computer systems in Watford , U.K. that processes and stores information related to payment card transactions at T.K. Maxx in the United Kingdom and Ireland ( “ Watford system ” ) .
We do not believe that the Computer Intrusion affected the portions of our computer systems handling transactions for customers of Bob ’s Stores , or check and merchandise return transactions at T.K. Maxx .
We do not believe that customer personal identification numbers ( PINs ) were compromised , because , before storage on the Framingham system , they are separately encrypted in U.S. , Puerto Rican and Canadian stores at the PIN pad , and because we do not store PINs on the Watford system .
We do not believe that information from transactions using debit cards issued by Canadian banks at Winners and HomeSense that were transacted through the Interac network was compromised .
Although we believe that information from transactions at our U.S. stores ( other than Bob ’s Stores ) using Canadian debit cards that were transacted through the NYCE network were processed and stored on the Framingham system , we do not believe the PINs required to use these Canadian debit cards were compromised in the Computer Intrusion .
We do not process or store names or addresses on the Framingham system in connection with payment card or check transactions .
… we can speculate on the reasons why TJX does n’t know which systems were affected .
Could it be that the intruder (s ) washed the audit logs , or accessed the data in a way that did n’t show up on audit logs ?
There are also some hints appearing that suggest that TJX was not following PCI requirements in terms of what information may be stored and which may not .
Note there they say “ We do not believe that customer personal identification numbers ( PINs ) were compromised , because , before storage on the Framingham system … ” !!
It sounds like they were storing PINs on the “ Framingham system ” which is clearly a violation of PCI requirements .
PIN must never be stored on a merchant system .
Next , the report describes the data that was stolen .
Customer Information Believed Stolen .
We have sought to identify customer information stolen in the Computer Intrusion .
To date , we have been able to identify only some of the information that we believe was stolen .
Prior to discovery of the Computer Intrusion , we deleted in the ordinary course of business the contents of many files that we now believe were stolen .
In addition , the technology used by the Intruder has , to date , made it impossible for us to determine the contents of most of the files we believe were stolen in 2006 .
Given the scale and geographic scope of our business and computer systems and the time frames involved in the Computer Intrusion , our investigation has required a substantial period of time to date and is not completed .
We are continuing to try to identify information stolen in the Computer Intrusion through our investigation , but , other than the information provided below , we believe that we may never be able to identify much of the information believed stolen .
Based on our investigation , we have been able to determine some details about information processed and stored on the Framingham system and the Watford system .
Customer names and addresses were not included with the payment card data believed stolen for any period , because we do not process or store that information on the Framingham system or Watford system in connection with payment card transactions .
In addition , for transactions after September 2 , 2003 , we generally no longer stored on our Framingham system the security data included in the magnetic stripe on payment cards required for card present transactions ( “ track 2 ” data ) , because those data generally were masked ( meaning permanently deleted and replaced with asterisks ) .
Also , by April 3 , 2006 , our Framingham system generally also masked payment card PINs , some other portions of payment card transaction information , and some portions of check transaction information .
For transactions after April 7 , 2004 our Framingham system also generally began encrypting ( meaning substituted characters for the actual characters using an encryption algorithm provided by our software vendor ) all payment card and check transaction information .
With respect to the Watford system , masking and encryption practices were generally implemented at various points in time for various portions of the payment card data .
Until discovery of the Computer Intrusion , we stored certain customer personal information on our Framingham system that we received in connection with returns of merchandise without receipts and in some check transactions in our U.S. , Puerto Rican and Canadian stores ( other than Bob ’s Stores ) .
In some cases , this personal information included drivers ’ license , military and state identification numbers ( referred to as “ personal ID numbers ” ) , together with related names and addresses , and in some of those cases , we believe those personal ID numbers were the same as the customers ’ social security numbers .
After April 7 , 2004 , we generally encrypted this personal information when stored on our Framingham system .
We do not process or store information relating to check or merchandise return transactions or customer personal information on the Watford system .
… it is clear that much more than just credit card data was stolen .
There were apparently many incidents of other information , including drivers ’ license , military and state identification numbers , names and addresses , social security numbers , and perhaps more .
The report continues :
Information Believed Stolen in 2005 .
As we previously publicly reported , we believe customer data were stolen in September and November 2005 relating to a portion of the payment card transactions made at our stores in the U.S. , Puerto Rico and Canada ( excluding transactions at Bob ’s Stores and transactions made at Winners and HomeSense through the Interac network with debit cards issued by Canadian banks ) during the period from December 31 , 2002 through June 28 , 2004 .
We suspect the data believed stolen in 2005 related to somewhere between approximately half to substantially all of the transactions at U.S. , Puerto Rican and Canadian stores during the period from December 31 , 2002 through June 28 , 2004 ( excluding transactions at Bob ’s Stores and transactions made at Winners and HomeSense through the Interac network with debit cards issued by Canadian banks ) .
The data were included in files routinely created on our Framingham system to store customer data , but the contents of many of the files were deleted in the ordinary course of business prior to discovery of the Computer Intrusion .
… the report than shows a chart that indicates the number of cards compromised .
I ’ll summarize here :
Payment Card Status at Time of Believed Theft
Transactions from
12/31/02 – 11/23/03
Expired Cards : Track 2 data masked : 5,600,000 cards ;
All card data in the clear : 25,000,000 cards
Unexpired Cards : Track 2 data masked : 3,800,000 cards ;
All card data in the clear : 11,200,000 cards
Transactions from
11/24/03 – 6/28/04 Expired Cards : Track 2 data masked : unknown quantity ;
All card data in the clear : 0 cards
Unexpired Cards : Track 2 data masked : unknown quantity ;
All card data in the clear : 10 cards
The narrative continues :
Customer names and addresses and , for transactions after September 2 , 2003 , track 2 data were not included in the payment card information believed stolen in 2005 .
We do not believe that customer PINs were compromised .
In addition , we believe that personal information provided in connection with a portion of the unreceipted merchandise return transactions at T.J. Maxx , Marshalls , and HomeGoods stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico , primarily during the last four months of 2003 and May and June 2004 , was also stolen in 2005 .
The information we are able to specifically identify was from 2003 and included personal ID numbers , together with the related names and / or addresses , of approximately 451,000 individuals .
We are in the process of notifying these individuals directly by letter .
TJX does not know how many records were stolen from 11/24/03 – 6/28/04 because they regularly purge data , and because they do n’t know when the specific thefts took place , they do not know how many were taken .
They began encrypting card data on 4/7/04 .
Prior to that , according to the report , they either masked card data , or stored it all in the clear .
The report continues by describing data stolen in 2006 :
Information Believed Stolen in 2006 .
As previously publicly reported , we identified a limited number of payment cards as to which transaction information was included in the customer data that we believe were stolen in 2006 .
This information was contained in two files apparently created in connection with computer systems problems in 2004 and 2006 .
Through our investigation to date , we have identified the following information with respect to the approximate number of payment cards for which unencrypted information was included in these files :
The report shows another table , a simpler one this time .
In 2006 , the numbers of cards that could have been stolen numbers in the tens of thousands , rather than in the millions .
This suggests to me that TJM was more aggressively purging transaction data and keeping far less card data online than before .
Much more narrative follows :
Customer names and addresses were not included with the payment card information in these files .
We do not believe that customer PINs were compromised .
Some of the payment card data contained in these files were encrypted ; we have not sought to decrypt these data .
In addition , the two files contained the personal ID numbers , together with the related names and / or addresses , of approximately 3,600 individuals , and we sent notice directly to these individuals .
We also have located a third file created in the ordinary course that we believe was stolen by the Intruder in 2006 and that we believe contained customer data .
All of the data in this file are encrypted , and we have not sought to decrypt them .
As previously publicly reported , we believe that in 2006 the Intruder may also have stolen from our Framingham system additional payment card , check and unreceipted merchandise return information for transactions made in our stores in the U.S. , Canada , and Puerto Rico ( excluding transactions at Bob ’s Stores and transactions made at Winners and HomeSense through the Interac network with debit cards issued by Canadian banks ) during portions of mid-May through December 18 , 2006 .
Through our investigation , we have identified approximately 100 files that we believe the Intruder , during this period , stole from our Framingham system ( the vast majority of which we believe the Intruder created ) and that we suspect included customer data .
However , due to the technology utilized by the Intruder , we are unable to determine the nature or extent of information included in these files .
Despite our masking and encryption practices on our Framingham system in 2006 , the technology utilized in the Computer Intrusion during 2006 could have enabled the Intruder to steal payment card data from our Framingham system during the payment card issuer ’s approval process , in which data ( including the track 2 data ) is transmitted to payment card issuer ’s without encryption .
Further , we believe that the Intruder had access to the decryption tool for the encryption software utilized by TJX .
The approximately 100 files stolen in 2006 could have included the data that we believe were stolen in 2005 , as well as other data relative to some customer transactions from December 31 , 2002 through mid-May 2006 , although , with respect to transactions after September 2 , 2003 generally without track 2 data , and , with respect to transactions after April 7 , 2004 , generally with all data encrypted .
In addition , as previously publicly reported , we suspect that customer data for payment card transactions at T.K.
Maxx stores in the U.K. and Ireland has been stolen .
In that regard , we now believe that at least two files of the approximately 100 files identified above that the Intruder stole from the Framingham system in 2006 were created by the Intruder and moved from the Watford system to the Framingham system .
We suspect that these files contained payment card transaction data , some or all of which could have been unencrypted and unmasked .
However , due to the technology utilized by the Intruder in the Computer Intrusion , we are unable to determine the nature or extent of information included in these files .
Further , the technology utilized by the Intruder in the Computer Intrusion during 2006 on the Watford system could also have enabled the Intruder to steal payment card data from the Watford system during the payment card issuer ’s approval process , in which data ( including the track 2 data ) are transmitted to payment card issuer ’s without encryption .
We have provided extensive payment card transaction information to the banks and payment card companies with which we contract as requested by them .
While we have been advised by law enforcement authorities that they are investigating fraudulent use of payment card information believed stolen from TJX , we do not know the extent of any fraudulent use of such information .
Some banks and payment card companies have advised us that they have found what they consider to be preliminary evidence of possible fraudulent use of payment card information that may have been stolen from us , but they have not shared with us the details of their preliminary findings .
We also do not know the extent of any fraudulent use of any of the personal information believed stolen .
Certain banks have sought , and other banks and payment card companies may seek , either directly against us or through claims against our acquiring banks as to which we may have an indemnity obligation , payment of or reimbursement for fraudulent card charges and operating expenses ( such as costs of replacing and / or monitoring payment cards thought by them to have been placed at risk by the Computer Intrusion ) that they believe they have incurred by reason of the Computer Intrusion .
In addition , payment card companies and associations may seek to impose fines by reason of the Computer Intrusion .
The report , above , mentions several times “ the technology utilized by the Intruder ” without being more specific .
In a 10 - K , this terminology is appropriate .
For the report to describe what SQL , ODBC , .NET , or command line interface was used to get the data would be far too much detail .
Still , my professional curiosity is piqued .
What technology * did* the intruder (s ) use ?
The portion of the 10 - K report on the intrusion continues and concludes :
Financial Costs .
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 , we recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $ 5 million , or $.01 per share , for costs incurred through the fourth quarter in connection with the Computer Intrusion , which includes costs incurred to investigate and contain the Computer Intrusion , strengthen computer security and systems , and communicate with customers , as well as technical , legal , and other fees .
Beyond this charge , we do not have enough information to reasonably estimate losses we may incur arising from the Computer Intrusion .
Various litigation has been or may be filed , and various claims have been or may be otherwise asserted , against us and / or our acquiring banks , on behalf of customers , banks , and / or card companies seeking damages allegedly arising out of the Computer Intrusion and other related relief .
We intend to defend such litigation and claims vigorously , although we cannot predict the outcome of such litigation and claims .
Various governmental entities are investigating the Computer Intrusion , and although we are cooperating in such investigations , we may be subject to fines or other obligations .
( See Item 3 with respect to litigation and investigations . )
Losses that we may incur as a result of the Computer Intrusion include losses arising out of claims by payment card associations and banks , customers , shareholders , governmental entities and others ; technical , legal , computer systems and other expenses ; and other potential liabilities , costs and expenses .
Such losses could be material to our results of operation and financial condition .
Above , the report mentions costs associated with strengthening computer security and systems .
Are these costs associated with bringing systems up to PCI standards , or beyond them ?
The report is not clear on this point .
Future Actions .
We are continuing our forensic investigation of the Computer Intrusion and our ongoing program to strengthen and protect our computer systems .
We are continuing to communicate with our customers about the Computer Intrusion .
We are continuing to cooperate with law enforcement in its investigation of these crimes and with the payment card companies and associations and our acquiring banks .
We are also continuing to cooperate with governmental agencies in their investigations of the Computer Intrusion .
We are vigorously defending the litigation and claims asserted against us with respect to the Computer Intrusion .
TJX may suffer more losses over the years and they may be material .
Well , that ’s a reasonable supposition .
The TJX intrusion is a watershed event to be sure , and could result in lawsuits the likes of which we have n’t seen in the past , as well as new legislation related to protection of financial information and remedies for failures .
Update : intruders probably broke in through WiFi by breaking WEP .
More here .
Longtime Democratic Party activist who had worked with Sens. Ed Muskie and George Mitchell recently sent me an intriguing email .
Despite his connection with these legendary mainstream Democrats , he was going to send $ 100 to the Dennis Kucinich campaign .
His note leads me not merely to consider following suit , but also to ask the more difficult question of why Kucinich enjoys the support of only a tiny percentage of likely voters in next year 's Democratic presidential primaries ?
When his name is mentioned , words like unelectable or radical come immediately to the lips of many people .
Yet why should our support for a candidate , even before the primaries , be premised merely on whether he or she can win ?
I am fully aware that in our first - past - the - post , winner - take - all electoral system , there is a tendency for both parties to converge on the " middle . "
But middle of what ?
Even when one considers all voters , Kucinich 's demand for immediate withdrawal from Iraq is the majority position .
A late September ABC - Washington
Post poll asked voters :
Do you think the United States should keep its military forces in Iraq until civil order is restored there , even if that means continued U.S. military casualties , or do you think the United States should withdraw its military forces from Iraq in order to avoid further U.S. military casualties , even if that means civil order is not restored there ?
Respondents gave withdrawal a 54 percent to 43 percent majority , a commitment that surely would be far stronger among likely Democratic primary voters .
Polling data also suggests that Kucinich 's views on other important issues resonate with large numbers of citizens .
He advocates extending a Medicare - like health benefit to all Americans , and he would have the U.S. withdraw from and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade agreements that have disproportionately benefited corporate interests .
Kucinich 's healthcare bill has 84 co-sponsors in the House , and his concerns about the biases in Clinton - era trade policies are , as even many Republicans admit , now typical of a large number of voters .
If voters and candidates are " triangulating " in quest of a middle position , it is not the middle of the electorate that they are seeking .
The goal of most Democratic candidates seems to be to keep some symbolic touch with the activist base of the party while retaining the good graces of both major media and wealthy contributors .
The established media have decided that anything other than a long withdrawal from Iraq , to be followed by maintenance of support bases , is " irresponsible . "
( This in spite of the fact that a majority of the citizens in this nation that we wish to democratize want us out and smaller majorities even support the use of violence to remove the U.S. presence . )
Thus even John Edwards , who admits his vote for the Iraq war was a mistake , cannot promise to remove troops before the end of the next presidential term .

The media with whom the first tier Democratic candidates seem to be triangulating have an immense stake in who becomes president and even in how campaigns are conducted .
The major media profit from health insurance and prescription drug ads , corporate trade deals that protect " intellectual property " but not their workers rights , and relaxation of rules on media consolidation .
Any candidate with the least challenge to these norms can easily be labeled " extreme , " a label too easily taken seriously even by citizens who often distrust the same media that hurl such labels .
The media also contribute to the inordinate focus on elections as about winning and losing .
How much major media time is spent on the horse - race aspect of campaigns versus the time devoted to explaining candidates ' positions ?
In addition , the most recent election cycle has been noteworthy for another unfortunate feature , the " money primary . "
I have seen far more reports on how much money the top three Democrats have raised than on their programs .
The implication of course is that money is a sign both of " seriousness " and " electability . "
Since media benefit from the expenditure of all this money on ads , they have little incentive to explore the implications of the money primary or to explain carefully individual candidates ' stands .
Perhaps any contribution to Kucinich is tilting after windmills , but triangulating toward the corporate center did not elect either Al Gore or John Kerry .
And if the result of the election is to give us a president eager to prove that she or he can be as tough as their predecessor , we may only be further along a road to disaster .
Basing a vote on the electability of a candidate , as determined in part by the media and the wealthy , is to play the role of spectator rather than political actor .
Contributions to a candidate whose views represent the mainstream of the Democratic Party might lead to unexpectedly positive results .
Electoral surprises might force top tier candidates to move closer to the base of the party , redefine the political center , and even make them more electable .
We will never know if we do n't try .

The actor Wesley Snipes has been sentenced to three years in prison for tax evasion .
The sentence is the maximum for willfully failing to file a tax return .
Snipes was cleared in February of five charges including fraud and conspiracy , but convicted on lesser charges of failure to file a tax return .
During the three years he failed to file a tax return , Snipes earned at least $ 13.8 m ( £ 7 m ) , prosecutors alleged , and would be liable for $ 2.7 m in taxes .
Snipes said he owed $ 228,000 .
The actor was not taken into custody yesterday .
The judge agreed to recommend that he be incarcerated close to his family home in New Jersey .
The 45 - year - old actor is best known for his starring role in the Blade films , as well as comedies such as White Men Ca n't Jump .
He has also appeared in several Spike Lee films .
Prosecutors had argued that Snipes should be sent to prison to set an example : " This case cries out for the statutory maximum term of imprisonment , as well as a substantial fine , because of the seriousness of defendant Snipes 's crimes and because of the singular opportunity this case presents to deter tax crimes nationwide , " they wrote .
Thirty - one of Snipes 's friends submitted character references in support of him .
" Wesley is like a tree - a mighty oak , " wrote Denzel Washington .
Woody Harrelson added : " It is an honour to call Wes my brother . "
Prosecutors , meanwhile , were less gushing .
They are convinced that Snipes - a " notorious " and " inveterate " offender - continues to hide money from federal and state tax authorities .
He reported having just $ 8,824 in a bank account , despite having disclosed assets of $ 25 m .
The following is part one of an eight - part interview with Dr. Michael Holick , author of " The UV advantage " and one of the world 's most respected authorities on vitamin D and the health benefits of natural sunlight .
His work can be found at www.UVadvantage.com .
Be sure to print out the vitamin D myths , facts and statistics page summarizing the key points of this interview .
Adams : Today we 're speaking with Dr Michael Holick , Thank you for joining us today Dr Holick .
Dr. Holick :
Oh , it 's my pleasure .
Adams :
For those who may not be familiar with your work and your website , can you give a brief introduction of what you cover and how you got into it ?
Dr. Holick : Sure , I 've been doing research in the vitamin D field for , now , more than 30 years , and I happened to be in the right place at the right time as a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin , and worked with one of the authorities in vitamin D , Dr. Hector DeLuca .
As a graduate student my PhD project was actually the isolation and identification of the active form of vitamin D , and my roommate and I , over the next two years , were the first to chemically synthesize it .
And what was really neat about that experience was that we actually gave this to patients when I was in medical school -- and patients that had bone diseases associated with kidney failure , that were wheelchair bound , that had severe bone pain started walking again .
That was my first introduction into one of the major benefits of activated vitamin D and the development of it for the treatment of a bone disease .
Adams :
Does this mean you and your colleague were the first to synthesize this form of vitamin D ?
Dr. Holick :
Yes , the active form of vitamin D that 's made by the kidney , it 's called 125 - dihydroxy vitamin D .
Adams :
Is this procedure more widely used now , for example to make vitamin D supplements ?
Dr. Holick :
No , because this active form of vitamin D is available only by prescription .
It 's used to treat osteoporosis in Europe and Japan .
And it 's also used to treat bone disease and kidney failure patients , and has a lot of other uses as well .
Adams :
So as you were doing the research on this , you were able to immediately observe the health impact of it , right away .
Dr. Holick : Exactly , and what we began to realize was that vitamin D was much more complex than thought .
We always knew that vitamin D was made in your skin when you are exposed to sunlight , but it was only in the 1970s that it was finally appreciated that it actually had to go on this circuitous journey , first to your liver to get hydroxylated , kind of activated , modified -- what 's called 25 - hydroxy vitamin D - it 's the major circulating form of vitamin D that doctors should be measuring in your blood to determine your vitamin D status .
But that is also inactive , and it has to go to your kidneys , and then in the kidneys it gets modified again , to its active form , which we call 125 - dihydroxy vitamin D .
And it's this 125 - dihydroxy vitamin D that 's responsible for telling your intestines to absorb calcium from your diet more efficiently , and to make sure that your blood calcium is normal and that you have healthy bones .
Adams :
So if there is a failure of any of these body systems along the chain , that can suppress the circulating active vitamin D then ?
Dr. Holick : Exactly , and in fact if you have severe liver disease , for example , you have two problems .
One is that you may not be able to modify it , to get the 25 - hydroxy vitamin D , and secondly if you have a fat malabsorption problem where you can't absorb dietary fat , since vitamin D is a fat - soluble vitamin , then you can't absorb vitamin D and you become deficient in vitamin D .
Then if you have any kind of kidney disease , you need either activated vitamin D or one its analogs in order to be able to maintain healthy bones .
Adams :
In the testing then that you mentioned , was this active form being given through injection ?
Dr. Holick :
You could either take it orally or by injections .
Adams : Interesting .
So you mentioned the positive impact on people who had trouble walking , who had osteoporosis , and various bone diseases .
What other effects did you observe ?
Dr. Holick :
We also realized a few years later was that your skin does n't only make vitamin D , which I think we 'll talk about a little bit more in a minute , but it also recognizes activated vitamin D .
And what was really , to me , quite amazing , was that in 1985 we realized the possibility that if you take activated vitamin D and put it in skin cells that you culture from humans , it turns out that activated vitamin D was probably one of the most potent inhibitors of skin cell growth .
So I reasoned back in 1985 that if that was true , maybe you could take advantage of it by developing it to treat the hyperproliferative skin disorder psoriasis .
And indeed it 's one of the treatments of choice now worldwide .
Both activated vitamin D and its analogs are used worldwide as the first line therapy for treating psoriasis .
And so again it shows you the breadth of activity that vitamin D has .
Not only just to regulate calcium metabolism and bone health , but to regulate cell growth .
And that 's why we started realizing that people who live in higher latitudes and are more prone to vitamin D deficiency and are more prone to developing common cancers and dying of them , such as cancer of the colon , prostate , breast and even ovaries .
And we think that that 's in part due to the body 's inability to make enough activated vitamin D to help regulate cell growth and to keep cell growth in check .
Adams :
That would explain the links between breast cancer , prostate cancer , colon cancer and vitamin D deficiency .
Dr. Holick : Exactly .
And then the key factor that we found was that , as I mentioned to you originally , we realized that the kidney was the major source of the activation of vitamin D .
And the function of that is to make activated vitamin D for bone health .
But we now also know that the prostate , breast , colon and many other tissues in the body can also activate vitamin D .
And by doing so , we think that it locally produces this 125 - dihydroxy vitamin D , which then regulates cell growth .
It 's a cell growth modulator .
And I spell all this out in my book " The UV advantage " at www.UVadvantage.com
A Letter to Thomas F. Bayard Challenging his right — and that of all the other so - called senators and representatives in Congress — to exercise any legislative power whatever over the people of the United States .
To Thomas F. Bayard , of Delaware : ( 3 ¶ 1 )
Sir — I have read your letter to Rev. Lyman Abbott , in which you express the opinion that it is at least possible for a man to be a legislator ( under the Constitution of the United States ) and yet be an honest man . ( 3 ¶ 2 )
This proposition implies that you hold it to be at least possible that some four hundred men should , by some process or other , become invested with the right to make laws of their own — that is , laws wholly of their own device , and therefore necessarily distinct from the law of nature , of the principles of natural justice ; and that these laws of their own making shall be really and truly obligatory upon the people of the United States ; and that , therefore , the people may rightfully be compelled to obey them . ( 3 ¶ 3 )
All this implies that you are of the opinion that the Congress of the United States , of which you are a member , has by some process or other , become possessed of some right of arbitrary dominion over the people of the United States ; which right of arbitrary dominion is not given by , and is , therefore , necessarily in conflict with , the law of nature , the principles of natural justice , and the natural rights of men , as individuals .
All this is necessarily implied in the idea that the Congress now possesses any right whatever to make any laws whatever , of its own device — that is , any laws that shall be either more , less , or other than that natural law , which it can neither make , unmake , nor alter — and cause them to be enforced upon the people of the United States , or any of them , against their will . ( 3 ¶ 4 )
You assume that the right of arbitrary dominion — that is , the right of making laws of their own device , and compelling obedience to them — is a " trust " that has been delegated to those who now exercise that power .
You call it the trust of public power . ( 3 ¶ 5 )
But , Sir , you are mistaken in supposing that any such power has ever been delegated , or ever can be delegated , by any body , to any body . ( 3 ¶ 6 )
Any such delegation of power is naturally impossible , for these reasons , viz : ( 3 ¶ 7 )
No man can delegate , or give to another , any right of arbitrary dominion over himself ; for that would be giving himself away as a slave .
And this no one can do .
Any contract to do so is necessarily an absurd one , and has no validity .
To call such a contract a constitution , or by any other high - sounding name , does not alter its character as an absurd and void contract .
( 3 ¶ 8 ) No man can delegate , or give to another , any right of arbitrary dominion over a third person ; for that would imply a right in the first person , not only to make the third person his slave , but also a right to dispose of him as a slave to still other persons .
Any contract to do this is necessarily a criminal one , and therefore invalid .
To call such a contract a constitution does not at all lessen its criminality , or add to its validity . ( 3 ¶ 9 )
These facts , that no man can delegate , or give away , his own natural right to liberty , nor any other man 's natural right to liberty , prove that he can delegate no right of arbitrary dominion whatever — or , what is the same thing , no legislative power whatever — over himself or anybody else , to any man , or body of men . ( 3 ¶ 10 )
This impossibility of any man 's delegating any legislative power whatever , necessarily results from the fact that the law of nature has drawn the line — and that , too , a line that can never be effaced nor removed — between each man 's own interest and inalienable rights of person and property , and each and every other man 's inherent and inalienable rights of person and property .
It , therefore , necessarily fixes the unalterable limits , within which every man may rightfully seek his own happiness , in his own way , free from all responsibility to , or interference by , his fellow men , or any of them . ( 3 ¶ 11 )
All this pretended delegation of legislative power — that is , of a power , on the part of the legislators , so - called , to make any laws of their own device , distinct from the law of nature — is therefore an entire falsehood ; a falsehood whose only purpose is to cover and hide a pure usurpation , by one body of men , of arbitrary dominion over other men . ( 3 ¶ 12 )
That this legislative power , or power of arbitrary dominion , is a pure usurpation , on the part of those who now exercise it , and not a trust delegated to them , is still further proved by the fact that the only delegation of power , that is even professed or pretended to be made , is made secretly — that is , by secret ballot — and not in any open and authentic manner ; and therefore not by any men , or body of men , who make themselves personally responsible , as principals , for the acts of those to whom they profess to delegate the power .
( 3 ¶ 13 )
All this pretended delegation of power having been made secretly — that is , only by secret ballot — not a single one of all the legislators , so - called , who profess to be exercising only a delegated power , has himself any legal knowledge , or can offer any legal proof , as to who the particular individuals were who delegated it to him .
And having no power to identify the individuals who professed to delegate the power to him , he cannot show any legal proof that anybody ever even attempted or pretended to delegate it to him .
( 3 ¶ 14 )
Plainly , a man who exercises any arbitrary dominion over other men and who claims to be exercising only a delegated power , but cannot show who his principals are , nor , consequently , prove that he has any principals , must be presumed , both in law and reason , to have no principals ; and therefore to be exercising no power but his own .
And having , of right , no such power of his own , he is , both in law and reason , a naked usurper . ( 3 ¶ 15 )
Sir , a secret ballot makes a secret government ; and a secret government is a government by conspiracy ; in which the people at large can have no rights .
And that is the only government we now have .
It is the government of which you are a voluntary member and supporter , and yet you claim to be an honest man .
If you are an honest man , is not your honesty that of a thoughtless , ignorant man , who merely drifts with the current , instead of exercising any judgement of his own ? ( 3 ¶ 16 )
For still another reason , all legislators , so - called , under the Constitution of the United States , are exercising simply an arbitrary and irresponsible dominion of their own ; and not any authority that has been delegated , or pretended to have been delegated , to them .
And that reason is that the Constitution itself ( Article 1 , Section 6 ) prescribes that : —( 3 ¶ 17 )
For any speech or debate ( or vote ) in either house , they ( the Senators and Representatives ) shall not be questioned ( held to any legal responsibility ) in any other place .
( 3 ¶ 18 )
This provision makes the legislators constitutionally irresponsible to anybody ; either to those on whom they exercise their power , or to those who may have , either openly or secretly , attempted or pretended to delegate power to them .
And men who are legally responsible to nobody for their acts , cannot truly be said to be the agents of any body , or to be exercising any power but their own ; for all real agents are necessarily responsible both to those on whom they act , and to those for whom they act . ( 3 ¶ 19 )
To say that the people of this country ever have bound , or ever could bind , themselves by any contract whatever — the Constitution , or any other — to thus give away all their natural rights of property , liberty , and life , into the hands of a few men — a mere conclave — and that they should make it a part of the contract itself that these few men should be held legally irresponsible for the disposal they should make of those rights , is an utter absurdity .
It is to say that they have bound themselves , and that they could bind themselves , by an utterly idiotic and suicidal contract . ( 3 ¶ 20 )
If such a contract had ever been made by one private individual to another , and had been signed , sealed , witnessed , acknowledged , and delivered , with all possible legal formalities , no decent court on earth — certainly none in this country — would have regarded it , for a moment , as conveying any right , or delegating any power , or as having the slightest legal validity , or obligation .
( 3 ¶ 21 )
For all the reasons now given , and for still others that might be given , the legislative power now exercised by Congress is , in both law and reason , a purely personal , arbitrary , irresponsible , usurped dominion on the part of the legislators themselves , and not a power delegated to them by anybody . ( 3 ¶ 22 )
Yet under the pretense that this instrument gives them the right of an arbitrary and irresponsible dominion over the whole people of the United States , Congress has now gone on , for ninety years and more , filling great volumes with laws of their own device , which the people at large have never read , nor even seen nor ever will read or see ; and of whose legal meanings it is morally impossible that they should ever know anything .
Congress has never dared to require the people even to read these laws .
Had it done so , the oppression would have been an intolerable one ; and the people , rather than endure it , would have either rebelled , and overthrown the government , or would have fled the country .
Yet these laws , which Congress has not dared to require the people even to read , it has compelled them , at the point of the bayonet , to obey .
( 3 ¶ 23 )
And this moral , and legal , and political monstrosity is the kind of government which Congress claims that the Constitution authorizes it to impose upon the people .
( 3 ¶ 24 )
Sir , can you say that such an arbitrary and irresponsible dominion as this , over the properties , liberties , and lives of fifty millions of people — or even over the property , liberty , or life of any one of those fifty millions — can be justified on any reason whatever ?
If not , with what color of truth can you say that you yourself , or anybody else , can act as a legislator , under the Constitution of the United States , and yet be an honest man ? ( 3 ¶ 25 )
To say that the arbitrary and irresponsible dominion , that is exercised by Congress , has been delegated to it by the Constitution , and not solely by the secret ballots of the voters for the time being , is the height of absurdity ; for what is the Constitution ?
It is , at best , a writing that was drawn up more than ninety years ago ; was assented to at the time only by a small number of men ; generally those few white male adults who had prescribed amounts of property ; probably not more than two hundred thousand in all ; or one in twenty of the whole population .
( 3 ¶ 26 )
Those men have been long since dead .
They never had any right of arbitrary dominion over even their contemporaries ; and they never had any over us .
Their wills or wishes have no more rightful authority over us , than have the wills or wishes of men who lived before the flood .
They never personally signed , sealed , acknowledged , or delivered , or dared to sign , seal , acknowledge , or deliver , the instrument which they imposed upon the country as law .
They never , in any open and authentic manner , bound even themselves to obey it , or made themselves personally responsible for the acts of their so - called agents under it , They had no natural right to impose it , as law , upon a single human being .
The whole proceeding was a pure usurpation . ( 3 ¶ 27 )
In practice , the Constitution has been an utter fraud from the beginning .
Professing to have been ordained and established by we , the people of the United States , it has never been submitted to them , as individuals , for their voluntary acceptance or rejection .
They have never been asked to sign , seal , acknowledge , or deliver it , as their free act and deed .
They have never signed , sealed , acknowledged , or delivered it , or promised , or laid themselves under any kind of obligation , to obey it .
Very few of them have ever read , or even seen it ; or ever will read or see it .
Of its legal meaning ( if it can be said to have any ) they really know nothing ; and never did , nor ever will , know anything .
( 3 ¶ 28 )
Why is it , Sir , that such an instrument as the Constitution , for which nobody has been responsible , and of which few persons have ever known anything , has been suffered to stand , for the last ninety years , and to be used for such audacious and criminal purposes ?
It is solely because it has been sustained by the same kind of conspiracy as that by which it was established ; that is , by the wealth and the power of those few who were to profit by the arbitrary dominion it was assumed to give them over others .
While the poor , the weak , and the ignorant , who were to be cheated , plundered , and enslaved by it , have been told , and some of them doubtless made to believe , that it is a sacred instrument , designed for the preservation of their rights . ( 3 ¶ 29 )
These cheated , plundered , and enslaved persons have been made to feel , if not to believe , that the Constitution had such miraculous power , that it could authorize the majority ( or even a plurality ) of the male adults , for the time being — a majority numbering at this time , say , five millions in all — to exercise , through their agents , secretly appointed , an arbitrary and irresponsible dominion over the properties , liberties , and lives of the whole fifty millions ; and that these fifty millions have no rightful alternative but to submit all their rights to this arbi- trary dominion , or suffer such confiscation , imprisonment , or death as this secretly appointed , irresponsible cabal , of so - called legislators , should see fit to resort to for the maintenance of its power . ( 3 ¶ 30 )
As might have been expected , and as was , to a large degree , at least , intended , this Constitution has been used from the beginning by ambitious , rapacious , and unprincipled men , to enable them to maintain , at the point of the bayonet , an arbitrary and irresponsible dominion over those who were too ignorant and too weak to protect themselves against the conspirators who had thus combined to deceive , plunder , and enslave them . ( 3 ¶ 31 )
Do you really think , Sir , that such a constitution as this can avail to justify those who , like yourself , are engaged in enforcing it ?
Is it not plain , rather , that the members of Congress , as a legislative body , whether they are conscious of it or not , are in reality , a mere cabal of swindlers , usurpers , tyrants and robbers ?
Is it not plain that they are stupendous blockheads , if they imagine that they are anything else than such a cabal ?
Or that their so - called laws impose the least obligation upon anybody ? ( 3 ¶ 32 )
If you have never before looked at this matter in this light , I ask you to do so now .
And in the hope to aid you in doing so candidly , and to some useful purpose , I take the liberty to mail for you a pamphlet entitled : ( 3 ¶ 33 )
In this pamphlet , I have endeavored to controvert distinctly the proposition that , by any possible process whatever , any man , or body of men , can become possessed of any right of arbitrary dominion over other men , or other men's property ; or , consequently , any right whatever to make any law whatever , of their own — distinct from the law of nature — and compel any other men to obey it .
( 3 ¶ 35 )
I trust I need not suspect you , as a legislator under the Constitution , and claiming to be an honest man , of any desire to evade the issue presented in this pamphlet .
If you shall see fit to meet it , I hope you will excuse me for suggesting that — to avoid verbiage , and everything indefinite — you give at least a single specimen of a law that either heretofore has been made , or that you conceive it possible for legislators to make — that is , some law of their own device — that either has been , or shall be , really and truly obligatory upon other persons , and which such other persons have been , or may be , rightfully compelled to obey .
( 3 ¶ 36 )
If you can either find or devise any such law , I trust you will make it known , that it may be examined , and the question of its obligation be fairly settled in the popular mind . ( 3 ¶ 37 )
But if it should happen that you can neither find such a law in the existing statute books of the United States , nor , in your own mind , conceive of such a law as possible under the Constitution , I give you leave to find it , if that be possible , in the constitution or statute book of any other people that now exist , or ever have existed , on the earth .
( 3 ¶ 38 )
If , finally , you shall find no such law , anywhere , nor be able to conceive of any such law yourself , I take the liberty to suggest that it is your imperative duty to submit the question to your associate legislators ; and , if they can give no light on the subject , that you call upon them to burn all the existing statute books of the United States , and then to go home and content themselves with the exercise of only such rights and powers as nature has given to them in common with the rest of mankind . ( 3 ¶ 39 )

This blog has had a long and sordid history with the more ardent supporters of Ron Paul , as clearly evidenced in the comments to this post from yesterday .
Over the months leading up to the primaries and throughout the primaries , I ’ve seen that those enthusiastic Paul supporters have often found it difficult to believe that Ron Paul ’s support was as limited as some of the national polls indicated , largely because Ron Paul dominated straw polls , both online and offline .
They came up with several reasons for this apparent lack of support :
1. Media bias —
If the media does n’t give Ron Paul any airtime , how could his support improve ?
2. Polling bias —
If polls do n’t mention his name , or do n’t call the “ youth ” without land - lines , or only registered Republicans , can they be trusted ?
3. Diebold —
Those pesky electronic voting machines are paid for by people who are anti-Paul
4. Election fraud —
The system of neocons will silence those who speak truth to power
5. Illuminati/Bilderberger /etc —
The people who really control everything wo n’t let him ascend
Inherent in these excuses is a consistent belief that Ron Paul is actually winning the hearts and minds ( and thus the election ) , but that the system is so incredibly corrupt and fraudulent that he is being kept down by those above .
With this , the following point is clear : the system is no longer to be trusted , and if Ron Paul does not become President , it is an indication that the system has been hijacked by people who will not allow it to be fixed .
What does this mean ?
It means that these Paul supporters , who have committed themselves to the rEVOLution , are up against a wall .
They ’re faced with a question :
“ If the democratic process no longer works and has been subverted , what are you going to do about it ? ”
Those of us who do n’t believe that Ron Paul is being denied his rightful place in the Oval Office by nefarious henchmen suggest that the next step is for those Paul supporters to join a wider liberty movement , and carry the torch that Ron Paul has ignited farther than he could ever do himself .
But for those who have placed their faith in the man himself , the fact that he ’s been bested by statists like John McCain is a fact that cannot stand .
There are only two options : agorism , or rebellion .
The choice is simple .
The system is flawed , and must be destroyed .
Agorism is the attempt to do so , through extricating oneself from the system and working to establish an alternate system in parallel .
The end goal is that legitimacy in the establishment will fail , and at the same time the agorists will have created a viable alternative .
The system thus withers away .
Rebellion , of course , is much more clear : the taking up of arms against the established system .
I would think , of course , that this is a ticket to either a penitentiary or a morgue .
But for those who believe that the true support for Ron Paul greatly exceeds what appears in polls , such a rebellion would be too large to be quashed .
So the question still stands .
For those truly adamant Ron Paul supporters who believe that he deserves to lead this country , and cannot accept the fact that he will not be President in November , what are you going to do about it ?
Our source who played with the 3G iPhone told us explicitly there is no front - facing videoconferencing camera .
Even still , when we were ferreting around the new 3G iPhone firmware today , we were keeping an eye out for altered or additional camera drivers , something to indicate a front - facing camera .
Nothing .
The text explanation for Exchange and iChat are so bad as to make the whole thing unbelievable .
( Apple 's doing video chat for Windows ?
Huh ? )
But that 's not all !
Say , would n't that exchange logo be in the Apple banner that 's up at the Moscone right now ?
All the other iPhone icons are .
No Apple design would be laid out the way this guy 's got his page laid out here .
Did we mention that the red design on the right is missing the power button ?
( Thanks everybody ! )
Bottom line : looks pretty , but so very fake .
It 's a few days before a big Apple event , and you know what that means : a ridiculous amount of really bad fake Apple product shots .
Actually , you have to hand it to this first guy , pictured above .
It 's mildly convincing and sites are starting to pick it up -- the story goes some dude grabbed these pics from a Photoshop template his friend was working on and then posted it to Flickr , a scenario reminiscent of those iPod nano phatty shots that turned out to be real .
Except there are a few issues with this one :
Click on to see the other one going around right now , a supposed opened box from a confidential 3G iPhone shipment .
Uh huh .
[ Thanks to everyone who sent these in ]
Ouch .
AMR corp just announced that they ’re going to start charging for the first checked bag on all of their American Airlines and American Eagle flights , effective for tickets purchased on or after June 15 .
And so ends the era of free checked baggage on airlines .
I wonder how long it will be before the other major airlines follow suit ?
I can already see the ruckus of carry - on baggage now .
Right after the liquids ban , I remember getting on aircraft and seeing nearly empty overhead compartments — everyone wanted to check their luggage so that they could bring their 10 oz toothpaste with them .
Things gradually returned to normal loads as people have adapted to the 100 ml rule .
Now , since nobody wants to pay an extra 15 $ , everyone is going to want to bring their luggage aboard , overhead compartments are going to jam up , people with giant luggage are going to clog up space and passengers are going to get testy .
Of course the new rule does n’t apply to elites , but as several people on the underground pointed out , it really affects everyone on the aircraft .
If the overhead compartments are full and the flight spends an extra 15 minutes on the ground sorting out luggage issues and appeasing passengers , the entire plane is late , right ?

it 's a myth .
except when referring to flaccid states , which is probably the source of the mythology ( most men see other mens ' penises when flaccid ) .
asian men have smaller flaccid penises , african men bigger , and euro - caucasions are in the middle .
the " purest " genotypical asians are found in mongolia , where it 's very cold .
east asians are genetically adapted to dealing with a harshly cold climate , which is why they have epithentric folds in their eyelids and more fat tissue in their faces ( both of which help insulate heat ) .
amongst these heat - conserving physical traits is having their penises shrink up ( like what happens when in cold water ) when " not in use " .
people of african descent are genetically adapted to living in hot sunny climates , which is why they have more melanin in their skin ( blocks UV rays ) , and are more likely to have a low body fat percentage .
there 's no need for their penises to contract for heat conservation .
and euro - caucasions are somewhere inbetween in terms of their genetic adaptation to heat / cold .
race is not a factor in erect penis sizes .
the whole " black=big " , " asian=small " myth is also rascist in nature , in that it implies that all black men are wild sex - obsessed animals and asian men are asexual and unmasculine ( both these concepts are widely projected in our media & culture in many forms other than penis size ) .
the proof this is inherently rascist is the common belief of the remaining race 's penis size ... " in white men there 's variety " .
some other interesting notes on this : purely statistically speaking , asian men have slightly shorter penises , but not because of race , but because of height .
it would be more accurate to say that , generally speaking , shorter men have slightly shorter penises .
there is evidence of a VERY SLIGHT correlation between penis length and body height , and on average , asian men are shorter than caucasion and african men .
one note about this : asians are not genetically short ... it 's primarily a result of traditional asian diets ( during childhood ) which lack the dairy and protein prevalent in western diets .
it is also because of this meat & dairy lacking diet that asian americans are less likely to develop heart disease or hypertension .
also , the slight difference in penis size due to short vs. average height is menial ( around half an inch ) .
according to most surveys , caucasions have larger penises than black men , which is probably due to the height correlation .
in the U.S. , white men are on average taller than black men , which is probably due to economic factors ( wealth affects childhood nutrition , which affects height ) .
most men's concern about penis size is more about unconscious male - to - male competition issues than it is about attracting / pleasing women ( my theory , at least ) .
according to one survey , a large percentage of black men in western countries with average sized penises believe they are well endowed .
an effect of the projected mythology ?
or maybe a result of shower room flaccid comparisons .
a possible early source of the black penis mythology was a sensationalized and widely spread report by a victorian era british anthropologist that found an african man in ethiopia with a 10 inch penis .
i remember reading somewhere that there 's an ethnic group in east africa which is known for having longer than average penises .
many straight male porn stars have only slightly bigger than average penises , and are shorter than average , which makes their penises look relatively big .
watch for when they stand up next to the woman.using penis pumps may result in erection problems ( bigger penis tissue , but same amount of blood to fill it ) .
in my own personal experiences , women are horribly inaccurate when they guess the size of a lover from memory .
they usually overguess by an inch or so .
especially if he was good in bed ( a sad commentary ) .
and i've saved the best for last ... in most penis size surveys in which the men self - measure , the average erect length comes to around just over 6 inches .
in a survey in which a third party did the measuring , the average erect length came out as just over 5 inches .
and if anyone 's wondering how the hell i know all this , it 's because i was going to make a documentary film on the american male 's obsession with penis size ( but i went flaccid on the idea ) .
long live the penis .
my MC : that beautiful girl who walks down hayes in the morning who looks super hot in her red pants .
