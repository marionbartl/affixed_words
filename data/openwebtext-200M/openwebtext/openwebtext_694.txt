Two new Marist polls of Virginia and Colorado were released today , and each poll shows Barack Obama leading John McCain .
In Colorado , Obama leads McCain 52 % - 43 % with registered voters and 51 % - 45 % with likely voters .
In Virginia , Obama leads 49 % - 43 % with registered voters and 51 % - 47 % with likely voters .
In Colorado , 44 % of those surveyed said that they already have cast their ballots .
Obama ’s lead with is mostly due to the early voters , when they are taken out of the numbers , the candidates are tied at 46 % with likely voters .
Independents are behind Obama in a big way in state .
By a margin of 58%-35 % , Independents are supporting Obama .
Eighty four percent of those surveyed said that they are strongly committed to their candidate .
Eighty eight percent of Obama supporters and eighty four percent of the McCain supporters described themselves as firmly committed .
Both candidates have positive approval numbers , Obama ’s is 56 % , and McCain ’s is 51 % .
Joe Biden has a 51 % positive rating , and Sarah Palin is still the least popular candidate in this race with a 46 % positive rating .

In Virginia , the race is closer because Independents are supporting John McCain .
Independents are favoring McCain 54 % - 42 % .
However Obama is offsetting some of this advantage , by picking up 11 % of the Republican support in the state , compared to 6 % of Democratic support for John McCain .
Only 2 % of registered voters who were polled said that they might change their minds before election .
Eighty five percent of registered voters said that they are firmly committed to their candidate .
Eighty eight percent of Obama supporters and eighty two percent of McCain supporters describe themselves as firmly committed .
Obama has a high positive rating of 61 % compared to 54 % for McCain .
Joe Biden has a 53 % positive rating , while Sarah Palin splits those surveyed , 47 % positive , and 46 % negative .
However , Independents give Palin a 52 % positive rating .
I think Colorado is likely to go to Obama , but McCain must have Virginia , and that race looks like a dead heat .
There are positives in the numbers for both candidates .
Like North Carolina and Florida , the results in Virginia will probably hinge on how well Obama gets his vote out .
Without an influx of new Democrats , this is probably a 50/50 race .
The built in advantage for Obama is in demographics , but he could win or lose the state depending on turnout .

Maddow : New rule kicks Patriot
Act foes ' right in the teeth ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday November 12 , 2008

The Bush administration has been planning since last spring to issue a final burst of federal regulations just before leaving office .
It was recently announced that over 90 new regulations would be finalized before November 22 -- 60 days prior to the end of Bush 's term -- making them difficult , though not impossible , for President Obama to reverse .
Although many of the regulations have to do with energy and the environment , MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow noted on Tuesday that there 's also " one that 'll kick opponents of the Patriot Act right in the teeth . "
The proposed regulation " would allow state and local law enforcement agencies to collect intelligence on individuals and organizations even if the information is unrelated to any criminal matter , " Maddow explained .
She added , " Even if they were n't already watching you -- they soon could be . "
Maddow was joined by the Nation 's sports correspondent , Dave Zirin , who began by complaining about Bush , " Hemorrhoids are more popular than this man .
Why is he making laws ? "
Zirin described how he had been involved in an episode where " the Maryland State Police sent people to infiltrate meetings I was in -- a very seditious organization called the Campaign to End the Death Penalty , where we planned such horrifying acts like tabling at the local farmer 's market or planning rallies . "
" Why were they spying on us ? " Zirin continued .
" Because the governor at the time , Bob Ehrlich -- a right - wing Republican who makes Sarah Palin look like Emma Goldman -- I mean , he 's somebody who saw us as political opponents .
He was for the death penalty , we were against the death penalty , therefore in his mind we deserved to be spied upon . "
" We were entered into a database the heading of which was ' Terrorists / Anti-Government , ' " Zirin noted angrily .
" The person who organized all of this , the head of the Maryland State Police ... called us ' fringe people ' in the hearings .
He said we deserved it because we were fringe people . ' "
Zirin pointed out that the final report which exposed the state 's anti-constitutional behavior recommended future safeguards but held no one accountable .
" We either have a Constitution or we do n't , " he stated .
" Either our rights were violated or they were n't . "
" They 're talking about expanding this nationwide , " Maddow commented , " and what they will say in order to argue for it is , ' Oh , what 's the harm done ? ' "
" Here 's the harm , " Zirin replied .
" It has a chilling effect on the Constitution .
It has a chilling effect on our ability to assemble .
...
We need to be welcoming new people into community activism , welcoming new people into struggle .
And what you have instead is people looking at each other in Maryland as if , ' Is that person an enemy ?
Is this person a plant ? ' "
" And it has a horrible effect , " concluded Zirin , " right at a time where in the wake of the Obama victory we should be talking about solidarity , we should be talking about expanding our forces , we should be talking about fighting for the change that we all waited on line to vote for . "

Via Good as
You we see that Focus on the Family has produced an ad “ that is airing through the end of the year on CBS , ABC , NBC , Fox and other stations ” in which a character named Fred is “ thanked by complete strangers everywhere he goes ” and is supposed to “ represent the work the constituents [ i.e. donors ] have done for Focus on the Family . ”
Since Good as
You has already posted the video of the ad , we wo n’t bother to capture it and post it here , but its message is that “ by supporting Focus on the Family , Fred is helping a lot of families thrive .
So follow Fred ’s example and go to ThanksFred.com and follow Fred ’s example .
Imagine how many people you ’ll be helping . ”
If you go to Focus ’s new website , here ’s what you see :
If you click on the “ Relationship & Marriage ” or “ Social Issues ” links on the left , you get a sense of just what sort of right - wing anti-gay , anti-abortion programs Focus “ constituents ” are funding with their donations :
And if you take a look at Focus ’s “ Helping Families Thrive ” report [ PDF ] you get a pretty good sense of how they are using their various outreach programs to promote their right - wing agenda :
Focus on the Family ’s mission statement is “ to cooperate with the Holy Spirit in sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ with as many people as possible by nurturing and defending the God- ordained institution of the family and promoting biblical truths worldwide . ”
SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE ­ The Sanctity of Human Life Outreach is based on the belief that all human life is created in God ’s image and is of inestimable worth and significance in all its dimensions .
With this in mind , the Sanctity of Human Life division has integrated several initiatives .
OPTION ULTRASOUND PROGRAM
Tens of millions of pre-born babies have been lost to abortion since the Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973 .
Research has shown that women who have the opportunity to see their babies via an ultrasound image are far less likely to choose abortion than those who have never viewed the new life growing inside their womb .
Since the launch of our Option Ultrasound Program in 2004 , Focus on the Family has equipped hundreds of pregnancy medical clinics ( PMCs ) in 49 states , with plans to place a total of 650 ultrasound services by 2010 .
Tens of thousands of babies have been saved through medical PMCs offering a combination of ultrasound and counseling services from the inception of the program through the end of 2008 .
I.M.P.A.C.T. TRAINING Focus on the Family is conducting I.M.P.A.C.T. Training , which helps PMCs become Influential , Medical , Professional , Accountable , Culturally relevant and Trustworthy .
By providing comprehensive education for leadership teams and board members of medical PMCs in high - abortion areas , these clinics are equipped to improve organizational strength and outcomes in reaching women at risk for abortion .
IMPACTING HIGH -ABORTION COMMUNITIES
Focus on the Family has strategically focused its efforts to impact high - abortion communities through pregnancy medical resource centers as well as other impact partners and organizations .
­ This will increase life decisions within the most abortion - prone areas , such as minority communities .
GLOBAL ABSTINENCE OUTREACH
Focus on the Family ’s character - based abstinence curriculum , No Apologies : ­ The Truth About Life , Love and Sex , has reached more than 2 million students around the globe !
­
This video and curriculum program promotes sexual abstinence before marriage and fidelity after marriage as the only true forms of “ safe sex . ” LOVE WON OUT Focus on the Family ’s Love Won Out ( LWO ) ministry exhorts and equips the church to respond in a Christlike way to the issue of homosexuality .
To those who struggle with unwanted same - sex attractions , we offer the gospel hope that these desires can be overcome .
In short , the LWO team strives to uphold God ’s design for sexuality in a way that transforms both individual lives and the wider culture .
To this end , LWO offers five annual one - day conferences in the United States that seek to educate and empower parents , family members , ministry leaders , educators , counselors , policy - makers and other interested individuals .
­
The goal is to reach out lovingly with uncompromised faith — in compassion and grace — to a loved one who deals with homosexuality .
In addition , conferences are now being held in international locations in conjunction with Focus on the Family international affiliate offices .
Coupled with the conference schedule , the LWO team also engages in a high number of media and public speaking opportunities throughout the year , each with the goal of spreading the redemptive biblical message of hope to a cynical and permissive culture that readily dismisses the transforming power of Christ .
Of course , Focus does n’t bother to mention their core mission of “ promoting biblical truths worldwide ” in their new advertising campaign , instead choosing to downplay their right - wing cultural and political agenda in order to dupe television viewers into believing that a donation to the organization will merely help “ families thrive . ”
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - A church has vanished from the Russian village where it stood for almost 200 years , the local diocese said Tuesday .
The Church of Christ ’s Resurrection , in the central Russian village of Komarovo , was built in 1809 but in early October someone took it away brick by brick , Father Vitaly a spokesman for the local Russian Orthodox Church , told Reuters .
“ We have sent a letter to local prosecutors , ” he said .
“ Who exactly did this , the investigation will show . ”
The church was in an isolated area only occasionally visited by clergymen , so the disappearance was not immediately noticed .
Komarovo is in the Ivanovo region , about 300 km ( 186.4 miles ) north - east of Moscow .
The church was not in use but clergy had been considering resuming services there , the Ivanovo - Voznesenskaya and Kineshemskaya diocese said in a statement on its Internet site .
A survey of the large , two - storey church a few months ago found that it was structurally sound , but now all that remains are the foundations and sections of walls , the statement said .
Thieves routinely make off with church property in rural Russia , where unemployment , petty crime and alcoholism are widespread .
Criminals target religious icons stored in churches because they can fetch a good price , and church buildings are dismantled to provide building materials .
“ This is not an isolated case , ” said Father Vitaly .
“ In many villages in central Russia sites of historical interest are being dismantled and people suffer by being deprived of their cultural heritage . ”

Fears that Colombia 's Nobel prize winning author , Gabriel García Márquez , had put down his pen forever were allayed yesterday when a close friend confirmed that the 82 - year - old master of magical realism was working on a new novel .
García Márquez 's next book will be a love story , though his friend and fellow writer Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza said that the author was struggling to come up with a version that he was happy with .
" He has four versions of it , " Apuleyo said .
" He told me that he was now trying to get the best from each of them . "
Apuleyo , who co-wrote a book of conversations with García Márquez called The Smell of the Guava Tree in 1982 , said the Nobel prizewinner had become hugely self - critical and demanding of himself .
Two years ago , García Márquez said : " I 've stopped writing ... 2005 was the first year in my life that I did n't write a line . "
He admitted , though , that his problem was one of enthusiasm rather than inspiration .
" With all the practice I 've got , I 'd have no problems writing a new novel , " he explained .
" But people notice if you have n't put your heart into it . "
Apuleyo said García Márquez described his year without writing as " a sabbatical " , during which he had devoted his time to reading .
Rumours that the author of One Hundred Years of Solitude was close to finishing a new novel began circulating earlier this year .
The Carmen Balcells literary agency , which represents him , said yesterday the author had not yet set a publication date for any new novel .
" There is nothing , for the moment , " a spokeswoman said .
García Márquez 's last novel , Memories of my Melancholy Whores , was published in 2004 .
He is also said to be preparing a second volume of memoirs to follow Living to Tell the Tale , published in 2002 .
Workers occupy auto parts plant in northern Germany
By Lucas Adler
12 December 2008
On December 5 , about 100 employees of the bankrupt auto parts supplier HWU occupied their factory in the small town of Hohenlockstedt , north of Hamburg .
The workers are determined to defend their jobs and prevent the planned closure of the plant at the end of the year .
The workers ’ union , IG Metall , is attempting to end the factory occupation following complaints from union bureaucrats at a major auto manufacturer that the action was threatening to disrupt production at that other firm .
HWU produces parts for catalytic converters , steering wheels and door locks .
In June 2008 , HWU was sold by its parent company , the Vollmann Group , to Horst Strodtkötter , a former employee at the factory .
The workforce only learned of their new owner June 30 , at a factory meeting that the new managing director did not attend .
Then six weeks ago , on October 29 , Strodtkötter informed the workforce that HWU was bankrupt and unable to pay their wages in October .
Strodtkötter declared that a 30 percent drop in orders resulting from the current crisis in the automotive industry had driven the company into bankruptcy .
The workers reacted at that time with a spontaneous 24 - hour occupation of the premises .
Their main concern was to prevent the removal of any parts or machinery that would make further production at the factory impossible .
Following the declaration of a bankruptcy administrator that the company had sufficient orders , and that the outstanding wages could be paid out of insolvency funds ( Insolvenzgeld - - money paid by the government to workers at bankrupt firms , out of a levy on the owners ) , the employees returned to work .
Since then the workforce has been kept completely in the dark about any further developments .
There was no further information on the future of the factory from either the managing director or the bankruptcy trustee .
When it was announced last week that at the end of the year the insolvency funds would be exhausted , workers reoccupied the plant on Friday .
On Tuesday morning the factory council finally informed the workforce about the plan to close the plant .
The majority of workers are to be made redundant by December 31 .
A skeleton staff of between 25 to 30 workers will be retained until the end of March to wind down the factory .
The only hope for any retention of jobs , according to IG Metall , was via the creation of some sort of transfer company ( a firm specializing in matching laid - off workers with new jobs ) .
The workers at the factory , however , place absolutely no confidence in such a transfer company .
They are all convinced that the chances of finding alternative work in the present economic climate are almost zero .
Many workers have been employed at the factory for over two decades and are ill - equipped to find new jobs at this stage of their lives and careers .
Hohenlockstedt is a small town of approximately 6,200 inhabitants in rural Schleswig - Holstein .
At its peak , the factory was a thriving enterprise with up to 700 employees .
Older inhabitants of the town recall when the factory operated three - shifts some 50 years ago .
But such times are long past .
One worker with 37 years in the plant told a WSWS reporter how he had begun his apprenticeship there as a toolmaker and in recent years had worked predominantly in the production of spare parts .
The situation for many workers is very bitter , he explained :
“ Entire lives are at stake .
There are many workers who began their working lives here , built a house and have small children .
And then suddenly one day we were informed that everything is gone .
After working here for over 35 years , I ’m told that as of January 1 , I can only inspect my workplace from the other side of the factory gate . ”
An HWU employee who has worked as a toolmaker at the factory for 20 years stressed that the jobs situation in the region was very bad : “ In the extreme case , you would have to move away from here to find new work .
But under conditions where everybody has the same idea it will be difficult to find work . ”
A somewhat younger worker , who started at the factory as an apprentice in 1988 , pointed to the anger of the HWU employees — in particular because they had been informed about the factory ’s plight at such a late stage .
Workers are angry that all the skills and knowledge built up over decades of employment are now considered worthless and summarily being dismissed .
The WSWS also spoke with the chairman of the works council , Steffen Schmidt , and his deputy , Alfred Butt .
When asked why IG Metall had done nothing to organise a more extensive campaign to defend the workers ’ jobs , they responded by referring to disputes between the “ works council princes ” ( union officials ) active in the big car plants , who are intent on defending their own factories at the expense of all others and therefore make impossible any sort of broader solidarity between different plants and their workforces .
The perspective of IG Metall
The announcement of the closure of the facility was preceded by a series of measures aimed at reorganising the factory and which involved considerable sacrifices on the part of the workforce .
The union enforced these measures by arguing that they were the only alternative to job cuts and HWU ’s closing down .
The result now is the complete closure of the plant .
The perspective of ‘ saving jobs ’ by accepting wage cuts and other concessions failed catastrophically .
In 2002 , IG Metall signed a contract with HWU involving a year - long reduction of the working week from 35 to 30 hours for its 225 employees with a 14 percent cut in wages .
Just two years after the expiry of this contract , management announced the first bankruptcy of the factory in October 2005 .
The bankruptcy procedure at that time called for the shedding of 80 jobs .
IG Metall officials reacted by reaching a new contract , which abolished existing Christmas benefits and accepted other concessions .
This contract ran until September 2007 , when it was replaced by another involving further attacks on wages and working conditions , including the abolition of holiday pay .
In return , workers were given a guarantee that their jobs would be safe until the end of 2009 .
This assurance has now been consigned to the waste bin following the latest declaration of bankruptcy .
The various concessions made by the trade union were incapable of saving a single job .
Instead the workers were left unprepared for the planned closure of the factory .
The union and the works council now regard the closure of the factory as inevitable .
Their only concern is how best to negotiate the option of a possible transfer company .
IG Metall is trying to call off the occupation to ensure that the auto companies supplied by HWU receive the needed parts .
The bureaucracy ’s main concern is the smooth working of the German auto industry , not the fate of the HWU or any other workers .
HWU workers should establish contact with workers at these companies , independently of IG Metall , and organise a common struggle to defend jobs and production .
The only future for auto workers lies in a fight for socialist policies and the nationalization of the industry under workers ’ control .
In order to step up pressure on workers to return to work , managing director Strodtkötter posted a letter on the company bulletin board Tuesday afternoon threatening the immediate sacking of workers who refused to return to work .
He also announced that striking workers would be forced to pay large sums to compensate for lost production .
The occupation of the HWU factory should be supported by all workers .
It raises important political questions , which are relevant for workers at other companies .
The most important of these questions is : who controls the productive forces and in whose interest should they be organised ?
We are on the verge of a historical , seismic shift here in America .
I write this as we begin our day as citizens lining up to affect outcomes of world events not yet ready to unfold .
People stop me on the street and ask me what it looks like .
They ask me what will be .
There is little debate left in our lungs – we are out of breath , exhausted and exhilarated and wondering what will be .
I remember the day Richard Nixon won in 1968 .
That was a time that seemed certain to bring about long - awaited seismic change in America .
But events of tragic proportion took us on a turn .
Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jnr were suddenly dead .
The Vietnam War was in full throttle .
Thousands of American casualties every year and no end in sight .
Riots threatened the sanity of our cities .
I rode the subway to school that morning .
I looked at people .
They read the newspaper , cracked gum , ate muffins , nodded off to catch a few more minutes of sleep before work – no different than the day before .
I thought the world would surely be different .
I was sure I would see a darker place ; a colder Earth ; an ugly city or at least a dirty look or sneer or some sign on my subway ride to school that morning that the world was in trouble .
Things happen to us and reaction is sometimes tough to measure .
A cop told me once that when he pulled his weapon and shot a man for the first time the thing that struck him most was that the man seemed unbothered by the bullets that had entered his body .
The man kept running for blocks – kept running and running .

I fell in love with my wife 20 years ago .
I am only now , it seems , getting it through my very thick skull how lucky I am .
I 've been running and running .
If you are like me , our most powerful epiphanies find us after their effect could have been put to good use .
We are often too late with our brilliance .
We are on time delay .
The only instant gratification comes in the form of potato chips .
The rest will find us by surprise somewhere down the road , maybe as we sleep and dream of other things .
So I wonder about tomorrow .
Is this a monumental moment in our lives ?
Is this the instance of epiphany or are we awakening from slumber and recognising the effects of cosmic shifts in paradigms that have happened long ago , from which we are too tired to keep running away ?
I wonder what would have been had Al Gore been allowed to accept his victory as our President .
We would not be in Iraq – I know this .
We would have invested heavily in green and alternative technology and we would be leading the world in an economic boon for the next generation .
There are seminal moments in our lives where our brilliance is given the chance to unfold and show itself .
In the collective American consciousness we had such a moment .
On election night 2000 , the networks had all given Al Gore a victory in Florida after a tough and close battle all evening .
The exit polls were showing a growing Gore lead that was insurmountable and so Florida was called for Gore , which would also give him the electoral numbers to claim victory .
A press conference was announced in Crawford , Texas , where George W Bush and his team had holed up for the big night .
Newsmen and pundits anticipated a concession speech that would declare the night officially over .
But there was no concession speech and no George Bush .
Instead out came Howard Baker , a Bush senior campaign adviser , Karen Hughes , the Bush communications director , and Mr Bush 's brother Jeb , the Florida Governor .
Huh ?
They announced , in no uncertain terms , that they did not concede Florida on this night nor did they concede the general election and they were , and this is a quote : " Getting on the phones and getting to work .
We are going to win Florida ! "
The newsmen and women seemed stunned .
I was screaming at the television asking the question : " Getting on the phone to do WHAT ? "
The polls had closed .
There was no work to do .
Everybody had already voted .
Magically , the numbers changed and showed an unlikely , to say the least , turn in the count that begat the infamous recount that begat the infamous hanging chads that begat the criminal Supreme Court decision that handed the reins of power in a virtual coup d'état to the governor of Florida 's brother , George Bush .
Had we been a fighter pilot we would have been blown out of the sky .
If we were Luke Skywalker , we forgot to use the force .
If we were a goalie on a soccer field , we went right and the ball went left , or worse , we did n't move at all and the ball rolled through our legs .
Had we had our senses with us that day , our antennas up and our muscles taut , we could have been brilliant .
We could have stormed the ranch at Crawford and taken our country before it was stolen from us .
Instead we rolled over in our sleep .
So , as we stand on the verge of a shifting Earth , I wonder is this the Big One , the epiphany that leads us to brilliance in real time , or is this an aftershock .
Was the Big One Rosa Parks refusing to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery in 1955 ?
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 ?
Richard Nixon 's Watergate ?
Crawford , Texas ?
9/11 ?
Maybe it is the slow moving forward of lives toward death that allows evolution to do what it can by killing away ancient paradigms of supremacy of people and nation .
That has allowed for a younger generation to be blind to issues of race and gender and to recognise climate change as science and not God .
We lay asleep , we Americans , dreaming of making millions in mortgage madness , unbothered by battles fought and blood spilled by contractors and volunteers a million miles away .
Though we did begin to worry about the cost .
Has evolution caught us napping ?
Has this new generation moved forward and with the kindness of their spirit brought us along for the ride ?
I am in my home , New York , as it happens .
Today I will ride the subway .
There will be gum and muffins and newspapers and some will be dozing .
Will the city be beautiful this day ?
Time will only tell .
" This is a happy day indeed for the curvy cucumber and the knobbly carrot , and other amusingly shaped fruits and vegetables , " said European Commission spokesman Michael Mann .
" Rules governing the size and shape of fruit and vegetables will be consigned to history , " the commission said in a statement .
EU nations on Wednesday gave the green light Monday for bent cucumbers and other " wonky " fruit and vegetables to be sold in supermarkets and elsewhere , as part of a drive to cut red tape .
" This is a happy day indeed for the curvy cucumber and the knobbly carrot , and other amusingly shaped fruits and vegetables , " said European Commission spokesman Michael Mann .
" Rules governing the size and shape of fruit and vegetables will be consigned to history , " the commission said in a statement .
The rules are to be scrapped for apricots , artichokes , asparagus , aubergines , avocados , beans , Brussels sprouts , carrots , cauliflowers , cherries , courgettes , cucumbers , cultivated mushrooms , garlic , hazelnuts in shell , headed cabbage , leeks , melons , onions , peas , plums , ribbed celery , spinach , walnuts in shell , water melons , and chicory .
" This marks a new dawn for the curvy cucumber and the knobbly carrot , " said EU Agriculture Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel .
" It 's a concrete example of our drive to cut unnecessary red tape .
We simply do n't need to regulate this sort of thing at EU level .
It is far better to leave it to market operators . "
She added that in the current climate of high food prices and economic woes " consumers should be able to choose from the widest range of products possible .
It makes no sense to throw perfectly good products away , just because they are the ' wrong ' shape . "
Representatives of most EU countries voted against the rule change , but not by the overwhelming " qualified majority " required to stop it going through , a commission spokesman said .
MP : The last paragraph is the most amazing part of the story : most EU countries voted against the change !
Below are examples of the absurd EU regulations that the Eurocrats wanted to keep , notice that cucumbers MUST be straight and bananas can NOT be straight !
1. Cucumbers must be practically straight and their maximum bend must be at a gradient of no more than 1/10 .
2. Bananas must be bent : the thickness of a transverse section of the fruit between the lateral faces and the middle , perpendicular to the longitudinal axis must be at a minimum of 27 mm .
They must also be longer than 14 cm .
In the ideal world of the bureaucrat , everything has to either be prevented or required .
Reality TV junkie ?
Also a State - worshipper ?
Then you ’re in luck !
Every day the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security patrol more than 100,000 miles of America ’s borders .
This territory includes airports , seaports , land borders , international mail centers , the open seas , mountains , deserts and even cyberspace .
Now viewers will get an unprecedented look at the work of these men and women while they use the newest technology to safeguard our country and enforce our laws , in “ Homeland Security USA , ” which debuts with the episode “ This is Your Car on Drugs , ”
How much of this “ epic ” TV show will actually have to do with terrorism ?
Will this finally belie the claim that the Department of Homeland Security was created with purely “ keeping us safe from evildoers ” as it ’s mandate , or will it be another dose of soma “ reality television ” for the unquestioning masses .
Bear in mind , that ’s a rhetorical question , we all know the answer is the latter .
Now that you ’ve seen go - karts tear up the streets , the only thing that could top that would be taking a Formula 1 car on a grand tour of San Paulo , Brazil .

I 'm not a violent man .
My physical aggression is limited to kicking non-existent objects when my train gets cancelled , or slamming the phone down on British Gas when they cold - call for the third time in a week .
But in the past fortnight , I 've been on a sustained campaign of slaughter – several dozen boars , umpteen Dustwind Harpies and Razormane Dustrunners , a vicious troll called Zalazane – and that 's just for starters .
What 's more , dispatching these computer - generated characters to the hereafter was utterly absorbing , and if I had n't been ordered to stop " researching " and start writing , I 'd probably have carried on vanquishing evil while my phone rang out and takeaway cartons piled up on my desk .

An awesome bloodbath , and a colossal source of revenue .
Aside from the cost of the game , there 's a monthly subscription fee of between £ 7 and £ 10 .
That works out at a pretty hefty annual bill for a player to run amok with a Dragonbone Greatsword , but there 's a good reason for millions of people coughing up for WoW : it 's fantastically – or worryingly – addictive .
The devotion that war games inspire – particularly the MMORPG variety – is well documented ; when the new expansion pack for WoW was launched last week , queues were forming in London 's Oxford Street hours beforehand , and the person at the front was so overwhelmed when the barriers were lifted that he passed out .
But Jon Appleyard , a WoW player who spends up to three nights a week playing alongside other members of his WoW guild , Second Blood , is sanguine about the role the game plays in his life .
" I 'll admit I use it as a comfort thing , " he says , " a dependable way of escaping from everyday life .
If I was n't playing WoW , I 'd probably be getting wasted down the pub . "

But for those who have " addictive personalities " , playing WoW is not so benign an activity .
There are plenty of stories of gaming leading to relationship breakdowns .
Wendy Kays , author of Game Widow , watched her marriage flounder as a result of her husband 's addiction to online war gaming .
" It was bizarre , " she says .
" There were all the signs of drug addiction – but no drugs . "
And there are many instances of online rivalries leading to real altercations .
" There are rumours of real - life murders , " says Appleyard , " and I think they 're probably true .
There was one guy who lent someone a Sword of Slaying or something in the game EverQuest .
He never got it back , so he tracked the guy down and killed him . "
But what is it about these games that inspires such powerful emotions ?
As someone whose interest in gaming is limited to occasionally shoving coins into fruit machines , I was curious to try WoW .
After creating my character , an apprentice mage ( whom I wanted to call Geoff , or Mike , but ended up naming Kohntarkosz to avoid being laughed at by a Paladin or a Night Elf ) , I set a trepidatious foot into the Valley of Trials .
Immediately , some orcs asked me to execute a few harmless creatures using a gnarled stick , for which I was rewarded with some coins , or a shabby piece of clothing .
Bewildered by my surroundings , I carried on doing what I was told – only obeying orders , if you like – and pretty soon I 'd gained the ability to cast a fireball spell , freeze enemies to the spot and turn humans into sheep .
These skills might be worth little at Tesco , but in the wastes of Durotar they were boons .
I was sent on killing sprees in the Echo Isles ; I rode a winged creature to the Horde stronghold of Orgrimmar to receive orders from Thrall , I maimed dozens while searching for the secret of the Samophlange .
And , to my horror , I found myself utterly bewitched by the game .
What 's most astonishing is its depth and complexity ; even seasoned players such as Appleyard admit that they feel they 're barely scraping the surface .
And it 's designed in such a way that even first - timers , or " noobs " , are drip - fed just enough to keep them coming back for more : the prospect of increasing a level , or gaining possession of a fetching cape , or being praised and sent on new , exciting missions .
While war games have long captured our imaginations , Wendy Kays believes that blaming the violent aspect of WoW and the like for their addictive properties is a red herring ; she believes it 's down to that sense of achievement the games bestow on players .
" Despite the fact that you 're in combat for a lot of the time , the point of WoW is n't killing .
It 's just a safe way to explore new things , an inexpensive way to feel as if you 're being a pioneer .
It 's emotionally compelling – and I have to say that while researching the game I ended up loving it . "
It 's a strange admission from someone whose book tells of the dangers of online gaming , and the steps she and her husband made to get their relationship back on track .
" I 'm not crusading against them , and it would be easy for me to appear joyless .
No , I think they 're a wonderful gift that has the capacity to be badly misused . "
In two weeks as a subscriber to WoW , I played it for some 27 hours – a shocking statistic .
How could that time have been better spent ?
That leads to questions surrounding the point of our existence : is learning to knit or going to the cinema any more use than emerging triumphant from Ragefire Chasm having vanquished Jergosh the Invoker ?
" That 's the question gamers need to address , " says Kays .
" If people have thought about this , and decide to choose gaming , that 's fine – they should go ahead and have a great time .
But the ones who have n't – and particularly if they have responsibility for children – just need to be asked the question , otherwise in five years they 'll wonder where all that time went . "
Fortunately , this is n't a question I will confront .
My frustration at forgetting to pick up a Flawed Power Stone en route to the Altar of Fire in Dreadmist Den meant that I could n't be arsed to return to Ak ' Zeloth to get one .
So I 've just logged out – and I 've moved the game to the trash .
I 've been wowed by WoW , but when real life starts to feel grim , I do n't want to have to slaughter a bunch of Voidwalker Minions to make me feel better .

The difference between Sarah Palin and Britney Spears
September 7 , 2008 by twitterpaters
by twit
Is that Britney is sorry about endangering the life of her child .
Via USAToday :
Sally Lee , editor of Parents magazine , says there is no excuse for driving with a baby in your lap , because if there ’s an accident , the child “ becomes a projectile or is crushed between the mother and the steering wheel , ” she says .
“ It ’s such dangerous behavior , and it goes against everything you ’ve ever been told about auto safety and babies .
There are never mitigating circumstances .
The baby should be in a car seat , period . ”
According to the Washington Post on September 7 , 2008 :
Palin held her baby in her arms as the warden drove a short distance around the facility , said corrections director Joe Schmidt , who sat next to Palin .
A few days later , the governor got a warning from her public safety commissioner that someone had complained that she did not strap Trig into a car seat for the ride .
Palin dismissed the complaint as petty , and the commissioner , whom she appointed , took no formal action .
Just ask Britney Spears how illegal it is .
Governor Palin , I have been telling anyone who will listen to stay out of your personal life .
But endangering your infant child is potentially a criminal offense and a very public matter .
update :
It looks like this issue runs right into Troopergate :
On the car seat matter , Monegan sent an e-mail to the governor on June 30 , 12 days before he lost his job , that said : “ Via a soon - to - be- retiring legislator , we received a complaint that had you driving with Trig not in an approved car seat ; if this is so that would be awkward in many ways . ”
The governor fired back from her private e-mail account : “ I ’ve never driven Trig anywhere without a new , approved carseat .
I want to know who said otherwise — pls provide me that info now . ”
Todd Palin , in his sworn statement , said this was a “ false rumor , ” and that the governor was a passenger in a truck , “ on a private farm road without traffic at low speed . ”
Thanks ,
Todd , for letting us know that Governor Palin failed to use a car seat in a moving vehicle .

[ M]easures of cognitive skill [ CS ] predict social awareness and choices in a sequential Prisoner 's Dilemma game .
Subjects with higher CS's more accurately forecast others ' behavior .... [ S]ubjects with higher CS 's also cooperate more as first movers .
That 's the result from a new experimental study of 1,000 people attending truck driving school .
The authors tested all of them with Raven 's Progressive Matrices , a real IQ test .
They then put pairs of them through a prisoner 's dilemma game , and found :
This set of genuine experiments improves on this older paper , which found that students at high - SAT schools cooperated more in prisoner 's dilemmas than students at low - SAT schools .
Now we know it 's not just because posh , high - SAT schools facilitate a " culture of cooperation " or something like that .

IMAGINE winning $ 95,000 on the pokies , but walking away without realising it because of a faulty jackpot alarm .
Or being shown by the machine you have just won $ 21 million , only to find out it is malfunctioning .
NSW gamblers poured more than $ 5 billion into gaming machines last financial year but in some instances their chances of striking gold were virtually impossible .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A computer glitch at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China gave gold traders a 23 - minute bonanza that cost the bank dearly last week , sparking a debate on Monday as the bank reclaimed the windfall .
ICBC , the world ’s biggest bank by market value , was left red - faced after its trading system went awry in the early hours of Friday , quoting a bid price for gold of 848 yuan per gram , nearly six times the going rate it had offered moment earlier .
Alert traders using the bank ’s online trading platform pounced on the bank ’s misfiring system and raked in easy profits , according to local media reports .
One lady in the western city of Xian made a tidy 126,540 yuan in a single minute , the Beijing Times said , estimating that the bank ’s total losses ran to 10 million yuan ( $ 1.46 million ) .
The golden opportunity lasted for 23 minutes , between 01:52 a.m. and 2:15 a.m. local time , Caijing Magazine reported .
ICBC spotted the error later in the day on Friday and froze all trades that had taken advantage of it , Caijing added .
On Saturday , the bank posted a statement on its website saying that prices on its gold trading system had “ deviated seriously from the market price ” for a short time .
It added that all sales and purchases executed during that window would be canceled in accordance with an agreement signed by users of the gold - trading platform .
“ The gold trading system quickly returned to operating normally and ICBC is contacting related clients and explaining matters , ” the statement concluded .
The question on Monday was whether the bank was in the right .
Zhang Zhifeng , a lawyer at the Lanpeng Law Firm , told the Beijing News that ICBC had no legal basis in seizing the money since the clients had simply sold at the price quoted by the bank and had not intentionally cheated it .
Law scholar Wang Weiguo disagreed , telling Fazhi Wanbao , a legal affairs newspaper , that the windfall constituted “ unjust enrichment ” for the traders and had to be returned to the bank .

Robots !
At least that is how my son says it .
He loves everything to do with our fine mechanical friends .
He does not discriminate .
Roomba , VEXplorer , BEAM Bot , Bristle bot , or wind up toy , they all get his approval .
Partly because of his enthusiasm , and partly because of my occupation , I frequently get ask by parents to recommend a robot kit for their child .
Until now I have n't had a good answer because my knowledge is limited to more expensive high school and college level robotics kits and systems that start around $ 300 for a entry level kit .
So here 's my first look into the world of low cost robots .
I should disclose that while I have purchased from some of these companies , I have not yet purchased or assembled any of these kits .
I do plan to soon .
I 'll start with the list off with what appear to be the easier kits and work up to the more difficult .
A Mechanical Tiger from Tamiya .
It is comes with a pre-built gearbox , motor , and single AA battery holder .
They do n't list an age group , but this should be good for any kids past the " eating stuff " stage .
Tamiya also makes a Walking Robot Kit that can be built with 2 , 4 , or 6 legs .
This walker looks a little more difficult to assemble , but should be good for ages 8 + with some help .
It looks a lot more robot - like than the Tiger since it has a circuitboard for sound activated start and stop .
Stepping up to a more complex mechanical design is the OWI Weasel Robot Kit .
The Weasel has both touch and line senors , and a user selectable 3 speed gearbox .
Also from OWI , is the Moon Walker II , a 4 legged walker .
Mechanically it looks more complex than the Weasel , but only reacts to light and sound to run for a predetermined time .
The i-robo , Line Tracer is a solderless line tracker that 's quite agile .
I think it would be great for kids who have n't made the jump to soldering , but want a more capable robot .
Be sure to check out the youtubes to see how fast Dust off your soldering skills for the Solar Speeder , a member of the BEAM family .
It teaches basic electronics , soldering , and solar power .
Check out the documentation before you buy to make sure it 's not too far out of your skill range .
The Mousebot Kit is Solarbotics take on a junk bot .
It runs off a 9V battery and has simple touch sensors ( whiskers and tail ) and a light sensor to help it navigate .
This one is my favorite , but it is the most complex to assemble .
Like with the solar speeder , I recommend reading the instructions before purchasing to ensure it is n't too difficult .
That should give you some ideas .
There are hundreds more to choose from in every skill range , so look around , buy a robot , and do n't be afraid .
You really can do it if you take your time and read the directions .
If you have any other recommendations , experiences , or suggestions , please post a comment .
I 'll keep watching for new bot kits and try to follow up this post with more good kits for geeks of all ages .
After full disclosure , how do we prevent such a crisis happening again ?
Firstly , the " white collar " crimes which drove this sub - prime debacle – at mortgage lenders , investment banks and ratings agencies – need to be severely punished .
People who did bad things must go to jail .
I 'm against regulatory overkill , but recognise a strong framework of rules is needed .
We need to acknowledge that too much leverage is even more dangerous than too little .
Western central banks need to regain powers , weakened in the 1980s and 1990s , to impose " reserve asset requirements " , so reining in bank lending .
December blew in with a mighty chill on Wall Street .
In six and a half hours on Monday , the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index declined nearly 9 percent  the type of collapse that , historically , has taken years to occur .
But in 2008 , a year that has now been officially declared to be in recession , the drop registered with a resigned sense that , yes , this awful year still has yet another month to go .
The sell - off , which erased nearly all the gains enjoyed by the stock market in Thanksgiving week , came as investors flocked to the safety of government notes , driving their yields to near record lows as concern mounted that the economy could get much worse before it improves .
Investors have long assumed that the country was in recession , and analysts said that after last week ’s gains , including the biggest five - day rally in decades , a sell - off was to be expected .
But perhaps not this fast  and not this deep .
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 679.95 points or 7.7 percent , all but wiping out a 783 - point gain built up last week .
The S.& P. 500 gave back 80 points of the 96 - point gain from the same period .
The Nasdaq composite index was also off 9 percent .
Facebook has devoted a lot of energy to becoming an important part of the political ecosystem in America .
It has conducted experiments with media partners like ABC , operated a voter registration drive which signed up 50,000 people , and promoted politicians ’ fan pages and virtual gifts throughout election season .
As Facebook has demonstrated its potential to make a difference in the way political influence spreads at the grassroots level to large numbers of people , candidates from the local level to the highest levels have taken notice and spent significant time investing in their Facebook presence and communicating with their Facebook supporters .
The Obama campaign , however , also spent time with the Facebook sales team .
A new report from ClickZ analyzing the Obama campaign ’s Federal Election Commission filing shows that Obama spent a total of $ 467,000 on Facebook – $ 370,000 in September alone .
ClickZ says the McCain campaign did not break out individual online ad spending in its FEC reports .
While these numbers are small in light of both Obama ’s overall spend on the campaign and Facebook ’s estimated $ 300 million in 2008 revenues , it ’s quite likely that Facebook outpaces much other online ad spend in terms of measurable engagement for political marketing campaigns , and likely ranks pretty decently when compared to other political marketing tactics like robo- calling , which is apparently completely ineffective but still sells for $ 20 CPM .
If Facebook continues to educate the market , it could see bigger pieces of the political spend in upcoming election cycles .
A 1960s tape recorder the size of a household fridge could be the key to unlocking valuable information from NASA 's Apollo missions to the moon .
An archiving error by NASA has meant 173 data tapes have sat in Perth for almost 40 years , holding information about lunar dust that could be vital in expanding science 's understanding of the moon .
But after almost four decades , a donation from a Sydney computer society looks set to breathe fresh life into a long - neglected field of lunar science .
The Apollo 11 , 12 and 14 missions of the late 1960s carried " dust detectors " that were invented by Perth physicist Brian O'Brien .
This information was beamed back to earth and recorded onto tapes .
Dr O'Brien had access to the tapes at Sydney University , but the couple of papers on moon dust he published with the preliminary findings failed to spark as much interest from the scientific community as he was hoping for .
" These were the only active measurements of moon dust made during the Apollo missions , and no - one thought it was important , " he said .
" But it 's now realised that dust , to quote Harrison Schmitt , who was the last astronaut to leave the moon , is the number one environmental problem on the moon . "
Dr O'Brien 's work on lunar dust took a back seat when he started working for Western Australia 's Environmental Protection Authority , and when NASA lost their copies of the tapes it meant the information was basically laying fallow .
" NASA , in the words of their website , misplaced the tapes before they were archived , " Dr O'Brien said .
The revelation of the loss only came two years ago .
Dr O'Brien says there is no indication as to when exactly the tapes were lost , but he guesses that it was " way , way back " .
When Dr O'Brien learnt of the tape loss , he was contacted by Guy Holmes from data recovery company SpectrumData , who offered to try and get hold of the information .
Mr Holmes has kept the tapes in a climate - controlled room since then , and it was only when he stumbled upon a 1960s IBM729 Mark 5 tape drive at the Australian Computer Museum Society that his company had the ability to unlock the information .
The computer enthusiasts who run the Sydney - based group agreed to lend the almost archaic - looking recorder , which is in need of tender love and care , to Mr Holmes .
Mr Holmes jokes that a 1970s Toyota Corolla fan belt could be used to get the recorder up and running .
" The drives are extremely rare , we do n't know of any others that are still operating , " he said .
" It 's going to have to be a custom job to get it working again .
It 's certainly not simple , there 's a lot of circuitry in there , it 's old , it 's not as clean as it should be and there 's a lot of work to do . "
Mr Holmes is hopeful of getting the tape recorder working again in January , and then he says it should only take a week to extract information that has been locked away since the early 1970s .

I 've recently started a full - time job at Standard Chartered .
Before that I was doing an internship with Credit Suisse , where I spent a reasonable amount of time doing F# programming .
Before I started F# I had 6 years of Haskell experience , plenty of C# experience , but little exposure to ML .
I 've now had 3 months to experiment with F# , using an old version ( the one before the latest Community Technology Preview ) and here are my impressions .
F# is a functional language from Microsoft , previously a Microsoft Research language , which is moving towards a fully supported language .
F# is based on ML , and some ( perhaps many ) ML programs will compile with F# .
At the same time , F# has complete access to the .NET framework and can interoperate with languages such as C# .
F# is a hybrid language - at one extreme you can write purely functional ML , and at the other extreme you can write imperative C# , just using a different syntax .
F# seems to be designed as a practical language - it is n't elegant or small , but does interoperate very nicely with every .NET feature .
The F# language is based on ML , with the addition of indentation based layout , and many of the weaknesses in F# come from ML .
F# is certainly more verbose than Haskell : in some places you need an extra keyword ( often a ) ; pattern matching is not nearly as complete ; the indentation is n't as natural as Haskell .
However there are some nice syntactic features in F# that are not in Haskell , including generalised list / array / sequence comprehensions and active patterns .
The type checker in F# is powerful , but unpredictable .
I often get surprised by where type annotations need to go , particularly when working with .NET object types .
The tuple type is treated specially in many cases , and this also leads to surprise - inserting or removing a pair of brackets can effect the type checker .
Much of this complexity is necessary to manage the interaction with .
NET , but it does complicate the language .
Unfortunately , even with the advanced type features in F# , there are no type classes .
The lack of type classes precludes the standard implementation of things such as Uniplate and QuickCheck .
However , F# does have some nice reflection capabilities , and often entirely generic implementations can be given using reflection .
There is certainly an interesting design trade - off between reflection based operations and type classes , something I have looked at in the past and hope to explore again in future .
F# is an impure language , which offers some practical benefits from Haskell , but also encourages a less functional style .
In Haskell I sometimes work within a localised state monad - F# makes this much more natural .
The impurity also allows simple interaction with .
NET .
Having programmed with an impure language I did find myself reaching for localised state much more often - and was occasionally tempted into using global state .
In most cases , this state became problematic later .
Before using F# I thought purity was a good thing , now I 'm convinced that purity is a good thing but that impurity is often very useful !
Haskell could learn some things from F#. Every statement in F# must either be bound to a value or evaluate to .
In Haskell it is possible to write .
Any experienced Haskell programmer should spot that theis a space leak ( it should be ) , but the type system does n't enforce it .
In F# the type system does .
The change in Haskell is simple , and in my opinion , desirable .
F# is a fully fledged member of the .NET platform .
You can write a class in VB.
NET , write a derived class in F# , and then derive from that class in C# .
All the languages can produce and consume the same libraries .
This integration with .NET allows companies that already use the Microsoft tools to easily migrate - even on a function by function basis .
However , the combination of both an imperative framework and a functional language at some times leads to confusing choices .
All of the standard .NET libraries work with arrays , but for a functional program the list is a more natural type .
F# provides both , and it was never clear which I should use where , leading to lots of conversions .
The .NET libraries are very powerful , but often are overly imperative .
For example , the XSD libraries ( Xml Schema Description ) are very imperative - you have to create objects , mutate properties , then make calls .
However , in Haskell , I probably would n't have hadXSD support , certainly nothing as well - supported as in .NET .
The most impressive aspect of F# is the integration with the Visual Studio environment .
F# contains a debugger , profiler , auto - completion , identifier lookup and many other tools .
While other functional languages have some of these tools , the Visual Studio environment tends to have very refined and polished implementations .
The integration with F# is sometimes a little fragile , or at least was in the version I was using , but the tools are already very powerful and are likely to continue to improve .
The F# language is n't the most beautiful language ever , but it 's not bad .
The integration with .NET is incredible , and while this requires compromises in the language , the benefits are considerable .
I still prefer Haskell as a language , but for many users the tool chain is a more important consideration , and here F# excels .
I 'd recommend reading Vesa Karvonen 's comment below - he has additional perspectives on F# from a more ML perspective .
We where telling “ encryption jokes ” ( like ROT26 ) at the office , until a colleague mentioned that a part of the Windows Registry is ROT13 encrypted .
It appeared to be true , Windows Explorer will store info about the programs you run in registry key
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist\{75048700-EF1F-11D0-9888-006097DEACF9}\Count .
The value names stored in this key are ROT13 encrypted .
Google for UserAssist and you ’ll find several pages where this is explained in detail , like this one .
Some of these pages mention programs to decrypt ROT13 , but I did n’t find a program to display and manage the UserAssist data .
So I decided to write my own , just for the fun of it .
I wanted this program to have a GUI and I did n’t want to spend much time coding low - level details , so I decided to code it with the Microsoft .NET 2.0 Framework .
I posted my program ( source code and binaries ) here on the gotdotnet site .
Download the ZIP file , you ’ll have to extract UserAssist \UserAssist\bin \Release \UserAssist.exe to get my program .
There is no setup , it ’s just one executable .
I used Microsoft Visual C# 2005 Express Edition because it ’s free , so you can examine and modify my program .
But it ’s not needed to run my program , you ’ll only need the .NET Framework 2.0 runtime to run my program ( download it only if you have a problem running my program , if you have an up - to - date version of Windows XP , the .NET 2.0 Framework will already be installed ) .
My program displays the decrypted UserAssist entries as a treeview :
ROT13 is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher , these ciphers are very easy to decrypt , e.g. by frequency analysis .
The namespace System .
Security .
Cryptography in .NET 2.0 does not implement the ROT13 cipher , I had to implement my own method .
While I developed my program , I became intrigued with the binary data .
Because I had no access to the Internet at that time , I had to resort to the good old trial and error technique to discover the meaning of this data ( I tested my program on Windows XP SP2 ) .
For all entries starting with UEME_RUN , the binary data is 16 bytes long .
The first 4 bytes at first always remained zero , and the fifth byte increased with one each time I ran the corresponding program ( like notepad.exe ) .
Because the sixth , seventh and eight byte are zero , I surmized that the 4 bytes starting at byte 5 are a 32 bit counter .
Data on Intel machines is usually stored in little - endian format , this means that the least significant byte is stored first , e.g. a 32 bit integer with value 9 is stored as 09 00 00 00 .
When I ran a program the first time , this counter was initialized to the value of 6 .
This was also the case when I deleted the entry and ran the program again .
The remaining 8 bytes changed apparently at random each time I ran the corresponding program , but in fact only the least significant bytes changed .
I hypothesized that the remaining 8 bytes are a timestamp .
I ran notepad , noted the value of the 8 bytes , ran notepad exactly one minute later and noted the new value of the 8 bytes .
The difference was 0x23B9D020 , or 599380000 , which is almost equal to 60 seconds times 10.000.000 .
Hence it definitely was a timestamp , I tried to convert the 8 last bytes to a timestamp with the C# method DateTime .
FromFileTime , and Bingo ! , I got the date and time when I last ran notepad .
Now back to the first 4 bytes .
I noticed a trend : they are set to the value of the last 4 bytes of the UEME_CTLSESSION , and these 4 bytes appear to be a 32 bit counter that increases each time the user logs on ( only after a reboot ? ) .
I need to analyze this further .
To summarize , the 16 data bytes are organized as :
• 4 bytes , meaning unknown , probably a 32 bit integer , appears to be a session counter
• 4 bytes , a 32 bit integer , counts the number of times the corresponding program was executed , is equal to 6 for the first run
• 8 bytes , a 64 bit timestamp , last time the corresponding program was executed
When you select an entry in the treeview , the binary data will be decoded and displayed at the bottom of the form .
My program should be self - explanatory .
Right - click an entry to clear it :
Clear
All will delete the root keys , thus deleting all entries and also preventing Windows Explorer to record program execution until you perform a new logon ( in fact , the entries are ( re ) created when Windows Explorer is started ) .
Caution : the UserAssist entries are used by Windows to display programs you use frequently in the Start menu :
Clearing the UserAssist entries will impact the Most Frequently Used Programs portion of your Start menu .
Reverse - Engineering the UserAssist entries was relatively easy , but I ca n’t explain why they are ROT13 encrypted !

Slogan
" From each according to their ability , to each according to their needs " ( German : Jeder nach seinen Fähigkeiten , jedem nach seinen Bedürfnissen ) is a slogan popularised by Karl Marx in his 1875 Critique of the Gotha Program . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
The principle refers to free access to and distribution of goods , capital and services .
[ 3 ]
In the Marxist view , such an arrangement will be made possible by the abundance of goods and services that a developed communist system will be capable to produce ; the idea is that , with the full development of socialism and unfettered productive forces , there will be enough to satisfy everyone 's needs . [ 4] [ 5 ]
Origin of the phrase [ edit ]
The complete paragraph containing Marx 's statement of the creed in the Critique of the Gotha Program is as follows :
From each according to their ability , to each according to their needs ! [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
In a higher phase of communist society , after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor , and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor , has vanished ; after labor has become not only a means of life but life 's prime want ; after the productive forces have also increased with the all - around development of the individual , and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly — only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners :
Although Marx is popularly thought of as the originator of the phrase , the slogan was common within the socialist movement .
For example , August Becker in 1844 described it as the basic principle of communism [ 6 ] and Louis Blanc used it in 1851 .
[ 7 ]
The origin of this phrasing has also been attributed to the French utopian Étienne - Gabriel Morelly , [ 8 ] [ 9 ] who proposed in his 1755 Code of Nature " Sacred and Fundamental Laws that would tear out the roots of vice and of all the evils of a society " , including : [ 10 ]
I . Nothing in society will belong to anyone , either as a personal possession or as capital goods , except the things for which the person has immediate use , for either his needs , his pleasures , or his daily work .
II .
Every citizen will be a public man , sustained by , supported by , and occupied at the public expense .
III .
Every citizen will make his particular contribution to the activities of the community according to his capacity , his talent and his age ; it is on this basis that his duties will be determined , in conformity with the distributive laws .
A similar phrase can be found in the Guilford Covenant in 1639 :
according to every man 's ability , and as need shall require , and we promise not to desert or leave each other or the plantation , but with the consent of the rest , or the greater part of the company who have entered into this engagement . [ 11 ]
We whose names are here underwritten , intending by God 's gracious permission to plant ourselves in New England , and if it may be , in the southerly part about Quinnipiack , do faithfully promise each , for ourselves and our families and those that belong to us , that we will , the Lord assisting us , sit down and join ourselves together in one entire plantation , and be helpful each to the other in any common work , and we promise not to desert or leave each other or the plantation , but with the consent of the rest , or the greater part of the company who have entered into this engagement .
Some scholars trace the phrase to the New Testament . [ 12 ] [ 13 ]
In Acts of the Apostles the lifestyle of the community of believers in Jerusalem is described as communal ( without individual possession ) , and uses the phrase " distribution was made unto every man according as he had need " ( διεδίδετο δὲ ἑκάστῳ καθότι ἄν τι ς χ ρείαν εἶχεν ) :
Acts 4:32–35 : 32
And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul : neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own ; but they had all things common .
33
And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus : and great grace was upon them all .
34 Neither was there any among them that lacked : for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them , and brought the prices of the things that were sold , 35 And laid them down at the apostles ' feet : and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need .
Other scholars find its origins in " the Roman legal concept of obligation in solidum " , [ 14 ] in which " everyone assumes responsibility for anyone who cannot pay his debt , and he is conversely responsible for everyone else " .
[ 15 ]
James Furner argues :
If x = a disadvantage , and y = action to redress that disadvantage , the principle of solidarity is : if any member of a group acquires x , each member has a duty to perform y ( if they can assist ) .
All we then need to add , to get to the fundamental principle of developed communism , is to assume that non-satisfaction of a need is a disadvantage .
The corresponding principle of solidarity in respect of need says : if any member of society has an unsatisfied need , each member has a duty to produce its object ( if they can ) .
But that is precisely what the principle ' from each according to their abilities , to each according to their needs ! ' dictates .
In Marx 's vision , the basic principle of developed communism is a principle of solidarity in respect of need . [ 16 ]
Debates on the idea [ edit ]
Marx delineated the specific conditions under which such a creed would be applicable — a society where technology and social organization had substantially eliminated the need for physical labor in the production of things , where " labor has become not only a means of life but life 's prime want " . [ 17 ]
Marx explained his belief that , in such a society , each person would be motivated to work for the good of society despite the absence of a social mechanism compelling them to work , because work would have become a pleasurable and creative activity .
Marx intended the initial part of his slogan , " from each according to his ability " to suggest not merely that each person should work as hard as they can , but that each person should best develop their particular talents . [ 18 ] [ 19 ]
Claiming themselves to be at a " lower stage of communism " ( i.e. " socialism " , in line with Lenin 's terminology ) , [ 20 ] the Soviet Union adapted the formula as : " From each according to his ability , to each according to his work ( labour investment ) " .
[ 21 ]
This was incorporated in Article 12 of the 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union , but described by Leon Trotsky as " This inwardly contradictory , not to say nonsensical , formula " . [ 22 ]
While liberation theology has sought to interpret the Christian call for justice in a way that is in harmony with this Marxist dictum , many have noted that Jesus ' teaching in the Parable of the Talents ( Matthew 25:14–30 ) affirms only " TO each according to his ability " ( Matt. 25:15 ) , and not " FROM each according to his ability " .
[ 23 ] [ unreliable source ? ]
In popular culture [ edit ]
In Ayn Rand 's 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged , a large and profitable motor company adopted this slogan as its method for determining employee compensation .
The system quickly fell prey to corruption and greed , forcing the most capable employees to work overtime in order to satisfy the needs of the least competent and to funnel money to the owners .
As a result , the company went bankrupt within four years .
In Margaret Atwood 's 1985 novel The Handmaid 's Tale , members of a dystopian society recited the phrase thrice daily . [ 24 ]
Notably the phrase is altered to read " From each according to her ability ; to each according to his need , " demonstrating a perversion of the phrase 's original intention by Atwood 's fictional society .
In Vladimir Voinovich 's 1986 novel Moscow 2042 , the slogan was parodied in the context of " communism in one city " .
Every morning the radio announced : " Comrades , your needs for today are as follows : ... " .

President - elect Barack Obama will soon announce current head of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Steven Chu as his Secretary of Energy .
Filling the slot for EPA Administrator will be Lisa Jackson , Carol Browner will serve as Obama ’s “ climate czar ” – much better termed by the job ’s official title of Energy and Climate Coordinator , and Nancy Sutley will head the White House Council on Environmental Quality .
Chu is a Nobel Prize - winning physicist , sharing the award in 1997 for developing ways to “ cool and trap atoms ” with lasers .
Lisa Jackson , Obama ’s pick to run the EPA , is former commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection after spending 16 years at the EPA in Washington and New York .
Many are eager to see Princeton - educated Jackson take the reigns of the EPA and steer it in a much - needed new direction , but has also drawn some critisicsm of her performance in New Jersey .
Nonetheless , a new direction is certainly expected after the sorry performance of Stephen Johnson ’s reign at the EPA .
Energy and Climate Coordinator Carol Browner is probably best known as the head of the EPA during the Clinton years .
She has also worked as head of the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation and as a legislative director of Senator Al Gore ( back in the day ) .
In terms of her new position on the Obama team , she has been quoted as saying :
In responding to the climate crisis , the United States has the opportunity to rethink our energy future and move toward energy independence .
Taking action now will allow us to avoid the worst climate impacts and will drive the creation of a clean energy economy , in which we exchange carbon - dependency for greater energy independence and new clean energy jobs
Nancy Sutley , soon to be the White House Council on Environmental Quality , has “ a long history in the environmental community ” .
Her current position is that of Los Angeles deputy mayor for energy and environment .
Sutley has also served on the California State Water Resources Control Board .
At the risk of invoking what might be a cryptic reference for those that do n’t follow Jon Stewart ’s The Daily Show , as I look at Obama ’s team taking shape and the promise of a new direction – or just any direction – in environmental and climate policy , all I can say is “ Can we have our bike now ? ”
Stated more clearly , let ’s just get on with it .

The Entity moved silently through the darkness of space , as it had done for the entirety of its existence .
It was an example of one of the oldest life forms in the universe , though partly because it was also one of the simplest ; its body nothing more than a tenuous cloud of ions and messenger particles held together by the sheer forces of its consciousness .
For several million years , it had tracked its way around this and many other stars , blindly and instinctively searching for others of its kind , a search that most would proclaim futile .
In the long ages of searching , this particular Entity had found only one other .
But now , between the fourth and fifth planets of a small stellar system , its luck was about to change .
If the Entity knew of feelings like yearning or loneliness , it would certainly feel them .
Separated by the vast gulfs of space , each member of this species , if it could be classified as such , yearns to find its peers , each one searching with infinite patience .
On the all too rare occasion when this did happen , and two of these entities met , the two living clouds would slowly , instinctively , and , some would say , joyously merge together .
During this transformation , they become something new , greater than the sum of their parts , never to separate again .
In the vast distance , this particular Entity sensed a moving object , shining like a blinding light , which it knew at once to be the indication of another life form .
It waited , the object moving closer until the light resolved itself further into a tight grouping of almost two dozen separate entities , moving together and , more importantly , in its direction .
If the Entity knew of elation , it would have felt it .
Shifting its mass slightly , the entity accelerated away some of its own gases to move into the direct path of the incoming life forms–shedding lifeblood to prepare itself for the glorious merging which would soon take place .
Eight months into a voyage which was scheduled to take one year , thirteen days , and five hours , the Captain of the R.Borillian looked worriedly upon his instrument panel .
A red light blinked , one which very rarely required his attention .
It was labeled EMS , and to his knowledge had been on only once before .
It had blinked several months ago to notify him of the approaching electromagnetic field generated by a solar storm , one which passed harmlessly around the ship .
The Captain shrugged it off , if the light were something important , he told himself , there would be a beeping to accompany it .
Looking back to the screen at his left , he scrolled through an article , dense with equations and figures , titled On the Eccentricity of Lunar Orbits in the Jovian System .
It was written by one of the astrophysicists on board .
He ’d never been good with names , or physicists , for that matter , but the captain knew that it was either the bearded one or the guy with the glasses .
Carrying sixteen scientists , five of his crew , and a disproportionately large amount of cargo , the ship raced at ten miles per second through the vacuum of space , intent on reaching the three inhabited moons of Jupiter .
The quest for extraterrestrial life , the scientists reminded him daily , is what brings mankind to the outer planets .
The frozen seas of Europa , Ganymede ’s oh - so - precious magnetic field , and the volcanism of Io had been the only topics of discussion among the lab coats aboard , each factor supposedly contributing to the chance of life emerging either on or beneath the moons ’ surfaces .
Even now , there were dozens of research teams drilling and scraping and digging , trying desperately to unearth even a single microbe in the hopes of forever cementing their names in the history books .
A door behind the Captain slid open with a pneumatic hiss to admit one of the biologists , who clumsily floated into the room .
He held four thick books , two in each hand , and a pen between his teeth as he floundered his way into a chair .
Finally settled , he nodded to the Captain and spread the books out to hang in the air in front of him .
Then , breaking the silence of the otherwise quiet observation deck , a faint beeping from the EMS panel would be the only warning the two men would receive .
The Entity reached out , opening its consciousness to the new life forms .
The time had come .
The Captain barely had time to recognize the sound of the alarm before the sharp pain stabbed into the core of his mind .
He looked to the biologist , who was convulsing wildly in the air , screaming an incomprehensible terror .
Involuntarily his eyes clamped shut and his hands held his head , expecting to find that his brain had ripped itself free from his skull .
The blinding white pain remained for several seconds until fading to a dull blackness .
It was after this point that the Captain , and the rest of the scientists and crew , would breathe no more .
The official report on the incident would later conclude that , after passing through an otherwise clear region of space , the R.Borillian was showered with radiation , whose origin and nature are as of yet still unknown .
There were no survivors among the crew ; every one of them had suffered from either hemorrhagic strokes or other complications stemming from burst blood vessels in the brain .
One crewman , however , survived long enough to shout his last words into a transmission aimed for Ganymede .
The last transmission is as follows :
“ Hello ?
Is anyone listening ?
I ’m trying to transmit…oh God , they ’re all dead … Something ’s happened , my ears are bleeding , I ’ve got a terrible headache , they all just stopped moving , and I do n’t know what to do…please , it just hurts so — “
[ End of Transmission ]
The Entity continued on its path around the Sun .
Such a wealth of life had been found , and yet none of them were compatible , none ready to combine their life with itself .
If the entity knew sadness , it would have felt it .
Although an opportunity had been lost , the Entity would have consoled itself in knowing that such a great gathering of life was completely unprecedented among its race , and that the pleasure of such a momentous sight made the encounter well worth the trouble .
Besides , for a being which was all but immortal , there would be plenty of chances to try again .

The cat with purr - fect vision !
Almost - blind moggie Ernest has his life transformed by wearing CONTACT LENS
Most contact lens wearers have had trouble putting them in their eyes at some point - so the idea of putting them on a cat might seem ridiculous .
But that is exactly what the owners of Ernest - a 15 - year - old black and white cat -
have found themselves doing .
And from these pictures the elderly moggie looks like he has plenty to purr about after the lens have transformed him from a squinting cat unable to see where he was going .
What a sight : Ernest the Cat has his contact lenses put in
The contact lens , fitted by a vet , have saved Ernest from a life - threatening operation .
The old pet , suffers from entropion - an inward rolling of the eyelids , which causes inflammation and hinders sight .
He has lived at the RSPCA rescue centre in Godshill , Isle of Wight , for 13 years after he was injured in a car accident .
' I see you now ' : RSPCA
Centre resident staff cat Ernest looks happy with his new lease of sight
Centre manager Paula Sadler , 56 , said : ' Before Earnest was given the contact lenses he was quite squinty and had trouble seeing where he was going .
' Now his eyes have opened up and he has a new lease of life .
' Given his old age it would have been very risky giving him an operation because there is no telling how he would have reacted to the anaesthetic .
' The lenses have worked wonders . '
Purr - fect : Staff cat Ernest enjoys a cuddle with animal care assistant Kay Spicer after having the lens fitted
Pay the Designer !
If you ’re a science fiction fan like me , you might have heard of Harlan Ellison .
He ’s an award winning writer who wrote for TV series such as Star Trek , The Outer Limits , Babylon 5 , and many more .
Ellison is very good at what he does , and more importantly , he ’s very outspoken about professionalism among writers .
I use the word “ outspoken ” lightly here , and you ’ll soon find out why .
During an interview he gave , for the filming of Dreams with Sharp Teeth , an autobiography film about himself , Harlan Ellison gave a passionate speech about something that ’s important to people in the creative field , GETTING PAID .
( note : the following clip contains strong language , but well justified IMHO )
If you do n’t have the patience to watch the whole thing , here are some key transcripts .
A woman from Warner Brothers calls Harlan up , asking to use a clip of his past interview for free .
“ A young woman calls me , she says we ’d like to use it on the DVD .
I said absolutely , all you gotta do is pay me ” .
She said “ what ? ” I said “ You gotta pay me . ”
She said “ Well , everybody else is just , doing , you know , for nothing . ”
I said “ Everybody else may be an asshole , but I ’m not .
By what right would you call me and ask me to working for nothing ?
Do you get a paycheck ?
“ Well , yes … ” “ Does your boss get a paycheck !?
Do you pay the telecine guy !?
Do you pay the camera man !?
Do you pay the cutters !?
Do you pay the teamsters when they schlepped your stuff on the trucks !?
Would you go to a gas station and ask them to give you free gas !?
Would you go to the doctor have him take out your spleen for nothing !?
How dare you call me and want me to work for nothing !? [...]
“ They always want writers to work for nothing .
And the problem is , there ’s God damn many writers who have no idea that they ’re supposed to be paid every time they do something .
They do it for nothing ! [...]
I do n’t take a piss without getting paid .
I get so angry about this , because you ’re under - cut by all the amateurs .
The amateurs make it tough for the professionals .
Ellison may come off brutally abrasive in this interview , but if you dig for his other interviews you ’ll find out that it ’s just his personality .
Regardless , he ’s right on the money ( no pun intended ) .
Creatives in all fields have been fighting for their wages and worth as long as greedy people have existed .
However , it was n’t until in recent years when laws of intellectual property have been enforced , albeit moderately .
Web design is a young creative field .
Already , we ’ve seen designers work for free , or undercutting each other .
If you follow web design blogs in recent months , you may be thinking that I ’m going to talk about anti-spec work .
I ’m not because so many people have talked about anti-spec work in far better detail than I could .
Instead , I ’m going to talk about another related phenomenon that ’s been hurting web designers : the devaluing of the web industry by cheap labor .
The early years of my career as a freelance web designer were blessed by the dotcom bubble .
There was very little competition because every designer , from newbies to experienced had no trouble getting paid , and getting paid handsomely .
Every company had plenty to spend on their web sites , whether it was their own money , or money from their VCs .
After the bubble burst , I found that freelancing became increasingly difficult .
A big part of the reason had to do with the economy .
Another factor was that web designers started working for free for spec work , or worked for very little in order to win a bid .
The value of web design in terms of dollars , have shifted .
Admittedly , during the bubble , design value was much inflated , resulting in clients paying thousands of dollars for a few static HTML pages .
I stopped freelancing and worked as an in - house UI designer for one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world .
I thought that working for a corporate company would spare me some integrity ( no more competing with cheaper designers ) and gain me some stability .
I was wrong .
I was hit by the biggest cheap labor scheme ever .
It ’s called out - sourcing .
My project team was dissolved after having worked on a high profile , multi-million dollar web project for three years .
We rarely hear about doctors or lawyers having this problem .
I think they are very smart people when it comes to earning as a community .
If everyone charges at the industry standard , then it ’s acceptable to propose a reasonable , livable figure to the client .
Whenever we lower our price to win a bid , we ’re essentially hurting the web design industry as a whole .
Devaluing our service gives clients a false impression that web design is cheap .
Good web design is NOT cheap .
It ’s more than slapping graphics with codes and calling it a web site .
Web design is about providing a solution .
Such creative problem - solving service mixed with technical know - how deserves a respectable pay .
Just how much should we charge ?
I ca n’t answer that with a $ figure .
However , I can only humbly suggest do not go lower than what your typical rate was during the good times .
Instead of thinking if you should charge less , I recommend offering more comprehensive services .
In doing so , you can even charge more .
A web designer ’s role is ever evolving .
Simply doing the technical work is n’t going to be enough .
What separates a good designer and an excellent designer ?
I ’ll spare you with the professionalism and love for the craft talk .
That ’s a given .
I feel , increasingly , that a web designer ’s role is offering the clients a solution .
This is more than creating a web site from a technical perspective .
Marketing , SEO , branding , social networking are the aspects we should offer to clients pro-actively .
I ’ll be Harlan Ellison - like here :
It ’s about the money .
It ’s about being paid .
If you do n’t care about how little you get paid , then switch careers and make web sites for your friends on the side as a hobby .
Recent economic recession has prompted me to write this article .
I feel tough times are happening again , and it ’s important to remind ourselves not to undervalue our work .
The UN says the carbohydrate - rich diet of many Gazans causes malnutrition
By Paul Wood
BBC News , Gaza
People are not starving in Gaza but there is what the aid agencies call " food insecurity " .
To see what this means we visited the family of Fauzi Abu Gerada in Gaza City .
It is dusk , a crescent moon was just visible overhead , and Fauzi has lit a fire .
This is for cooking , heat , and light , as the electricity is still off in Gaza City .
Fauzi is 40 years old and has been unemployed since the intifada that started in 2000 prevented him from crossing into Israel to work as a labourer .
His wife and six children all live with him in a single - roomed house , scraping by on food aid from the United Nations and others .
" I have no income to feed my children .
Sometimes I cannot even give them bread , " he told me .
" We beg some food from here , and some food from there .
Our life is begging . "
Looking despairingly at the breeze block and wood shack which was their home , he adds : " Eight people all live in this one room here .
The water comes in in the winter but I do n't even have money for a plastic sheet to put on the roof .
" We are suffering .
It 's like living underground .
Once I thought I 'd burn the house down with everybody in it just to escape this misery . "
People were hungry , literally .
There was a shortage of everything here , including food , and we actually ran out for a couple of days
John Ging
Head of Gaza operation , UNRWA
The family 's diet is heavy in bread , rice and vegetable oil .
Earlier this month , a leaked report from the International Committee of the Red Cross found that this kind of diet - carbohydrate - rich , but lacking in vitamins - was causing malnutrition among Gaza 's children .
On Thursday , Israel lifted its closure of the border crossings into Gaza to allow in much needed international humanitarian aid , mainly food .
Journalists were also allowed in for the first time in weeks .
We walked the quarter mile of no -man 's - land between the Israeli and Palestinian checkpoints , past the ruins of buildings hit by Israeli airstrikes .
Our arrival was filmed by Gaza TV .
Such is the feeling of isolation here that journalists coming in from the outside world is seen as an event in itself .
As we waited for our car to arrive , a bullet whined overhead .
" Israeli , " one of the Palestinian porters said , unconcerned at what was , apparently a regular event .
Empty warehouses
Over the past month , the border crossings have been open for just five days .
That is why the UN 's food warehouses here are empty .
The food which came in on Thursday went straight to distribution centres .
There is no slack in the system .
Guide : Gaza under blockade Gaza voices :
Life under blockade John Ging , head of the UN's Gaza relief operations , met me in one of his empty warehouses .
He reminded me that more than a million people in Gaza depended on UN for their next meal .
" Daily life is a struggle to survive .
People were hungry , literally .
There was a shortage of everything here , including food , and we actually ran out for a couple of days , " he said , looking back over the past month .
He went on : " The fact that it continues to get worse and worse adds to the despair so we 're searching desperately for reasons to have realistic hope . "
Mr Ging called on both sides - Israel and the Palestinians - to take action that would build confidence .
Rocket fire from Gaza into Israel had to stop , he said .
And Israel had to stop punishing the whole of Gaza for such incidents : " Otherwise you give the agenda to people who are firing rockets . "
Crumbling ceasefire Tension has risen in Gaza over the past month as the ceasefire with Israel has been progressively breaking down .
There seems little optimism , on either side , that the already shaky truce can be sustained when it comes up for renewal in two weeks ' time .
Mahmoud Zahar , perhaps the most influential member of the Hamas leadership in Gaza , told me that peace was in Israel 's hands .
" It depends on the Israeli side , " he said .
" If they are going to commit to what we already agreed upon - stoppage of all aggression against the Palestinian people , opening the gates for free communication on a commercial level .
The people will discuss this thoroughly . "
He added : " We have to defend ourselves against the Israeli aggression by all means , as we are accustomed to do . "
The Palestinian armed groups are meeting now to discuss their next move against what they see as continuing Israeli aggression .
Israel , too , is considering whether it will have to take what it would consider pre-emptive action against a gathering threat .
If the ceasefire is not revived , if there is closure once again , Fauzi 's family and thousands of others like it can expect much more misery .

Please do n’t believe the Treasury ’s estimates on borrowing in Monday ’s report .
In the last five years , it has underestimated the true level of borrowing by a total of £ 121 billion .
Our report is also about honesty .
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor have said that the public finances can withstand a burst of extra borrowing .
In fact the UK has the fourth highest structural budget deficit in the OECD .
Including the Government ’s long term spending commitments on pensions and education , the deficit stands at 6.6 per cent of GDP .
Without changes in spending , that means eventual tax rises of £ 100 billion , or £ 4,000 per household , which would wipe out over a quarter of families ’ disposable income .
Reform ’s Consultant Director , Nick Bosanquet , points out that the Government has misread Keynes .
Keynes actually focused on confidence ; a true Keynesian position would be about measures to raise confidence and demand in the private sector .
Instead we have what he calls “ Toxic Keynesianism ” – the view that what we need is big government spending programmes which will beat unemployment and further increase the role of the state .
This is also why fiscal stimuli in the form of crisis tax cuts do n’t work .
Either the electorate will discount them because they know the money has to be paid back in higher taxes .
Or – this is the view of the academic authority , Stephen Ceccheti – governments will avoid the higher taxes and the public finances will get even further out of balance .
The Chancellor wants to introduce a stimulus to give the electorate the confidence to increase consumption .
But the overwhelming academic evidence is that what actually restores confidence is a sense that governments have regained control of their finances .
This is why many economies – including the UK in the early 1980s – had the paradoxical experience of a return to growth after tax increases .
Andrew Haldenby is director of the think - tank Reform , which today publishes a report ,
The hole we are in and how to get out of it , presenting new evidence that a fiscal stimulus – whether tax reductions or spending increases – will prolong the recession .
This , he says , is worrying since the Government is expected to announce just such a package in the Pre-Budget Report next week .
And it ’s about culture .
In retrospect the UK has endured a long period of living beyond its means , supported by interest rates held far too low .
We have become used to unsustainable levels of debt and consumption ( we use the graphic image of the “ obese economy ” ) .
We now need to find a new path based amongst other things on saving ( remember that ? ) .
A fiscal stimulus would be the last hurrah of the debt - binge era .
It ’s time to move on .
Instead the Chancellor should get a grip of public spending .
That does not mean crisis cuts in public spending , which would increase inefficiency and – by creating a perception of under - funding – lead to demands for higher spending later on .
This , by the way , was the story of the 1990s .
Crisis ( Conservative ) spending cuts led to a popular demand for ( Labour ) spending increases .
The UK public sector needs to leave behind this cycle of boom and bust .
Instead it means the programme of public service reform that the Government should have introduced years ago .
The recession should give the Government the courage to tackle the root causes of inefficiency .
Above all that means the workforce agreements with public sector workers and the political direction from Whitehall .
Much of the programme will save money immediately .
We ca n’t underestimate how much of the inefficiency of public spending is due to the targetry and tinkering to which most Ministers and senior officials remain addicted .
A typical finding of our research is that the leaders of public services have the tools to change the way their services are run but are continually distracted by political priorities , from hospital cleanliness to changes to school curricula to ever - changing rules on use of police resources .
The only cost of putting targets on a bonfire would be a certain amount of Ministerial embarrassment .
The gains would be immediate and large - even if for example the NHS became only 5 per cent more efficient ( and it would be much more ) , that would save over £ 25 billion during a Parliament .
The Chancellor can also set out a productivity agenda for the private sector and individuals .
We suggest greater competition between businesses – the Lloyds / HBOS merger is ill - omened – and deregulation .
We should also enable individuals to make better use of their own money .
Public sector reform should open up the room for sustainable reductions in marginal tax rates , improving productivity .
In the short term , the automatic stabilisers have to be allowed to work and overall public spending will rise due to higher benefit payments .
At the same time , the Government must reform the rest of public spending .
We suggest that the Chancellor should revise his Comprehensive Spending Review and republish it with the March Budget .
When the Chancellor drew up his last spending forecast , he expected growth of 2.75 per cent in 2009 .
It will actually be less than minus 1 per cent .
His proposals for spending ( excepting the automatic stabilisers ) need to be revised downwards .
The Conservative Party ’s new policy on public spending therefore looks well - judged and well supported by the evidence .
The danger of excessive borrowing is real .
The remaining challenge is over public service reform .
We read that the Conservative Party is looking for “ waste ” to justify reductions in public spending ( rather like the James Review in the last Parliament ) .
That is n’t good enough – the problem is n’t “ waste ” but the structures that lead to the waste .
There is no avoiding the need to tackle head - on factors like the terms and conditions of public sector workers .
There is also no avoiding the NHS – it ’s the biggest budget ( £ 100 billion ) and ca n’t just be appeased .
The Conservatives faced down union opposition in the early 1980s recession , to the great benefit of the economy .
Will they find the courage to repeat their achievement in today ’s recession , in the public sector ?
Next year the recession will bite hard .
Policy makers will be confronted with unemployment and public finance figures that keep on getting worse and worse .
Further damage to the public finances will be recognised to be highly irresponsible .
I hope Alistair Darling will reconsider .

Encouraging , But ...
When the Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) issues a " Class 1 recall " of a device , service , or medication being offered the public , that 's serious .
It means that they believe the item has a reasonable probability that it will cause " adverse health consequences or death . "
Now , I do n't think it took concentrated investigative powers of perception for the Administration to determine that anything called a " Vibrational Integrated Bio-photonic Energizer " - made by manufacturer VIBE Technologies of Greeley , Colorado , or the " HLX8 " device made by Nebion of Los Angeles , California , might not perform as advertised .
The VIBE device is sold to treat cancer , infections , and depression , while the HLX8 claims to treat : cancer - breast , bone , lung , and pancreatic , carpel tunnel syndrome , migraine , premenstrual syndrome , rheumatoid arthritis , shingles , sports injuries , sprains , and ruptured discs - an obviously wider range of ailments .
Recalls were issued on both company 's products .
Dr. Daniel G. Schultz , director of the FDA 's Center for Devices and Radiological Health , said :
These recalls underscore the importance of taking action against manufacturers who make false medical claims for their devices ...
One of the FDA 's primary responsibilities is protecting consumers from harm that can be caused by manufacturers who try to sidestep the approval and clearance process .
The FDA investigation of the VIBE claims began back in November of 2007 , when they found that the company had not obtained FDA marketing approval or clearance for their device .
On April 11 , 2008 , they issued a warning letter to them , and also cited the company for deviations from the Good Manufacturing Practice / Quality System regulations .
More than a year passed before the FDA finally decided to close them down , while customers continued to purchase and use the product .
The FDA was aware of information suggesting that the VIBE device was used for cancer patients , and death occurred to one patient who used it , though the FDA has not verified that there is an association between that death and the device .
In June of 2008 , the FDA inspected Nebion , and found that the company had not obtained FDA marketing approval or clearance for the HLX8 device , and they also uncovered substantial deviations from the Good Manufacturing Practice / Quality System regulation .
As a result , Nebion recalled eight HLX8 devices , and notified their customers to stop using the devices immediately and to contact Nebion for their retrieval .
The FDA has not received any reports of injuries or deaths linked to the HLX8 device .
Under federal law , any product that claims to diagnose a disease or condition , to cure , mitigate , treat or prevent a disease , or that is intended to affect the structure or function of the human body , is a product subject to the jurisdiction of the FDA and may require their approval or clearance prior to marketing it .
Premarket approval is the most stringent type of FDA device review and is for devices with a high level of risk , such as those that support or sustain human life .
Regular FDA clearance is for lower risk devices or materials that are shown to be as safe and effective as similar devices or materials already on the market .
In summary , neither VIBE Technologies nor Nebion were able to show the FDA that their devices are safe and / or effective at curing or treating diseases , as they had claimed , and they have been withdrawn from sale .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Congress is looking into allegations that National Security Agency linguists have been eavesdropping on Americans abroad .
Government linguists say the U.S. eavesdropped on Americans , including military officers serving in Iraq .
The congressional oversight committees said Thursday that the Americans targeted included military officers in Iraq who called friends and family in the United States .
The allegations were made by two former military intercept operators on a television news report Thursday evening .
A terrorist surveillance program instituted by the Bush administration allows the intelligence community to monitor phone calls between the United States and overseas without a court order -- as long as one party to the call is a terror suspect .
Adrienne Kinne , a former U.S. Army Reserves Arab linguist , told ABC
News the NSA was listening to the phone calls of U.S. military officers , journalists and aid workers overseas who were talking about " personal , private things with Americans who are not in any way , shape or form associated with anything to do with terrorism . "
David Murfee Faulk , a former U.S. Navy Arab linguist , said in the news report that he and his colleagues were listening to the conversations of military officers in Iraq who were talking with their spouses or girlfriends in the United States .
According to Faulk , they would often share the contents of some of the more salacious calls stored on their computers , listening to what he called " phone sex " and " pillow talk . "
Both Kinne and Faulk worked at the NSA listening facility at Fort Gordon , Georgia .
They told ABC that when linguists complained to supervisors about eavesdropping on personal conversations , they were ordered to continue transcribing the calls .
NSA spokeswoman Judith Emmel said the agency 's Inspector General has investigated some of the allegations and found them " unsubstantiated . "
Other accusations are still being looked at , she said .
The NSA operates in " strict accordance with U.S. laws and regulations , " she said .
" Any allegation of wrongdoing by employees is thoroughly investigated " and if misconduct is discovered , " we take swift and certain remedial action . "
CIA Director Mike Hayden , who was the head of the NSA when the terrorist surveillance program began , has always maintained that private conversations of Americans are not intercepted and if it should happen inadvertently , the name is removed from the record .
" At NSA , the law was followed assiduously , " said Hayden 's spokesman , Mark Mansfeld .
" The notion that Gen .
Hayden sanctioned or tolerated illegalities of any sort is ridiculous on its face . "
Author Jim Bamford was the first to interview the two former NSA linguists for his new book , " The Shadow Factory , " which will be published next week .
Bamford told CNN the accounts from the whistle - blowers demonstrate the NSA was listening to the private conversations of Americans , transcribing them and keeping them .
" They do n't delete them , " he said .
Bamford has written two other books on the NSA and was a party to an unsuccessful ACLU lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Terrorist Surveillance Program .
The ACLU issued a statement on Thursday saying the allegations show that the government " misled the American public about the scope of its surveillance activities . "
The ABC report " is an indictment not only of the Bush administration , but of all of those political leaders , Democratic and Republican , who have been saying that the executive branch can be trusted with surveillance powers that are essentially unchecked , " said ACLU official Jamell Jaffer .
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller , D - West Virginia , called the allegations " extremely disturbing . "
" Anytime there is an allegation regarding abuse of the privacy and civil liberties of Americans , it is a very serious matter , " said Rockefeller , adding that his committee is prepared to take whatever action is necessary to ensure the government is following the strict procedures to protect U.S. citizens against unwarranted surveillance .
A House Intelligence Committee spokesman said the panel has been in contact with the NSA and is awaiting the agency 's response .
All About National Security Agency • Central Intelligence Agency
WASHINGTON  When a Congressional committee subpoenaed Harry S. Truman in 1953 , nearly a year after he left office , he made a startling claim :
Even though he was no longer president , the Constitution still empowered him to block subpoenas .
“ If the doctrine of separation of powers and the independence of the presidency is to have any validity at all , it must be equally applicable to a president after his term of office has expired , ” Truman wrote to the committee .
Congress backed down , establishing a precedent suggesting that former presidents wield lingering powers to keep matters from their administration secret .
Now , as Congressional Democrats prepare to move forward with investigations of the Bush administration , they wonder whether that claim may be invoked again .
“ The Bush administration overstepped in its exertion of executive privilege , and may very well try to continue to shield information from the American people after it leaves office , ” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse , Democrat of Rhode Island , who sits on two committees , Judiciary and Intelligence , that are examining aspects of Mr. Bush ’s policies .

Creating Filesystems with Ruby and FUSE
Posted by Steve on Fri 7 Nov 2008 at 19:30
The FUSE project allows you to create filesystems in userspace - which means you can create a filesystem without having to get your hands dirty and modify your kernel source .
This is insanely cool , and can be used for many purposes .
Here we 're going to look at using the Ruby bindings to create a simple filesystem .
The FUSE project allows you to create a filesystem entirely in userspace merely by writing a couple of primitives - such as :
Get contents of directory .
Get file permissions .
Write to file .
With enough of the basic primitives implemented you 'll end up with a working filesystem .
Unfortunately unless you 're a fan of working in C this process is a little more complex than it should be .
To ease this there are bindings for Perl , Ruby , and other languages which makes getting started very simple .
My recent FUSE experiments have been Ruby - based , using the libfusefs - ruby 1.8 packages .
Assuming you 're working with a recent kernel you should be able to get started writing a filesystem very quickly .
Here 's what it took for me :
trashvm : ~# apt - get install libfusefs - ruby1.8 fuse - utils ruby 1.8
Reading package lists ...
Done Building dependency tree ...
Done
The following extra packages will be installed : libfuse2 libruby 1.8
The following NEW packages will be installed fuse - utils libfuse2 libfusefs - ruby1.8 libruby1.8 0 upgraded , 4 newly installed , 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded .
Need to get 1716 kB of archives .
After unpacking 6476 kB of additional disk space will be used . ..
Once I installed the packages I inserted the fuse kernel module :
trashvm : ~# modprobe fuse
Assuming this completes without errors you 're ready to begin !
Lets create a simple filesystem that just proves we can .
Create the file hello.rb :
require ' fusefs ' class HelloDir def contents ( path ) [ ' hello.txt ' ] end def file ?( path ) path == ' / hello.txt ' end def read_file ( path ) " Hello , World !
" end end hellodir = HelloDir.new FuseFS.set_root ( hellodir ) #
Mount under a directory given on the command line .
FuseFS.mount_under ARGV.shift FuseFS.run
Once you 've done that you can mount your filesystem by running :
trashvm : ~# mkdir hello / trashvm : ~# ruby hello.rb hello / &
Once you 've done this you should find you 've got a directory called " hello / " which has our filesystem mounted in it .
This filesystem just creates a file called " hello.txt " - and when you read it you 'll get the expected contents :
trashvm : ~/hello# ls hello. txt trashvm :~/hello# cat hello
Hello , World !
You can now kill the userspace program and all will be gone :
trashvm : ~# kill - 9 %1 [ 1 ] +
Killed ruby1.8 hello.rb hello trashvm : ~# umount hello trashvm : ~# ls hello trashvm : ~#
All gone .
Now is time to confess that I did n't create that hello.rb file - it is one of the examples included with the libfusefs - ruby 1.8 package .
If you take a look beneath /usr / share / doc / libfusefs - ruby 1.8 directory you 'll find several examples which each work in a similar way to the one we 've demonstrated .
So , what could you do with a FUSE filesystem ?
Well if you 're creative there are almost no limits .
As a more useful example I 've placed a simple filesystem I created online at the foot of this article .
This allows you to mount MySQL as a filesystem :
skx@gold:/mysql/yawns$ ls about_pages.data notifications.data related.data about_pages.sql notifications.sql related.sql adverts.data permissions.data scratchpads.data adverts.sql permissions.sql scratchpads.sql articles.data poll_anon_voters.data sessions.data articles.sql poll_anon_voters.sql sessions.sql bookmarks.data poll_answers.data submission_notes.data bookmarks.sql poll_answers.sql submission_notes.sql comments.data poll_questions.data submissions.data comments.sql poll_questions.sql submissions.sql db_version.data poll_submissions_answers.data tags.data db_version.sql poll_submissions_answers.sql tags.sql ip_blacklist.data poll_submissions.data tips.data ip_blacklist.sql poll_submissions.sql tips.sql messages.data poll_voters.data users.data messages.sql poll_voters.sql users.sql news.data preferences.data weblogs.data news.sql preferences.sql weblogs.sql
Each directory beneath / mysql is a database , and each table of that database is presented as two files :
foo.sql - Just the table structure .
- Just the table structure .
foo.data -
The contents of the table .
The code is very simple and mostly revolves around invoking mysqldump correctly , but despite that it is surprisingly useful .
I 'd love to hear suggestions on interesting uses for FUSE , and what you 're doing with it !
This is the code which implements the MySQL filesystem .
It is very short as it only involves implementing a couple of methods :

ARCHIVES | SEARCH iSpy an iPhone Spy Posted by Response @ 15:44 GMT
There are some new developments on the mobile security front .
Spy tool applications are now available for Apple 's iPhone .
Symbian and Windows Mobile spy tools have been around from two and a half to almost three years .
Now it would seem that it 's finally the iPhone 's turn .
One of the two spy vendors appears to require a jailbroken iPhone .
They also claim to be the " first and only " spy software .
If only that were true .
Their application can be installed on 3G model iPhones .
… and on December 21st , a second option will be available .
This vendor 's comparison chart claims quality and features over costs .
Note that their application lets you " secertely " spy .
It does n't seem entirely sure based their promotional promises , but it appears that vendor number two may be able to jailbreak , install , and then un-jailbreak the iPhone during its installation .
It can be installed on older iPhones as well as current .
We wonder what Apple 's position on this will be ; will they do anything about it ?
What do you think ?
We wo n't bother providing these spy vendors with a backlink to our weblog , so if you want to see more , use the addresses in the image below .

Former Home Secretary Charles Clarke has warned that plans to overhaul how police forces are held accountable are ' very dangerous to society ' and will ' destroy ' efforts to tackle crime .
The comments by one of New Labour 's former leading lights threaten to undermine government attempts to introduce directly elected representatives on to the boards of police authorities , the regional bodies which determine how each of the country 's forces tackles crime .
They come as a survey of senior police officers reveals that almost as many believe such a move will make fighting crime harder .
The Local Government Association , the cross-party organisation representing councils in England , surveyed all 212 senior police officers in charge of local policing .
Of the 65 who responded , 79 per cent said the government 's plans will make their jobs more difficult .
In a letter to Sir Jeremy Beecham , vice - chairman of the association , seen by The Observer , Clarke warned that the creation of the new ' crime and policing representatives ' will result in a politicisation of the police .
The representatives will be elected in local elections solely on their manifestos for cutting crime .
Concerns have already been expressed that the move will result in extremist parties such as the BNP securing positions on police authorities .
Clarke said that he could envisage a situation where the representatives are elected on single - platform manifestos such as to ' arm all police ' or to ' prevent officers taking certain forms of action in industrial disputes ' .
He warned that this will create tensions for forces which will have to make an ' invidious choice ' between ignoring the views of a directly elected politician or ' implementing a policy that they believed to be operationally quite wrong ' .
We 're approaching one of those paradigm shifts again .
Knowledge of functional programming ( FP ) is on the verge of becoming a must - have skill .
Now , we 're not talking about a shift on the scale of the tectonic movement that object - oriented programming brought on .
Functional programming has been around since the creation of LISP in 1958 and has n't taken over application development , nor is it about to .
FP wo n't make your word processing program faster or better .
But there are domains where it is highly useful , and in particular FP looks like the paradigm of choice for unlocking the power of multicore processors .
Functional programming languages are ideally suited to , as one developer succinctly puts it , " solving the multicore problem . "
Which is a big deal , because the chipmakers have essentially said that the job of enforcing Moore 's Law is now a software problem .
They will concentrate on putting more and more cores on a die , and it's up to you to recraft your software to take advantage of the parallel - processing capabilities of their chips .
And that means that there are real benefits in becoming proficient in parallel functional programming , and , as will be argued momentarily , that means functional programming .
The bad news ?
Getting good at functional programming is hard , harder than moving from iterative Pascal or Basic or C coding to object - oriented development .
It 's an exaggeration but a useful one :
When you move to FP , all your algorithms break .
FP : What It Is
Most modern programming languages , including object - oriented languages , are imperative : A program is essentially a list of instructions intended to be executed in order .
Functional programming languages derive from the declarative style branch of the language tree , where there need be no explicit flow of control .
This branch bifurcates further , with one branch leading to the logic - flavored languages , primarily Prolog , and one branch leading to the functional languages , the prime historical example being Lisp .
Lisp and many other FP languages are based on , and are essentially implementations of , Alonzo Church 's lambda calculus , a formal model for computation .
Two defining features of functional languages are that all computations are treated as the evaluation of a function and that functional language programs avoid state and mutable data .
Every variable is really a constant .
You can't change the state of anything , and no function can have side effects , which is the reason why FP is ideal for distributing algorithms over multiple cores .
You never have to worry about some other thread modifying a memory location where you 've stored some value .
You do n't have to bother with locks and deadlocks and race conditions and all that mess .
Some companies , Ericsson , for example , are making good money exploiting this virtue of functional programming .
This is too good to be true , of course .
No side effects means no I /O , for example .
You can't really do anything if you can't modify any values or change state .
Yet it can be shown that the lambda calculus is equivalent to a Turing machine , so you must be able to perform calculations using FP .
How ?
The answer is that FP languages store state in function parameters that is , on the stack .
They also cheat when it 's practical to do so , breaking the pure FP paradigm in carefully controlled ways .
Monads are one such trick : Impure functions that have side effects and that can call pure FP functions but can't be called by them .
That other defining feature ?
Everything is a function .
When I learned Lisp , my professor taught that no program should be longer than three lines , four in a pinch .
The idea is that the entire program is one function , and that this function simply calls two or three other functions that , if they existed , would do the job .
Then you write those functions , and the functions they require , until eventually you are writing exclusively in primitive functions , at which point you 're done .
In any functional programming language , you are likely to encounter these features :
First - class functions , or higher - order functions : Functions can serve as arguments and results of functions .
Recursion as the primary tool for iteration .
Heavy use of pattern matching , although technically it is not a defining feature of FP .
Lazy evaluation , which makes possible the creation of infinite sequences and other data structures .
Here 's the canonical example of a functional program , the factorial function , in Haskell :
factorial n = if n > 0 then n * factorial ( n - 1 ) else 1
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Citigroup Inc. suffered another brutal day on Thursday as shares tumbled to their lowest level in more than 15 years .
News that the giant bank 's largest individual shareholder , Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal , planned to increase his stake to 5 % did little to resolve questions enveloping Citi in recent days .
" Unfortunately it seems like they [ sellers ] are sitting on Citi here , " said Todd Leaon , head trader at Cowen & Co . " It 's sell first and ask questions later . "
Shares of Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) cratered 26 % , extending the brutal losses from Wednesday , when the stock lost nearly a quarter of its value .
So far this year , Citigroup stock is down 83 % .
The Wall Street Journal , citing sources familiar with the situation , reported Thursday night that Citi executives were set to meet Friday to discuss their options , including selling off pieces of the company to raise capital .
The move by Alwaleed , a long - time investor in the New York - based bank , follows the U.S. government 's decision to inject some $ 25 billion .
That left Alwaleed with about a 4 % stake in Citigroup .
Alwaleed , in a press release from his holding company , expressed his faith in Citigroup management , including CEO Vikram Pandit .
He added that he believed the company was doing what is necessary to weather the current economic crisis .
Alwaleed 's firm did not provide terms of the purchase including how many shares he would purchase or at what price .
Based on the most recent securities filings , Alwaleed and his holding company owned more than 250 million shares of Citigroup .
Alwaleed is one of the world 's richest people and worth about $ 21 billion , according to Forbes .
The Saudi prince first acquired a stake in Citicorp , which later became Citigroup , in 1991 .
According to filings , Alwaleed also is a big investor in media company News Corp and online travel site Priceline.com .
Earlier this year , he was among a group of investors who invested $ 12.5 billion in Citigroup , as part of an effort by the bank to raise capital .
Citigroup , one of the hardest hit financial firms during the credit crisis , has faced plenty of scrutiny in recent weeks .
Earlier this week , the New York City - based bank unveiled plans to cut its staff levels by more than 50,000 in an attempt to reduce expenses as it braces for what many are anticipating will be a difficult economic climate in 2009 .
There has even been talk that changes could come at the top of the organization although the company has strenuously denied such speculation .
At the same time , analysts have warned that the company still faces a large exposure to problem assets , such as mortgages , credit cards and commercial real estate .
Fox - Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller analyst David Trone noted in a report earlier this week that the bank would likely be forced to take additional writedowns and report another loss in the fourth - quarter .
The bank has lost more than $ 20 billion in the past four quarters .
Citigroup is also bracing for a tough economic climate in 2009 , which could translate to rising losses tied to consumer and business loans .
Scientists study for years to give us advances like computers .
Lawyers sue scientists on behalf of people who can't operate computers , earn ten times as much and , in doing so , raise horribly relevant questions about which group is actually smarter .
Here we see seven of the worst offenses of law against science :
7 Flower Power Versus Particle Physics
Walter Wagner enjoyed a lot of media attention a few months ago , bringing a lawsuit against the Large Hadron Collider which he claims will destroy the world .
While Wagner repeatedly pointed out that he 's a scientist , he failed to mention that he 's a botanist , also known as a " plant scientist " , also known as " the closest they come to particle physics is sneezing at pollen .
Now , while we 're sure Wagner knows his way around a tulip , it 's important to note that his only recorded experience with nuclear science comes from working in a hospital that performed nuclear medicine and , unless they treated Galactus , that does n't involve a lot of superstring ultrascience .

" Bees...pollen...bees - My God ... the LHC will destroy us all . "
Get over yourself , Wagner .
Plenty of unqualified smartasses warn the world about the LHC , but they 're not suing anyone .
While his website is quick to point out his impressive credentials ( " wikipedia science editor " ) , as well as remind everyone how expensive his particular brand of scientific exploration is going to cost ( " We expect to encounter expenses in excess of $ 100,000 in this action " ) , it strangely fails to mention his 2004 indictment for first - degree identity theft and fraud in Hawaii .
Also missing from the website : reasonable , non-retarded evidence to support his claims about the collider .
Still , Wagner believed he was going to save the world , and if that meant getting totally rich and famous in the process , Wagner was prepared to carry that weight .
He truly is a hero .

Or , at least he was : the judge in the Honolulu court he filed the case in had to explain that they do n't actually have jurisdiction over Switzerland .
" Exhibit A , your Honor : A map of America that does n't feature Switzerland .
I rest my case . "
Since Switzerland is pretty clearly not part of this country , that ruling may not surprise you .
In fairness , though , Wagner 's a flower doctor , so you can't expect him to understand something as complex as geography .
You can , however , still donate to Wagner and his cause , in case you either support lunatics or just plain hate real science .

VIENNA–Oil prices plummeted Thursday as the already battered market reacted to unexpectedly high U.S. unemployment figures – the latest dramatic evidence of recession in the world 's largest market for crude .
With cold weather settling in parts of the U.S. and the rest of the Northern hemisphere , this time of year is normally bullish for the market .
But the weak US jobs report added to the gloom spread by other dire economic data to counteract the usual trend for increased winter demand .
Skittish U.S. employers slashed 533,000 jobs in November , the most in 34 years , catapulting the unemployment rate to 6.7 per cent , according to figures released by the Labor Department Friday .
As companies cut down on their work force , the U.S. unemployment rate bolted from 6.5 per cent in October to 6.7 per cent last month , a 15 - year high .
" The damage to the economy by the financial turmoil is much bigger than the market initially thought , " said Tetsu Emori , commodity markets fund manager at ASTMAZ Futures Co. in Tokyo .
" The economic data now is much worse than what we expected a few months ago . ''
Light , sweet crude for January delivery was down $ 1.43 at $ 42.24 a barrel – nearly a 4 year low – in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange by afternoon in Europe after going as low as $ 42.05 on release of the jobs statistics .
The contract fell $ 3.12 overnight to settle at $ 43.67 , the lowest since January 2005 .
" Baby it 's cold out there ... on the NYMEX that is , " wrote trader and analyst Stephen Schork in his Schork Report .
" Given how weak price action is there , last night 's 15 F ( - 9 C ) temps in Chicago seem downright balmy . ''
Oil prices have fallen about 70 per cent since peaking at $ 147.27 in July .
Fresh dismal economic news Thursday in the U.S. also pointed to a sharp contraction of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter and weakening demand for crude products , such as gasoline .
The government said the number of people continuing to claim unemployment benefits last week reached 4.09 million , the highest level since December 1982 , while the proportion of workers receiving benefits matched a level reached 16 years ago , in September 1992 .
Factory orders plunged a bigger - than - expected 5.1 per cent in October , caused by big cutbacks in demand for steel , autos , computers and heavy machinery .
It was the largest decrease since an 8.5 per cent fall in July 2000 .

A weekly series from the Ruby Masters
This week , we ’re happy to have Yehuda Katz from USA .
Satish Talim >>
Welcome , Yehuda and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts .
For the benefit of the readers , could you tell us something about your self ?
Yehuda >>
I ’m the current maintainer of the Merb project , and also work on the jQuery and DataMapper projects .
Together , Merb , DataMapper , and jQuery are a killer stack that really ramps up productivity .
I was an Accounting major in college , and got involved with Ruby in 2005 , in the pre-1.0 days of Ruby on Rails .
I love Ruby and the community around it , and believe that the future is bright for the language .
I currently work for Engine Yard on the Merb project .
Keith Brady , Australia >>
What are the pros and cons of Ruby that are being discussed in the development community and what is your opinion on that ?
Yehuda >>
A lot of people have talked about Ruby as too slow to really be viable .
I debunked that in my keynote at MerbCamp .
Because Rubyists are so industrious , most of the critical path of Ruby applications have been optimized in C ( with servers like Thin and Ebb and bindings to XML libraries like LibXML ) .
People are also concerned about the development process of the Standard Ruby .
On the bright side , the RubySpec project has created a runnable test suite for what Ruby is , and the alternative implementations ( Rubinius and JRuby ) are pushing the language forward .
What ’s great about Ruby is how quickly it exposes new developers to advanced programming techniques , like lambdas .
You ca n’t get past simple iterations in Ruby before being exposed to lambdas , and many methods in common frameworks accept blocks ( one of Ruby ’s lambdas ) .
Additionally , Ruby ’s mutability makes it very easy to implement ceremony - less extensions to the language that make building frameworks like Rails or Merb simple and easy to use .
Compare Rails or Merb with CakePHP or Struts if you want to see what I mean .
Finally , something that is n’t really related to the language itself is Rails ’ strong emphasis on the 80/20 rule and convention over configuration .
While Merb tries to go even further by making it possible to opt out of the conventions more granularly , the basic idea is fairly permeated in the Ruby community .
It ’s very difficult to make a Ruby library popular if it requires out - of - the - box configuration and does not attempt to provide a certain amount of common defaults .
Willian Molinari , Brazil >>
What has been your biggest challenge while working with Ruby ?
Yehuda >>
I ’d say the biggest challenge of working with Ruby is how dynamic the language is .
While it makes it possible to create really powerful , simple language extensions ( and thus makes Rails or Merb possible ) , those same features allow Ruby libraries to hide complexity and changes that are n’t easy to track down .
The popular alias_method_chain feature , for instance , combined with metaprogramming creates methods that run in your application but that you ca n’t easily look at in source .
In fact , it can sometimes be nearly impossible to figure out where all the pieces even come from .
That ’s the reason for the Merb rule against alias_method_chain , but you ca n’t really solve this problem without making Ruby significantly less powerful .
It ’s important for Ruby programmers to define clear APIs for libraries that they release , and try to avoid opaque magic where possible .
Where not possible , library developers should clearly document exactly what they ’re doing , so people trying to debug those libraries can understand the underlying codebase .
Satish Talim >>
Most beginners in Ruby , would like to contribute their time , skills and expertise to a project but invariably are unaware of where and how to do so .
Could you suggest some ?
Yehuda >>
Merb of course !
While I may be biased , the Merb project has a simple enough codebase ( at around 6,000 lines for the core framework ) to take a look at some outstanding tickets and dive in quickly .
It ’s also a relatively popular framework , so contributions you make could start helping developers very quickly .
You can get information on how to get started contributing to Merb .
You might also dive into other edgy projects like DataMapper or YARD .
Both could use some love , but have the potential to really be game - changers to the Ruby ecosystem , so getting involved now could be a great way to get in on the ground floor .
The only thing I ’d add is that when getting involved in a project , make sure to understand the culture and goals of the project .
Be humble while learning the rules and idiosyncrasies of the project and its team .
Keith Brady , Australia >>
What types of applications are currently being developed in Ruby and what changes do you foresee over the next year or two ?
Yehuda >>
The biggest changes have to do with old Ruby infrastructure that ’s being pushed to the breaking point .
Rubygems , rake , and rdoc were all fantastic pieces of software during the earliest days of Ruby in the US , but the community is putting so much pressure on the projects that significant changes are afoot .
Rubygems , for instance , really needs support for “ packages ” , a simple change that could dramatically improve the way large Ruby projects package their applications .
I ’d look for modifications or wholesale replacement of core pieces of Ruby infrastructure over the next year .
Michael Uplawski , Germany >>
According to you , what is a comfortable size of a Ruby / Rails - project ?
Why ?
Yehuda >>
Once a Ruby projects gets larger than about 5 - 10,000 lines of code , I like to start breaking it up into modules .
When I say modules , I mean defined sub- projects with their own external APIs that other modules connect to .
This prevents the sort of intertwined Ruby projects that are extremely difficult to refactor because of how connected everything is to everything else .
In a Merb project , I ’d strongly recommend using slices for this purpose .
Merb itself uses rubygems to separate out the core framework ( around 6,000 LOC ) and additional modules , which all use the same plugin API that we expect users to use in general .
Dennis Theisen , Germany >>
Do you think Ruby is ready to be used in “ Enterprise applications ” ?
Kindly justify your answer .
Yehuda >>
Absolutely .
The productivity benefits alone justify using Ruby in the Enterprise .
While certain parts of Ruby might still be rough ( SOAP support is a good example ) , the language itself , and the frameworks surrounding it are so productive that it ’s worth having to deal with the oddities of SOAP4R , for instance .
Ruby is also fundamentally changing the way Enterprises should think about software .
While it ’s simple to think that you ’re building a piece of software from the ground up with very little common infrastructure , the fact is that proprietary applications built inside enterprises are constantly reinventing the same wheels over and over and over .
Since Ruby and its supporting infrastructure is open source , large companies can leverage the power of the work others are doing to avoid having to reinvent the wheel .
Additionally , as more and more large companies , like Yellow Pages , begin to use Ruby , the feedback loop becomes more powerful as more and more large companies feed back into the community .
Engine Yard , the company I work for , has been on the forefront of encouraging contributions , and the ecosystem around Rails and Merb is growing every day ( Gartner found that 1,000,000 developers are already using Ruby , and that number is expected to grow to 4,000,000 in just a few years ) .
Satish Talim >>
Do you have any other suggestions for these participants ( would - be Ruby developers ) ?
Yehuda >>
Do n’t be seduced by the power of the dark side .
But seriously , Ruby is an extremely powerful language , but you should still define clear , consistent APIs to use both internally and in libraries .
When testing , test those interfaces .
Avoid mocking out large pieces of the interfaces that prevent you from determining whether the full application or library works .
A clear API , with only a few public parts exposed , is worth its weight in pixie dust .
Satish Talim >>
Thanks Yehuda for sharing your views with the RubyLearning participants .

The Path to Ruby Mastery Series ( So Far ) :
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , in an interview on “ 60 Minutes ” Sunday night , lifted the veil on some tricks of the trade in both his cinematic and political careers .
With reporter Scott Pelley lifting weights as they spoke , Schwarzenegger hinted that when he played a muscle man in the movies , he just pretended to lift 300 pounds .
“ I mean , when you do it for the cameras you only do 50 , so you take it easy , ” he said .
“ You do n’t kill yourself . ”
He described a scene in the movie “ Stay Hungry ” with actress Sally Field in which he had to lift 225 pounds over and over .
“ I learned very quickly : Put on wooden plates , ” Schwarzenegger said .

“ You ’re not telling me that ’s what you did in the movies , ” Pelley said .
The governor responded , laughing : " . . .
No , no , not me . ”
His governing style apparently involves some acting as well .
“ People think show business was in Hollywood , but I think [ Ronald ] Reagan was absolutely right , ” Schwarzenegger said .
“ If he would n’t have the training in acting , this would have been a very difficult job . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. consumers who wait too long to request government coupons to subsidize converter boxes for the digital television transition in February may come up empty - handed , a regulator has warned .
Due to a last - minute rush of coupon requests , demand may exceed supply in the coming month , said the Department of Commerce official overseeing the subsidy program .
Rep . Ed Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat who asked for the update on the digital TV transition , said Congress may need to quickly pass additional funds in early January for the coupons .
Congress ordered the switch to digital signals , effective February 17 , 2009 , to free up public airwaves for other uses such as for police and fire departments .
The switch will mean improved picture and sound for TV viewers , but about 15 percent of the population rely on analog - only over - the - air signals and therefore need a converter box to keep their screens from going black .
The government program doling out $ 40 coupons to subsidize the converter boxes is likely to reach the $ 1.34 - billion limit of its budgetary authority in the first week of January , said Meredith Attwell Baker , acting assistant secretary for Communications and Information at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration .
“ Once the obligation ceiling is reached , the program will hold coupon requests until funds from unredeemed coupons become available , ” said Baker in the December 24 letter to Markey who chairs the House subcommittee on telecommunications and Internet matters .
“ NTIA realizes that this would likely result in consumer confusion , ” she added .
If the high demand continues at its current rate of more than 1.5 million requests per week , the agency could run out of coupons in late January .
There are about 60 models of boxes to choose from , costing between $ 40 and $ 90 , before the coupon , according to Consumers Union , which produces the magazine Consumer Reports .
Markey said Baker ’s response was worrying .
“ It is becoming increasingly clear that at minimum Congress may need to quickly pass additional funding for the converter box program in early January , ” he said in a statement .
Courtenay Semel Wants Us to Google Her
Have you heard of ?
Well , if you answered no , you 're not the only one .
Back in August , a bouncer at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas made the mistake of not recognizing Yahoo bigwigs daughter .
Sadly for him , he will never forget ... or so he says .
Actually it is the pummeling that he suffered that is sticking with him .
You may remember seeing Courtenay practically attached to MTV reality show host Tila Tequila .
The two have been open about their relationship , though it 's been on and off recently .
Jaroslaw Jarczok , the " battered security guard " , is now suing Courtenay for beating him up and causing humiliation and anxiety .
In a lawsuit filed yesterday in the L.A. County Superior Court , he claims that at around 4:00 a.m. on that early August morning at Pure Nightclub , Semel was intoxicated and became belligerent .
In fact this is what she said to Jaroslaw :
" Do you even know who I am , F *! #ing idiot ?... Google me , you dumb F#*k . "
What do you think ?
We think it 's BS and is clearly a case of a security guard who has dollar signs dancing in his head .
Any judge worth his salt should pitch this frivolous claim right into the trash .
What does the job description for a security guard aka bouncer entail ?
Most would say they deal with and eject the very hammered and suddenly courageous clientele from their premises .
Instead he got bested by a girl with big bucks .

When Donald Trump came to Rancho Palos Verdes six years ago with plans for a world - class golf course , he was welcomed with open arms .
Then came the dispute with the city over his plan to name a street after himself .
And then came the battle with neighbors over his 12 - foot - tall ficus trees .
Now the mogul is suing the small town , and suing big .
He wants $ 100 million from a city with an annual budget just shy of $ 20 million .
In a lawsuit filed this week , Trump accused the city of fraud and civil rights violations , contending that the city was refusing to allow improvements needed to maintain the “ Trump image , ” including a clubhouse terrace and a row of ficus trees he was forced to cut down earlier .
“ I ’ve been looking forward for a long time to do this , ” Trump said of the lawsuit Friday in a phone interview from New York .
“ The town does everything possible to stymie everything I do . ”
Advertisement
But city leaders and some residents said the lawsuit was just another attempt by the real estate mogul to bully the community and avoid playing by the rules .
They call it the culmination of his history of run-ins with officials from the upscale , picturesque city of nearly 46,000 set amid the coves and beaches of the Palos Verdes Peninsula .
The city ’s mayor , Larry Clark , dismissed the charges and said the lawsuit may cause residents ’ already simmering ill will toward the developer to explode .
“ We have bent over backwards many , many times to work with Donald Trump , ” said Clark , who said he had spoken with Trump about the lawsuit .
“ I ’m sure this lawsuit is really going to anger a lot of the residents . ”
Among the angered citizens is 68 - year - old Jo Ann Michetti , who e-mailed a city councilman Friday urging him to “ please continue not to give in to this bully . ”
Advertisement
“ I think he just feels rules are n’t made for him , ” said Michetti , a retired liability investigator who has lived in the city since 1971 .
“ He expects them to say he can do it because he ’s Donald Trump . ”
Trump ’s relationship with residents did not start off this way .
When the New York - based developer first swept up the 300 - acre site , many thought the planned golf course would be a financial boon for a city economy just staggering out of a recession .
A landslide in 1999 had caused part of the property to collapse into the Pacific Ocean , driving the previous owners into bankruptcy .
Trump snagged the land for a deeply discounted $ 27 million , in his first West Coast real estate venture .
Michetti recalled Trump being “ charming ” and said residents “ fell over themselves ” for him and what he would do for the town .
City officials organized a business leaders ’ breakfast to introduce him to the community , Clark said .

Three years later , Trump ’s namesake golf course opened with an LPGA tournament where world - class golfers oohed and ahhed at the view of the vast ocean and the 45,000 - square - foot clubhouse decked out with a giant , elaborate crest on one wall .
But Trump soon started ruffling feathers , suing the school district over the lease of a piece of land it owned in the golf course and planting a row of tall ficus trees to block from view homes he deemed unsightly .
“ The law does not require the city or any regulators to allow him to have whatever he may wake up one morning and want , ” said Councilman Douglas Stern , who has long pitted himself against Trump .
Residents responded with rolling eyes and smirks when Trump repeatedly tried to have the adjacent Ocean Trails Drive renamed Trump National Drive .
Perhaps it should be called “ Ego Aisle ” or “ Narcissism Lane , ” some residents quipped in protest .
Advertisement
The central issue in the suit is a series of geological studies and reviews the city required of Trump ’s company to build on the landslide - prone site .
Clark and Stern said the city had an obligation to ensure that everything on the golf course was built to city codes , to ensure public safety .
Stuart Miller , Trump ’s attorney , said the city was unfairly holding him to higher standards and more stringent regulations .
Trump accused the city of trying to prolong his projects to extract fees from him , when , as he sees it , the town should be grateful for his developments .
“ I took a piece of land that was lying fallow , tied up in courts for years and created the No. 1 course in California , ” he said .
Trump is confident he remains popular among Palos Verdeans -- he said he had conducted a private poll of residents in the area and found he had an 88 % approval rating .
Advertisement
Trump declined to give details about the poll , saying he is planning to use it in litigation .
At least one resident said he sided with Trump .
“ He has rehabilitated that property to an outstanding venue and really a credit to the community , ” said 78 - year - old Ken DeLong , a part - time telecommunications consultant who is retired .
“ It is a world - class addition to our community . ”

“ We basically gutted our military after World War I , after World War II , in certain ways after Korea , certainly after Vietnam and after the end of the cold war , ” Mr. Gates said .
“ Experience is the ability to recognize a mistake when you make it again . ”
Image The Joint Strike Fighter program , which rolled out a jet in 2006 , is said to be a target for cuts .

Mr. Gates acknowledges that military spending is almost certain to level off , and he expressed a goal that the Pentagon budget at least keep pace with inflation over coming years .
Apprehension over potential budget cuts has trickled down the Pentagon bureaucracy to those who each year draft the military ’s spending proposals .
“ If that ’s what they want , they have to know that we simply cannot do everything we are doing now , but for less money , ” said one Pentagon budget officer who was not authorized to speak for attribution .
“ So if there ’s going to be less , it ’s up to the president , Congress and the public to tell us what part of our national security mission we should stop carrying out . ”
Much of the Pentagon budget pays for personnel costs , which are difficult to cut at any time , and particularly while troops are risking their lives in combat .
Mr. Obama has said his plan to begin drawing down American forces from Iraq would ease a wartime taxpayer burden that now totals over $ 10 billion a month .
But budget analysts at the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill say that even troop reductions in Iraq  whether at the cautious pace laid out by President Bush and endorsed by Mr. McCain or at the more rapid pace prescribed by Mr. Obama  would present little savings in the first years .
Moving tens of thousands of troops and their heavy equipment home from the Persian Gulf region is a costly undertaking .
And housing at stateside bases is more expensive than in the war zone , so savings would be seen only in subsequent years .
Researchers in one of the external groups of the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência ( IGC ) , in Portugal , have discovered a novel mechanism which regulates the process whereby new blood vessels are formed and wounds heal , including chronic wounds , such as those found in diabetic patients and those suffering from morbid obesity .
These findings , by Sérgio Dias and his team , are to appear in the new issue of the journal PLoS ONE (* ) , and have implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches to healing damaged blood vessels and building new ones .
Working at the Centro de Investigação e Patobiologia Molecular of the Portuguese Institute of Oncology Francisco Gentil , in Lisbon , the team showed that the cells that make new blood vessels ( called endothelial cells ) are stimulated by an intracellular signalling pathway , mediated by the protein Notch .
The formation of new blood vessels is a crucial step in wound healing : the newly - formed vessels allow anti-inflammatory proteins to reach the wound site , improve oxygenation of the damaged tissue and carry essential nutrients for the re-structuring of the tissue , that is , the skin .
According to Francisco Caiado , a PhD student at the IGC , and first author of this study , " We knew that the endothelial cells are stimulated by cells originating in the bone - marrow , the so - called bone - marrow derived precursor cells .
We have now shown that the actual stimulus happens through the Notch protein , found on the bone - marrow derived cells .
Upon activation , Notch promotes the adhesion of the precursor cells to the site of the lesion , where they stimulate the endothelial cells to make new blood vessels " .
Chronic skin wounds are an increasing medical problem , since they are commonly found in diabetic patients and in those suffering from morbid obesity .
Diabetic patients may develop " diabetic foot " , a condition whereby wounds do not heal leading , in the most severe cases , to amputation .

PDFs have always been one of my biggest computing nemesis : they slow my machine down to a crawl when opened and eat up a lot of disk space when saved .
Gmail has just added a solution to address this : its own viewer that lets you view PDFs in your Web browser .
It ’s blazing fast , includes a search feature , and lets you download or print the PDF if you really need to .
The way it works is pretty simple .
If you ’re the recipient of a PDF , you ’ll now get a “ View ” link along with the previously existing “ Download ” link .
When clicked , the “ View ” link opens up a new tab , which promptly loads the PDF in Google Docs , without opening up any desktop software ( ie – Adobe Reader ) .
Other features of the viewer include options to zoom in and out , as well as quick paging via next / previous arrows .
As the recipient of a lot of PDF files , I ’m pretty stoked about this addition to Gmail .
On the other hand , it ’s a bit of a blow to startups Scribd and Docstoc perhaps , who offer their own solutions for web - based PDF viewing .
Also , and I ’ll assume this is just temporary and give Google the benefit of the doubt , but the new PDF viewer does n’t seem to work in Firefox , but works perfectly in Chrome .
Update : The Gmail team says any issue I may have been having with Firefox is now fixed .
I can confirm that this now works beautifully in Firefox too :)
Proverbs 14:12
Not all presumption is careless drifting .
Unfortunately , strong evidence exists to show that much of modern liberalism in religion was deliberately planned and executed .
A Layman 's Guide to Protestant Theology by William Hordern , p. 74 , refers to this :
The method of liberalism includes the attempt to modernize Christianity .
The world , liberals argue , has changed radically since the early creeds of Christendom were formulated ; this makes the creeds sound archaic and unreal to modern man .
We have to rethink Christianity in thought forms which the modern world can comprehend .
Fosdick argued that we must express the essence of Christianity , its " abiding experiences , " but that we must not identify these with the " changing categories " in which they have been expressed in the past .
For example , says Fosdick , an abiding experience of Christianity has been its conviction that God will triumph over evil .
This has been traditionally pictured in the category of Christ 's second coming on the clouds to destroy evil and set up good .
We can no longer retain the outworn category , but we can still believe the truth which this ancient thought form was trying to express .
We can continue to work in the faith that , through His devoted followers , God is now building His Kingdom and that there will be a renewing of life , individual and social , to bring it into conformity with the will of God .
The essence of the faith is thus retained , argues Fosdick , which the thought form in which it was once clothed has been abandoned .
A second aspect of the method of liberalism is its refusal to accept religious belief on authority alone .
Instead , it insists that all beliefs must pass the bar of reason and experience .
Man 's mind is capable of thinking God 's thoughts after Him .
Man 's intuitions and reason are the best clues that we have to the nature of God .
The mind must be kept open to all truth regardless of from whence it comes .
This means that the liberal must have an open mind ; no questions are closed .
New facts may change the convictions that have become hallowed by custom and time .
The liberal will venture forth into the unknown , firmly believing that all truth must be God 's truth .
In this spirit , the liberal accepts the higher criticism of the Bible and the theory of evolution .
He refuses to have a religion that is afraid of truth or that tries to protect itself from critical examination .
( emphasis added )
Is it any wonder , when those who are supposed to be the primary protectors of religious purity think the way they do , that the laity behaves as they do ?
Does it really make any difference ?
Certainly , because the almighty God on high definitely thinks it makes a difference !
Hardly anything more clearly illustrates the self - deceived perverseness of human nature as its presumptuous additions of the observation of Christmas and Easter to the worship of the God of the Bible .
That Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea is indisputable , but among other things ,
He was not born on December 25 , nor did anybody exchange gifts on that date .
Scripture nowhere says there were three wise men , and it is clear they gave gifts only to Christ as King .
Regarding Easter , Jesus was not resurrected on a Sunday morning , nor was He crucified on a Friday afternoon .
It is impossible to squeeze three days and three nights , which Jesus Himself said would be the length of time
He would spend in the tomb ( Matthew 12:40 ) , between Friday afternoon and Sunday morning .
Even so , fantastically detailed and emotionally appealing traditions have presumptuously been built around both these events and have been taught to a deceived public as though they were true .
Beyond what has been already mentioned regarding these days , where in God 's Word does
He command that we believe and do these commonly accepted practices ?
Men have presumptuously taken them upon themselves .
The addition of Christmas and Easter to Christianity happened so long ago that they have come to be accepted as part of the Christian religion , and most people celebrate them without thought .
Nevertheless , adding to so - called Christian beliefs has not ended — in fact , it is still happening .
The late Pope John Paul II was an ardent ecumenist .
He circled the globe many times in his travels and embraced in conference many non-Catholics in his effort to bring all into one fold .
His successor , Pope Benedict XVI , has pledged to continue that effort .
Recently , their representatives achieved a decisive victory in forging a much closer alliance with the Anglican Church .
However , Anglican leaders could take this step only by abandoning the firm foundation of a former doctrine and thus joining Catholics in accepting a presumptuous addition that the latter already believe .
A headline in the Seattle Post Intelligencer , May 17 , 2005 , reads , " Catholics , Anglicans reach accord on Mary : Statement closes big gap between churches . "
The article explains :
The historical separation between Roman Catholics and Anglicans has narrowed after both found common ground on the position of Mary , mother of Jesus , according to a document conceived at the highest church levels .
. . .
Anglicans , already close to Catholics because of liturgy and traditions , have moved even closer through their understanding of Mary as outlined in the joint statement , which took five years and an international committee to complete .
Bringing back the departed brethren has been a strong focus of the Catholic Church since the Counter - Reformation that followed the Protestant Reformation , which had dealt Catholicism a powerful blow in the sixteenth century .
However , it was not until the " New Age Movement " began in earnest during the mid-1970s — with its strong , insistent call for a paradigm shift toward greater tolerance and radical thinking in religious beliefs and values — that the stage was set for ecumenical efforts to succeed .
The following quotation from the same article publicly undressed , as it were , the Anglican Church :
The document seeks to transcend past controversies on Catholic dogma , including the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption of Mary .
While not spelled out specifically in the Bible , such beliefs can be interpreted through Scripture , according to the 80 - paragraph document .
The result might be an elevation , or at least a heightened acknowledgment , of the place of Mary — particularly for Anglicans , the denomination born in England during the Reformation and called the Episcopal Church in the United States .
Anglicanism is considered closest to Catholicism because it gives
Mary a pre-eminent place among the saints , includes her in Communion prayers and holds six Marian feast days .
Among other matters , Catholics and Protestants disagree over the Catholic dogmas of the Immaculate Conception — the assertion that Mary lived a life free from sin from the moment she was conceived — and the Assumption , the belief that her body and soul were taken into heaven when her earthly life ended .
Those dogmas have " created problems not only for Anglicans but also for other Christians , " the document said , largely because they are not explicitly supported by Scripture .
But those dogmas also " can be said to be consonant with the teaching of the Scriptures and the ancient common traditions , " said the document , titled " Mary : Grace and Hope in Christ . " ( emphasis added )
How can either of these two doctrines be biblically derived ?
They cannot !
The Catholic Church has long acknowledged that the role they give Mary cannot be supported by Scripture alone , so now both the Catholic and Anglican churches have admitted through the publication of this document that these teachings are based upon mere human tradition .
In the distant past , someone decided that honoring Mary in this way would be " nice , " or perhaps he used the word " appropriate , " because she was chosen by God to bear His Son in her womb , and besides , she seems to be such a good woman .
However , the Scriptures call for no such elevation in status , and they certainly never claim that she lived a perfect , sinless life !
Now the Roman Catholic Church has gone so far as to claim she is co-savior with Christ !
Such presumption seems beyond the bounds of honest , spiritual reasoning , but the Catholic Church has similarly declared Sunday to be the day of worship , replacing God 's Sabbath .
They have published articles openly admitting that , if one uses the Bible alone , then the Sabbath is the only acceptable day of worship .
In those same articles , they have also been honest in stating that they have made this change from Sabbath to Sunday on their own authority .
On these issues , their presumption is not hidden !
But this is arrogant and bold hubris on a massive scale , enabled only because Satan has managed to deceive the whole world ( Revelation 12:9 ) .
The overwhelming majority of people calling themselves Christian are so unconcerned — that is , tolerant and careless — they live thinking that it does not matter to God.

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - President - elect Barack Obama ’s team is considering a plan to boost the recession - hit U.S. economy that could be far larger than previous estimates and might reach $ 1 trillion over two years , the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday .

Obama 's team is considering a plan to boost the recession - hit U.S. economy that could be far larger than previous estimates and might reach $ 1 trillion over two years , the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday .

Obama aides , who were considering a half - trillion dollar package two weeks ago , now consider $ 600 billion over two years “ a very low - end estimate , ” the newspaper said , citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter .
The final size of the stimulus was expected to be significantly higher , possibly between $ 700 billion and $ 1 trillion over that period , it said , given the deteriorating state of the U.S. economy .
Officials with Obama ’s camp have declined to comment on media reports about the size of the boost his administration might seek to give the economy through increased public spending and tax cuts .
Obama is due to take office on January 20 .
Battered stock market investors around the world have taken heart from previous indications of how Obama ’s administration may seek to kickstart growth in the world ’s largest economy .
Obama has promised he will launch a massive public works program to help lift the U.S. economy out of recession .
The president - elect is likely to be briefed by his aides on the outline of the stimulus plan next week with a view to getting it passed by Congress by the time he is sworn in next month , the Journal said .
Economists have previously said they expect Obama to quickly sign a multi- year spending package that could be worth up to $ 750 billion , or almost 5 percent of U.S. gross domestic product .
The administration of President George W. Bush has been given authority by Congress to spend up to $ 700 billion in taxpayer money to rescue the nation ’s banking system .
The money was originally set aside to buy up toxic mortgage - backed securities but is now being used to recapitalize banks and induce them to lend more freely .

When I married my archaeologist wife , Nikki , I figured I was signing up for a life of Indiana Jones - type adventures .
Those pictures of her hunched in tombs , the stories about unearthing 1,000 - year - old skeletons - these relics of her time in the field convinced me that our lives together would be anything but ordinary .
Nothing , however , prepared me for eating a cute and fluffy household pet in the name of science .
The gastronomic escapade occurred in Lima , Peru , where the two of us lived for three months while Nikki researched her doctorate .
Her project was heady stuff .
She sampled bones excavated from a coastal fishing town named Ancon .
Later , during tests in the United States , she looked at chemical signatures in the bones and determined whether the people composed of those bones hailed from the coast or migrated there .
Guinea pigs were a big part of the analysis .
The little rodents , locally called cuy ( coo-ee ) , have been celebrated as a special meal in the Andes for 1,000 years .
Today the creatures are considered a delicacy , the Peruvian equivalent of Beluga caviar .
Cuy do n't travel much , so Nikki knew that guinea pigs raised at Ancon would provide perfect chemical controls for her research .
All she needed were their bones .
In any other society , it might have been easy to buy a few cuy , kill them and pocket the bones .
But in Peru , where the little fellows are seen as furry deities , nobody was willing to part with cuy without preparing a feast .
So we scheduled a meal to remember .
Nikki found a farmer in Ancon who raised cuy , and ordered three .
The farmer agreed to skin the animals and fry them with pepper and achiote , a South American spice .
The morning of the big meal , Nikki woke up sick .
After her fourth trip to the bathroom , it was clear she was n't leaving the apartment .
This meant I 'd have to go to Ancon , eat all the cuy and fetch the bones alone .
When I arrived at the museum where Nikki was conducting her research , the museum 's director , Justo , brimmed with excitement .
" Estas listo para comer cuy ? " he asked , asking if I was ready to eat the guinea pigs .
" I think so , " I replied in Spanish .
Justo led me into the lab .
Normally , this was where Nikki articulated skeletons .
Today , the room was set up like a banquet hall , with tablecloths on the tables , candles and bottles of cold Cusque ña beer .
I took a seat across from Benny , the museum secretary , and Azaleah , another researcher .
The two of them were grinning like schoolchildren on Halloween .
The farmer entered carrying a Pyrex dish with the guinea pigs nestled side - by - side - by - side .
Azaleah gasped .
Benny sighed .
Justo pursed his lips as if to kiss the air .
" Que ricos ! " he said .
How rich .
During the next 15 minutes , parts of different guinea pigs found their way to my plate : A leg .
An arm .
A back .
Timidly , I dug in .
The leg and back were gamey but moist .
The arm was a bit like the leg of a Dungeness crab - tons of work for little reward .
With every bite , I tossed bones from each guinea pig into Ziploc bags .
Conversation was sparse during most of the meal , but when we did talk , subject matter was peculiar at best .
" Do you eat guinea pigs in your country ? "
Benny asked at one point .
No , I explained , in our country they were pets .
" Mascotas ? " she asked , quizzically repeating the Spanish word for pets .
Yes , I said timidly , pets .
" Do you eat cats ? " she asked .
No , I said , those are pets , too .
Benny could not believe her ears .
As she gnawed at a cuy foot , she explained that if she had a cat for a pet , she probably would eat it , and that if she did n't , someone else likely would .
My appetite had pretty much disappeared after the cat conversation , but apparently , one more ritual remained : the head .
Justo explained to me that this was by far the best part of a cuy , and that no guinea pig feast was complete until everyone had tasted it .
In this case , however , numbers were working against us .
Including the farmer and her assistant , there were six people , and only three heads to go around .
Because fried guinea pig heads are roughly the size of garlic cloves , they are challenging to split .
Obviously , Justo and Azaleah each wanted heads .
That left one head for the rest of us .
Benny , it turns out , was not a head gal .
The farmer 's assistant also bowed out .
That meant the fight for the final head was between the farmer and me .
A detente of etiquette set in quickly .
Mine was a dilemma of chivalry ; there was no way I was going to deprive an elderly woman of anything , especially fried cuy head .
The farmer , on the other hand , was trapped by Peruvian hospitality ; because I was a guest , there was no way she could take the head out of my mouth .
Back and forth we went :
You eat it ; no you ; I insist you eat the cuy ; seriously , it 's yours .
Finally , Justo ended the discussion by popping the entire head into his mouth .
His defense : Cuy head was " too special " to go uneaten for so long .
Later , on the ride home , when I told the taxi driver about the feast , he got so excited he nearly rammed the cab into a parked bus .
" Three cuy !
Three ! " he exclaimed .
" For me , it would have been a fantasy ! "
That 's when the significance of my day at Ancon finally dawned on me .
Sure , I had told myself I was eating guinea pigs in the name of science .
And yes , the bones eventually helped my wife complete her doctorate .
But whatever had led me to Ancon that afternoon , I had partaken in one of the oldest gustatory traditions in Peruvian history .
For a traveler , few cultural experiences are more sacred than that , and in my world , the memory will last nearly as long as any chemical signature ever could .
A Sunday night episode of the Fox animated series “ Family Guy ” stirred up trouble by suggesting­ rather directly that Nazi officers would have supported the McCain - Palin ticket .
And it was another arm of the News Corp. conglomerate , Fox News Channel , that first reported on the episode .
Fox ( the broadcast network ) aired the episode in which Stewie , the obnoxious baby character at the center of the series , and Brian , a talking dog , traveled back in time to Poland during the 1939 German invasion .
The characters ambush Nazi soldiers in an alley and steal their uniforms so they can travel without drawing attention .
Putting on an overcoat , Stewie notices a McCain - Palin campaign button affixed to the lapel .
“ Huh , that ’s weird , ” Stewie remarks .
“ Family Guy ” has never been known for its taste level .
One recent episode depicted Jesus binge drinking , and the hit show once got in trouble with the Federal Communications Commission for showing a partially nude cartoon character .
The series ’ creator , Seth MacFarlane , is a prominent supporter of Barack Obama ’s presidential bid .
So fans of the program seemed to take the scene in stride : by mid-day Monday , the vast majority of blog mentions of the episode were favorable .
And the phones at the network ’s Los Angeles press office were silent until … a call arrived from the Fox News Channel asking for comment for a story it was preparing and which subsequently appeared on the Fox News Web site .
According to a
Fox executive who would not talk on the record for fear of angering his News Corporation colleagues , this generated more calls from other reporters .
British celebrity Timmy Mallet found himself booted off of the UK reality show I ’m a Celebrity … Get Me out of Here !
after the producers organized a challenge where they had to eat kangaroo penis and testicles blended into a variety of drinks and he refused .
“ It was an eating trial .
I was n’t expecting that .
I ’m a vegetarian .
How could I cope ?
Am I comfortable having to consume living creatures ?
The answer is no , of course I ’m not comfortable .
But I am a fighter and I believe you ’ve got to be in it to win it . ” said the 53 - year - old TV presenter .
Mallett ’s refusal to consume the mixes presented in the survival battle meant an elimination and he was sent packing .

ACER Smartphones would be released in the first quarter of 2009 .
This was revealed by the company 's chairman JT Wang as he blamed the delay in the release of the smartphones as on going negotiations with the Global carriers were taking too long .
ACER has been trying to release the phones since it adopted the E - Ten Information Systems but on the other hand it has n't provided any concrete information on its Smart Phones .
The handset is developed by Acer 's own original smartphone R&D Team and their counterparts from E - Ten.
E - Ten Information Systems had been inquired by Acer in September .
The Chairman JT Wang , predicts that this segment will be a significant growth area for the company over the next 3 - 5 Years .
The company has not released any pricing , specifications or geographical details about it yet .
However , when ACER took over E - TEN , it did reveal that the smartphone would be windows based .
It did also say that the devices would be firstly launched in Western Europe .
Massive frozen water reservoirs discovered on Mars Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday November 20 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  NASA scientists have discovered enormous underground reservoirs of frozen water on Mars , away from its polar caps , in the latest sign that life might be sustainable on the Red planet .
Ground - penetrating radar used by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveals numerous huge glaciers up to one half - mile thick buried beneath layers of rock and debris .
Researchers said one glacier is three time the size of Los Angeles in area .
" All together , these glaciers almost certainly represent the largest reservoir of water ice on Mars that 's not in the polar caps , " said John Holt , a geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin and lead author of a report about the discovery , which appears in the November 21 issue of the journal Science .
" In addition to their scientific value , they could be a source of water to support future exploration of Mars , " said Holt .
Scientists on the 12 - member research team surmise that the frozen water deposits are remnants of a Martian ice age millions of years ago .
Because water is one of the primary requirements for life , scientists said the frozen reservoirs are an encouraging sign of extra-terrestrial life .
The buried glaciers reported by Holt and his 11 co-authors lie in the Hellas Basin region of Mars ' southern hemisphere , and scientist said even larger frozen water reservoirs may exist in Mars ' northern hemisphere .
" The fact that these features are in the same latitude bands -- about 35 to 60 degrees -- in both hemispheres points to a climate - driven mechanism for explaining how they got there , " said Holt .
Another member of the research team noted however , that a basic mystery about the glaciers remains unsolved .
" A key question is ' How did the ice get there in the first place ? ' " said James Head of Brown University .
Unanswered questions also persist , Brown said , about what might be contained in the frozen water .
" On Earth , such buried glacial ice in Antarctica preserves the record of traces of ancient organisms and past climate history , " he said .
NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter for NASA .
Werewolves and stargazers are in for a treat tomorrow night with the year 's biggest full moon set to brighten the sky .
The full moon , due to rise close to 8 pm , will appear about 12 per cent larger than usual , Sky and Space Magazine news editor Dave Reneke said .
When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie it will be at the closest point to Earth on its annual orbit , a mere 358,000 kilometres away .
" It 's going to be nice , it 's going to be one of those big orange / yellow moons that we used to see and not many people remember now , " Mr Reneke said .
" What makes it more interesting is it 's part optical illusion and part fact .
As the federal government marches forward with its plan to provide General Motors and Chrysler some $ 15 billion in financial aid — Ford insists that it ’s OK for now — we have to wonder how that $ 15 billion will trickle down to our local dealers .
Will it save the two companies ?
Or does it just stem the bleeding ?
No one knows , but should U.S. vehicle sales continue on their current pace — which would produce just 11 million vehicle sales in 2009 , down from 16 - million - plus as recently as 2007 — automotive life as we know it must change dramatically .
Heck , even if sales do pick up , dramatic change must take place anyway .
General Motors
In its survival plan , General Motors points out that the vast majority of its sales come from Chevrolet , Cadillac , GMC , and Buick .
Mostly unmentioned are Saab , Hummer , and Saturn , although all three are under official or unofficial “ review , ” which usually means “ up for sale or discontinuation . ”
Expensive development of new products for the three brands has stopped in the interest of focusing on the four priority brands , so the future for Hummer , Saab , and Saturn does n’t look very bright .
Pontiac is referred to as a " niche " brand , suggesting that a few unique models , such as the Australian - built G8 or the Solstice roadster , might survive , perhaps the way Lincoln - Mercury tried , and failed , to position the Merkur brand years ago .
Should Buick survive , it will likely be because the brand has traction in China , where far more Buicks are sold than in the U.S. Should Cadillac be broadened in appeal to attract Buick customers , though , it would spell doom for the tri-shield brand .
Ditto GMC —its products are shared with Chevrolet , and at some point , the beancounters must ask themselves a question :
If there was only Chevrolet , could it be expected to retain a large percentage of those GMC customers ?
If the answer is yes — and we suspect it would be —GMC could fade away .
The saddest casualty here would be Saturn , which has renovated its product mix completely over the last two to three years in the hopes of prove the old auto axiom :
If you have good products , customers will find them .
They have n't , and they are n't likely to .
Ford
As for Ford , there 's little point in arguing that Mercury has much of a future .
Ford maintains that Mercury will survive as a smaller - volume brand , but with little evidence of new products in the pipeline and the recent death of the Sable , call us dubious .
Additionally , the Blue Oval has been less successful at remaking the product image of Lincoln than GM has been with Cadillac , but there are some viable Lincoln products on the market now that show moderate promise , like the MKS and refreshed MKZ sedans , and the Ford Flex–based MKT crossover will head to production soon .
Volvo is already on the block , but good luck finding a company like Tata that can take it off Ford 's hands , as the Indian conglomerate did with Jaguar and Land Rover .
Indeed , even Tata is having a rough year , with plunging sales volumes at Land Rover and Jaguar compounding the challenges of a difficult domestic market in India , all punctuated by the terrorist activity in Mumbai .
Still , having already sold its English luxury brands and eyeing a sale of Volvo , Ford is well ahead of GM and Chrysler in the self - streamlining process .
Chrysler
Chrysler is more the wild card here :
There are products to cut , as well as strengths to capitalize on .
The Chrysler minivan is good enough for Volkswagen to commission its Routan version , and the new Dodge Ram may be the best pickup on the market .
Indeed , the Ram will work well rebadged as the next - generation Nissan Titan .
The Caliber has shown some sales strength , but aside from that trio , there is n't that much in the Chrysler lineup with legs .
The 300 and Charger are getting long in the tooth , the Viper appears to be history , and the Challenger is hardly a volume product .
As for the subpar and underachieving Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Avenger mid-size sedans , they should receive a thorough rework soon — a redo was ordered almost immediately after the cars were released for 2007 and 2008 , respectively , as company officials realized how far behind the competition the pair lagged .
Jeep sales are down , but it remains a viable — if overexploited — brand .
It went from a brand starved for new vehicles to a brand so littered with overlapping product that trying to find a logical place to put the Commander , Grand Cherokee , Liberty , Patriot , Compass , and Wrangler in the showroom was a challenge .
We know the Commander is on its way out , but ditching the Liberty and Compass makes sense , too ; pared to the Grand Cherokee , Patriot , and Wrangler , the Jeep brand would be stronger .
We 're entering one of the toughest years in the automotive world since World War II .
Get ready for a rough ride .

A team of top boffins believe that they have cracked one of the main problems of interplanetary travel - that of surviving deadly solar radiation storms .
The physicists say they have come up with an idea for a crafty forcefield which could stand off the protoplasm - punishing particle squalls of deep space .
There 's plenty of weather on the sun .
Thus far , only a very few people have ever travelled beyond the protection of the Earth 's magnetosphere - the Apollo astronauts who went to the Moon in the 1960s and 70s .
All other humans in space - including the crews of the present - day International Space Station - have remained within the protective magnetic field of their home planet .
The Apollo missions were reasonably safe because they were brief - only days long .
The risk of a major solar radiation storm was minimal .
Even so , had there been a serious solar event during an Apollo mission the results might have been disastrous - the more so as there is no lunar atmosphere to protect explorers .
A journey to Mars , however , is projected to take 6 months - and then there 's the return trip to consider .
Even though the astronauts would be protected by the Martian atmosphere ( and the planet itself ) during their stay , a year in deep space would be very dangerous .
Even normal background radiation could be expected to use up much of an astronaut 's lifetime exposure limit .
A solar storm , more or less bound to occur over such a period , would breach the health guidelines and create an unacceptable risk of cancer .
A bad particle squall could cause radiation sickness severe enough to incapacitate or even kill a Mars - ship crew on the spot .
But now boffins at the Rutherford Appleton Lab and the Universities of York , Strathclyde and Lisbon have shown that it 's possible to generate a " portable magnetosphere " or magnetic forcefield just a few hundred metres across , which would prevent ionised particles reaching a space ship .
It had previously been thought that only mighty planetary - scale fields could possibly be effective , but new computer simulations suggest that just a small " hole " in the solar winds could be enough .
“ These initial experiments have shown promise , " said Dr Ruth Bamford of the Rutherford Appleton lab , rather cautiously .
" It may be possible to shield astronauts from deadly space weather . ”
Astronauts in a ship moving through space would find a nifty lightweight forcefield especially useful .
Ordinary radiation shielding is extremely heavy , but everything in a spaceship must be as light as possible , every kilo of mass being precious .
On the other hand the power required to generate a " magnetic bubble " could be an issue .
The new research would seem to have implications for NASA 's plans to build a permanent Moon base , too .
While lunar explorers would gain a good deal of protection from the Moon itself , blocking out half the sky , the lack of any atmosphere would see an explorer caught outside his thick - walled underground moon bunker by a solar storm during daylight in serious trouble .
Moon rovers and inflatable habitats of the future might find magno - forcefield kit very handy .
Needless to say , reasonably portable forcefields would also be invaluable for the hover tanks , power - armour suits or interplanetary battlecruisers of tomorrow - ideal for resisting deadly particle - cannon blaster beams , krenon rays * etc .
The research is set out in a new paper :
The Interactions of a flowing plasma with a dipole magnetic field : measurements and modelling of a diamagnetic cavity relevant to spacecraft protection ( R Bamford et al 2008 Plasma Phys .
Control . Fusion 50 124025 ) .
It 's published online here . ®
* We would vote for the next kind of ray or beam to be called this .
There is an increasing variety of options for purchasing music online , but also a growing thicket of confusing usage restrictions .
You may be getting much less than the services promise .
Many digital music services employ digital rights management ( DRM )
— also known as " copy protection " — that prevents you
from doing things like using the portable player of your choice or
creating remixes .
Forget about breaking the DRM to make traditional uses like CD burning and so forth .
Breaking the DRM or distributing the tools to break DRM may expose you to liability under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) even if you 're not making any illegal uses .
In other words , in this brave new world of " authorized music
services , " law - abiding music fans often get less for their money than
they did in the old world of CDs ( or at least , the world before record
companies started crippling CDs with DRM , too ) .
Unfortunately , in an effort to attract customers , these music services try to obscure the restrictions they impose on you with clever marketing .
This guide " translates " the marketing messages by the major services , giving you the real deal rather than spin .
Understanding how DRM and the DMCA pose a danger to your rights will help you to make fully informed purchasing decisions .
Before buying DRM - crippled music from any service , you should consider the following examples and be sure to understand how the service might limit your ability to make lawful use of the music you purchase .
Apple iTunes Music Store Says ...
" Own it Forever and a Day "
" Just 99 Cents , Plus Generous Personal Use Rights "
The Facts : You Bought It , But They Still Own It
Imagine if Tower Records sold you a CD , but then , a few months later , knocked on your door and replaced the CD with one that you can't play in your car .
Would you still feel like you " owned " the CD ?
Not so much , eh ?
But Apple reserves the right to change at any time what you can do with the music you purchase at the iTunes Music Store .
For instance , in April 2004 , Apple decided to modify the DRM so people could burn the same playlist only 7 times , down from 10 .
How much further will the service restrict your ability to make legal personal copies of your own music ?
Only Apple knows .
Another hallmark of ownership is the right to give away or sell your
property .
That 's called " first sale , " and it 's explicitly protected
under copyright law .
Yet Apple 's DRM frustrates first sale — just
ask George Hotelling , who had to give away the login and password to his iTunes Music Store account in order to resell a single song .
As the table below shows , there are many other ways that Apple 's DRM limits what you can do with a song you " own . "
Many other a la carte download services choose to impose similar restrictions .
How " generous " of them .
Additional iTunes Music Store Restrictions
Restricts back - up copies :
Song can only be copied to 5 computers
Restricts converting to other formats : Songs only sold in AAC with Apple DRM
Limits portable player compatibility : iPod and other Apple devices only
No remixing : Cannot edit , excerpt , or otherwise sample songs
Update : EMI Licenses Apple to Offer DRM - Free Music April 2 , 2007
Microsoft Touts ...
The " Plays for Sure " labeling for Windows Media Audio DRM compatibility :
" Choose Your Music .
Choose Your Device .
Know It 's Going to Work "
" Match logos ... [ it 's ] no hassle . "
The Facts : With DRM , Nothing Truly " Plays for Sure "
Your investment in CDs has paid all kinds of dividends over time because third parties could freely enable novel uses , like ripping MP3s or creating your own ringtones .
But when you buy DRM - crippled music , you 're locked into the limited array of software and devices that DRM vendors say you can use .
Many online music stores offer songs wrapped in Microsoft 's Windows Media Audio ( WMA ) DRM , but not every device supports this format .
You have to check for the " Plays for Sure " label , and , even then , only a few media players support " subscription " WMA content , like songs offered through Napster To Go .
Not exactly hassle - free .
Microsoft 's campaign is meant to make you comfortable with its limited universe of compatible products .
But what happens if you later want to switch to a WMA - incompatible iPod , or a superior device that Microsoft wo n't license ?
You 'll have to rebuy your music collection .
Unlike MP3s , you can't easily convert DRM - crippled music to a different format .
Likewise , if you switch music stores , you might have to buy a new set of compatible devices .
And if the time comes that stores and devices no longer support your DRM , you 're entirely out of luck .
Update : Microsoft's Zune Portable Player Incompatible With " Plays For Sure " Content September 15 , 2006
RealNetworks Advertises ...
" ' Freedom of Music Choice ' ... to help consumers break the chains that tie their music devices to proprietary music downloads . "
The Facts : RealNetworks Does n't Offer Real Freedom of Choice
RealNetworks pitched a fit because songs sold at the Real Music Store could not be transferred to Apple 's iPod.
Real 's " Freedom of Choice " campaign says that consumers should be able to play their music using the device of their choice .
That 's what you want , but it 's not what you 'll get from Real or any other service that sells songs wrapped in DRM .
Real 's customers are chained to the narrow set of software and devices licensed to unlock Real 's proprietary DRM or Microsoft 's Windows Media Audio ( WMA ) DRM .
Want to stream music throughout your home with Creative 's Sound Blaster Wireless Music ?
Too bad .
Ca n't do it with music from Real .
Your CD collection has become more valuable over time because third parties could freely enable new uses , like ripping MP3s or creating your own ringtones .
That 's not the case with music you buy from Real .
Even if you own devices compatible with Real 's DRM or WMA today , what happens tomorrow when you want to buy a superior device that Real or Microsoft wo n't license ?
You 'll have to rebuy all your music in a compatible format .
Unlike MP3s , DRM - crippled music can't easily be converted to other formats .
Or what if Real someday gives up the digital music business and its formats go unsupported in all devices ?
The CDs you bought 10 years ago still play in every CD player you can buy today , but you might not be able to say the same about Real 's music .
Additional Real Music Store Restrictions
Restricts back - up copies :
Song can only be copied to 5 computers
Limits audio CD burning : Same album or playlist can only be burned 5 times
No reselling songs
No remixing : Cannot edit , excerpt , or otherwise sample songs
DRM restrictions can change : " DRMs may be able to revoke your ability to use a Download — if you violate the usage rules associated with Downloads . "
" Real may modify this Agreement [ which sets out the usage rules ] at any time in its sole discretion . "
Napster 2.0 Promises ...
" All the Music You Want . Any Way You Want It . "
The Facts : Music " Any Way You Want It " — So Long As You Pay for It Over and Over Again
Napster 2.0 and many services like it provide celestial music jukeboxes , but you 'd better bring a sack of quarters .
Using DRM , they charge extra for many traditionally free uses of your music .
For a monthly subscription fee , the Napster Unlimited music rental service offers you the ability to stream and download as much as you like from its entire catalog .
If you miss a monthly payment , the DRM renders the downloaded music unplayable .
Even while your subscription lasts , however , the DRM ensures that you do n't get to use the music " any way you want . "
Want to move your music to a portable player ?
That 'll be an extra five bucks per month for Napster To Go — and you 'll still only be able to play it using software or devices licensed to play WMA - protected subscription content , which excludes the iPod and most other portable players .
How about burning a song to CD ?
Napster 's DRM requires you to cough up 99 cents more .
What if you want to copy music to more than three computers ?
Pay another monthly subscription fee , or 99 cents per song .
And what if you want to mix a song snippet with a home movie ?
Forget it — the DRM forbids that entirely .
Explaining Napster Restrictions
Napster 2.0 is divided up into three services .
They all share one
thing : complicated , restrictive DRM .
Defending Linux and adjacent Open Source Software against low - quality patents .
Linux Defenders is a manifestation of the commitment that OIN has made to protect its community and core Open Source Software from patent aggression .
It is an umbrella concept encompassing the many ways that OIN and its partners are working to eliminate low - quality patents , which are frequently leveraged by strategic patent aggressors and patent trolls .
Specifically , OIN works in the following ways to support its community members and the broader Open Source community .
Prior Art Assistance
In many cases where one of our community members was the subject of patent infringement claims , Open Invention Network has leveraged our network of relationships to identify and share prior art for use against patent trolls or corporate patent aggressors .
This helps OIN licensees at risk , or in litigation , to better defend against Linux - centric patent aggression .
Reducing Patent Application Claim Scope
Open Invention Network has been a leading user of third party pre-issuance submissions , which are prior art submissions to limit the claim scope , or secure outright rejection , of overly broad patent claims in patent applications which are focused on key technology areas relevant to Linux and adjacent open source technologies .
Encouraging Open Source Software Use of Inter Partes Review
“ Inter Partes Review ” , also known as an “ IPR ” , is a procedure for challenging the validity of an issued patent owned by a 3rd party .
By challenging patents with IPRs , the Linux and broader Open Source community can help to eliminate them .
Unified Patents — which OIN , IBM , Linux Foundation and Microsoft support through its Open Source Zone — has successfully invalidated several patents using IPRs .
Advocating Open Source Use of Defensive Publications
Defensive publications are documents that provide descriptions and artwork of an invention so that it enters the public domain and becomes prior art .
The disclosure prevents other parties from obtaining a low - quality patent ( or , a non-novel patent ) on the same invention later .
OIN encourages all Open Source community members to submit inventions as defensive publications for free at tdcommons.org .

They ’re all free , so there ’s hardly a financial investment to consider .
But one can still be proven to be an out - and - out victor that suits your needs better than the rest .
That ’s why we ’re comparing all three character creators under the harshest and most obvious criteria .
Although before we start , there are a couple of important things to bear in mind :
1. Wii / Miis have more functionality , but it ’s also had two years ' worth of creative users behind it who can easily create masterpieces in five minutes that you could n’t in a lifetime .
2. NXE /360 Avatars are classy indeed , but even the most monstrous abomination will turn out looking like a Precious Moments figurine .
3 . The PS3 ’s Home still has its foot firmly lodged in beta .
While featuring a robust face manipulator , it ’s host to a more pathetic offering of cosmetic features , such as somewhere around five shirts of plain and unchangeable color .
Let ’s see how they all do with some icons .
360 : The lack of overalls is immediately apparent , and that awful shirt makes him look like a Wendy ’s fry cook .
Overall he still looks “ Mario ” enough , and that mustache is mighty fine .
Wii :
This could be an upset ...
PS3 : Clever sabotage , Sony .
With no red male clothing to speak of , I bet you thought Bob Hoskins and Captain Lou Albano were as bad as a true - to - life Mario could get .
He ’s just a fanny pack shy from a trip to Universal Studios , yet also resembles a frightened immigrant caught in an INS sting .
Winner : 360
360 : Women ’s groups are going to hate us for saying this , but Lara is n’t Lara without breasts big enough to snap a human spine .
Lusting after this Croft will land you a meeting with Chris Hansen .
Wii :
Take away the body and blue shirt and all you ’ve got is a Mii in lipstick .
Truly , the Angel of Darkness of Lara Croft avatars .
PS3 : Smart move , Home .
Out of the four female shirts , one is a powder blue tank top , and the lone hand accessory is a pair of lacy adventurer gloves .
It ’s good to know your audience .
Winner : PS3
360 : Who knew Kratos could be cute ?
Plus , a little scarring goes a long way .
Wii : Is this the God of War or the Guy Who Cuts My Hair ?
A flipped ginger - stache could ’ve doubled as a scar , ya know ?
PS3 : With no ability to whiten skin tones , or add scars , or a f**king goatee , this Kratos Homey is flat out pathetic .
From fallen deity to average dickhead at a ska show .
Winner : 360
360 : This is n’t Link !
This is from that creepy ass Mary Martin version of Peter Pan that ’s been tricking kids into watching it instead of the Disney version for fifty years .
Automatic fail !
Wii :
So what if he looks like an albino Asian with rulers taped to his cheeks ?
This does look like some bizarre bridge between the Link in Ocarina and Wind Waker .
If you will , a missing ... nevermind , not saying it .
PS3 : A fairly accurate princely , medieval shithead ... if Zelda had been made into a modern - day Jerry Bruckheimer movie .
But without the green Ebenezer Scrooge nightcap , he comes off like the bad guy .

Province police official , Ekramuddin Yawar put the number of dead following the coalition operation at 76 .

One of the men hit Jose over the head with a bottle , and the driver of the car swung an aluminum baseball bat at his head , the police said .
He fell to the floor as the three attackers , who were black , continued kicking and punching him , the police said .
The beating ended only when Romel held up his cellphone and said he was calling the police .
On Tuesday , the police released a description of one of the men , saying he is 6 feet tall and thin , and wore a black leather jacket , boots , dark jeans and a dark baseball cap during the attack .
The authorities said they did not have the license number of the car .
The reward for information was set at $ 22,000 .
Julia Osman , who worked with Mr. Sucuzhanay , visited him at the hospital on Monday .
His face was so swollen that she could not see his eyes , and his head was wrapped in bandages .
“ He was kind , and cared about everyone who worked with him , ” she said .
In the decade he has in the United States , Mr. Sucuzhanay rose from waiter to business owner .
He got his real estate sales license three years ago , according to state records , and later started two companies and became the owner of several buildings , according to friends and public records .
“ He was happy to have his own business , ” said Cesar Alvarado , who owns a metal shop in Bushwick .
Mr. Sucuzhanay ’s office was a tenant of his , Mr. Alvarado said .
“ It was going well for him . ”
Mr. Sucuzhanay , 31 , well known in the local community .
Herbert Velez , who worked with him to find an affordable apartment , said : “ He works with everybody around here .
He found a lot of people homes .
He does whatever it takes to help someone . ”
Raw Story highlights the recent CNN piece on a Kansas pastors who has posted a rather provocative sign outside his church :
CNN ’s Rick Sanchez reported on a church marquee that reads “ America we have a Muslim president .
This is a sin against the Lord . ”
Mark Holick is pastor of The Spirit One Christian Center in Wichita , Kansas where the sign is being displayed .
Holick told KSNW , “ The main point of the marquee is to cause the Christians to understand he is not a Christian , Again , they will call me and they will tell me that he ’s not a Muslim because he is a Christian .
That ’s not the point .
The point is he ’s not a Christian . ”
The idea that Obama is not a Christian has become commonplace among many on the Right , as has the idea that it is perfectly acceptable to attack him because of his faith and that a voting for him was a sin .
But this is the first time I ’ve seen anyone argue that his understanding of his Christian faith actually makes him a Muslim .
If the point that Holick wanted to make is that Obama is not a Christian , why did n’t he just say that instead of saying that Obama is a Muslim ?
That does n’t even make any sense .

More than 12 m of about 213 m eligible American voters across the country have already cast ballots , sometimes waiting in queues around the block to do so , despite the election being six days away .
Barack Obama is leading 53 % to McCain 's 34 % among those who have already voted , according to a poll released today by the Pew Research Centre .
Under a procedure known simply as early voting , 32 states allow voters to cast a ballot before election day , either in person at the polling site or by mail .
An additional 14 states and Washington DC allow it if voters can argue they will be unavailable next Tuesday .
The long October queues at polling places anticipate a tremendous surge in voter turnout over previous elections , and statistics from key states indicate an advantage for Barack Obama over rival John McCain among early voters .
" If we 're in an election year where you have to wait two hours to vote early , you can imagine what it will look like on election day proper , " said Doug Chapin , an election expert at the Pew Centre on the States .
Campaigns , voters and election workers have increasingly embraced early voting this year .
Voters enjoy the convenience .
Election workers like early voting because it allows them to stress test election procedures while time remains to iron out flaws .
It also lessens the crunch on election day .
Research indicates early voters tend to be more partisan and firm in their choices than average , and the campaigns of Barack Obama and John McCain have encouraged supporters to vote early .
The campaigns and their backers have dispatched volunteers and paid canvassers door to door to push supporters to the polls ahead of election day .
In Florida , where more than 2 m have already cast ballots , Democratic vice - presidential candidate Joe Biden on Monday said an early vote could decide a close race .
" With an early vote , now is the time to choose , " he said at a rally .
Also on Monday , Michelle Obama launched a two - day swing through the western US to promote early voting .
Leading in national polling and in key battleground states , the Obama campaign hopes early voting will reduce the chances of a late surge by John McCain .
Also , if early voters discover a problem with their registration , there is time to correct it and lessen the risk of disenfranchisement , Obama campaign workers say .
That is increasingly vital as states enact polling place identification requirements and voter - roll strictures .
" The more people we can get out , the fewer we have to deal with on November 4 , " said Faulkner Fox , an Obama volunteer organiser in Durham , North Carolina .
" We can bank those votes . "
In 2004 , 22.5 % of American voters cast their ballot before election day .
That is expected to rise to as much as one third of all voters this year .
" The question remains if this means a greater share of the 2008 vote will be cast early , if turnout will be up overall , or - as I suspect - a combination of these two factors are in play , " writes Michael McDonald , an associate professor of government and politics at George Mason University .
The long queues at early voting sites across the country seem to be benefiting the Democratic ticket .
While the votes will not be counted until election day , the party registration statistics in key states anticipate an advantage for Obama .
In North Carolina , for instance , registered Democrats have cast 55 % of early ballots , compared with 28 % for the Republicans and 17 % with no party affiliation , according to McDonald 's analysis .
In Florida , Democrats have cast 45 % of early and absentee votes , compared with 40 % for the Republicans and 15 % other .
But the apparent early voting advantage for the Democrats may narrow because the Republicans typically start their mobilisation efforts closer to election day , McDonald told the Guardian .
One early vote the Democrats were happy to tout : George Bush last week cast his Texas absentee ballot for John McCain .
Paris Hilton Benji Madden Break Up Confirmed : Prince William Responsible ?
and rocker boyfriendhave called it quits but " remain very good friends , " according to Hilton 's publicist Alanna McCarthy .
Rumors that there was trouble in paradise began a few weeks ago , then earlier this week photos of Hilton getting cozy with ex-boyfriend Stavros Niachros hit the net , leading to speculation that the relationship had taken a nosedive .
Now there are rumors that Prince William may be behind the split .
According to an inside source , the handsome prince and the hotel heiress spent time together while she was filming her reality show " Paris Hilton 's British Best Friend " in London , and have plans to meet up in Australia to ring in the New Year .
Hilton and Madden are booked to attend a launch party for a new social networking site , Bongo Virus , on New Years Eve. Paris will host the event , while Benji is scheduled to spin .
Bongo Virus confirmed that Prince William is invited to the bash , but would n't comment further .
Prince William will not be confirming his attendance until just before the event " for security reasons , " but he is " pretty keen to meet up with Paris , " said the insider .
Whether Prince William has anything to do with the split or not , it does n't seem that Paris is having any trouble moving on .
In addition to being spotted with her ex in Miami on Saturday , she was also seen at West Hollywood hot spot Apple , partying with gal pals and dancing on the couches into the wee hours of Wednesday morning .
George Bush was on the receiving end of the worst of all Middle Eastern insults at the weekend when an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at the outgoing US president at a press conference in Baghdad .
Throwing a shoe at a person 's head is n't , of course , considered insulting in only the Islamic world , though it does carry a particularly degrading symbolism ( showing the sole of your shoes is considered deeply offensive ; when the statue of Saddam Hussein was toppled in Baghdad in 2003 , Iraqis beat it with their shoes ) .
Bush steps down in January , but this surely wo n't be the last offensive gesture he encounters on his travels .
Here , then , is our handy guide .
The V sign
In his book Gestures the anthropologist Desmond Morris concluded that we will never know the origin of the two - fingered salute .
One theory , though widely discredited , is that the French threatened to cut off the fingers of English archers at the Battle of Agincourt ; the English would hold up two fingers as a sign that the French had failed .
Not to be mistaken with the victory or peace signs : Churchill often got his fingers facing the wrong way - and on a tour of Australia in 1992 , George Bush Sr flicked the Vs to a group of farmers .
The bras d'honneur
Not easily misunderstood - the slap of one hand against the crook of the opposite elbow , the aggressive thrust of the forearm and fist , and the giant phallus it is supposed to resemble .
Particularly popular in France ( where it is translated as " the arm of honour " ) and southern European countries .
An exaggerated " screw you " , if you like .
The thumbs up
In the Middle East , this is possibly the biggest insult you can inflict with your shoes on .
A Fonz - style double thumbs up adds insult to insult .
The same goes for parts of west Africa and South America .
Loosely translates as " sit on this " .
The OK sign
Like the thumbs up , the hand gesture that westerners know to mean everything is fine ( it comes from the hand signals used by divers ) has other meanings elsewhere .
Do it to someone in southern Europe , and you 'll be telling them they are " nothing " ( or " zero " ) ; in Brazil or Turkey an " arsehole " .
Bunny ears
Although this gesture is more commonly considered a prank to sabotage photographs , it is closely related to the Italian cornuto gesture , whereby two " horns " held up behind someone 's head are supposed to imply their spouse is cheating on them .
Biting the thumb
" I will bite my thumb at them , which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it . "
So said Sampson to his fellow Capulet servant Gregory in the first scene of Romeo and Juliet .
Rarely used in southern Europe these days but surely due for a comeback .
Open hand
Nobody likes having an open palm thrust in their face - the aggression is obvious - though in Greece , where it is known as the moutza , it means " I rub shit in your face " .
It originated in Byzantine Greece where criminals were paraded through the streets , faces blackened with soot , or worse .
Sunny Von Bulow Dead After 28 Year Coma 1932 -2008 ( Photos )
Martha ' Sunny ' von Bulow 1932 - 2008
, U.S. heiress , philanthropist and socialite died in a Manhattan nursing home on December 6 , after spending 28 years in a persistent vegetative state .
Sunny was stricken on December 21 , 1980 during a Christmas celebration at her home in Newport , Rhode Island .
She ended up in a hospital in a deep coma .
A previous hospitalization in April 1980 for similar symptoms and a breakdown of Sunny and her husband Claus von Bulow 's marital relationship caused her children from a previous marriage to suspect foul play after the second hospitalization .
They convinced law enforcement officials that Claus von Bulow had injected their mother with drugs that induced the coma .
Rhode Island prosecutors were eventually persuaded to present the evidence to a grand jury .
Claus von Bulow was tried and convicted and later acquitted of the charges .
Martha ' Sunny ' von Bulow is survived by Annie - Laurie Isham and Alexander Auersperg from her marriage to Prince Alfred of Auersperg , an Austrian tennis instructor .
At the time of their divorce in 1957 , Sunny had a net worth of $ 75 million .
Sunny is also survived by daughter Cosima von Bulow , 41 .
The three offspring split a $ 90 million inheritance at the death of their material grandmother and are Sunny 's sole heirs .
Claus von Bulow relinquished any claim to Sunny 's fortune many years ago at the behest of his daughter Cosima 's maternal grandmother , who threatened to disinherited the child for siding with her father in his quest to be acquitted of murder .
Claus von Bulow , 82 , lives in London , where he writes theater and art reviews .

LANDIKOTAL , Pakistan ( Reuters ) - Pakistani security forces aim to recapture trucks hijacked by militants as they were taking supplies to Western forces in Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass , a government official said on Tuesday .

Most supplies , including fuel , for U.S. and other Western forces battling a Taliban insurgency in landlocked Afghanistan are trucked through neighbouring Pakistan , which is also facing growing militant violence including a wave of bomb attacks .
In the latest attack , a suicide bomber blew himself up outside a stadium in the northwestern city of Peshawar shortly after the closing ceremony of an inter- provincial games , killing three people and wounding nearly a dozen , hospital officials said .
Pakistani Taliban militants hijacked 13 trucks without firing a shot as they passed through the Khyber Pass on Monday .
The gunmen later posed for photographs in front of two Humvee military vehicles and some of the trucks .
Security forces had blocked the main road from Peshawar through the pass to the border at Torkham in preparation for a recovery operation , and army helicopters later attacked militants , government officials said .
“ Two helicopter gunships went and hit militants ’ positions in the Malagori area but there ’s no report of casualties , ” said Bakhtiar Mohmand , a senior government administrator in the area .
Malagori is an area north of the Khyber Pass where militants have hideouts , he said .
“ We have asked for foot soldiers and as soon as they get here , we ’ll launch a ground operation , ” he said .
The trucks were carrying two Humvees and wheat but no weapons or ammunition , another official said .
The militants unloaded the trucks and abandoned them but held most of the drivers .

The Khyber region has long been notorious for smuggling and lawlessness , but until recently it was relatively free of Islamist militants .
But security has deteriorated this year and soldiers carried out a sweep in part of the Khyber region in June to push militants back from the outskirts of Peshawar .
Officials said the militants who seized the trucks were loyal to Pakistani Taliban commander Baitullah Mehsud , who is based in the Waziristan region to the southwest of Khyber .
The militants posed for photographs with a banner over one of the Humvees proclaiming their membership of Mehsud ’s group .
“ SECURITY IGNORED ”
Transport operators say the government has ignored security along the road .
About two dozen trucks and oil - tankers have been attacked in the past month .
Torkham , at the top of the Khyber Pass , is one of only two main crossing points on the Afghan - Pakistani border .
The other is at the town of Chaman , to the southwest , from where a road runs to the southern Afghan city of Kandahar .
Many goods for Western forces in Afghanistan are shipped into Pakistan ’s Karachi port and trucked through the crossing points .
NATO and Russia signed a land transit agreement in April allowing the alliance to use Russian land to deliver non-lethal supplies to troops in Afghanistan but it was not immediately clear what volume of NATO supplies was coming that way .
This year , four U.S. helicopter engines worth more than $ 13 million were stolen in northwest Pakistan while being trucked from Afghanistan to Karachi port to be shipped home .
Pakistani forces have been fighting militants in the Bajaur region and in the Swat Valley , both to the northeast of Khyber , and there has been growing speculation about an offensive in the Mohmand area , to the north of Peshawar .
Security forces were searching for militants by a road on the way to Mohmand on Tuesday and hundreds of villagers were leaving in fear of fighting , police and a government official said .
“ We have n’t asked people to leave , they are doing it on their own , but it ’s good if they do so before any trouble starts , ” said the government official in Ghalanai , the main town in Mohmand .
A coalition of conservation groups has just filed a formal protest opposing the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) decision to auction off 100,000 acres of public lands for oil and gas leasing and development .
Leases will be auctioned for wild and remote public lands in Utah , including White River , the greater Desolation Canyon region , Labyrinth Canyon , and the benches east of Canyonlands N.P .
[ social_buttons ]
The coalition includes Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance ( SUWA ) , The Wilderness Society ( TWS ) , Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , National Parks Conservation Association ( NPCA ) , Grand Canyon Trust ( GCT ) , and the Sierra Club .
Together they represent over a million Americans who support conservation efforts .
Some of the land includes protected areas that the National Park Service asked BLM to omit from the sale .
Kind of makes you wonder what ’s most important to us – oil , or wild and scenic places ?
I ’ve been through Labyrinth Canyon , and it ’s such an amazing place that I shudder to think what it would look like after being opened up to development .
December 12th has been set by the BLM as its timeline for announcing what other parcels it intends to defer from leasing at the December 19th sale .
This may or may not be the agency ’s final decision on the lease sale protests .
In addition to the land lease auction , the BLM has issued six controversial management plans for public lands across eastern and southern Utah , opening up large portions of red rock country to oil and gas drilling and off - road vehicles .
The coalition also intends to legally challenge these management plans .

Natalie Dylan Selling Her Virginity
Here ’s a nice piece of offbeat news for the day .
22 - year - old college graduate Natalie Dylan , who is looking to pursue a career in sex therapy , is currently making the news for auctioning off her virginity .
She appeared on The Tyra Banks Show and spoke about it for the first time on camera with Tyra .
The picture above is Natalie and a 59 - year - old guy that is currently bidding on taking her virginity .
She says she has received bids ranging between $ 1 million and $ 3.8 million from more than 5,000 men , including bids from a rock star and a famous actor .
Here ’s what she says about her decision to auction off her virginity :
“ We wanted to study the dichotomous nature between virginity and prostitution .
There ’s really been so few case studies of it … I stumbled upon this article of a Peruvian woman who wanted to sell her virginity and she was offered and exorbitant amount of cash … $ 1.5 million . ”
On how this is not like a regular auction :
“ It ’s not like an eBay auction … I do n’t have to take the highest bidder .
I ’m taking time to get to know the guys .
We contact each other back and forth . ”
On people having a distorted view of virginity :
“ I think people misconstrue virginity with being prudes .
I ’m definitely not ; I ’m very open - minded to what they want to do … I think this is about being pro-choice with your body . ”
And about her willingness to engage in different positions :
“ I ’m selling my virginity , it ’s a one time thing and I ’m definitely willing to work with them . ”
On having the option to back out of the deal :

“ Civilizations rise and fall , ” Dave said and I turned around to see if he was talking to me , but he was still staring at his monitor .
I looked over at Mac who was sitting at one of the other computers .
He was playing a game .
He did n’t seem to hear what Dave had said .
Dave is Dave Duffy , the fellow who publishes this magazine , and Mac is O.E. MacDougal , Dave ’s poker playing buddy who lives down in southern California .
I guess it ’s fair now to say Mac ’s my friend , too .
He ’d come up to the lake for another visit .
“ The civilizations of ancient Egypt , Athens , Rome … gone .
What happens ? ”
Dave asked .
I looked at Mac .
He was still playing the game .
I was going to give him some pointers strategies I had worked out over the last few months  but he seemed to be picking it up rapidly and was doing quite well .
“ Ever think about why Athens and Rome fell ? ” Dave asked .
“ No , ” I said .
“ Sure , ” Mac said without interrupting his game .
“ Will the United States ever fall like Athens , Rome , and those other countries ? ”
Dave asked .
“ Of course it will , ” Mac said .
I was surprised to hear him say that and I stopped what I was doing .
Dave turned around , too .
“ You ’re a real ray of sunshine , ” I said .
“ Do you really think so ? ” Dave asked Mac .
“ Sure .
And it ’s interesting that you mention the Greeks and Romans .
Not only because they ’re the ones we ’re most familiar with , but because they have had such a powerful influence on western civilization : our customs , governments , languages , and the way we think .
And the failures of both Athens and Rome influenced the Founding Fathers of this country when they formed our government . ”
“ Well , what happened .
I mean , what was it that brought down Athens and Rome ? ”
Dave asked .
“ To a large degree , both fell as a direct result of defects in their political systems . ”
“ What were the defects ? ”
“ With the Athenians it was the excesses of democracy . ”
“ That sounds dumb , ” I said .
“ How can you have too much democracy ? ”
Mac looked up at the ceiling for a second .
“ What do you guys know about the Athenians ? ”
“ Not much , ” Dave said .
I shrugged when Mac looked at me .
The Athenian democracy
“ First you should know that the Athenian democracy was different from modern democracies .
It was a direct democracy . ”
“ Meaning … ? ”
Dave asked .
“ What that meant was that all the enfranchised voters were entitled to meet in the town square and voted on nearly every issue .
There was no congress , no parliament , and the citizens had a direct voice in almost all matters .
Of course , women , slaves , and people of foreign birth , no matter what their contributions to society , could not participate in the Greek democratic process .
So , in that respect , it was a limited democracy .
That left only about 10 % of the adult citizens of Athens who could vote .
This meant a mere 5 % of the adult population could determine policy for everyone else .
And almost everything was determined by a simple majority voteeven trials . ”
“ Just seven out of twelve people could convict you of something ? ” I asked .
“ Seven out of twelve ? ” he asked .
“ Oh , no , decisions in trials were determined the same way in which other public matters were resolved , with the crowd .
Often hundreds of people came to hear the trials and if you were one of the enfranchised citizens who had come to hear a trial , you were also a juror .
Socrates was tried in just such a manner .
His exact crime was misleading the youths of Athens by encouraging them to question the state , its laws , and its religion .
His jury , as I recall , was about 800 citizens and he was condemned to death by a vote that ran something like 500 to 300 . ”
“ What about the right to free speech ? ” Dave asked .
“ Individuals had no rights as we know them today .
Any rights you had were subject to the whims of the crowd .
There was no freedom of speech , religion , or freedom from government intrusion into your life unless the crowd decided you were entitled to those rights and tomorrow they might change their minds . ”
“ So , ancient Athens had a democracy without any rights , ” Dave said .
“ Except the right to vote and that , only if you were enfranchised , and very few people were . ”
“ It ’s hard to think of a democracy and the lack of freedom coexisting , ” I said .
“ It sounds contradictory . ”
“ Ever read Claire Wolfe ’s book , 101 Things to Do til the Revolution , ” Mac asked .
“ We ran a review of it , ” I said .
“ She pointed out that most dictatorships today are democracies .
And she ’s right .
Today ’s dictatorships are very often countries in which democracy exists but the people are without freedom and without a basic bill of rights .
All of the former Communist Bloc countries and almost every third - world dictatorship hold elections , but no one would call them free countries . ”
“ I never thought of it that way , ” I said .
“ Did the Athenians see the flaws in their democracy ? ” Dave asked .
“ Sure they did .
Plato was among those who pointed out that democracy leads to tyranny and it did so in Athens .
But the proposed solutions for the problem , including his own solution , were usually to junk the democracy and replace it with some kind of benign tyranny .
For Plato , the rule of the people should be replaced with the rule of ‘ philosopher kings . ’
“ Other philosophers also had their own solutions .
But , in reality , those who really succeed in becoming tyrants are anything but philosophers .
The Roman Republic
“ Later , the Romans , saw the problems of the Greek democracy the most salient of which were that there was no stability , because the crowds that showed up to vote could be inflamed or impassioned temporarily , and that the voters could n’t always be available to vote on every issue at hand .
So the Romans created a representative form of government to put a buffer between the electorate and the decision making process and to ensure that there was a permanent body in place on a daily basis to conduct the business of the state .
This way state policy did n’t vary from one day to next on the whim of public opinion .
The crowd still voted , but they voted to elect those who were to represent them , just as we do today . ”
“ That was the origin of the Roman Senate , right ? ” Dave asked .
Mac nodded .
“ It was one of the world ’s first legislative bodies .
It ’s also the reason we called early Rome the Roman Republic republics are essentially representative forms of government . ”
We nodded knowingly .
I do n’t know why I did because I was feeling like an idiot .
“ But the trouble was , ” Mac continued , “ those elected were self - aggrandizing and , as history would show , the republican form of government itself all too often turned into tyranny , too . ”
“ And did Rome become a tyranny ? ” Dave asked .
“ By the time of Julius Caesar the Republic was falling apart as men clambered for power .
Caesar had himself made emperor , but there was still enough resistance so that , when he went to the Senate , men who did n’t want an autocrat running the country assassinated him .
But that did n’t stop other men from wanting to be tyrants and , eventually , Rome was permanently led by an emperoran absolute tyrant the first of whom was Augustus , Caesar ’s nephew .
From then on , the Roman Republic did n’t exist and we speak of the Roman Empire . ”
“ So a representative form of government was n’t enough to prevent tyranny , ” Dave said .
“ That ’s right .
And that ’s why centuries later our own Founding Fathers , seeing the major defects of both the Athenian and Roman systems that the individual was still at the mercy of the state , whether it was the crowd or the emperorcreated the Constitution .
Our Constitution lists the powers of the state .
Any powers not specifically given to the state in this case , the federal government are reserved to the people and the separate states that make up these United States .
And very soon after the Constitution was adopted , they added 10 amendments which guaranteed that we , as individuals , had certain rights upon which the government could not infringe .
“ Our Bill of Rights was the first and only time this kind of bill of rights has been adopted in history .
It makes the United States a quirk among nations .
Never before , nor since , and perhaps never again will people have the rights Americans have . ”
“ Do n’t people in other countries have rights in their constitutions ? ”
Dave asked .
“ Of course they do .
The British do , the Canadians do…any number of other countries do .
But , in every other country with a constitution or a bill of rights , the rights of the citizenry that is , the individuals is at the discretion of the government . ”
“ But not here ? ” Dave asked .
“ I wish you guys would read our Constitution .
It ’s a recipe for how the federal government is allowed to govern .
It ’s a document that limits the power of both the central government and the crowd .
Then read the first ten amendments , what we call The Bill of Rights , and you ’ll discover that it ’s not a bill of rights at all , but a set of restrictions against the government .
It never says the people can do something like have free speech or bear arms ; it says the government cannot prohibit them . ”
“ What ’s the difference ? ” I asked .
“ If the source of our rights is the government , then the government can take them away .
But , the way the Constitution and , in particular , the Bill of Rights is written , the Founding Fathers assumed our rights exist apart from the state because they exist within us they ’re inherent .
The state cannot take them away because the state did not grant them . ”
“ So , let me see , what you ’re saying is , as incongruous as it sounds , democracy confers neither rights nor freedom , ” Dave said .
“ That ’s right . ”
“ Hmm . ”
“ You do n’t sound as though you think freedom is going to last in this country , ” I interrupted .
“ No , I do n’t .
In the first place , the Constitution is in shambles .
There are all kinds of laws , passed by those who govern us , that contain exceptions to the Constitution and we put up with it .
In the second place , there is a power our Founding Fathers did not anticipate . ”
“ What ’s that ? ” Dave asked .
“ Bureaucrats . ”
“ Bureaucrats ? ” Dave asked .
“ Yes . ”
Dave and I did n’t say anything for a moment .
I was just trying to think of what this all meant and I guess Dave was too .
Finally , Dave asked , “ Do you really think bureaucracies can bring a country down ? ”
Bureaucratic power
“ Bureaucracies have been the reason for the stagnation or collapse of several civilizations , ” Mac said .
“ How ? ” Dave asked .
“ First of all , throughout all of history bureaucracies have had more power than most people realize .
In every civilization of consequence they ’ve reigned supreme .
In ancient Egypt the pharaohs were just figureheads .
Egypt itself was ruled by one of the first great bureaucracies .
“ It was the same with the kings and queens of Europe ; they were , with just a few notable exceptions , figureheads while the nations themselves were run by the bureaucrats .
These figurehead rulers the pharaohs , the kings , the emperorslent an air of legitimacy to the government , but the actual machinery almost always lay in the hands of the bureaucrats .
And no one who has ever wanted power has successfully ignored the bureaucracy for very long .
If they were unaware it existed before taking power , they soon learned of its existence and importance .
And , if they wanted to retain power , they had to leave it in place .
“ Alexander the Great understood the importance of making friends with the bureaucracies and he kept them intact in every city and country he conquered . ”
“ I thought they just slaughtered everyone during their conquests during those days , ” I said .
Mac shook his head .
“ Alexander understood the importance of political organizations and made sure , after each conquest , that he preserved the bureaucracy that had been in place .
They were the ones who had managed it before he appeared and he knew they were the ones who could keep it running smoothly after he went on to conquer the next city or country .
And this was how conquerers would behave throughout most of history .
“ Centuries later Niccolo Machiavelli in his book , The Prince , warned that when you conquer a country you should keep the bureaucrats in place and not make the mistake of trying to stick your own cronies in there .
And he explained why . ”
“ What were his reasons ? ” Dave asked .
“ Like Alexander , he knew that in the bureaucracies the real power lay but that , historically , bureaucrats have always been willing to switch their allegiance from an old regime to a new one as long as you paid them and let them retain their power . ”
“ You know , that actually makes sense , ” Dave said .
“ Of course it does .
History is full of examples where conquerers came and went , but the bureaucrats never changed .
“ Very often nations have been shaped , for better or worse , by what the bureaucrats desired , even if it was counter to the welfare of the state . ”
“ Can you give an example ? ” Dave asked .
China ’s bureaucracy
“ The best one I can think of was in China .
Today , China should be the preeminent power in the world , but because of its bureaucracy it did n’t happen . ”
“ What did they do ? ” Dave asked .
“ Six hundred years ago , China was much further along technologically , militarily , and culturally than any European country .
With their wealth , the size of their navy , the seaworthiness of their ships , and their command of navigation , both North and South America should have been discovered by the Chinese and become Chinese domains .
“ During the reign of a Chinese emperor named Yongle , the years between 1405 and 1431 were filled with Chinese exploration .
His chief admiral , a eunuch named Zheng
He , sailed with more than 300 ships and almost 28,000 men all the way to India , the Persian Gulf , and even Africa .
Some of his ships were 30 times the size of any of Columbus ’ three ships .
The Chinese were on the verge of dominating all of the world .
Europe should have had Chinese ships entering their ports to trade rather than the other way around .
But it did n’t happen .
And it was clearly not because the Chinese were incapable of it .
They could have gone on and on and ruled the entire globe . ”
“ So , what happened ? ” I asked .
“ The Chinese bureaucracy is what happened .
It was one of the most powerful that ever existed and would n’t let it happen . ”
“ Why ? ”
“ Bureaucracies are , by their very nature , extremely power hungry while at the same time very conservative .
I do n’t mean conservative in the political sense we mean today , but in maintaining the status quo .
And with the growth of their trading fleet and the rise of a merchant class in China , the bureaucracy saw the first real threat to their power in centuries .
“ Even though we , today , can see how the rise of a merchant class and a trading fleet would have benefited China as a whole , the bureaucrats saw them only as threats to themselves .
And , since they wielded considerable influence with the Chinese emperor , they induced him to forbid further exploration .
They put a limit on how far and to what ports the trade merchants and explorers were allowed to go .
They also had almost all of the records of their astounding feats of navigation and exploration destroyed so it would not happen again .
They wanted to forever squash any threat to their place in Chinese society and , for all the effect the feats of the Chinese explorers have had on how China developed since then , it may as well never have happened .
“ As a result , the Europeans became the world explorers and traders and their power expanded far beyond what one would have thought possible in the years before Columbus sailed .
And now the Chinese are playing catch - up .
Other bureaucracies
“ There are other examples of bureaucratic power that involve religion , corporations , and military power . ”
“ Religion ? ” I asked .
“ Historically , when the churches held great sway in the political world , they were an ideal place for ambitious individuals to rise to power through the bureaucracy .
Let ’s face it , a young man from a poor family had no chance of becoming a prince and being in line for the throne of England or some other country .
But poor young men of ability and ambition often rose through the ranks of the Church to positions of power .
And though many who went into the church were sincerely religious , many others seemed mesmerized by the political power they wielded .
It was because of such political power that the Inquisition was possible . ”
“ Are there any positive contributions of bureaucracies ? ” Dave asked .
“ Absolutely .
Writing was invented by bureaucrats .
Not for the writing of novels or the enlightenment of the masses , but to take inventories and the census , to keep track of taxes , record laws , notate maps , etc .
“ And no one not in China , Europe , or even this country formed a bureaucracy to tie civilization down .
They were meant to make civilization run more efficiently .
They were intended to serve as a tool , a means for getting work done and achieving society ’s objectives .
But , historically , they have become an end in themselves and , instead of the servant , they have become the master .
This is what happened in the communist countries and , though not to such a degree , it ’s what ’s happening in the west . ”
“ Is that what you think is happening here ? ” I asked .
“ Yes .
Wherever they are they have gained power , it has been at the expense of the individual .
This is how they ’ve operated throughout all of history , so there is very little reason for me to think they will operate any differently in the United States and the evidence is that they are not .
American bureaucracy
“ In fact , how a bureaucracy arises , expands , and aggrandizes power can be seen right here in the United States .
We started out with virtually no bureaucracy .
When the capital was moved from Philadelphia to Washington , D.C. , in the year 1800 , all that had to be moved were exactly 12 boxes of paperwork .
“ But , after that , the bureaucracy began to grow and assume more power , and more branches of government were formed and each needed its own bureaucracy to support it .
“ How did it grow ? ” Dave asked .
“ Originally , there were only four cabinets to support the Executive Branch … ”
“ What ’s the Executive Branch ? ” I asked .
“ That ’s the Presidency . ”
“ Oh , ” I said .
“ … they were the Treasury Department , the Attorneys General now called the Department of Justice , the Department of Foreign Affairs now called the State Department , and the Department of Warnow called the Department of Defense .
A little later , the Navy Department was created , but it was eventually incorporated into the Department of Defense .
“ For almost a half a century , no new cabinet departments were added , and we still had a relatively small government .
But eventually , new ones were added and they changed the way we are governed .
“ In 1849 , James Polk , one of the Presidents I admire , formed the Department of the Interior . ”
“ For what reason ? ” Dave asked .
“ Under his administration , the United States gained more territory than under any administration before or since .
It was an amazing amount of land , over a million square miles , more land than has made up most countries that have ever existed .
So , to manage it , he formed the Interior Department .
“ It was never intended that this department was to last forever , nor was it intended that the federal government permanently own almost 30 % of the United States .
The Founding Fathers did n’t want the central government to hold that much land and forbade it in the Constitution .
But once the Interior Department was formed , it was foreordained that the federal government would never relinquish its power .
I ’d like to say , in Polk ’s defense , I do n’t think it occurred to him the federal government would decide to hold onto the western lands in perpetuity .
But they have .
It was a blunder on his part .
“ After that , the federal bureaucracy continued to grow .
Today , there are 14 cabinet level bureaucracies , and they will never go away .
And they , along with all the bureaucratic machinery in this country , have become the unelected and invisible government , and each year they assume more power . ”
“ I never thought about it like this , ” Dave said .
“ You ’re not alone .
I find it funny that so many people in the press , in Congress , and in the electorate , think of reasons why we should limit the terms of office of those who govern us .
We limit our presidents to two terms and we ’re talking about constitutional amendments that would limit the time a senator or representative can spend in Congress .
But no one is saying anything about the permanent government the bureaucracy .
The personnel in this permanent government have no term limits , yet they pass regulations that have a profound effect on how our lives are conducted , and they are by default largely unaccountable for their actions . ”
“ What about the department heads appointed by the President ? ” I asked .
“ Each time a new President is elected , there are appointed positions to be filled .
And these positions very often go to political cronies and large campaign contributors .
But the appointees are often ignorant of what their departments do .
The result is that the bureaucrats have to train their bosses how to do their jobs .
And , when they do , they train them to do it ‘ the way it ’s always been done , ’ so the new appointees rarely if ever bring any meaningful innovation .
Then two , four , six , or eight years later a new regime is elected and a new set of appointees replaces the old ones and they have to be trained .
In the meantime , the bureaucracy goes on doing what bureaucracies do . ”
“ Do n’t you think that they mean well ? ” I asked .
“ No .
If they were presented with evidence that what they were doing was harmful or wrong , do you think they ’d say , ‘ Well , let ’s close up shop and go down to the employment office and file claims . ’
Of course not .
They have mouths to feed , mortgages to pay , credit card bills that come due .
They have their jobs and they want to keep them .
“ If you promise a week ’s pay , an annual vacation , and a retirement and health plan , you can get very ordinary people to justify their jobs even when their jobs are inherently harmful ; even when the job kills , maims , and ruins lives .
The Soviet gulags were run by bureaucrats ; the Nazi death camps were run by bureaucrats ; and in this country , we ’ve taken what is at very worst a critical health problemdrug abuse and criminalized it .
And to handle that , we have a bureaucratic system that runs our prisons very effectively . ”
“ You make it sound as if drug crimes are bureaucratic crimes . ”
“ They are .
And because of it , the War on Drugs is a problem that will never go away .
The huge bureaucracy that supports law enforcement wants it , the courts want it , and the prison system , as I said , wants it .
And because of that , we imprison a larger proportion of our population than any other country in the world more than China , more than Russia , more than any two - bit African or South American dictatorship .
“ And the only reason we can imprison as many people as we do is because we ’re a rich enough country to support these immense bureaucracies .
As we get richer , I predict we will find more crimes to imprison people for …unless the American people call for a halt to it . ”
“ Do you think they will ? ” Dave asked .
“ I ’m very pessimistic . ”
“ How do these things get out of control ? ” Dave asked .
Why have bureaucracies ?
“ We create bureaucracies to solve problems .
But that ’s not why people become bureaucrats .
What motivates the bureaucrat is the promise of a career , not public service .
And once created , bureaucracies have a need to expand their power , and that has nothing to do with the political system of the country .
The need to expand power is simply its nature .
The folks who staff a bureaucratic institution may be capitalists , socialists , royalists , or whatever when they go home .
But while they are at their jobs , they are bureaucrats , and expanding their power is their goal .
“ Then , the larger a bureaucracy becomes and the more it has to manage , the less those who are subject to the bureaucracy can control it .
Given the natural apathy of the majority , the bureaucrats become entrenched by default . ”
“ As they apparently did very well in China , ” Dave said .
Mac nodded .
“ Not only that , but bureaucrats often make decisions that favor various special interests and they do so for personal reasons .
In this country those interests could be anything from from corporations to environmental organizations , and they do it because of the prospect of getting hired by those organizations once they ‘ retire ’ from government .
While all this is going on , the citizen the taxpayer is caught in the middle .
“ Another problem with a bureaucracy is its approach to solving a problem .
The fact is , it is often against the interests of a bureaucracy to solve a problem .
Once solved , unless the solution has created more work for them , they ’re out of business .
So , they are n’t always interested in solutions . ”
“ Give me an example of a bureaucracy that would n’t go out of business , ” Dave said .
“ An easy one is the one John wrote about a while back .
When Prohibition ended , did the enforcers go home ?
Of course they did n’t .
They were sicced onto a problem that was out of the American mainstream drugs .
“ It was white America that brought Prohibition to an end .
So , when it ended , rather than going home , the bureaucrats went after drugs because the only people doing them were blacks and Mexicans .
No one cared who was getting thrown in jail until white college kids started seeing the inside of slammers in the ’60s .
Now , fully one third of the electorate wants at least marijuana decriminalized . ”
“ Give me an example of a bureaucracy that should be scaled back , but it ’s not happening . ”
The Cold War is over , and it seemed as if defense spending would be cut back .
But today spending is still up while new crisis are found .
“ What do you mean ?
There have been base closures and layoffs … ”
He got up and took the 1992 World Almanac and the 1997 World Almanac from the bookshelf .
“ Let ’s look at defense spending since the Cold War ended .
In 1987 , two years before the Cold War ended , total defense expenditures were about $ 274 billion .
In 1995 , six years after it ended , about $ 260 billion .
That ’s not much of a change . ”
“ I did n’t realize that , ” Dave said and Mac handed him the almanacs .
“ And when we try to cut bureaucracy by cutting their funding , the bureaucrats threaten revenge . ”
“ How ? ” Dave asked .
Mac thought a moment .
“ Let me start with a scenario of how government grows , and then what it does when we try to cut it back .
“ From the very earliest days of this country , the citizens expected roads , police and fire protection , and education .
Eventually libraries were even included .
The enormous growth of government since then has involved everything from farm subsidies to grants to the arts .
But , when the tax payers insist on tax cuts and less government spending , is it tree inspectors and artists we ’re going to lose ?
No , they tell us they ’re going to have to lay off police and firemen .
The schools will be closed .
They never say anything about sending the monumental bureaucracy home .
And does the electorate stand up to them and call their bluff ?
Of course not .
They believe this is what must be cut and they back away under bureaucratic threats . ”
“ You sure paint a bleak picture , ” I said .
“ We like to think that somehow we ’re different from those older civilizations those civilizations that got bogged down in their political machinery , that stagnated , then folded .
As a country , we certainly started out differently , but we ’re not different now .
We ’ve gradually let the bureaucratic superstructure evolve until , here at the end of the 20th century , we have more in common with the old world countries that have existed since the dawn of civilization than the America we started out with .
That America , for better or worse , is gone and will never come back . ”
“ Ca n’t we get rid of the bureaucracy ? ” I asked .
“ First of all , bureaucracies do n’t ‘ go away . ’
They live on forever .
Do you think the communist bureaucrats went home when the communists fell out of power ?
The bureaucrats just changed the title on the nameplates on their desks and continued right where they were . ”
“ As Machiavelli would have predicted they would have , ” Dave said .
“ That ’s right .
“ Besides that , I ’m not sure we want bureaucrats to go away .
What we want to do is to control them . ”
“ What do you mean ? ” I asked .
“ We want them more responsive to our needs and we want the bureaucrats who screw up to be personally responsible for their mistakes .
Controlling bureaucracy
“ There ’s no clear connection between the governed and the bureaucracies , so there ’s very little input into any bureaucracies .
That may be okay in France where the two most powerful forces are the President and the bureaucracy , but in this country the individual is supposed to reign supreme and the government is supposed to exist for his benefit .
But the bureaucrats do n’t see it that way , nor do the politicians , or even the electorate anymore , and because of that this country is becoming more and more European and less and less American .
“ But there are steps we could take to make bureaucracies less of a threat the same way our Founding Fathers tried to make the crowd and the legislature less of a threat by giving us a constitution that limits the government ’s ability to deprive us of our rights .
The first way might be to stress accountability .
Someone has to be in danger of losing his or her jobor even going to jail if a bureaucracy screws up or violates constitutional rights .
“ Second , not all bureaucracies allow their members to be unaccountable .
The military has a bureaucracy to make it run smoothly and the difference between it and the civil bureaucracy is that the military bureaucracy accepts personal initiative and responsibility .
It allows the individual to override the ‘ book ’ but stresses accountability .
In fact , that last one , accountability , may be the biggest difference of all .
Military personnel who throw the book out risk dishonor when they fail and recognition when they succeed .
In civilian bureaucracies , failure is ignored .
We should , perhaps , apply principles like that to political bureaucracies .
“ Another might be to make it mandatory that there be legislative review of all regulations bureaucracies enact .
Let bureaucracies submit laws and regulations to Congress before they can be enacted .
It may make things unwieldly , but this country was never meant to run efficiently , it was meant to be free .
“ By the way , did you know that only about one percent of all bills proposed in Congress are enacted but that about 99 percent of all regulations proposed by bureaucracies are put into effect .
How does that happen ?
Are we to believe bureaucrats know more about what the American people want than the legislators ? ”
We did n’t answer .
“ It also has got to be possible to make a bureaucracy go away .
To shut it down .
First of all , a bureaucracy should have stated goals and , when those goals are met , it should be shut down .
“ Perhaps it should also be possible to make a bureaucracy disappear by referendum so that bureaucracies are directly responsible to the public . ”
“ The I.R.S. would be the first to go , ” Dave said .
Mac smiled and shrugged .
“ But would n’t that be throwing power back to the crowd ? ” I asked .
“ Yes , it would .
But I say it only as a suggestion .
Come up with something better .
We need to get something going here so that bureaucracies are more responsive and the people have a greater say in what goes on in their lives .
“ But what I think would be better would be to allow jury trials by informed juries when people are indicted for violations against bureaucratic rulings . ”
“ What ’s an informed jury ? ” I asked .
“ We ’ve talked about this before .
An informed juror is a juror who realizes that when a citizen is on trial , the law is on trial , too .
“ Today , juries are routinely told that they cannot judge the law , despite the fact that they are legally entitled too .
No judge can order you to find a defendant guilty when you feel the law is wrongeven when you realize the defendant actually broke the law .
“ In fact , since the trials of the Nazis at Nuremberg , Germany , following World War II , it has been a felony in this country to imprison or execute someone when your conscience has told you it ’s wrong . ”
“ But are n’t people always allowed jury trials now ? ” I asked .
“ All too often there are no jury trials , as promised by the Constitution , when you are in violation of bureaucratic code .
Two good examples are tax laws and family law .
“ Let me ask you something , how does the accused stand when accused of a crime by the government ? ”
“ You ’re guilty until you ’re proven guilty , ” Dave said .
“ I do n’t know how many Americans realize this , but you are actually assumed guilty when prosecuted by the I.R.S. and , not only do they not have to prove you ’re guilty , they are under no obligation to show cause for indicting you .
And , if you ca n’t prove your innocence , you lose .
The I.R.S. even admits this is so .
I know it runs counter to our system of justice , but they do it anyway . ”
“ But , ” I said , “ They have to do it this way . ”
Mac looked at me as if in expectation that I had more to say on the subject .
“ If they did n’t do it that way , nobody would pay their taxes … it ’s the only way to see that they can collect taxes efficiently so that the government runs efficiently … ”
“ This is in the name of efficiency ? ” Mac asked .
“ Yes . ”
“ When our Founding Fathers founded this country and wrote our Constitution and the Bill of Rights , they placed several things far ahead of government efficiency and among them were liberty and personal freedoms .
People have died for those freedoms , but the I.R.S. finds them inconvenient . ”
“ And you feel jury trial …
“ … with jurors who are chosen at random from among our peers as guaranteed by the Constitution , and who are informed of their rights as jurors to question the fairness of the law … ”
“ Okay , okay ” I said .
“ But that might create new problems . ”
“ Every solution creates new , and often unforeseen , problems , ” he said .
“ But we ca n’t let that stop us from trying to solve the problems we have .
But I ca n’t help but think that allowing juries to be a buffer between the individual and the state ca n’t be all that bad , even if it does create new problems . ”
World - wide bureaucracy
“ What ’s the future ? ” Dave asked .
“ The ultimate bureaucracy will be the U.N .
It now has a governing body , it has a standing army , it has overturned the democratic elections in one country , Bosnia , and though it currently gets its money from national governments , there is already in place the machinery to allow the U.N. to get its finances through direct taxation . ”
“ Kind of an emerging world government , ” Dave said .
“ Yes .
But those who advocate one world government do n’t have history on their side .
Whenever and wherever government has acquired too much power , it has invariably become oppressive .
“ I used to think if we could take the U.S. Constitution , intact , as the guarantee for individual liberty , that one world government would be okay .
But we have the Constitution and it ’s already been subverted by our own government in particular , the bureaucrats ” .
“ Do you think that if we had a one world government it would be a democracy ? ” I asked .
“ Would it matter ?
I ’ve already pointed out that most dictatorships are democracies .
But that would just be one facet of the problems a worldwide government would create . ”
“ What else do you think would happen ? ” I asked .
“ How long do you think it would be before poor countries could take away the things we , the so - called rich countries , have worked to produce , to benefit themselves .
In a worldwide democracy without inherent rights and we are the only country that has such rights it will be just a matter of time before we have welfare on a global scope , administered , of course , by bureaucrats whose very existence will depend on them doing their job right . ”
“ Whose fault is all this bureaucratic takeover ? ” I asked .
“ Yours , ” he replied .
“ No , really . ”
“ Really .
Ultimately , the responsibility for the abuses of bureaucracies lie with you , me , Duffy … and 260 million other Americans .
If the American people said they really wanted more limited government , it would go away .
But , though they say they do , they really do n’t care and they wo n’t do anything about it .
If they really wanted it tens of millions would vote Libertarianeven if only for one or two elections and either elect people who are bent on reducing the size of government and its bureaucracies or just scare the hell out of the Democrats and Republicans so they would actually give us the smaller government they have been promising us for decades . ”
“ The Libertarians ? ”
“ Those more - freedom - less - government people .
But the fact is , Americans do n’t really care .
No politician or bureaucrat need lose any sleep tonight over what the American people say about wanting less government because the American people do n’t really care and they ’re getting the government they deserve .
The problem is that I too am getting the kind of government they deserve . ”
Dave laughed .
“ There must be some solutions , ” he said .
“ I often wonder how different things would be if on the back of the tax forms we fill out there was a ballot by which we vote for everyone from President to dog catcher , ” Mac said .
“ That might give politicians and bureaucrats nightmares . ”
“ It might .
People would be casting their votes when the problems of government was still fresh on their minds . ”
Dave looked serious now .
“ How long before the United States is no more ? ” he asked .
Mac shrugged .
“ That ’s not an easy question to answer .
China never fell , it just kept changing .
The fall of Rome took centuries and , even after there was n’t any Roman Empire left , many Europeans considered themselves Romans .
The United States will probably go on for centuries to come , but I guess we ’ll be able to say it ’s gone when we can say , ‘ not one of the Founding Fathers would be able to recognize their creation any more . ' ”
“ That does n’t sound good for us , ” Dave said and Mac went back to his computer game .
Consider , in particular , what happened after the crisis of 1997 - 98 .
This crisis showed that the modern financial system , with its deregulated markets , highly leveraged players and global capital flows , was becoming dangerously fragile .
But when the crisis abated , the order of the day was triumphalism , not soul - searching .
Time magazine famously named Mr. Greenspan , Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers “ The Committee to Save the World ”  the “ Three Marketeers ” who “ prevented a global meltdown . ”
In effect , everyone declared a victory party over our pullback from the brink , while forgetting to ask how we got so close to the brink in the first place .
In fact , both the crisis of 1997 - 98 and the bursting of the dot - com bubble probably had the perverse effect of making both investors and public officials more , not less , complacent .
Because neither crisis quite lived up to our worst fears , because neither brought about another Great Depression , investors came to believe that Mr. Greenspan had the magical power to solve all problems  and so , one suspects , did Mr. Greenspan himself , who opposed all proposals for prudential regulation of the financial system .
Now we ’re in the midst of another crisis , the worst since the 1930s .
For the moment , all eyes are on the immediate response to that crisis .
Will the Fed ’s ever more aggressive efforts to unfreeze the credit markets finally start getting somewhere ?
Will the Obama administration ’s fiscal stimulus turn output and employment around ?
( I ’m still not sure , by the way , whether the economic team is thinking big enough . )
And because we ’re all so worried about the current crisis , it ’s hard to focus on the longer - term issues  on reining in our out - of - control financial system , so as to prevent or at least limit the next crisis .
Yet the experience of the last decade suggests that we should be worrying about financial reform , above all regulating the “ shadow banking system ” at the heart of the current mess , sooner rather than later .
For once the economy is on the road to recovery , the wheeler - dealers will be making easy money again  and will lobby hard against anyone who tries to limit their bottom lines .
Moreover , the success of recovery efforts will come to seem preordained , even though it was n’t , and the urgency of action will be lost .
So here ’s my plea : even though the incoming administration ’s agenda is already very full , it should not put off financial reform .

She said her grease gun exploded , getting the dark gray stuff all over a camera and her gloves .
While wiping off herself , the white , backpack - size bag slipped out of her grip , and she lost all her other tools .
" Oh , great , " she mumbled .
Stefanyshyn - Piper was carrying out the spacewalk with Stephen Bowen .
He had his own tool bag with another grease gun , putty knife and oven - like terry cloth mitts to wipe away metal grit from a clogged joint at the space station .
Mission Control agreed the spacewalk would continue as planned , and that the two astronauts would share tools .
Flight controllers were assessing the impact the lost bag would have on the next three planned spacewalks .
Earlier , the spacewalkers spotted a screw floating by , but were too far away to catch it .
" I have no idea where it came from , " Stefanyshyn - Piper told Mission Control .
Mission Control said the screw was not considered a serious hazard , but did not immediately elaborate on the missing tool bag .
Flight controllers were tracking its location in orbit .
The lost bag marred what had been a near - flawless mission by Endeavour and its seven - member crew .
Putting her disappointment aside , Stefanyshyn - Piper - the first woman to be assigned as lead spacewalker for a shuttle flight - carried out her work on the joint with Bowen .
For more than a year , the jammed joint has been unable to automatically point the right - side solar wings toward the sun for maximum energy production .
The repair work - expected from the outset to be greasy and hand - intensive - is supposed to take up much of all four spacewalks .
The joint is located near the extreme reaches of the 354 - kilometre - high outpost .
The spacewalkers had 26 - metre safety tethers to keep them connected to the mother ship at all times .
NASA suspects a lack of lubrication caused the massive joint to break down ; grinding parts left metal shavings everywhere and prompted flight controllers to use the joint sparingly .
Besides scraping and wiping away the grit and applying grease , the spacewalkers will replace the bearings .
As a precaution , extra grease will be applied on a later spacewalk to the joint on the opposite side of the space station that has allowed those solar wings to produce ample electricity .
As the action unfolded outside , the astronauts inside the shuttle - station complex started unloading the gear inside a huge trunk that was brought up by Endeavour .
The big - ticket item - and one of the first things to be hooked up - is a recycling system that will convert astronauts ' urine and sweat into drinking water .
It is essential if NASA is to double the size of the space station crew to six next June .
Endeavour also delivered an extra bathroom , kitchenette , two bedrooms , an exercise machine and refrigerator that will allow space station residents to enjoy cold drinks for the first time .
The additions - coming exactly 10 years after the first space station piece was launched - will transform the place into a two - bath , two - kitchen , five - bedroom home .
Endeavour arrived at the space station on Sunday , with the next spacewalk set for Thursday .

This past weekend , Michael Arrington reported that Thoof , an Austin , Texas - based social news site , took a dirt nap .
It should n’t come as a surprise to our readers .
Stacey had the scoop way back in January that the company started by Ian Clarke ( one of the founders of Revver ) was up for sale .
Thoof wanted to create a Digg - like service by observing people ’s click streams .
The company raised some seed funding from Austin Ventures and others and hit its peak ( in terms of traffic ) in October 2007 before it began slip - sliding away into oblivion .
Thoof ’s web site now redirects to Reddit , one of the popular social news sites that ’s owned by CondeNast .
Given that the company was up for sale for about six months , I would say it ’s just the latest example of the fact that Web 2.0 remains a buyers ’ market — not a good sign for tens of dozens of companies that have cropped up across the web .
The buyers remain pretty disinterested — even Yahoo is still busy dealing with its own mess .
Microsoft is too distracted to do anything , and while Google and AOL are buying stuff , both of them are being highly selective .

The price of one gallon of regular unleaded gasoline at a BP gas station in Hebron , OhioThursday .
GAS PRICES GAS PRICES State - by - state gasoline averages from AAA JOIN THE DISCUSSION JOIN THE DISCUSSION
The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline is rising fast .
How has the price affected you ?
Join the discussion at USA TODAY 's Fuel Forum to swap stories and money - saving tips with fellow readers .
WASHINGTON 
The national average price for a gallon of gasoline has fallen below $ 2 for the first time since March 2005 , the Energy Department and AAA say .
The price for regular unleaded gasoline fell for the ninth week in a row , sinking to $ 1.989 a gallon overnight Friday , AAA says .
Thirty states have gasoline prices that average under $ 2 a gallon , according to the AAA travel club .
REFINERS PINCHED : Crude oil costs more than gasoline WE'RE DRIVING LESS : Despite falling gasoline prices GAS FORUM :
How much did you pay for gas today ?
Falling gasoline prices are putting extra money in the pockets of consumers , but there is concern some drivers may return to their gas - guzzling vehicles .
The chairman of the Senate Energy Committee said Monday the new Congress probably will not approve legislation to raise the federal tax on gasoline .
Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman said he was aware of arguments that a high " variable tax " should be put on U.S. gasoline to prevent falling pump prices from encouraging Americans to drive more while making alternative fuels less attractive .
Such a tax hike " would be very tough to pass , " Bingaman said .
" I do n't think something like that has much prospect of being enacted in my honest opinion . "
Americans pay an 18.4 - cent federal tax on each gallon of gasoline they buy , plus another 29 cents on average in combined state and local taxes .

This blog runs on Wordpress , and I 'm quite happy with it .
It 's simple to configure and use , is very well supported and the huge amount of plugins and extensions make every wish come true almost automatically .
When we had to open a trave log , I did n't think twice before using Wordpress for that too .
Regardless of the general theme of this post , I 'm thankful for Wordpress , and do think that its developers and maintainers deserve kudos on creating such a great piece of software , for free .
Wordpress is implemented in PHP , like most popular web applications .
In the world of ( open - source ) web applications , PHP is a 500 - ton train sweeping everything else aside .
Do you need a CMS ?
No problem , have Drupal or Joomla .
A photo - album ?
There 's Coppermine ( which I 'm also using for our online photo album ) .
Need a forum ?
Everyone knows that phpBB rulez .
And some of the big competitors , like punBB and Invision are also written in PHP .
There are literally truckloads of articles online explaining the popularity of PHP , so I wo n't just drop another leaf into it .
Rather , I just want to express an opinion that it's a damn shame that this is the situation , because PHP is a bad language that encourages bad programming practice , which makes tinkering with large PHP painful .
I 'm a natural tinkerer , and my Wordpress blog is self - customized in several minor ways .
I 've also customized some of the plugins I use for my special needs .
I can't describe the disgust and horror I sometimes experience when fixing or changing something in Wordpress 's PHP code .
So much things are global - the variables , the hooks , the functions .
Even after PHP added OOP , most code does n't use it , or only uses it in a very rudimentary way as module - like wrappers .
PHP is probably an ideal language for applications to which many sub-competent hackers add code .
It has almost no " accepted style " and people place no limits on what they do .
This is a real shame .
I firmly believe that Python is a superior language to PHP .
In all domains except web programming it's also much more popular , so I 'm really saddened by the lack of competition to PHP web apps from Python 's side .
There 's absolutely nothing in Python that makes it less suitable for web applications than PHP - it 's simply a matter of custom .
Therefore , I think it would be really great if at least one of the big - gun web apps was written in Python .
Maybe a competitor to Wordpress , or a forum software .
I , for once , would be delighted to use it once it 's stable enough .
And it should n't be too hard , either .
All it would take is a single dedicated and talented Python hacker , perhaps in a setting like the Google Summer of Code .
Take Wordpress for instance .
It weighs less than 30 KLOC of PHP code .
Even assuming that PHP - Python translation is 1 - to - 1 , brushing some of the more advanced features aside the Python replacement could easily be written in a summer .
At first , it can mimic the Wordpress architecture to make the transition easier .
Then , once the project gains users and momentum , the code can be slowly and surely refactored to bring more good Python practices in .
I hope someone will start such an endeavor .
Perhaps the Django team could offer it as a GSoC project for a Wordpress replacement using Django ( which would surely shave lots of code , as WP itself is written in pure PHP w/o any framework beneath ) .
Slingin’ Sammy Baugh , a record - setting passer , punter and defensive back who led the Washington Redskins to two National Football League championships in 16 seasons and whose wide - open style of play helped usher professional football into the modern era , died Dec. 17 at Fisher County Memorial Hospital in Rotan , Texas .
He was 94 .
Baugh , a charter member of the NFL Hall of Fame , had lived for the last few years at a nursing home in the small West Texas town of Jayton , about 30 miles from his beloved Double Mountain Ranch .
His daughter - in - law , Jean Baugh , said he died of kidney failure and pneumonia .
Doctors told her his body just wore out .
Sportswriter Dan Jenkins , who saw Baugh play at Texas Christian University and with the Washington Redskins , called him “ the greatest quarterback who ever lived , college or pro . ”
Baugh , a tall , rangy Texan , was a superb all - around athlete -- he signed a professional baseball contract with the St. Louis Cardinals the summer before joining the Redskins .
As a rookie , Baugh led the team to its first division title and an opportunity to play the Chicago Bears , the fearsome Monsters of the Midway , for the NFL championship .
During 16 seasons with the Redskins , Baugh would direct the team to four divisional titles and a second NFL championship in 1942 .
He retired after the 1952 season as a popular icon of football excellence .
For most of his career in Washington , he played both defense and offense as well as on special teams .
But he was always best known as a pinpoint passer who could hit his receivers over long and short distances while under extreme defensive pressure .
For six seasons -- 1937 , 1940 , 1943 , 1945 , 1947 and 1949 -- he led the NFL in passing .
Twice he threw six touchdown passes in a single game .
His career totals were more than 1,700 completed passes , 187 for touchdowns .
He also was a superb punter , the last master of the all - but - forgotten stratagem of the quick kick , and a formidable defensive back .
Against the run , he was a fierce tackler who could bring down the fabled fullback Bronko Nagurski .
Defending against the pass , he was an interception threat .
He had 28 over his career .
In one season , 1943 , he led the NFL in passing , in punting and in interceptions with 11 .
He ’s the only player ever to lead the league in offensive , defensive and special teams categories .
Baugh led the Redskins to a second NFL championship with a 14 - 6 victory over the Chicago Bears in 1942 , coming from behind after the Bears scored first on a 50 - yard runback of a recovered Redskins fumble .
In that contest , Baugh stunned the Bears with an 85 - yard quick kick on a third - down play , tossed a 25 - yard touchdown pass to halfback Wilbur Moore and orchestrated an 80 - yard drive for the final score that ended when Andy Farkas ran the ball into the end zone from the 1 - yard line .
That game was sweet revenge for a 73 - 0 humiliation of the Redskins by the Bears in the 1940 NFL championship game .
Playing at Griffith Stadium in Washington , 10 different Bears players scored 11 touchdowns .
The Redskins , who had defeated the Bears 7 - 3 on the same field three weeks earlier , botched a scoring opportunity early in the game when the usually reliable receiver Charlie Malone dropped a Baugh pass on the goal line .
At the time , the Bears had scored only seven points , and the outcome of the game was still in doubt .
Someone later asked Baugh if the result would have been different had Malone not dropped the pass .
“ Sure , ” Baugh said .
“ The final score would have been 73 - 6 . ”
Samuel Adrian Baugh was born in Temple , Texas , and moved to Sweetwater in high school .
He played four years of high school football , but his main sport was baseball , and he was recruited to play third base at Texas Christian .
He did , but he also joined the football team , and was an All - American as TCU won the 1935 national championship and the Sugar Bowl and the Cotton Bowl .
In 1935 , he also was the star of the College All - Star Game , which was sponsored by the Chicago Tribune , throwing a touchdown pass to beat the Green Bay Packers , 6 - 0 .
In Washington , his greatest success came during his early years .
Baugh ’s last winning season came in 1948 , when the Redskins had a 7 - 5 record .
He took the team to its fourth Eastern Division title in 1945 , the last one of his career .
During his final year with the Redskins , Baugh injured his hand in the fourth game of the season , and was unable to grip the football for a month .
He saw only limited action thereafter .
In December 1952 , he retired .
For five years after leaving the Redskins , Baugh coached football at Hardin - Simmons College in Texas , compiling a won- lost record of 23 - 28 .
He also was a coach of freshman football at Oklahoma State University , a backfield coach at the University of Tulsa and head coach for two years of the New York Titans , later the New York Jets , of the fledgling American Football League .
He was head coach of the Houston Oilers in 1964 and had a record of four wins and 10 losses .
But the job interfered with his West Texas cattle operations , and he left to return to his 6,300 - acre ranch near Rotan .
In 1938 , Baugh married his college sweetheart , Edmonia Smith , in Sweetwater .
She died in 1990 .
Survivors include four children , Tod Baugh of Billings , Mont. , David Baugh of Rotan , Stephen Baugh of Midland , Texas , and Frances White of Lubbock , Texas ; 11 grandchildren ; and 12 great - grandchildren .

That the $ 100 - billion fast food industry rests on a foundation of corn has been known more through inference and observation than hard scientific fact — until now .
Chemical analysis from restaurants across the United States shows that nearly every cow or chicken used in fast food is raised on a diet of corn , prompting fresh criticism of the government 's role in subsidizing poor eating habits .
" People had talked about what they observed or found out about , as individual journalists or individual consumers , " said University of Hawaii geobiologist and study co-author A. Hope Jahren .
But anecdotes do not add up to scientific proof , she said .
" We got national data on how this food is being produced .
It 's very objective . "
Corn is central to agriculture in the United States , where it is grown in greater volumes and receives more government subsidies than any other crop .
Between 1995 and 2006 corn growers received $ 56 billion in federal subsidies , and the annual figure may soon hit $ 10 billion .
But in recent years , environmentalists have branded corn as an icon of unsustainable agriculture .
It requires large amounts of fertilizer and pesticides , both of which require large amounts of fossil fuel to manufacture .
Most of the resulting corn is fed to livestock who did n't evolve to subsist entirely on corn .
In cattle , eating corn increases flatulence emissions of methane — a potent greenhouse gas — and creates an intestinal environment rich in * e. coli , * a common cause of food poisoning .
That necessitates mixing cow feed with antibiotics , in turn producing antibiotic - resistant disease strains .
Many of those livestock end up in high - calorie , low - nutrition franchised fast foods , which have been repeatedly linked to obesity , diabetes and heart disease .
Fast food 's biggest selling point is its low price — and that , say industry critics , is largely possible because of corn 's ubiquitous cheapness .
" We 're seeing that corn is the number - one reason that fast food is so cheap and available , " said Meredith Niles , a food policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety who was not involved in the study .
" U.S. programs are subsidizing obesity in this country . "
Jahren 's team analyzed hamburgers , chicken sandwiches and french fries from multiple McDonald's , Burger King and Wendy 's restaurants in six U.S. cities .
In both types of meat at every location , a telltale configuration of nitrogen and carbon traces showed that the animals had eaten corn- heavy diets ; in the case of beef , 150 out of 162 samples came from animals that ate nothing but corn .
Fries were prepared in corn - based oil .
The results were n't surprising , said New York University food studies expert Marion Nestle , but underscored the fact that " most people are n't aware of the extent to which corn ingredients permeate the food supply . "
Nutrition aside , Jahren urged consumers to consider the implications of what they eat .
" When you give a nickel to fast food , invariably it goes right back to the corn industry , " she said .
For Niles , the results are a political challenge .
" We have a new President taking his place in the White House .
It 's a great opportunity to rearrange agricultural policy and to think about obesity , " she said .
" This study shows that it comes down in a lot of ways to one product . "

In functional reactive programming ( FRP ) , the type we call “ behaviors ” model non-interactive behavior .
To see why , just look at the semantic model : t -> a , for some notion t of time .
One can argue as follows that this model applies to interactive behavior as well .
Behaviors interacting with inputs are functions of time and of inputs .
Those inputs are also functions of time , so behaviors are just functions of time .
I held this perspective at first , but came to see a lack of composability .
My original FRP formulations ( Fran and its predecessors TBAG and ActiveVRML ) , as well as the much more recent library Reactive , can be and are used to describe interactive behavior .
For simple sorts of things , this use works out okay .
When applications get a bit richer , the interface and semantics strain .
If you ’ve delved a bit , you ’ll have run into the signs of strain , with coping mechanisms like start times , user arguments and explicit aging of inputs , as you avoid the dreaded space - time leaks .
Behaviors
Suppose I define an object that pays attention to an input that ’s interesting near a certain time .
For instance , a cat chasing a bird in the back yard one morning last week .
Now shift the behavior a week forward to this morning .
The result is just a week - delayed form of the earlier behavior , displaying reactions to week - old input .
The original interactive behavior ( the cat ) was fed input ( bird and yard ) from a week ago , the result was recorded , and that recording is replayed a week later .
Written functionally ,
laterObserveCat :: Behavior World ->
Behavior Cat laterObserveCat = later week .
cat
where
world :: Behavior World cat :: Behavior World ->
Behavior Cat later :: Duration -> Behavior a ->
Behavior a
We can also sit in the living room , five meters north of the back yard , and watch the cat via a camera .
livingRoomObserveCat :: Behavior World -> Behavior Cat livingRoomObserveCat = north ( 5 * meter ) .
cat
Typically recordings are moved both in space and in time .
For example , record the cat in the back yard one week and watch the recording in the living room a week later :
replayLRL :: Behavior World ->
Behavior Cat replayLRL = later week .
north ( 5 * meter ) .
cat
Interactive behavior
I ’ve just described transforming a non-interactive behavior ( recording ) in time and space .
That non-interactive behavior resulted applying an interactive behavior ( the cat ) to some input ( bird and yard ) .
An interactive behavior is simply a function from non-interactive behavior ( time - varying input ) to non-interactive behavior ( time - varying output ) .
Consider what it means to transform an interactive behavior in space .
I pick up the cat and carry her five meters north , into the living room .
The cat has a different perspective , which is that her environment moves five meters south .
For instance , the mouse that was one meter south of her is now six meters sounth .
If I lift the cat four feet above the ground , she sees the ground now four below her .
If I spin her clockwise , her environment spins counter - clockwise .
If I point my shrinking ray at her , she sees her world as growing larger , and she flees from the giant mice .
We can play the perspective game in time as well as space .
I point my speed - up ray at the cat , and she perceives her environment slow down .
When I say I move the cat north and she see her environment move south , I am not suggesting that there are two alternative perspectives and we might take either one .
Rather , a complete picture combines both movements .
The behavior my cat exhibits when I pick her up is composed of three transformations :
The world moves south ;
The cat perceives this more southerly world and responds to it ; and
The resulting cat behavior is moved north .
Written functionally ,
livingRoomCat :: Behavior World ->
Behavior Cat livingRoomCat = north ( 5 * meter ) .
cat .
south ( 5 * meter )
Similarly with other spatial transformation , each with paired inverse transformations .
And similarly in time , e.g. ,
laterCat :: Behavior World ->
Behavior Cat laterCat = later week .
cat .
earlier week
So there ’s a semantically consistent model of transforming interactive behaviors in time or space , and this model explains the difference between transformation of non-interactive behavior and of interactive behavior .
Aside
Comparing these two definitions with the previous two suggests an alternative implementation .
Refactoring ,
laterCat :: Behavior World -> Behavior Cat laterCat = laterObserveCat .
earlier week
Instead of carrying the interactive cat a week ahead in time , this definition suggests that we move the world ( other than the cat ) back one week , record the cat interacting with it , and hold onto that recording to watch a week later .
My back - of - the - envelope calculations suggest that this second implementation is less resource - efficient than the first one , so I ’ll not consider it further in this post .
Arrow FRP
When we use for an interactive setting the tools suited to non-interactive behaviors , we ’re begging for space leaks ( filling up recording media ) and time leaks ( fast - forwarding through old recorded matter to catch up with what we want to see ) .
These problems are what people experience when programming explicitly with might call “ classic FRP ” , i.e. , programming explicitly with ( non-interactive ) behaviors .
Out of this experience was born “ Arrow FRP ” , as in Fruit and Yampa .
The idea of Arrow FRP was to program with a type of “ signal functions ” , which can be thought of as mappings between behaviors :
type SF a b = Behavior a ->
Behavior b
( Behaviors were also renamed to “ signals ” , but I ’ll stick with “ behaviors ” for now . )
We can just look at semantic model for signal transformers and see that they ’re about interactive behavior .
A lot of work was done with this new model , mostly growing out of Paul Hudak ’s group at Yale .
It addressed the inherent awkwardness of the explicit - behavior style .
Despite this fundamental advantage of signal transformers , why am I still fooling around with the “ classic ” ( pre-arrow ) style ?
The Arrow style required multiple behaviors to be bunched up into one .
That combination appears to thwart efficient , change - driven evaluation , which was the problem I tackled in Simply efficient functional reactivity .

There was no room for the distinction between behaviors and events .
I ’d love to see how to combine them without losing expressiveness or semantic accuracy , and I have n’t yet .
Arrow programming is very awkward without the special arrow notation and has more of a sequential style than I like with the arrow notation .
I missed the functional feel of classic FRP .
Coming up
Given the fundamental semantic fit between signal transformers for the problem domain of interactive behavior , I ’d like to come up wh convenient and efficient packaging .
The next posts will describe the packaging I ’m trying out now .
In functional reactive programming ( FRP ) , the type we call “ behaviors ” model non-interactive behavior .
To see why , just look at the semantic model : t -> a , for some notion t of ...
The Obama administration and the next Congress are being urged , by a growing number of academics , environmentalists , and lawmakers , to address the country 's water problems , including its dwindling supplies , inadequate environmental protections , and stalled cleanup efforts .
Over the past decade , a potent combination of Supreme Court decisions , Bush administration regulatory actions , and congressional inaction — coupled with recent droughts and the specter of more pronounced problems from climate change — has helped breed crises of both water quality and water availability , they say .
At the top of their priority list : reviving federal laws — particularly the Clean Water Act — that have been weakened or narrowly interpreted in recent years ; boosting funding for the nation 's faltering and aging water infrastructure ; and strengthening the Environmental Protection Agency 's regulation of water pollution from industry and power plants .
Many of these priorities appear to align with those of Barack Obama .
In his remarks about a stimulus package last week , Obama stressed the need for infrastructure improvement .
During the campaign , he touted his support for water protection in battleground states like Florida , pledging to help protect and restore the Florida Everglades .
His campaign advisers , meantime , say he will support legislation to restore the full scope of environmental laws that were weakened under the current administration .
Environmentalists want him to start by rejuvenating the Clean Water Act — the main water - pollution control act in the United States .
Passed in 1972 , the law was interpreted by both Congress and the courts for nearly 30 years as protecting virtually all federal waters .
But in 2001 , and again in 2006 , the Supreme Court handed down rulings that served , in effect , to limit the law 's reach .
Now , more than 20 million acres of wetlands , along with more than half of the country 's steams and rivers , are more vulnerable to pollution as a result of the court 's decisions and EPA rules that have followed .
" Clean water enforcement is essentially broken at this point , " says Joan Mulhern , senior legislative counsel at Earthjustice , a nonprofit law firm that has prosecuted many of the most high - profile environmental cases of the past decade .
Moreover , because of uncertainty resulting from the court 's 2006 decision , the EPA has delayed processing hundreds of environmental violations .
To return the Clean Water Act to its original standing , environmentalists are asking Congress to pass legislation clarifying that the law applies not just to main waterways or waterways closely linked to main waterways , as some justices on the Supreme Court have argued , but to all types of federal waters .
Such a bill already has been proposed by Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Barbara Boxer and has been endorsed in principle by Obama .
" I would not be surprised if that actually got passed within the first few years of the Obama administration , " says Florida State law Prof.
Robin Craig , one of the nation 's top experts on water law .
Another concern is the condition of the nation 's sewage systems and water treatment facilities .
There is bipartisan consensus that the nation 's water infrastructure is in urgent need of repair .
" The nation 's sewage infrastructure for the 21st century is in abominable shape , " says Mulhern .
In June , presaging an argument he made last week supporting a second stimulus package , Obama told a crowd in Flint , Mich . , " If we want to keep up with China or Europe , we can't settle for crumbling roads and bridges , aging water and sewer pipes .
It 's gotten so bad that the American Society of Civil Engineers gave our national infrastructure a D. " Environmentalists are hopeful that any stimulus package Obama assembles will include at least $ 10 billion for water treatment systems and water - related projects .
They note that the Clean Water Act at one point provided $ 1.35 billion a year for infrastructure improvements .
Because of recent budget strains , that amount has been cut by more than half .
And as Craig and others point out , water quality is only half the battle .
Water supply is the other half .
" We are running out of water , and I do not say that facetiously , " she says .
Large parts of the United States depend on aquifers — such as the Ogallala aquifer under Texas and Oklahoma — that contain what Craig calls " fossil water " and are unlikely to refill .
Climate change is exacerbating water problems in many regions and water shortages are , in turn , making water quality issues more extreme .
" These are not unrelated issues , " says Craig .
" If you do n't have enough water in a river , you make whatever pollutants are there worse because they 're more concentrated . "

( Reuters ) - Andrew Grove , the former chairman of Intel Corp , is pushing the chipmaker to make advanced batteries for plug - in electric cars , the Wall Street Journal said .
Grove , who retired in 2005 but still advises Intel , is urging Chief Executive Paul Otellini to steer the company to battery production as a way to diversify the business and fill a strategic niche as automakers shift to the production of plug - in electric vehicles , the paper said .
Otellini declined to comment , but an Intel spokesman said the company already has investments in battery - related companies through its Intel Capital unit , the paper said .
Grove told the paper that Intel ’s deep pockets gives it the ability to figure out ways to improve batteries and drive down costs .
Intel and Grove could immediately be reached for comment by Reuters .

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - Teachers using red pen to mark students ’ work could be harming their psyche as the color is too aggressive , according to education strategies drafted by an Australian state government .
The “ Good Mental Health Rocks ” kit , which was distributed this month to about 30 schools in Queensland state , offers strategies such as “ do n’t mark in red pen ( which can be seen as aggressive ) - use a different color . ”
Other tips include structuring time for peer tutoring every day , apologizing to students when necessary and asking students to conduct a “ personal skills audit ” where they focus on their individual strengths rather than their weaknesses .
The kit , designed to help Queensland teachers address mental health in the classroom , suggests social and emotional wellbeing has been linked to young people ’s schooling , among other things .
The education aid has sparked a row in parliament , with deputy opposition leader Mark McArdle calling it “ kooky , loony , loopy lefty policies . ”
But Health Minister Stephen Robertson , whose department devised the kit , said youth suicide was a serious issue .
“ If mental health professionals determine that as one of a number of strategies teachers should consider , then I ’ll support them every day of the week , ” he told reporters recently .
“ This is not a matter for ridicule , this is serious . ”
According to some Australian mental health groups , the greatest number of people with mental illness are aged between 18 and 24 years , with 14 percent of Australian children and adolescents suffering from some sort of illness .
Boys are slightly more likely to experience mental health problems than girls and depression is one of the most common conditions in young people and increases during adolescence , the website of mental health group Mindframe said .

General Motors Co. Start Rumor Anew
The announcement last week of the formation , as a New Jersey corporation , of the General Motors Company , supposed to be the much - talked - of holding company which is to absorb all of the producers of low - priced cars in the automobile market , has created quite a flurry of interest .
It is said that three - quarters of the stockholders of the Olds Motor Works at Lansing and a proportion of the Buick Motor Company of Flint , Mich . , have already assented to a merger plan .
* * *
The basic idea behind the combination proposals has been the purchase of materials in quantities effecting a considerable saving in the cost of production , the distribution of the field so as to avoid competition in the production of cars of each given price , apportioning to each concern the type which it shall produce , and the limitation of it to that type .

Bell 's Cellular Radio Plans
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company informed the Federal Communications Commission today that it intends to stay in the new cellular radio business after its proposed divestiture of the 22 local telephone companies .
Cellular radio is a relatively new technology , developed over the past two decades by Bell Labs and others , that will provide an improved form of mobile and portable telephone service .
The F.C.C. later this year will approve franchises to offer the new phone service in localities around the country ...
Local cellular phone service would be offered and maintained by the local phone companies as regulated businesses , according to present plans .
* * *
Unlike conventional mobile telephone systems , which have one large sending and receiving antenna , usually near the center of town , cellular systems have multiple antennas , with each serving one small geographic section or cell .
As a vehicle moves through the city , its receiver obtains a signal from the closest antenna , handing off the customer from one cell to another as it moves through the streets .

April 1 , 1963
Resources of U.S. Found Adequate for this Century
The United States will have enough natural resources for at least the rest of the century to meet the demands of an increasing population and a rising national economy , it was reported today .
The nation , however , may face severe temporary and regional shortages of some resources , such as water and timber , and in the latter part of the century will probably be forced to turn to new sources for many raw materials .
* * *
Before the end of the century , it seems possible the country 's petroleum and natural gas resources " will be sufficiently depleted to bring into play an expanding flow of alternative energy sources . "
The incipient resources problem of domestic oil and gas , however , will be greatly mitigated , if not offset , by the increasing contribution of nuclear energy , exploitation of the oil shales of the Colorado Plateau and the tar sands of northern Canada , possibly gasification of coal into a high - energy fuel long - range shipment of natural supplies of oil and gas known to exist in the Middle East and North Africa and probably in other parts of the world , thus far only sporadically explored .

New System for Rating Top College Team
The latest attempt to guarantee a true college football national championship game was unveiled yesterday by the Bowl Championship Series , which concocted a complex formula of ratings that might have been devised by Stephen Hawking .
* * *
Despite taking six months to create the rating formula , which calls for measures like adjusted deviation of computer rankings and statistical weighting of opponents ' strengths of schedules , Roy Kramer , the Southeastern Conference commissioner and coordinator of the Bowl Championship Series , said it is not overly complex .
" I do n't think it 's more complicated than figuring out how a football writer can choose between a No. 9 and a No. 4 team , " he said .

British TV's Claim to Superiority Over U.S. Variety : There 's Less of It
At 10:50 on Saturday evening BBC " “ the government supported station " “ concludes the week with a satiric revue entitled That Was the Week That Was , with David Frost in charge of the improprieties .
* * *
After staring at routine programs for eight days it is refreshing to find something as skittish as TWTWTW .
The fact that it needles the government on a government station is interesting in itself .
But anyone familiar with the satiric brilliance of the stage revue , Beyond the Fringe , knows that TWTWTW is mediocre stuff .
Most of it is heavy - handed in an amateur style .
Some of it does not get beyond insulting the guests of the program " “ the cheapest method of getting attention on both sides of the Atlantic .
The personal insult is no funnier in London that it is in New York .
Nor is the general level of British TV higher .

The big change in Fred Trump 's operations in recent years is the advent of his son , Donald " ¦.
Donald , who was graduated first in his class from the Wharton School of Finance of the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 , joined his father about five years ago .

A Watch That Takes the Hard Time Out of Telling Time
Now there 's a new toy for the man with a collection of watches .
The digital watch , which is operated by a sort of tiny computer , takes all the guess work out of time reading by flashing the hours and minutes in numerals on its face .
* * * * *
Sales are brisk although the Pulsar is not a thing of beauty compared to many good watches .
The watch itself is thick , to accommodate its computer and battery , and weighs about four ounces with its metal strap .
Until its " command " button is pressed , it shows nothing but a blank , dark - red face and looks like a dead television screen .
But that , presumably , is the fun of owning one .
Ask the Pulsar wearer what time it is , and without saying a word , he presses the button and you know it 's 9:42 .

Weinberger Drops Debate At Oxford
Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger has withdrawn from a debate on foreign policy at Oxford University after a warning from his British counterpart that his participation " might not be advisable " because of the approach of a general election .
Andrew Sullivan , president of the Oxford Union , which had hoped to stage the debate on May 27 , said Mr. Weinberger telephoned last Friday to say he could not take part .
The American had agreed some time ago to oppose E.P. Thompson , the leader of the British nuclear disarmament movement , on the motion : '' There is no moral difference between the world policies of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R . ''
* * * * *
Mr. Sullivan , the union president , is a 19 - year - old student of history and French who describes himself as a supporter of the Government .
He reported that Mr. Weinberger said on Friday that he thought a debate might be an " inappropriate " forum for a person in his position and that he did not want to seem to intervene in the British domestic political process with an election in the offing .
Update : Mr. Sullivan responds .
Sesame Street

Rich TV Program Seeks Youngest
The most expensive and expansive television show ever beamed at the nation 's 12 million preschool children -- who will watch TV more hours before they get to kingergarten than they will spend in six grades of elementary school -- was announced yesterday by National Educational Television .
Sesame Street is named to reflect the balance between fantasy and the real - life educational open - a - new - window need of pre-school youngsters " “ particularly members of minority groups in the inner cores of big cities " “ that the show hopes to achieve .

David Connell , executive producer of the series ( he held the same position with the Captain Kangaroo series for eight years ) , said the new show would follow an informal magazine format , with either three or four permanent hosts yet to be selected .

As ' Wheel ' Goes , So Go TV Profits and Careers
Television executives offer various explanations for the wild success of Wheel of Fortune , which gave no particular hint of its extravagant future when it first appeared , seemingly just another word - game show , on NBC 's daytime schedule 11 years ago .
On the show , contestants win prizes for discerning a hidden phrase by guessing its letters .
Some suggest the secret is in the droll humor of the show 's host , Pat Sajak , a former television weatherman , or perhaps in the fetching manner in which the hostess , Vanna White , reveals the hidden clues .
Roger King , chairman of King Productions , the distributor , maintains it is in the game - simplicity itself .
" It can be played by a rocket scientist and by an 8 - year - old , " he said .
It is generally conceded that '' Wheel , '' entering its fourth year in syndication , ca n't go on as it has forever .
But most industry observers maintain that while the show may be nearing its peak , its impact remains huge .

Introduction
This is my first article ; I want to apologize in my English .
In this example , I want to show how to sorting a gridview using a Jquery in ASP .
NET , it is a flexible client - side table sorting .
We have known that Jquery is a new kind of Javascript Library .
You can find detail of Jquery in this site http://jquery.com/
there are lot of example with documentation and also allow free download a latest version .
Background
In this example , I used table sorter plug - in which has written by Christian Bach can found http://tablesorter.com/docs/ .
It is really cool plug - in and user can allow to download and customization as their wish .
I test this example in Visual Studio 2005 .
Some of other requirement needed is download a latest version of Jquery from official website and table sorter plug - in which can found as I mention above website .
Here we go ,
Using the Code
First , we need some image file which require for click in Gridview header .
Then , we need to add a CSS file to make proper position and color .
In this example , I use ajax json serialize to load data into the Gridview
< %@ Page Language = " VB " AutoEventWireup = " false " CodeFile = " TableSorterBlue.aspx.vb "
Inherits = " TableSorterBlue " %> < !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd " > < html xmlns = " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " > < head runat = " server " > < title > Table Sorter Blue < / title > < link href = " App_Themes /bluestyle.css " rel = " stylesheet " type = " text / css " media = " print , projection , screen " / > < script language = " javascript " type = " text / javascript " src = " script / jquery - 1.2.6.min.js " > < / script > < script language = " javascript " type = " text / javascript " src = " script/jquery.tablesorter.js " > < / script > < script language = " javascript " type = " text / javascript " src = " script / Sorter.js " > < / script > < /head > < body > < form id = " form1 " runat = " server " > < div id = " btnInfo " > < button id = " btnBlueLoad " type = " button " > Load Data < / button > < /div > < div id = " result " > < /div > < / form > < script type = " text / javascript " > $ ( function ( ) { $ ( " # btnBlueLoad " ) .click ( function ( ) {
LoadRecord ( ) ; } ) ; } ) ; function LoadRecord ( ) { $.ajax ( { type : " POST " , url : " TableSorterBlue.aspx/GetOrderDetailTable " , contentType : " application / json ; charset=utf - 8 " , data : " {} " , dataType : " json " , success : function ( msg ) { $ ( " # result " ) .html(msg ) ; formatSorterTable ( ) ; } } ) ; } < / script > < / body > < / html >
In the code behind a Page of TableSorterBlue.aspx :
Partial Class TableSorterBlue Inherits System .
Web.UI . Page < WebMethod( enablesession : =True ) > _ Public Shared Function GetOrderDetailTable () As String Dim page As New Page ( ) Dim userControl As UserControl = DirectCast ( page.LoadControl ( " ~/controls /GridViewControl.ascx " ) , UserControl ) userControl.EnableViewState = False Dim form As New HtmlForm ( ) form.Controls.Add(userControl ) page .
Controls .Add(form ) Dim textWriter As New StringWriter ( ) HttpContext .
Current .
Server .
Execute ( page , textWriter , False ) Return Clean(textWriter.ToString ( ) )
End Function Private Shared Function Clean ( ByVal html As String ) As String Return Regex .
Replace ( html , " <[ /] ?( form ) [ ^ > ]*? > " , " " , RegexOptions .IgnoreCase ) End Function End Class
And in a user control I create a Gridview but make sure you make accessible property to true as what I did in the code :
Partial Class controls_GridViewControl Inherits System.Web.UI.UserControl Protected Sub Page_Load ( ByVal sender As Object , ByVal e As System. EventArgs ) Handles Me . Load Me .MakeAccessible ( Me .gvTSOrderDetail ) End Sub Private Sub MakeAccessible ( ByVal grd As GridView )
If grd IsNot Nothing AndAlso grd .
Rows .
Count > 0
Then grd .
UseAccessibleHeader = True grd.HeaderRow.TableSection = TableRowSection .TableHeader End If End Sub End Class
TableRowSection .
TableHeader can help to create a < thead > and < tbody > which is synchronize with table sorter plug-in .
Now , you can click on arrow up and down it start sorting a row .
From a trusted Crispin Porter +
Bogusky source , we 've learned that some sites have jumped the gun and that the Microsoft Gates / Seinfeld ads have not been axed .
It 's true , Microsoft apparently asked the agency to focus on the new " I'm a PC " spots .
And it 's true , the agency has gotten plenty of " I do n't know what this means " response in their measured statistics of the Gates / Seinfeld ads .
But no one has pulled the plug on the dynamic duo just yet .
In fact , CPB has another completed spot featuring the lovable , affluent couple in the can , ready to air ( even though it wo n't quite yet ) .
And while the agency has prioritized development to the anti-Mac ads , there are still full plans to go ahead and produce more Seinfeld / Gates spots unless Microsoft were to pull the plug first ( which , once again , they have not at this time ) .
It 's good to know that in a time of economic uncertainty , Gates and Seinfeld have n't been laid off just yet .
UPDATE : We talked to our source again after speaking to Rob Reilly from CPB .
While Rob Reily has denied that another Gates / Seinfeld ad is sitting in the ready , our source confirms , once again , that it is .
Our source explains that if the Mac / PC ads running now prove to be successful , there 's a good chance that last Gates / Seinfeld spot will air .
However , there 's even more of an indication now that Microsoft aggressively cut the Gates / Seinfeld spot production short , canceling the shoot for a fourth spot just three days into production .
The spots were intended to be part of a running series with up to 12 planned spots conceptualized .
Now it 's unclear whether or not we 'll even see the last spot air , let alone Seinfeld come back for a reprisal .

As the euphoria of the Obama cult builds toward a climax and the pundits declaim the advent of Something Big , it ’s the small changes that concern me , particularly those that touch directly on my job , which is to sniff out the War Party wherever it is presently burrowed .
The election of Barack Obama has been the signal for many of them to migrate like fleas from the carcasses of the campaigns they attached themselves to and hop on the warm body of the new administration , which presents a rather large target .
It ’s a new day , and in the age of Obama , the War Party ’s battalions are massed on the ostensible Left .
Now that ‘s the kind of change I can believe in .
Ah , yes , the small changes , particularly the ones that concern me personally : those are what I ’m really interested in , quite naturally , and the biggest change  and I have to say it comes as a welcome relief  will be in my targets .
Instead of having to deal with all those tiresome neoconservatives with Republican leanings , I ’ll be dealing with a whole new crowd .
Of course , a lot of veteran neocons will turn up , particularly at the fringes of the incoming administration , but the real core of the War Party ’s strength will be in the State Department , with Hillary Clinton lording over a new nest of neocon hatchlings , albeit of the social - democratic variety .
In alliance with the " humanitarian " interventionists , whose shtick is sending troops to places like Kosovo , Darfur , Congo , and Burma , this new , reinvented War Party is ready and willing to open up several new fronts in our endless " war on terrorism , " with potentially cataclysmic consequences for America and the world .
The War Party ’s decisive influence in the Obama administration is going to be rolled out on Monday , so that even the most craven Obama - bots on the Left will be left wondering who and what they voted for .
Hillary the hawk at State , Bush ’s warlord Robert Gates at Defense , and Gen. Jim Jones  who wants to station U.S. troops in the occupied territories under the rubric of NATO !
 as national security adviser to the president .
Yes , antiwar voters took a chance on Obama , reasoning that anything would be better than four more years of Bushian belligerence , yet now they discover to their chagrin that the dice are loaded .
The same old crowd that brought us the invasion of Iraq is back , if not in full force or purest form , then at least in worrying numbers and high positions .
The cries of " betrayal " are already being heard .
The response from the Obama cult among the liberal landed gentry , in particular the ones who own choice pieces of editorial real estate in the nation ’s top newspapers , was delivered by E. J. Dionne from his perch at the Washington Post :
" In electing Barack Obama , the country traded the foreign policy of the second President Bush for the foreign policy of the first President Bush .
That is the meaning of Obama ’s apparent decision to keep Robert Gates on as defense secretary and also to select Hillary Clinton as secretary of state . "
This delights Dionne , even as it depresses those anti-interventionist voters who thought they had an ally in the White House .
His message to us is clear enough :
" The truth about Obama ’s worldview was hidden in plain sight in his most politically consequential foreign policy speech .
Antiwar Democrats cheered Obama for addressing a rally against the Iraq war in Chicago ’s Federal Plaza on Oct. 2 , 2002 .
His opposition to the war was a major asset in his nomination struggle with Clinton .
" Obama did indeed denounce the impending war as ‘ dumb , ’ ‘ rash , ’ and ‘ based not on reason but on passion . ’
But in retrospect , the speech may be most notable for other things Obama said that separated him from some in his antiwar audience . "
In short : screw you , buddy , and you better get used to it .
Amid all the talk about the reentry of the Republican " realists " into the circle of power in Washington and the hosannas to the rising influence of Brent Scowcroft , one has to remember that this is the same gang that brought us the first Gulf war and George H. W. Bush ’s " New World Order . "
It was a war to keep the emir of Kuwait on his throne , one that started after the U.S. ambassador to Iraq , April Glaspie , gave Saddam Hussein the green light to cross the border with his troops .
Out of the slaughter of that war arose the tide of anti-American radicalism that fueled al - Qaeda ’s recruiting and rationalized the stationing of our troops in Saudi Arabia .
We had both feet in the quagmire , in Bush I ’s day ; we just were n’t up to our necks quite yet .
Scowcroft and his friends are valorized by Washington ’s cocktail party peaceniks for not going all the way to Baghdad and toppling the regime .
These people are conveniently forgetting the dicey origins of that war , its official rationale  was n’t it James Baker , who crowed " Job , jobs , jobs " in an argument of unsurpassed vulgarity ?
 not to mention the horrific slaughter of the Iraqi " army , " which at that point was mainly boys and old men with few arms and even less willingness to fight .
The first Iraq war paved the way for the second and the current occupation , as the Clinton administration took up the anti-Saddam campaign and sponsored the Iraq Liberation Act , which set the whole disastrous process in motion and led us to the present moment .
Dionne goes on to note that Obama said " I do n’t oppose all wars " " not once but five times . "
Dionne praises Obama for mentioning all the " good " wars , singling out the liberals ’ two favorites 
World War II and the Civil War  as well as " the battle against terrorism after the attacks of Sept. 11 . "
This latter phrase is indistinguishable from George W. Bush ’s multi-generational twilight struggle , which Obama will continue , albeit on a different battleground , namely Afghanistan and Pakistan .
So do n’t worry , all you hawks out there : this is n’t the end of the good times !
Dionne ’s point , however , is this :
" Obama ’s national security choices are already causing grumbling from parts of the antiwar left , even if Obama made clear six years ago that while he was with them on Iraq , he was not one of them . "
If you " progressives " are now feeling like someone who ’s been kicked out of bed before dawn , on one pretext or another 
" Boy , was I drunk last night !
I do n’t remember a thing ! "  well , then , you ca n’t say you were n’t warned .
Well , somebody was drunk , though it probably was n’t Obama .
After all , he ’s not the one who hooked up with someone he thought was cool , only to wake up with Brent Scowcroft !
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
Dionne mentions the Center for a New American Security ( CNAS ) as the Obama administrations source of talent and a key player in the policymaking apparatus currently being assembled .
Go here for my take on CNAS .
Shorter version : kind of like the Project for a New American Century , except different

( CNN ) --
If you want to work for President - elect Barack Obama 's administration , be prepared to spill almost everything there is to know about yourself .
As White House chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel will have a say in many of the new administration 's hiring decisions .
The Obama transition team is sending a seven - page , 63 - item questionnaire to every candidate for Cabinet and other high - ranking positions in the incoming administration .
The questions cover everything from information on family members , Facebook pages , blogs and hired help to links to Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , American International Group and troubled banks as well as lawsuits , gifts , resumes , loans and more .
The transition team has about 7,000 positions to fill , according to the U.S. Government Printing Office 's Plum Book , the quadrennial list of positions subject to presidential appointment .
Watch how detailed the questionnaire gets »
Included are 15 Cabinet positions and nearly 200 ambassadorships as well as agency heads and their immediate subordinates , policy executives and advisers , and top aides to those officials .
iReport.com : Who should be in Obama 's cabinet ?
The largest part of the questionnaire asks prospective White House appointees and their spouses to list real estate and other business transactions , affiliations and relationships as well as personal financial and tax information .
It also asks about writings , speeches , testimony , online communications and even personal diaries .
An entire section requests details on any criminal or civil legal action in which the applicant may have been involved .
The last question in that 11 - item section asks for details on any child support or alimony orders .
In an apparent effort to avoid the problems faced by several nominees in the last two administrations , a block of four questions is devoted to ferreting out details -- including the immigration status -- of any domestic help the applicant may have hired .
Question 61 seems to have been prompted by the controversy over former 1960s radical William Ayres in Obama 's campaign : " Have you had any association with any person , group or business venture that could be used -- even unfairly -- to impugn or attack your character or qualifications for government service ? "
Under the final , " Miscellaneous " category , the questionnaire asks for the names and phone numbers of past live - in lovers ; whether anyone in the applicant 's family owns a gun ; the state of the applicant 's health ; and whether he or she has any enemies .

A police officer who was caught knocking a man off his bicycle in Times Square over the summer in a video that was distributed widely on YouTube has been indicted by a grand jury , according to lawyers involved in the case .
The officer , Patrick Pogan , has been instructed to report to State Supreme Court in Manhattan for the unsealing of the indictment , his lawyer , Stuart London , said .
David Rankin , a lawyer for the bicyclist , Christopher Long , said the office of the Manhattan district attorney , Robert M. Morgenthau , informed him around 3 p.m. that a grand jury had voted to indict Officer Pogan .
Mr. London and Mr. Rankin both said they did not know the specific charges , and Mr. Morgenthau ’s office declined to comment .
It is believed that prosecutors were seeking felony charges of filing false records in connection with the police report that Officer Pogan filed after arresting Mr. Long .
Officer Pogan , who was stripped of his gun and badge in July after the video emerged , also could be charged with a misdemeanor count of assault .
“ My client denies any wrongdoing in this matter , ” Mr. London said in an interview Monday afternoon .
“ I would have people withhold judgment until all the evidence comes out about the bicyclist ’s actions prior to my client taking action . ”
Mr. Long was taking part in a monthly ride , called Critical Mass , that often draws hundreds of riders .
In a criminal complaint against Mr. Long , Officer Pogan said that the cyclist rode straight into him .
But the video , which was shot by a tourist and posted on YouTube and on the blog Gothamist.com , showed Officer Pogan lunging toward Mr. Long .
Officer Pogan arrested Mr. Long on charges of attempted assault , disorderly conduct and resisting arrest , but the charges against Mr. Long were dropped in September .
The monthly rides have been a source of tension for the police since shortly before the Republican National Convention in 2004 , when a large number of officers arrested more than 250 riders on charges that included parading without a permit .
It 's getting really cold here , which means it seems that Hell is probably freezing over .
In fact that must be true because Home is finally out .
Yes , Sony 's virtual hangout city is finally upon us , having been unleashed to the masses this week .
After being in beta testing for pretty much ever , it 's now widely available to everyone .
In beta form , that is .
So how is the public release ?
Has it lived up to the promise of being your one - stop place to chat about games , play mini-games and make new friends ?
Is there even anything to do ?
Here 's what the IGN PlayStation Team has to say about the matter .
If I had to describe Home in one word , it would be " boring " .
Yep , I 'm bored to death with Home .
I 've only found two things that are entertaining for more than about 30 seconds : griefing and trying to enter the Matrix ( read : break the game ) .
Other than screwing with people or trying to break out of the intended space of my apartment , I have n't found a single thing that keeps my interest for more than about a minute .
The theater just shows the same videos over and over , and it 's just stuff that I can find online in a much higher resolution .
The games in the arcade cabinets are n't very good and are only worth checking out for a second - they 're not entertaining enough to really sink any time into .
Pool is about as basic as can be .
The billiards game in GTAIV was quite a bit better than what you 'll find here , and any number of free Flash pool games online are leaps and bounds better than it .
Bowling is just OK , but it 's certainly not enough for me to come home from work and say to myself , " I really feel like some Home bowling .
That would be much more fun than Dead Space .
" I understand that the point of these games is to help encourage people to talk while playing them , but that wo n't happen at an arcade machine unless you 're waiting to play .
And who is going to stand around to wait to play Carriage Return ?
The problem here is that while the experience on the whole is supposed to be there to incite conversation , you only really exist while you 're logged in .
If you 're not currently in Home , there 's not an easy way for people to interact with you outside of sending you a message , which you can just do from the Cross Media Bar anyway .
What it really needs is some sort of messaging space where you can leave gifts for people , write on a whiteboard , put stickers on their apartment door , etc .
It should act more like a college dorm , where people leave notes for each other and can decorate their doors , which other people can still check out if you 're not home .
As it is , if you 're not currently logged on in Home , you do n't really exist .
Really , if I felt like having conversations with people I do n't know , I would much rather do it on a message board somewhere .
At least you 're then capable of stepping away for a bit and can come back to where you were and see what others were saying when you have time .
I know that a whole lot more stuff is coming , like the Red Bull flying game , which looks like it could be OK , but what 's here now is , to be perfectly honest , a giant waste of time .
International climate change negotiators gathered in Poznan , Poland to draft a follow - on to the Kyoto protocol appear to have rejected the talks ’ most controversial proposal : giving a big boost to carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) , whereby carbon dioxide produced by coal - fired power plants is trapped deep underground .
The proposal was to award carbon credits to developing countries that installed CCS equipment — credits that they could then sell to industrialized nations or companies — but this morning opponents successfully tabled the proposal until next June , according to climate policy blog Climatico .
Countries pushing the credits - for - CCS proposal included Japan , Norway , Australia and Canada .
All are major coal consumers eyeing CCS to meet their own greenhouse gas reduction targets and / or oil and gas producers that could dual - purpose captured CO2 for enhanced oil recovery .
Japan and Canada also figure among the nations furthest behind in meeting emissions cuts mandated by the Kyoto protocol , and could be big buyers of CCS - generated carbon credits .
International Energy Agency executive director Nobuo Tanaka had also added his support ( see video ) .
Tanaka calls credits a means of accelerating development of capture and sequestration technologies , which the IEA sees as crucial to control emissions in countries such as China that will remain heavily dependent on coal for decades to come .
“ These technologies need all the financial help they can get , ” says Tanaka .
But the idea remained red - hot among the climate activists swarming Poznan this week as it unites a controversial technology with an already controversial program .
They see carbon sequestration as a potentially risky technology that could delay the transition from coal to solar , wind and other forms of renewable energy .
Meanwhile the UN ’s Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) , which manages the awarding of carbon credits to developing nations , attracts scorn from those who see carbon trading as a numbers game by which countries will avoid making real emissions cuts .
Many question whether emissions cuts certified for millions of dollars worth of credits under the CDM would n’t have occurred anyway — whether they offer ‘ additionality ’ in the UN lingo flowing in Poland this week .
The UN acknowledged possible problems after spot - checking a leading CDM certification firm and identifying a series of “ non-conformities ” in its auditing practices .
The firm , DNV Certification AS , was suspended but insists it is addressing the concerns identified to regain its accreditation .
Poznan ’s ministerial - level talks start tomorrow and should wrap up Friday .
Unless they pop CCS back onto the agenda the credits proposal will be stalled until next June ’s followup meeting in Bonn .
That meeting is a prelude to the big game that will define global energy policy : final negotiations and , if all goes as planned , the signing of a ‘ Kyoto II ’ treaty in Copenhagen next December .

Amsterdam has long been famed for its relaxed approach to prostitution and soft drugs , making the Dutch city one of the most popular destinations for tens of thousands of Britons on stag and hen parties .
But all that may be about to change .
As part of a major ' clean - up ' of the city centre , the local authorities yesterday unveiled plans to close half of the brothels and the little coffee shops where cannabis can be bought and smoked , prompting warnings that they will cost the city dear as visitors head elsewhere .
Although prostitution has been legal for eight years , and possession of small amounts of drugs has long been tolerated , the latest moves mark an escalation in the culture wars in a country that many of its people believe has become too liberal .
At the heart of the new initiative is the city 's drive against the organised crime that it claims gravitates to the areas with high concentrations of ' coffee shops ' , brothels and the ' windows ' where women advertise themselves .
While Amsterdam has long been held up as a model of the argument in favour of the legalisation of soft drugs and the sex trade , its critics counter that the windows and coffee shops mask the violent reality of organised crime .
' By reduction and zoning of these kinds of functions , we will be able to manage and tackle the criminal infrastructure better , ' the city said in a statement .
Opponents of the clean - up - including coffee - shop owners and the prostitutes ' union , De Rode Draad ( Red Thread ) , which represents 20,000 Dutch prostitutes - told The Observer yesterday that they believed that , far from reducing crime , it would encourage drug dealers and prostitutes to go underground in areas where they were banned .
They also warned that the new clampdown on drugs and the sex industry would have a profound effect on the economics of a city famous for both things .
' Amsterdam is the city of sex and drugs and rock ' n ' roll , ' said Metje Blaak , a spokeswoman for De Rode Draad , which provides health screening and other training for its members .
' Now we have no sex .
No drugs .
The women will go on the streets and to the hotels .
It is very bad , not least in terms of women 's health and safety .
The mayor has not listened to the women or the coffee shops , ' she added .
She also blamed the European Union for pressurising Holland into tightening its laws .
' Once we were a free country , ' she said .
' Now they tell us what to do . '
Prostitution will now be permitted in only two areas , including De Wallen ( The Walls ) - a web of streets and alleys around the city 's medieval retaining dam walls .
The area has been a centre of prostitution since before the city 's golden shipping age in the 17th century .
The city said yesterday it would offer retraining to prostitutes and coffee - shop employees who lost their jobs .
' Money laundering , extortion and human trafficking are things you do not see , but they are hurting people and the city .
The new reality will be more in line with our image as a tolerant and crazy place , rather than a free zone for criminals , ' said Alderman Lodewijk Asscher , one of the main proponents of the plan .
' We can still have sex and drugs , but in a way that shows the city is in control .
' It 'll be a place with 200 windows and 30 coffee shops , which you can't find anywhere else in the world - very exciting , but also with cultural attractions .
You wo n't have to be embarrassed to say you came , ' he said .
Merlijn Boshuizen of Plan A , one of the biggest organisers of stag and hen trips to the city , is not convinced .
' We have had 7,000 people , mainly from the UK and Ireland , this year .
This is wo n't be good for tourism .
People come here because of the drugs and the windows . '
The coffee - shop owners and workers are as sceptical of the new clampdown as De Rode Draad and Boshuizen .
Although cannabis is technically illegal in the Netherlands , prosecutors do not press charges for possession of small amounts and the coffee shops are able to sell it openly .
However , in the last year , authorities in Amsterdam and elsewhere have subjected the coffee shops to ever - more stringent checks .
' Marco ' , owner of the Rastababy Café in Prins Hendrikkade , near the city 's Centraal Station , said yesterday : ' It is really shitty .
We want to make money and they want to close us down .
The city will lose money .
People come here for the coffee shops .
To smoke . '
The same dismay was evident at the Reefer Café in St Antoniesbreestraat , not far from the Rembrandt Museum , where patrons can buy a pre-rolled ' White Widow ' spliff for € 3 , or a muffin laced with skunk resin .

Academic Integrity & Cheating
Introduction
Youth , youth , thou hadst better be starv'd by thy nurse
Than live to be hanged for cutting a purse .
( Elizabethan popular song )
Youth , youth , thou hadst better be starv'd by thy nurseThan live to be hanged for cutting a purse .
The academic enterprise involves encountering the world as it actually is , warts and all .
Thus honesty about facts , sources , ambiguities , ideas , errors , inspirations , and so on lies at the very heart of what universities are about .
Universities expect their faculty to be scrupulously honest in their research and in the presentation of their findings , and they treat even small infractions as extremely serious offenses against academic morality .
The same expectation is extended , appropriately , to students , and anything but strict honesty is treated as " cheating " and is taken quite seriously .
It embarrasses me to have to discuss cheating , since the issues seem obvious .
However , lest there be any doubts , here we go .
The discussion represents my views and applies to my courses .
Other professors may have slightly different formulations .
Unlike most professors , I 've tried to include some of the less obvious stuff
Occasionally Asked Questions
1. What Is Cheating ?
As applied to university students , cheating ( academic dishonesty ) is :
pretending that somebody else 's work is yours so that you can get a higher grade than your own work merits
falsifying data
lying in order to extend a deadline or gain some other special advantage
helping other people to do any of these things
Some specific forms of cheating include :
copying answers on tests
using prohibited reference materials ( such as notes , books , or electronic resources ) during an exam
turning in papers that you have not written yourself or that you wrote for a different course
quoting material without marking it as quoted and without attributing it to its source ( or closely paraphrasing material without attributing it to its source ) ( See below on plagiarism . )
knowingly attributing a quotation or other information to the wrong source
misrepresenting a medical or family emergency or other personal contingency in order to delay a scheduled exam or to get extra time on an assignment
pretending to have a disability you do not have ( or exaggerating one you do have ) in order to gain an unwarranted advantage unavailable to other students
modifying graded material and then resubmitting it to " correct the error in grading "
describing research deceptively or research that never happened
submitting work on - line under the name of another person or allowing another person to submit work on - line for you
( Effective January 1 , 2011 , it became a misdemeanor under California Senate Bill 1411 to use Email , social networking sites , or other on - line means to impersonate someone .
So civil penalties may be added to university ones for cheating in this way if you do it in California . )
2. What Practices Are Misunderstood to be Cheating ?
For purposes of my courses , at least , it is not cheating
to study with other students outside of class
to share notes with other students in preparation for an exam
to discuss with other students ideas about papers you or they are writing
to provide proofreading or other minor editorial assistance to other students or to receive it from them ( It is polite to acknowledge received assistance in a footnote . )
to look at exams or papers from previous years or other classes if they happen to come your way
to use any source of information , without citing it , as background for your own general knowledge and not as the source of a direct quotation or close paraphrase
to quote or closely paraphrase an Internet source , so long as you cite it as a source
to quote or closely paraphrase living people , so long as you cite them ( anonymously if it is necessary to protect their identity , as with some anthropological informants or journalistic sources )
to quote or closely paraphrase encyclopedias or other " easy " reference works , so long as you cite them
3. What Is Plagiarism ?
An important category of cheating is plagiarism , that is , quoting or closely paraphrasing the writings of others while leading the reader to believe that you are the author of the text .
( The word derives from Latin plagium , " kidnapping . " )
Plagiarism is not the same thing as copyright infringement .
The works of Charles Dickens have long since passed into the public domain , and anybody can reprint them .
Therefore , if you pretend to be the author of a passage from Oliver Twist , you are not infringing on a copyright , but you are still plagiarizing .
Citing Stuff Without Dying From the Experience
One of the best habits you can develop is always to include the source whenever you make a note while doing research for a paper , and always to include citations in rough drafts so that you do n't lose them or forget to add them later .
One of the worst habits you can develop is to figure on adding source information only to the final draft .
There is no way you are going remember for sure what came from where , and misattribution is likely to be counted as cheating .
Some students find that they fall into plagiarism because they are not sure how to acknowledge their sources easily and therefore leave out the citation .

MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers .
In the humanities ( and above all in most college writing programs ) this far more reader - and writer - hostile style - sheet is enforced , often with sadistic rigor .
You can buy a copy from the university bookstore or from the web site of the Modern Language Association itself .
It is not available for free on the web .
( College writing programs , like the Modern Language Association , expect you to pay for it , which is akin to being charged a fee to find out the speed limit . )

The University of Chicago Manual of Style .
This is the graduate student 's equivalent of the MLA style sheet .
It is equally annoying , and the same observations apply .
Computers and Plagiarism
The Internet has become a major source for student ( and non-student ) information - gathering , almost to the exclusion of paper sources .
This makes it extremely easy for the faculty ( or their surrogates ) to use computer - assisted plagiarism detection , since a plagiarism - detection company can do the same kinds of searches that students do .
Such companies also have access to additional files , often including the papers written by other students in your same classes , both now and in the past .
Computer - assisted plagiarism detection also is widespread in computer programming classes .
University computers can also potentially spot cross-student trends in centralized disciplinary records , although the implications of this are still unclear .
Because of the efficiency of computers in detecting plagiarism cases , plagiarism tends to get the spotlight at the moment , but other kinds of academic integrity concerns have not gone away , and the increased attentiveness to plagiarism is unlikely to diminish concern with such offenses as smuggling notes into exams , text - messaging answers during exams , or having your roommate write your lab report for you .
4. What 's Special About Wikipedia ?
Wikipedia is obviously wonderful .
It is a global experiment in shared knowledge , and it has been overwhelmingly successful .
It is a valuable first resource in researching absolutely anything , and the different language versions have different takes on the same subject .
It is banned in China ( and a handful of other totalitarian countries ) , which is probably among the stupidest mistakes a wannabe " modern " country can make .
I confess that I am both a daily user and a financial supporter of Wikipedia .
( Wikipedia is financed by donations , large and small to the Wikimedia Foundation .
To reach their donation page , click here . )
This does not mean it is perfect .
Articles can be incomplete , and errors can persist if knowledgeable people do not intervene to correct them .
Unless you live in China , Iran , or North Korea , Wikipedia can ( and should ! ) be used as a source for almost anything one cares to learn about .
It can be an inspiration , a pointer to sources , and a quick - and - dirty overview .
And for the most part , it is impressively excellent .
If it is an influential source for you on some subject , it can ( and should ) be cited .
That said , some professors dislike Wikipedia , mostly because it makes gathering information for student essays too easy (! ) , but ostensibly because it can contain errors and / or becuase it diverts students from learning how to use other sources that are closer to the actual research and reasoning on which published scholarship and student termpapers ( and Wikipedia articles ) should be based .
These are legitimate , if futile , objections .
Wikipedia is by no means a primary source ( except perhaps for the study of Wikipedia itself ) , and perhaps even more than other sources ) not necessarily 100 % reliable .
In most cases , it cannot substitute for tracking down original research reports , reading original sources , and the like .
( Often it will point out where such resources are to be found . )
I have heard of professors who grandly declare that they will give an F to anyone who uses Wikipedia ( which of course merely forces its use underground ) .
It is wise to find out what your professor thinks about this source before you cite it .
As with any other source , if you quote without acknowledgement from Wikipedia ( or anyway from the English version ) , pretending that you wrote the passage yourself , you will almost certainly be caught by your university 's plagiarism - police - bots and hung out to dry .
( For a bot , an on - line source is the easiest kind to find .
And remember , in the on - line world , bots are often smarter than you are . )
Some bots are getting better at detecting paraphrase .
That also means that if you translate a passage from the French or Spanish or Chinese version of Wikipedia , and someone else translates the same passage , even differently , there is now a risk that a clever web - roaming bot will notice the similarity and possibly find the source .
Things To Come
My prediction is that students will become better at disguising borrowed material , but the easiest thing for a student to do is simply cite the sources of any quoted material .
( Just use my web page called How to Cite Sources As Painlessly As Possible . )

5. Do Professors Agree About Cheating ?
All professors agree that cheating is despicable .
They disagree about the details .
Very few of them will give you particularly useful generic guidance , but most of them are happy to answer questions with reference to their own classes .
Definitions .
Some professors have different views ( rules ) about what kinds of student collaboration are encouraged , permitted , or prohibited .
When in doubt , ask .
( A section below addresses " ambiguities " with some examples . )

When in doubt , ask .
( A section below addresses " ambiguities " with some examples . )
Penalties .
Some professors are surprisingly tolerant of cheating .
Others believe that even the appearance of cheating should be grounds for expulsion and permanent scarification of the student 's transcript .
The more severe view is at present in the ascendant , at least when broad policies rather than individual cases are under discussion .

The more severe view is at present in the ascendant , at least when broad policies rather than individual cases are under discussion .
Genres .
Citation standards are quite different in different contexts .
A mystery novel does n't say where the author learned about poison .
An encyclopedia article usually does n't either .
Nor do articles in popular magazines .
Nor , probably , do your professors '
PowerPoint presentations or web pages .
An academic article , in contrast , is usually quite meticulous about sources .
Web pages often use " stolen " graphics ; books never do .
Many computer programming routines are universally used and are effectively , if not technically , in the public domain .
Others are conventionally acknowledged when borrowed .
Most ( all ? ) professorial statements about plagiarism and academic integrity fail to take genre differences into account and claim ( usually falsely ) to impose the strictest standard on everything .
6. What Happens to Students Caught Cheating ?
There are two , only slightly related , consequences if you are caught cheating :
Academic Consequences .
First , since academic honesty , like turning up for the final , is normally a condition for passing a course , you may flunk the course .
Some professors may flunk you only on the assignment on which you cheated , but flunking the whole course is the emergent standard .
In technical parlance , having a grade lowered for cheating is referred to as an " academic consequence . "
In most universities ( including UCSD ) the professor may not normally be overruled in this , even if it is inconsistent or unfair .
Normally an " earned " grade of D or F ( the kind you get for not knowing the material ) remains on a transcript , but is not calculated into a student 's GPA if the course is retaken and the student earns a higher grade .
However , when an F grade is a result of an academic integrity violation , it continues to be calculated into the GPA even if the course is subsequently retaken for a passing grade .
Furthermore , under UCSD regulations , as at most universities , an F given because of cheating is accompanied by a transcript symbol identifying cheating as the reason .
( This is believed to be intelligible only to reviewers on campus .
Off - campus inquirers about the meaning of the symbol are told that it is for " internal tracking . "
That seems unlikely to fool anybody . )
( Vaguely related tirade . )
Administrative Consequences .
Second , since academic dishonesty is also ( and independently ) an act of student misconduct as covered by the campus - wide student conduct code , you are subject to additional " administrative consequences . "
At UCSD these are imposed by the Council of Deans of Student Affairs , based on a range of possible penalties that vary depending upon the severity of the offence , the ambiguity of the situation , the student 's conduct record , and so on .
In keeping with the usual evolution of bureaucratic impulses , the trend is to allow the Council less and less discretion as the university grows larger .
Broadly speaking , suspension for the first offense and expulsion for the second are the " default " " administrative consequences . "
( Note that even a brief suspension can result in loss of financial aid or , for foreign students , a student visa . )
Students wishing to deny guilt may be granted a hearing , but faculty initiating a case need not appear at the hearing , where they may be represented by the Academic Integrity Coordinator .
( That suggests some obvious strategies for beating the rap , but it would be undignified for me to discuss them here . )
UCSD more or less continuously updates ( tightens ? ) its Code of Conduct , the basis for much of the reasoning used in administering putative cheating cases .
( Somehow such evolution means that the URL also changes frequently .
Good luck discovering what the code at your university actually says at any given time ! )
7. What Protections Does a Student Have Against False Charges ?
Virtually none .
As far as your grade is concerned , any change in your grade because of suspected or demonstrated academic dishonesty is at the discretion of the professor , just like other grades .
Probably some universities handle this better than UCSD does .
But it is never likely to be painless .
The UCSD Academic Senate has a committee on grade appeals , but traditionally it had no authority to consider cases unless " non-academic criteria " — use your imagination — could be shown to have been used .
Its authority was eventually broadened so that students could also appeal grades that were lowered in response to a professor 's suspicion of academic dishonesty if the professor did not bring formal charges .
( Grades lowered for academic dishonesty when charges are not brought are sometimes called " vigilante Fs " ) .
To my knowledge , however , only one student has ever successfully brought such a challenge , and anyway the committee cannot actually change a grade except to convert it to a P or NP .
For practical purposes you should think in terms of there being no effective appeal .
( Sometimes — rarely — a visit by a student to the department chair can help in getting the faculty member to reconsider .
UCSD 's college provosts are virtually never effective in this . )
The student - conduct violation is more complex .
At UCSD , as at most universities , undergraduate " academic integrity " procedures provide that , if you are accused of cheating , then ( as with sexual harassment ) the evidence adduced does not have to remove all doubt .
If you have a formal hearing , the hearing board will work under a " 51 % probability " rule .
So if the board is " 51 % convinced " that you are guilty , then you are judged guilty and are subject to penalties .
( The severity of your offense is often ignored ; the issue is merely whether there was an offense .
It is reminiscent of the unfortunate " three - strikes " laws in some states that can lock a person away for stealing a loaf of bread if it happens to be his third loaf . )
Theoretically of course you can hire a lawyer and try to sue anybody at any time for anything .
However , it is rare that an external civil court agrees to accept a case brought by a student against a university to change a grade or to correct a putatively false charge of academic dishonesty .
Furthermore , court cases can last longer than it takes to get a college degree .
( One such case at UCSD went on for five years , ending indecisively in San Diego Superior Court long after the student had been expelled and a key witness had graduated . )
In sum , undergraduates have virtually no truly effective appeal against false charges of cheating .
Your most effective defense is to avoid even the slightest appearance of cheating .
And that brings us to the next topic :
What do professors think cheating looks like ?
8. How Do Professors Detect Cheating ?
Most professors have various ways to detect cheating , and we prefer to keep the details secret .
However here are some fictionalized examples based on real cases that have come to my attention over the years .
Names have been changed to protect the guilty .
9. Do Students Ever Get Away With Cheating ?
Of course .
People get away with all sorts of things .
Nobody says it can't be pulled off .
Like all professors , I know some of the ways it has been done successfully , and I know the weaknesses in the system that could potentially be exploited , even though they probably have n't been .
But cheating is a VERY high - risk behavior .
The consequences , both institutional ( if they catch you ) and from your own pissed - off super - ego ( which you can't escape ) , are not worth it .
10 . How Can I Avoid Even Appearing to Cheat ?
Do n't cheat .
( Duh ! )
Pay close attention to what does and does not constitute cheating for a particular class .
At the time when you collect information from a source , be sure to make a note about the source .
If you are quoting a source exactly , citation ( including page number ) is absolutely essential .
After that , there is a gradation from exact paraphrase to subconscious influence that makes citation decreasingly necessary .
In general , err on the side of over - attribution , not under-attribution .
See the section above on plagiarism .
( Useful hint :
If you write down the source information before you copy the quoted material , you are less likely to leave it out . )
If you can't write a computer program that runs , get help from the TA or the professor or another student , preferably in a higher - level class .
But do not copy code from someone else .
If the class is too challenging , drop back a level .
There is no shame in ignorance .
There is much shame in copying someone else 's work and passing it off as your own .
( Vaguely related tirade . )
The same applies , mutatis mutandis to lab experiments , musical compositions , calculus problems , field research , &c . ( Note , by the way , that if you are reduced to cheating to get through certain classes , you should not be thinking of a career in that field .
It will almost surely not lead to a lifetime of happiness . )
In a closed - book exam , do not bring your books along , or else leave them securely covered in a clearly closed backpack .
A " casually " open book is easily ( and usually correctly ) taken as evidence of cheating .
If you do n't want to be accused of stealing fruit , an old Chinese proverb advises , then do n't reach toward it : " Do n't tie your shoes in a melon patch and do n't adjust your hat under a plum tree . "
( Guātián bù nàlǚ , lǐxià bù zhěngguān .
瓜田不纳履，李下不整冠。 )
In an exam , do not sit with the people you study with .
If your answers are similar , the fact that you are not sitting near each other is a powerful argument that no copying occurred .
Click here for a fictionalized but real - life example ( Jimmy Gimmie again ) .
11 . What Are Some Examples of Policy Ambiguities ?
Can an assignment done for one class later be submitted by the same student for a different class ?
Generally , no .
It is true that it is the same student 's work , but nearly all professors regard it as having been " used up " in the first class .
On the other hand there may be ambiguous cases where , for example , the student dropped a class and is subsequently retaking it and wants to resubmit material written for the class the first time .
( Damned if I can see why that is plagiarism , but I did see a student hauled in for it . )
When in doubt , ask !
Can two students collaborate to write the same paper ?
Certainly not if each pretends to be the sole author .
However some professors allow or encourage group projects .
Such arrangements must be approved by the professor very explicitly and in advance .
( The experienced professor avoids the " free rider " problem in group projects by requiring each group member to turn in a confidential statement of the division of labor .
Do n't be a free rider and you wo n't have to worry about your collaborators turning you in . )
Can the same term paper be submitted to two different classes ?
Generally , no .
However many professors will agree to allow this by prior arrangement on the understanding that this allows the student to take on a more ambitious project .
With the agreement of both your history professor and your anthropology professor , for example , you may be able to submit a longer paper as the assignment for both classes .
Without the prior permission of both of them , however , it is pretty certainly going to be classed as cheating .
A related question is whether sections of one paper can be incorporated into another paper ( for example a termpaper into a master 's thesis , or a master 's thesis into a Ph.D. dissertation ) .
The answer again is that it is critical to be very clear that this is what is happening and to be absolutely sure that the faculty member (s ) involved have no objection .
( I have seen this get ugly . )
In published books it is not infrequent to see a footnote explaining that a certain chapter began life as a journal article or a conference paper .
( In the professional world , it is not necessary to acknowledge that one has used one of one 's own unpublished compositions in the creation of something else .
Unpublished is unpublished , after all .
Analogously , a student 's work written in the past but never published and never submitted for a class would seem to be still " unused " and hence legitimate , although some of my colleagues would probably disagree .
Somebody always does . )
Can a paper a student has published be submitted as part of the same student 's MA thesis or PhD dissertation ?
Not in all countries , and not at all universities .
At UCSD the answer is yes , since in some fields delaying publication risks having someone else publish a new insight or research finding first .
However it is critical to be very explicit about what is being done , and to have the clear permission of one 's dissertation committee .
What Is the Faculty Told About Cheating ?
Despite urban legends about everybody cheating , cheating is in fact rare enough ( or perhaps successful enough ) that most professors have little experience with it and only rarely know the details about the procedures they are theoretically expected to follow .
From time to time the faculty is sent a notice providing some advice on the subject ( or urging them to crack down or go through channels ) .
As far as I can tell , they rarely pay any attention to it .
The official UCSD Policy on the Integrity of Scholarship constitutes Appendix II of the Manual of the San Diego Division of the Academic Senate .
It gives all the details of how cases are theoretically supposed to be handled .
( It is confusingly written and seems to be designed to put people to sleep , but it is official . )
13 . What Recent Changes or Long - Term Trends Are There ?
Nationally , student cheating continues to be an issue of great interest to the sorts of people who are interested in such things .
Researchers repeatedly elicit very high rates of confession of cheating among high school and college students ( although that may just be a fashion for boasting about cheating that did n't really occur ) .
There is widespread belief ( but little evidence ) that cheating of all kinds has become more common than in the past , and that it is vastly more widespread than it was when professors went to school ( like laziness , bad handwriting , and ignoring sage advice from wise elders ) .
It is an established view that cheating has become a serious national problem , eroding public morals and endangering the future of civilzation .
Some people suspect that cheating is more common among some stereotyped groups of students than among others .
Over the last few years , the academic senate of one university after another has enacted revisions to its procedures .
Here at UCSD , these are reflected in the descriptions of " academic consequences " above .
The effects of these changes are not yet clear .
At UCSD , some faculty members have been unhappy about the severity of the sanctions , which they support in theory and in public , but which they tend to see as too severe in particular cases .
It is not clear that more charges have in fact been filed since the enactment of the new procedures , and some faculty members suspect other faculty members of " covering up " some offenses because of the annoyance of the paper work or the severity of the sanctions once a case is reported .
( Occasionally some professors are even darkly suspected of mercy . )
I regret to say that I have seen no evidence of faculty interest in protecting students from false charges .
Students called before administrative hearings can still be convicted on the " preponderance " ( read : 51 % ) of the evidence , and nothing realistically prevents a professor from giving a lowered grade regardless of the outcome of a disciplinary hearing or even without filing charges , thus without giving a student a chance for self - defense .
( Indeed , the system seems to me to be conducive to a kind of " plea bargaining " between students and professors to swap a lower grade for the non-filing of charges regardless of actual guilt or innocence . )
What 's the Bottom Line ?
The inevitable conclusion is that it is critical never to cheat , and always to avoid anything which , while innocent , could possibly be misunderstood as cheating .
Remember that Jimmy Gimmie never graduated , but perished in ignominy .
Well , he is a fictionalized composite ( and nobody much uses the word " ignominy " any more ) but you get the general idea .

The grizzly bears , locomotives and redwood sawmills are long gone .
But remnants of two forgotten ghost towns , submerged 56 years ago when Lexington Reservoir was built near Los Gatos , have resurfaced from its muddy depths .
The reservoir ’s water level has been lowered over the past year so construction crews can complete a dam - safety project .
The scenic lake along Highway 17 was just 5 percent full Friday , and will remain that low until winter rains begin to fill it again .
As the water level has dropped , brick foundations , fence posts , tree stumps , parts of rock walls , even concrete steps that once were attached to homes and barns in the forgotten 19th century towns of Lexington and Alma have re-emerged along the lake ’s western edges .
“ This is probably only about the third or fourth time since 1952 that you can see it , ” said Bill Wulf , 69 , a historian in Santa Clara who roamed the two towns as a boy .
“ A lot of history took place there .
Lexington was where the first sawmill was in Santa Clara County , in 1847 , before the Gold Rush started .
All their loggers left for the gold fields and it shut down for a while . ”
Also visible now is the road bed from the original Highway 17 , an echo from a bygone era .
Dating back to 1858 as a stage coach route and toll road from San Jose to Santa Cruz , the road , which became known as the Santa Cruz Highway , was submerged , like the two towns , under 130 feet of water when the Santa Clara Valley Water Conservation District constructed Lexington Dam in 1952 to meet the water needs of a postwar population boom .
When the reservoir filled , Highway 17 was rerouted to higher ground .
But parts of the original route , now called “ Old Santa Cruz Highway , ” still snake through the woods from Bear Creek Road to the summit area .
Perhaps most dramatic among the reservoir ’s newly visible artifacts is a concrete bridge that once spanned Los Gatos Creek between Lexington and Alma .
The bridge is stamped with “ 1926 ” on both ends , visible to people who park near the Bear Creek Road overpass and walk a few hundred feet down into the dried lake bed .
“ This is a view you do n’t see too often , ” said Dave Chesterman , capital program manager for the water district , as he walked across the 82 - year - old bridge in rubber boots .
Chesterman said a $ 65 million project to rebuild the earthen dam ’s outlet system remains on schedule for completion by next September .
The project involves carving a half - mile long , 12 - foot - high tunnel through St. Joseph ’s Hill and installing a steel pipe to replace an outlet pipe system that has crumpled several times due to age and pressure .
As for the towns of Alma and Lexington , their heyday was the mid-1800s , when each of them was populated by about 200 hearty souls .
Each town had a post office , hotel , saloons , blacksmith shops and half a dozen redwood sawmills .
Lexington gained national attention in 1883 , when a Los Gatos saloon keeper , Lloyd Majors , hired two thugs to rob an elderly Lexington man who kept $ 20,000 in gold in his cabin .
The crooks burned the old man with turpentine - soaked rags and beat him with pistols , killing him and a friend , and then fled with the gold .
Their sensational trial in San Jose drew coast - to - coast newspaper coverage similar to that accorded the Lizzie Borden ax murders nine years later in Massachusetts .
Alma ’s reputation was more genteel .
It became a resort for San Francisco vacationers who hunted for deer or fished for trout .
It was surrounded by vineyards and redwoods .
The silent movie star Broncho Billy Anderson filmed several Western movies there in 1906 .
But both towns were doomed .
Lexington declined in the 1880s , when the South Pacific Coast Railroad — a line that raced passengers , lumber and orchard fruits between Alameda and Santa Cruz in less than four hours — rolled right past the town .
Later , the modern Highway 17 , finished in 1940 , bypassed Alma .
By 1950 , only about 50 families lived in Alma and less than a dozen families lived in Lexington .
The water district condemned their homes and paid them .
Some moved the structures to higher ground .
Others relocated .
“ The people were welcome to remove the buildings themselves and take the lumber with them if they wanted .
Or the district would do it .
Whichever worked out best , ” said John H. Clarke , 85 , of Aptos , who helped build Lexington Reservoir .
“ I knew quite a few of them , ” said the only surviving water district engineer .
” A lot of them moved to Los Gatos and Saratoga .
Most of them have died off now . ”
The relocation was unpopular .
But the South Bay , with its newly growing electronics companies , was desperate for new dams to help provide drinking water and recharge its underground aquifers .
“ A lot of people came here to live from places like Minnesota , ” Clarke said .
“ They liked the warmer weather .
But they never brought their own water with them .
We had to think of water for the valley .
That was what was most important . ”
For Wulf the historian , the long - lost towns still hold precious memories .
He remembers 1946 , when he was 7 years old , riding with his parents and grandmother on a car trip through the mountains .
It was raining , and the roof began to leak , so his father stopped at Jimmy Welter ’s bar in Alma .
As the family sat inside drying off , the young lad noticed his father disappearing behind a curtain in the back .
“ I followed him , ” he said with a chuckle .
“ And what was back there ?
A bunch of one - armed bandits .
Gambling machines .
A man shooed me out pretty quick . ”
Wulf hiked back to see the towns six years later just after construction on the 195 - foot - high dam had finished .
“ I wanted to see them before they were gone .
I could have taken photographs .
I did n’t have a camera , ” Wulf said .
He found abandoned buildings , including the boarded - up Alma train depot .
“ I went in there and it was full of hornets , ” he said .
For 56 years , all of it has been lost , under the reservoir , with parts resurfacing only a few times , like during the droughts of 1977 and 1991 .
And what of the project that has brought fleeting glimpses back to the surface ?
“ It jogs my mind .
It makes me reflect back to when I was a young boy , ” said Wulf .
“ Most people drive along Highway 17 and have no idea what was there .
When I go by , I look down and can still picture how those towns looked . ”

After taking down Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick earlier this year , Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy took aim Monday at violent video games .
Worthy released a Top 10 list of the " most violent video games played by teens , " and tied video games to a gruesome murder and decapitation in suburban Detroit , according to the Detroit Free Press .
In the process , she missed an opportunity to take the discussion of video game violence beyond mere scare tactics and publicity stunts .
TOO MUCH FOR TEENS ?
Kym Worthy 's list of violent games :
• Blitz : The League II
• Gears of War 2
• Saints Row 2
• Dead Space
• Fallout 3
• Far Cry 2
• Legendary
• Left 4 Dead
• Resistance 2
• Silent Hill : Homecoming
Worthy 's list ( see right ) is an exact replica of a list released earlier this year by the National Institute on Media and the Family .
The difference ?
NIMF used the list to warn parents not to let their kids play these violent games , while Worthy seems to assert that teens already are playing them , despite their " M " for mature rating .
Worthy also linked violent video games to the death of Daniel Sorensen in suburban Detroit .
J.P. Orlewicz and Alexander Letkemann were convicted of murder for stabbing Sorenson multiple times , decapitating him and setting his torso on fire .
During the trial , Orlewicz adopted a " video games made me do it " defense , with his lawyers arguing that the game Hitman inspired their client .
To my knowledge , their is no decapitation in Hitman , and some theorized that his lawyers mistakenly cited the game in lieu of Manhunt .
Regardless ,
Worthy 's assertion once again opens up the door to the age old question — do violent video games cause violent behavior ?
The answer is more complicated than a simple ' yes ' or ' no . '
In 1961 cognitive psychologist Albert Bandura laid the foundation for contemporary aggression - related research .
Bandura exposed children in his experimental group to aggressive behavior from an adult and then left them in a room with several toys , including a Bobo Doll ( a toy weighted at the bottom that bounces back up after being hit ) .
He found that children exposed to the aggressive behavior where much more likely than their typical peers to act out violently against the Bobo Doll .
Ok , so children observing real - life aggressive behavior may be inclined to replicate that behavior .
But what about observing , or acting out , such behavior in video games ?
Contemporary psychological research indicates that violent video games do not directly cause the sort of violent behavior Bandura documented , but they do clearly cause an increase in physiological arousal and aggression - related thoughts and feelings linked to aggressive behavior .
Now , I for one firmly believe I can appropriately channel that physiological arousal and those aggressive thoughts .
In fact , at times I 'm happy for such responses that snap me out of ennui .
But others , perhaps those less mentally stable , may not have or know of an appropriate channel .
Worthy 's list might help raise awareness in parents , but the ESRB already rates games , and responsible retailers everywhere are already doing their part to keep violent games out of the hands of children .
There 's a healthy discussion in the scientific community over whether video games cause violent behavior .
Unfortunately , Worthy added little to that discussion .
Pollack are a big source of white fish now that many cod stocks have been depleted ( Image : Scott Aiken / Rex Features )
Heard of the walleye pollack ?
If you ’re partial to a McDonald ’s Filet - o - Fish burger , you have probably eaten it .
It is one of the main reasons white fish is still available to eat , despite the collapse of many cod fisheries .
But now walleye pollack , which accounts for a third of the total US fish catch , is itself in danger .
Fisheries scientists met last week in Seattle and recommended that next year ’s catch in the eastern Bering Sea , the main walleye pollack - fishing region for US boats , be cut by 18 % to 815,000 tonnes .
See the report ( pdf format ) .

A series of cuts in recent years have seen the quota drop from almost 1,500,000 tonnes in 2005 .
The scientists ’ recommendation , which they say is a sustainable catch based on ecological models , is expected to be accepted by the government next month .
The reduced quota could bump up fish prices , but many fear that worse is to come .
Models have failed to foresee the collapse of other major stocks , such as the cod fisheries in the north Atlantic .
Some scientists , as well as the environmental group Greenpeace , have argued that the quota should be cut to around 500,000 in order to give the walleye pollack a chance to recover from years of overfishing .
“ We are on the cusp of one of the largest fishery collapses in history , ” said John Hocevar , Greenpeace oceans campaign director .
“ It may still be possible to prevent disaster . ”
Hocevar and others add that the fall in walleye pollack numbers is one reason for the population crash of one of the fish ’s predators – Steller sea lions .
Numbers have dropped by 80 % since the 1970s ( Ecological Applications , DOI : 10.1890/07-0508.1 ) .

Investing in the stock market could be a bumpy ride .
If you ’re looking for something a little more predictable and generate a steady interest income , investing in Certificates of Deposit might be a good option for you .
This is especially true if you cannot afford to lose what you currently have , or if you are looking at a shorter investing time frame .
What are Certificates of Deposit ( CDs ) ?
Certificates of Deposit , or CDs , are similar to your typical savings accounts .
You can purchase CDs at the same bank you have your savings account , and CDs accrue interest over time just like a savings account .
The major difference is that you are committed to holding a CD for a specific amount of time , e.g. , 3 months , 6 months , a year , 5 years , etc .
In return , the bank guarantees the interest rate for the length of the term .
As such , CDs have some unique characteristics
Fixed - Rate —
If you buy a high - interest CD that yields 2.0 % , it will yield 2.0 % for the duration of the CD .
If the rate interest goes up or down , your CD remains unaffected .
— If you buy a high - interest CD that yields 2.0 % , it will yield 2.0 % for the duration of the CD .
If the rate interest goes up or down , your CD remains unaffected .
Lack of Liquidity —
Since the term is fixed , you ca n’t cash out your CD early without incurring a penalty .
This is why CDs usually pay higher yields than savings accounts and money market funds .
How to Build a CD Ladder Investment
In general , CDs tend to pay a higher interest rate on longer - term CDs .
For example , a 5 - year CD pays more than a 4 - year CD , etc .
However , it would be a bad move to plunk on your money on the longest term CD because of the illiquidity .
This is where a CD Ladder comes in .
A CD ladder is a strategy that makes CD investing more liquid and acts as a hedge against interest rate volatility .
For example , let ’s assume that you have $ 10,000 to invest .
Instead of buying $ 10,000 in a 5 - year CD at 2.5 % interest , you could do the following :
$ 2,000 in 1 - year CD @ 2.0 %
$ 2,000 in 2 - year CD @ 2.1 %
$ 2,000 in 3 - year CD @ 2.25 %
$ 2,000 in 4 - year CD @ 2.4 %
$ 2,000 in 5 - year CD @ 2.5 %
Once your 1 - year CD matures , you could invest the money in a 5 - year CD ( to mature in year 6 ) to take advantage of the higher rate .
And likewise , once your 2 - year CD matures in the second year , you could invest the money in another 5 - year CD ( to mature in year 7 ) .
This means that at any given time , you are at most one year away from accessing 20 % of your money .
Here ’s an illustration of what I just said :
Moreover , we can even make the ladder more liquid by incorporating high yield savings account into your CD ladder investment strategy .
A Caveat to Consider
Not all bank offers the perfect yearly interval terms .
Some offer an odd mix of term lengths , and the interest rate also does n’t increase uniformly .
For example , many banks offer a promotional rate to attract customers , and it is possible to see a shorter - term CD offers a higher interest rate .
You will have to figure out exactly what to do depending on what your bank offers
A CD Ladder as a Hedge Against Interest Rate Fluctuation
Besides liquidity , another key advantage of investing in a CD ladder is its ability to hedge against interest rate changes .
Using the above ladder as an example , if the interest rate is low today , your shortest - term CD will expire in 1 year , allowing you to take advantage of the rising interest rate .
However , if the interest rate is high today , you have 4 CDs that are locking in the higher interest rate for 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 years , respectively .
Here are a few more articles about CD Ladder
While some Iraqi officials defended the dismissals , saying there had been no political motivation , others pointed to the secrecy involved as supporting their view that those removed had lost their posts without good cause .
Each of Iraq ’s 30 cabinet - level ministries has one inspector general .
These oversight officials are supported by varying budgets and staffing .
Although some of the inspectors general have been notably quiet , others have vigorously investigated both current and former ministers and other senior officials , and the top echelons of Iraqi officialdom have found ample reason to fear them .
In one case , investigations of a former electricity minister landed him in jail before he escaped and fled to the United States , and an Oil Ministry inspector general detailed extensive smuggling and extortion schemes that he said bedeviled the industry .
A former public works minister , a Kurd , complained before she fled the country that her ministry ’s inspector general at the time , a Shiite , had been hyperactive and had brought charges based more on political considerations than actual wrongdoing .
How many of the ministries have received orders to dismiss their inspectors is a matter of disagreement among Iraqi governmental officials , but their estimates range from a handful to as many as 17 .
Several senior Iraqi and American officials agreed that seven to nine inspectors general had already been dismissed or forced into retirement .
In one case , at the Education Ministry , the post became vacant when the inspector general died .
Senior Iraqi officials and four of the dismissed officials , many of whom asked not to be named for fear of government reprisals , said inspectors had already been removed in the Ministries of Water Resources , Culture , Trade , and Youth and Sport .
In addition , inspectors have been removed from the cabinet - level Central Bank of Iraq , and from two religious offices , the Sunni Endowment and the Christian Endowment , whose leaders carry the rank of deputy minister .
Israelis and Arabs " feel that only force can assure justice , " I. F. Stone noted soon after the Six - Day War in 1967 .
And he wrote : " A certain moral imbecility marks all ethnocentric movements .
The Others are always either less than human , and thus their interests may be ignored , or more than human and therefore so dangerous that it is right to destroy them . "
The closing days of 2008 have heightened the Israeli government ’s stature as a mighty practitioner of the moral imbecility that Stone described .
Israel ’s air strikes " have killed at least 270 people so far , injured more than 1,000 , many of them seriously , and many remain buried under the rubble so the death toll will likely rise , " Phyllis Bennis of the Institute for Policy Studies pointed out on Sunday , two days into Israel ’s attack .
" This catastrophic impact was known and inevitable , and far outweighs any claim of self - defense or protection of Israeli civilians . "
She mentioned that " the one Israeli killed by a Palestinian rocket attack on Saturday after the Israeli assault began was the first such casualty in more than a year . "
Even if you set aside the magnitude of Israel ’s violations of the Geneva conventions and the long terrible history of its methodical collective punishment of 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza , consider the vastly disproportionate carnage in the conflict .
" An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind , " Gandhi said .
What about a hundred eyes for an eye ?
It makes some of the world ill with rage .
And it turns much of the United States numb with silence .
Routinely , the politicians and pundits of Washington can’t summon minimal decency in themselves or each other on the subject of Israel and Palestinians .
While officialdom inside the Beltway seems frozen in fear of risking " anti-Semitism " charges by actually standing up for the human rights of Palestinian people , some progress at the grassroots has been noticeable .
It includes the growth of groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace , Tikkun , and the Shalom Center , where activists have worked to refute the false claims that American Jews are united behind Israeli policies .
At the epicenters of the conflict  where the belief that " only force can assure justice " seems to be even stronger than when I .
F.
Stone wrote about it 41 years ago  the conclusion has been drawn and redrawn so many times that deadly repetition has become paralytic .
While some Palestinian " militants " have terrorized and murdered , the Israeli government has terrorized and murdered on a much bigger scale , using a vast arsenal largely financed by U.S. taxpayers .
From afar , in the United States , it ’s too easy to shake our heads at the lethal loss of moral vision .
Do n’t they know that " an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind " ?
But the cycle of violence is extremely asymmetrical  while the U.S. government provides Israel with billions of dollars and invaluable " diplomatic " support .
What ’s going on in Gaza right now is not just an eye for an eye .
It ’s a hundred eyes for an eye .
And the current slaughter is not only an ongoing Israeli war crime .
It has an accomplice named Uncle Sam .

A former LDS Bishop in Harrisville has pleaded guilty to molesting children from his church ward .
Originally Timothy McCleve pleaded not guilty to several sex abuse charges , but later he struck a deal with prosecutors .
It 's a mystery why McCleve changed his mind , but we know victims were ready to testify in a trial .
In March 2007 , McCleve molested three sisters from his ward .
The little girls were abused in their home when their parents were gone .
The girls came forward after seeing media reports of sexual abuse involving school teacher Frank Lane Hall .
After that a fourth victim came forward , a 21 - year - old college student that used to be McCleve 's neighbor .
She says he abused her when she was 6 .
So , is his guilty plea justice for his victims ?
Harrisville Police Chief Max Jackson said , " We 're certainly glad it 's come to a conclusion , at least thus far , especially for the victims and their families . "
The victims ' parents were in court today but did not want to make a statement .
They may speak at McCleve 's sentencing , which is scheduled at the end of November .
McCleve faces a maximum of 30 years behind bars for the crime .

The siege at Mumbai's Taj Mahal hotel is over , officials say , three days after deadly attacks struck the city .
Police commissioner Hassan Gafoor said the hotel was now under their control .
" All combat operations are over .
All the terrorists have been killed . "
Commandos began a new assault early on Saturday aimed at ending fighting that has claimed at least 195 lives .
Commando chief JK
Dutt told media three militants had been killed but his men still had to check all the hotel rooms .
Speaking to media outside the hotel , he appealed for any guests still hiding in the building to make their presence known and warned that small explosions might be heard as the clearing operation continued .
See a detailed map of the area On Friday , almost 100 people were rescued from a second hotel , and six bodies were found at a Jewish centre .
India 's foreign minister has said " elements with links to Pakistan " were involved in the attacks on Mumbai .
However , his Pakistani counterpart has urged India not to bring politics into the issue , saying " we should join hands to defeat the enemy " .
The Pakistani government is to hold an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday to discuss the attacks .
But it has reversed a decision to send its intelligence chief to India to help with investigations , following criticism from opposition politicians and a lukewarm response from the army .
It will send a lower - ranking representative instead .
' Ultimate sacrifice '
Extremely heavy and sustained gunfire was heard inside the Taj Mahal Palace hotel shortly before 0730 ( 0200 GMT ) on Saturday , as soldiers rushed into the lobby in a bid to flush out the remaining few gunmen .
Firefighters then worked to contain fierce flames and thick smoke that billowed from the building 's lower floors .

All eyes will now be on India 's investigation of the attacks , our correspondent says , with questions already being asked about the failure of its intelligence agencies to uncover the plans .
The commandos suspect that the militants knew the hotel well because they were very mobile during the course of the siege , he says , making it extremely difficult for security forces to secure an area in order to evacuate guests .
Indian media have reported that one of the militants worked as a chef for 10 months at the hotel .
Some have described this as India 's 9/11 , our correspondent adds , and people in India now want answers as to who is responsible .
Blasts had rung out for most of Friday after truckloads of commandos entered the premises .
A journalist and bystander outside the hotel were taken to hospital after being hit by shrapnel .
Panic and rumours grip Mumbai Indian commandos who managed to enter other parts of the Taj say they found at least 30 bodies in one hall .
Fighting appears to have ended at the other key flashpoints in Mumbai , chief among them the Oberoi - Trident hotel - where nearly 100 people were rescued and 24 bodies were found earlier on Friday .
But at Nariman House , the Mumbai base of Chabad - Lubavitch , a New York - based orthodox Jewish organisation , the news was grim .
The organisation confirmed that Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg , 29 , had been killed alongside his wife , Rivka .
Their two - year - old son survived .
The Holtzbergs had moved to India in 2003 from New York to run the Mumbai branch of the outreach organisation , which offers services and hospitality to Jewish travellers .
The bodies were removed from the building early on Saturday .

Indo -Pakistan ties strained
The stand - offs began late on Wednesday when gunmen armed with automatic weapons and grenades opened fire indiscriminately on crowds at a major railway station , the two hotels , the Jewish centre , a hospital and a cafe frequented by foreigners .
Indian officials says at least 195 people have been killed since Wednesday , with around 295 injured , the vast majority Indian citizens .
The toll could rise further , they say .
At least 22 foreigners are known to have died , including victims from Germany , Japan , Canada , Australia , Italy , Singapore , Thailand and France .
One Briton , Andreas Liveras , has been killed .
A claim of responsibility for this week 's attacks - the worst in India 's commercial capital since nearly 200 people were killed in a series of bombings in 2006 - has been made by a previously unknown group calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen .
However , most intelligence officials are keeping an open mind as the attacks have thrown up conflicting clues , BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says .

Three ancient statues representing the African animal - god Amun were unearthed at el - Hassa , in Sudan , nearly three weeks ago , some 200 kms ( 120 miles ) to the north of the capital city of Khartoum .
The statues bear inscriptions that could help experts understand an ancient tongue , one of the few left undeciphered in the entire world .
Also , the references to king Amanakhareqerem may shed more light on the importance of the respective personality .
The stone rams belong to an old period of Africa 's history , the Meroe age , estimated to have extended for seven centuries and a half , between 300 BC to 450 AD , when kings ruled supreme .
An extensive amount of remains can still be found dating from the Meroitic period by the Nile river .
A legacy of the Meroitic people also resides in each inscription on the statues , representing the most ancient written tongue in sub-Saharan Africa .
" It is one of the last antique languages that we still do n't understand [...] we can read it .
We have no problem pronouncing the letters .
But we can't understand it , apart from a few long words and the names of people , " revealed Vincent Rondot , director of the dig works developed by the French section of the Directorate of Antiquities in Sudan , as cited by Reuters .
The inscription seems to be the complete version of the same royal dedication that was previously discovered only on fragments of carvings , and comparisons could aid specialists in determining the meaning of the words .
Although Sudan is far richer in pyramids than the more famed Egypt , the ongoing Darfur conflict prevents visitors from coming , and it makes research works more difficult .
The inscriptions on the statues found under the desert dunes among the ruins of a temple built for Amun may also shed more light on the infamous king Amanakhareqerem .
" Before we started the dig we only had four documents in his name [...]
We do n't even know where he was buried , " stated Rondot .
" We are beginning to understand the importance of that king . "
HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - More than 175,000 electric customers in Michigan remained without power on Monday as utilities worked to restore service knocked out by high winds that moved through the state on Sunday , utilities said .
More than 413,000 customers across the state were affected on Sunday as 60 mph winds knocked tree limbs into power lines .
Detroit Edison , a unit of DTE Energy , reported 120,000 customers without power at midday Monday , down from a peak of 230,000 on Sunday , a spokesman said .
Outages remained in and around Detroit and scattered across the company ’s eastern Michigan service territory .
CMS Energy ’s Consumer Energy unit , which serves central Michigan , said 57,000 customers were without power Monday , down from 183,000 at the peak of the storm .
Detroit Edison and Consumers said additional workers from Indiana , Ohio , Illinois , Kentucky and Tennessee were helping with the restoration .
Both utilities said they expect to have all customers restored by Wednesday .
American Electric
Power reported no major outages in its southwest Michigan territory , according to a spokeswoman .
The destructive windstorm extended a period of power outages across the U.S. Midwest that began a week ago when severe ice storms knocked out power across Indiana , Illinois and Ohio .

Flawed Assumptions about the Credit Crisis : A Critical Examination of US Policymakers
New York , NY , USA December 11 , 2008
US policymakers have implemented an unprecedented range of tools to fight the credit crisis .
However , it appears that many of their assumptions regarding the nature of the crisis are not supported , or even flatly contradicted , by the available data .
Many measures of lending have actually increased during the crisis and are even at record levels .
This reports examines some key assumptions being made by leading US policymakers regarding the credit crisis .
In particular , comments made by the two leading policymakers , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , Ben Bernanke , as well as the secretary of the US Treasury Department , Henry Paulson , are compared with publicly available data .
In many cases , it appears that these policymakers ’ assumptions regarding the credit crisis are incorrect .
Far from seeing a tightening of credit , a number of measures show that credit has expanded , and Celent finds that the lending markets are in surprisingly good health .
Data published ( in most cases by the Federal Reserve itself ) show that :
Overall lending by US banks is at a record high and has increased during the credit crisis .
Interbank lending is at record highs and has increased during the credit crisis .
Consumer credit is at record highs and has increased during the credit crisis .
Commercial paper markets are operating within their historical norms .
Lending by banks to businesses is at record highs and has been growing rapidly .
Municipal bond markets are operating within their historical norms .
Deposits at banks have shown a substantial increase since the start of the credit crisis .
" It appears that policymakers are making a variety of mistakes regarding the current financial crisis .
If that is the case , the policy tools that they are employing may very well be the wrong ones , " Octavio Marenzi , head of Celent and author of the report .
The 30 - page report contains 27 figures .

the endless forced good cheer , the media - driven consumer frenzy , the It's a Wonderful Life fantasy dissolving into a Married ... with Children reality .
But no matter how bad your holiday is , rest assured that it could have been far worse .
Home was definitely not the place to be for the family of R. Gene Simmons of Dover , Arkansas in 1987 .
The clan was rapidly becoming estranged from the family patriarch .
Even his favorite daughter , who had borne him a son , had run off and gotten married .
It was time for revenge .
As each contingent showed up at the dilapidated family mobile home to try to put a happy face on for the holiday , Simmons shot the adults and strangled the children .
By Christmas Day , he 'd wiped out almost three generations of Simmons , 14 all told .
It was the worst family slaughter in American history .
But wait — he was n't done yet !
For an encore a few days later , he went on a shooting rampage through a few former places of employment .
He killed two people and injured four more before surrendering to police .
He later became the first man executed by lethal injection in Arkansas .
The holiday - fueled impulse to eradicate one 's family is n't limited to the dysfunctional trailer park crowd .
H. Sanford Williams was eminently respectable , having been an Army Chaplin , a Methodist Pastor , and finally the head of a charity , the National Retirement Foundation .
Alas , the season of sharing had been a bust donation - wise and his foundation was in serious trouble .
On Christmas Eve in 1957 , the St. Petersburg , Florida man shot and killed his wife and two sons before turning the gun on himself .
It was the climax of the 1924 Christmas Eve pageant at the Babb's Switch , Oklahoma one - room schoolhouse .
The last recitation had ended , the last carol faded .
Now Santa himself was handing out bags of candy to all the children .
But oh no !
Santa brushed against the candle - lit tree .
Within minutes , the room was a seething inferno , with 200 men , women , and children trying to force their way out the only exit : a door that opened inward .
Thirty - four people died .
But thanks to the heroic efforts of Santa and the schoolteacher ( both of whom were themselves incinerated ) , only five children were among the dead .
The substitution of incandescent lights for candles did n't eliminate the tendency of Christmas trees to turn into pyrotechnic yule logs .
One of the deadliest of these modern - day holiday firebombs was Niles Street Hospital 's 1945 tree .
When a nurse unplugged the tree lights on Christmas Eve in the Hartford , Connecticut convalescent hospital , a spark ignited the dry needles .
She grabbed a fire extinguisher , but panicked at the sight of the roaring flames and fled .
Not only did she not even bother to call the fire department ( neighbors , woken by the crackling flames , summoned them several minutes later ) , she left the front door open to properly ventilate the blaze .
The building was completely gutted , and 15 patients and two staff died .
Christmas
Eve midnight mass in Temoaya , Mexico in 1953 had just finished .
Three thousand worshippers were peacefully filing out when someone tripped over the wrong wire .
There was a bright blue flash , and then total darkness .
All sense of peace and goodwill toward men vanished as the crowd transformed into a panic - stricken mob stampeding from the sanctuary .
By the time the lights came on a few minutes later , 23 people were dead and over 200 injured .
What are the different ways to play the Visual Thesaurus Spelling Bee ?
There are two different ways to play .
In the Tournament Spelling Bee , you 'll be challenged by a series of words , with the spelling difficulty adapted to your skill level .
The more words you get right , the higher your score will go , on a scale from 200 to 800 .
You can compete against other spellers , since we keep track of high scores ( with streaks of correct answers serving as tiebreakers ) .
You can also try a Community Spelling Bee generated from one of our subscribers ' word lists .
Community Spelling
Bees test your knowledge of a limited group of words and give you a score based on the percentage of words you spell correctly .
How does the Visual Thesaurus Spelling Bee work ?
Each turn , you 'll hear the recording of the word and see its definition ( with words suitably omitted that might give away the correct spelling ) .
You try to guess the spelling .
In the Tournament Spelling Bee , the more words you get right , the higher your score will go .
The game adapts to your skill level , so if you continue to answer correctly , you 'll get harder and harder words to spell .
And getting words wrong means you 'll get progressively easier words .
If you play a Community Spelling Bee , the words from the selected word list are presented in random order .
Your score is based on the percentage of words you spell correctly .
What happens if I misspell a word ?
If you spell a word incorrectly , you can keep guessing for as long as you like .
After three incorrect guesses , you can choose " I surrender ! " to reveal the word .
Continuing to guess at a word wo n't count towards your score .
Try to learn the correct spelling of these words , though , because you can expect to see them pop up again later in the game .
What is the appropriate age level or grade level to play the Spelling Bee ?
Because the Tournament Spelling
Bee is adaptive , it 's appropriate for all skill levels .
No matter what your spelling ability , everyone can reach a challenging level , where you 're getting about half the words right and half the words wrong .
Community Spelling
Bees can be tailored to any skill level , from basic to advanced , since the choice of words is up to the creator of the word list .
How does the scoring work ?
In the Tournament Spelling Bee , your score is calculated on a scale from 200 to 800 , much like the SAT and other standardized tests .
Your score will update after each round of five words that you complete .
In a Community Spelling Bee , your score is based on the percentage of words spelled correctly , from 0 % to 100 % .
Your score will update after each turn .
How do I see how my score stacks up against other spellers ?
When you play the Tournament Spelling Bee , you will see your rank among all spellers at the bottom of the page ( under " How do you stack up ? " ) .
At the end of each round of five words , your rank will change along with your score .
As you play , you 'll see your rank go up or down , depending on how well you do .
How do I get on the high score list ?
At the bottom of the Tournament Spelling Bee page and on the main page for the Spelling Bee , we keep track of which Visual Thesaurus subscribers are the best spellers .
The top ten spellers of the day are ranked , as well as a monthly Top Ten .
Subscribers who make it to the monthly Top Ten list earn a " bee " badge next to their names .
If you 're not a subscriber , your score will not be recorded in the Top Ten lists .
How do you break ties on the high score list ?
Your longest streak of correct answers is used as a tiebreaker in ranking the top scores .
When does the game end ?
In the Tournament Spelling Bee , you can keep playing for as long as you like .
The game only ends when you decide you 've had enough .
If you play a Community Spelling Bee , the game will end when you have spelled all words on the list correctly .
You 'll have a chance to revisit misspelled words before the game ends to make sure you can spell them correctly .
How do I make my own Community Spelling Bee to share with others ?
Subscribers to the Visual Thesaurus have the ability to design a custom word list and save it as an interactive Community Spelling Bee for others to play .
Simply create a word list and save it as a spelling bee .
As with regular Visual Thesaurus word lists , you can share Community Spelling Bees and add ones you like to your list of favorites .
Each subscriber 's profile will list the word lists and spelling bees they 've made .
We also feature several Community Spelling Bees on the main Spelling Bee page : just click one to start playing .
How do I make a spelling bee from any text , such as a web page or other document ?
First use VocabGrabber to grab vocabulary from the text .
If you 're a Visual Thesaurus subscriber , you can make a word list out of the vocabulary .
After you have created the word list , you can save it as a spelling bee .
Where do the pronunciations of the words come from ?
The high - quality audio pronunciations were developed especially for the Visual Thesaurus , in a recording project for all 150,000 words in our dictionary .
Read more about the voices behind the pronunciations here .
What if I find a problem with a pronunciation or a definition ?
Just use the link at the bottom of the play page to let us know of a problem with a particular word , and we 'll do our best to make improvements .
What do I do if I can't hear the pronunciations ?
First , make sure you have the most recent version of Adobe Flash installed .
Then make sure you have your volume turned up .
We also recommend using headphones while playing so that you can hear the subtleties in the pronunciations .

What are people saying about the Visual Thesaurus Spelling Bee ?
How can I find out more about how the Spelling Bee works ?
Our press release on the Spelling Bee has more background , including a description of the data analysis and contact information for media inquiries .
Eureka !
It ’s the halting problem , or to be more precise Collatz ’s Conjecture .
The algorithm is as follows :
while ( n > 1 ) { if ( n is even ) n := n / 2 ; else n :=
3n + 1 ; }
where n is an integer greater than 0 .
If we try a test cases the pattern is as follows :
n = 2 : 2 , 1 , halt .
n = 3 : 3 , 10 , 5 , 16 , 8 , 4 , 2 , 1 , halt .
n = 7 : 7 , 22 , 11 , 34 , 17 , 52 , 26 , 13 , 40 , 20 , 10 , 5 , 16 , 8 , 4 , 2 , 1 , halt .
Hopefully , none of you have ever written any code like this .
The question is , will this algorithm always terminate ( halt ) , or are their certain values of n for which it will loop forever ?
Collatz is a classic example of the Halting Problem , which Alan Turing proved that there is no way we can write a generic program that can tell if all possible programs will halt or not .
Obviously the halting problem is solvable for some / most programs – the first Hello World !
you ever wrote hopefully did halt .
Microsoft ’s Terminator research project can be used to tell whether a large numer of typical programs will halt or not , but the Collatz ’s algorithm still eludes them !
If you want to have a play around with this , I have written a Java program to save you the effort ( albeit minimal ) of doing it yourself .
Let me know how you get on – I suggest trying the number 27 .
A final thought : what is the best way to visualise all the data : say n = 1 to 1,000,000 ?
The traffic circle hums on a cool and sunny afternoon , as motorists round the center median with its fake orange palm tree that sparkles at night , blooming flower beds and chunky sculpture .
On such a calm day in Baghdad , it is hard to imagine the carnage that erupted here in Nisoor Square in September 2007 , when Blackwater Worldwide security guards killed at least 17 Iraqis in a hail of machine - gun bullets and grenades , but the evidence remains .
Bullet holes pock the small shelter where traffic cops dived for cover .
Splotches scar the wall of a school off the square that prosecutors say was hit by American gunfire .
Memories rankle people familiar with the story , which still resonates powerfully in Iraq even as the legal repercussions have shifted to courthouses thousands of miles away in the U.S .
Five Blackwater employees , all of them U.S. military veterans , were charged Monday with manslaughter and attempted manslaughter in the case , which strained U.S. - Iraqi relations and galvanized Iraqi opposition to the Western security companies that had operated with impunity here .
Advertisement
Starting Jan. 1 , private security details such as Blackwater will be subject to Iraqi jurisdiction if accused of crimes committed while off American bases , a change demanded by Iraq ’s government after the Blackwater incident and others involving different companies that resulted in civilian deaths on a smaller scale .
The current Blackwater defendants wo n’t face trial in Iraq , but they could face decades in prison in the United States if convicted , something that pleases Iraqis such as Ali Abdul Ali .
“ This is good , ” said Ali , an unemployed military veteran .
“ It means no one is above the law , even if he ’s an element of foreign forces .
It also means the victims will get justice . ”
Ali , who comes often to an abandoned bus stop near Nisoor Square to sit in the sunshine and think about life , has a friend whose mother was among 20 Iraqis shot and wounded in the incident .
Like other Iraqis in the circle that day , the friend said the shooting was unjustified , he said .
Advertisement
“ These people were armed and they were shooting innocent people , ” Ali said .
That ’s not how the Blackwater guards tell it .
They say their convoy came under attack as they escorted U.S. State Department officials and that they fired in self - defense .
In the square Tuesday , the sound of gunfire was constant and clear over the cacophony of car engines , tooting horns and sirens from the intimidating convoys that still tear through the circle , but it was from an Iraqi police firing range nearby .
Police officers stationed in the circle were happy to discuss the Blackwater case and to show off the bullet holes from that day .
One of them quickly interrupted his lunch of beans , rice and bread to weigh in .
Advertisement
“ I heard about [ the charges against the Blackwater employees ] yesterday on the news , ” said the officer , who like his colleagues was not authorized to speak to reporters and would not give a name .
“ Because they killed 17 innocent people , of course they should be arrested . ”
The policeman , who has worked this spot for five years , was not in the square the day of the shooting but came to work the next day to see wrecked cars , blood - stained streets , bullet casings .
He pointed to a section of gnarled concrete in the busy street a few feet away .
“ That ’s where the doctor and her son died , ” he said , referring to Mahasin Mohssen Khadum Khazali and her son , Ahmed Haitham Ahmed Rubaie , who were in a white sedan that the Blackwater guards said they suspected of being rigged to explode .
“ Justice should be served .
These victims -- their rights should be taken into consideration , ” said another policeman , edging in front of the first cop and quickly taking over the conversation .
This officer said that if the Blackwater guards are convicted , they should die .
Advertisement
“ This is the law of God .
In the Arab world , anyone who kills someone , he should be killed , ” he said .
They scoffed at the idea that the guards might have felt genuinely threatened because of the situation in Baghdad at the time .
Violence was far worse then , when attacks on U.S. forces were daily events .
That month , 70 foreign troops , including 66 Americans , were killed across Iraq , according to the independent website icasualties.org .
Last month , the total was 17 .
“ This place is surrounded .
It is secure , ” the second officer said , noting the national guard base on one side of the square and another government building on the other .
“ It ’s impossible ” that anyone could have felt threatened , he said .
Minutes later , a U.S. military convoy entered the circle .
Civilian traffic ground to a halt to let the vehicles pass , but they stopped midway through .
A group of U.S. soldiers walked toward the Iraqi police .
Advertisement
“ Let ’s have it , ” one of them sternly said to a U.S. journalist who had been filming the square , referring to the memory chip of his video camera .
The soldier uttered an obscenity about filming the convoy but backed off without taking the memory chip after another American intervened , satisfied that the journalists were more interested in the scene at the square , not the convoy that had rolled into view .
Afterward , one policeman joked that it was good the journalists were of the “ same tribe ” as the soldiers .
If they ’d been Iraqis , he said , they would have been locked up .

Step 3 .
Watch people freak out !!!
Maybe I should try this while I ’m on vacation .
Turning off all media for 48 hours does amazing things for clarity .
When you return , the insane and unintentional comedy of the civilized world becomes clear .
As Voltaire wrote , “ God is a comedian playing to an audience too afraid to laugh ” .
Among the many salient things I noticed after my media hiatus , the U.S. Presidential election stood out as the most curious drama of all .
I could n’t stop laughing , and crying , about how , despite our solemn patriotic pride , we have no idea what we ’re doing .
Although we ’re often asked to vote , we are often too ignorant and self - centered to make good choices .
Our checkered history of presidential voting
Take a good look at the previous presidents of the united states .
You can find credible literature describing many of them as both gods and as failures , often for the exact same deeds .
In hundreds of U.S. history classrooms , right now , kids are writing papers about whether Reagan , Lincoln or JFK were the greatest , or the worst , presidents in U.S. History .
Many historians agree it takes at least a decade to sort out the impact of a presidents actions .
Yet we bet so much on rejection or approval of the last president or two : four or eight years , being less than the decade needed to have a sense of what they did well , and what they did wrong .
And experts know a president ’s influence is , by design , magnitudes weaker than the public perception : one of three rings of power .
By constitutional design the three branches of government keep each other in check , and no matter how great a single president is as an individual , the condition and party balance of the senate and judiciary they inherent determine their fate at least as much as their ability does .
Political campaigns stress the individual , but what is harder to evaluate is their skill at working with other branches of government .
While we push as many people as possible to vote , there is no primer , handbook , or tip sheet provided on how to avoid mistakes of elections past .
We ’ve been doing this election thing for quite awhile , do n’t you think we should review how we ’ve done ?
Take a look and see if the way we vote has resulted in what we voted for ?
And perhaps make some adjustments this time around ?
The mistakes we make when voting
Many people vote for self - interest .
Construction workers vote for the president they think best understands construction workers ( e.g. pro union ) , Venture capitalists vote for the president they think best serves venture capital ( e.g. low taxes ) , and Star wars fans vote for the president most likely to ban more bad star wars movies ( e.g. mandate the imprisonment of George Lucas in a room with only star wars merchandise to wear , star wars food to eat , and post 1983 star wars movies to watch , and force him to write Han shot first a million times on a chalkboard ) .
But how can it make sense for everyone to vote solely on what suits themselves best ?
It ’s not a United States of Me. Certainly self interest is a major consideration in a vote , but it has to be weighed against others .
There might just be people in this country , or challenges to the common good , whose needs are more important to the future of the country than our own .
State and local elections often matter more for self - interest than national elections , by design .
And serious weight often goes to superficial things .
The jokes about high school elections being popularity contests are apt : we are distracted by surfaces .
People forget we are biased towards picking people who look like us , or fit an image of what we think a president should look like .
We are easily distracted away from better measures : namely performance , or our estimation of potential for performance .
Consider how the JFK and Nixon presidential debate , the first ever televised , gave the GQ - looking JFK an unprecedented advantage over Nixon : those who listened on radio thought Nixon won , while those watching on TV , thought it was JFK .
Many of our greatest presidents were less than telegenic : Abraham Lincoln , John Adams , FDR ( he hid the fact he was in a wheelchair ) .
Even Thomas Jefferson loathed giving speeches , believing he was n’t very good at them .
In our short attention span media - rich times many great voices of our past would never have even been heard .
Try closing your eyes in the next debate or interview , you might just improve your analysis of what ’s being said .
Many people make their list of positions on issues and try to find a candidate that best matches those positions .
This is the idealists approach to decision making : why does it matter if candidate A matches your positions if they do n’t have the skills to deliver on supporting those issues while in office ?
Or if they will cause so much harm to the nation at large to outweigh the importance of those positions .
The goal for the democracy is to do the greatest good over the long term , meaning it ’s likely a mistake to allow regress on many issues just to defend one .
Handy decision making tools like iSideWith , that use multiple choice questions to identify the candidate that best matches your opinions , are useful , but offer zero information on the candidate ’s ability to make any of these things happen .
And we forget much of what president ’s do is respond to issues we never imagined we ’d have to deal with ( Can you say 9/11 , Katrina , and the sub - prime mortgage crisis ?
None of which showed up on position lists for the 2000 or 2004 elections respectively ) .
Then consider how shallow our modern debates are : Lincoln and Douglas debated for over 20 hours in 1858 , and for a senatorial race !
A full days worth of debate might be too much for us today , but the modern presidential debate protocols , diminish the candidates role in representing themselves to the public .
Imagine how little need we ’d have for pundits and commentary if our candidates were asked to represent themselves against the other in true discourse , with wise / fearless moderators , allowing us the benefit of our own judgments .
How to decode political coverage
The simple test for any political coverage is to ask this :
What does this have to do with their ability to do the job ?
75 % of what gets passed off as commentary on the election fails this test .
What you hear is either trivia , gossip , mythology or noise .
( For example , McCain ’s POW status , while noble and honorable , is not a primary criteria for an executive position .
Neither in the case of Obama is one ’s race ) .
Pundits have failed when their commentary circles what ’s fed to them by campaign staff , instead of applying their expert knowledge to help viewers evaluate the merits of the candidate .
They are supposed to help us spot the good ones , or at least point out the attributes to look for , and that can not happen by endlessly dissecting the hidden meaning of a flubbed sentence in a speech , a vague promise , or a mistake of fact , things every president throughout history and forever into the future will , as non-robotic human beings , occasionally do .
The big confusion we make is mistaking the campaign for the presidency .
Running a great campaign bears little relationship to being a great president , as the many mediocre and tragic presidencies in our history proves ( They ran better campaigns , right ? ) .
It ’s not like the campaign consist of a presidential Olympics , with simulations and events designed to test their abilities .
They do n’t even get to play RISK against each other , much less , say , a Will Wright designed ‘ Sim - President ’ or other cleverly constructed simulation .
This means our job as voters is to look past the battles of the campaign and make a decision based on how we think they ’ll perform in the real thing .
How to pick a president
It ’s nowhere to be found in major coverage , but smart folks have studied what traits led to more successful presidencies .
Sure , these things are subjective , but they offer a better framework , based on history , for making our next big bet .
Fred I. Greenstein , Professor of Politics Emeritus at Princeton University , calls out 6 attributes most related to success in office , a veritable scorecard for our use :
Effectiveness as a public communicator Organizational capacity Political skill ( obviously , but he explains specific traits ) Vision Cognitive Style Emotional Intelligence
Read his descriptions of these skills , as he offers excellent , and easy to understand examples from history .
He also notes this surprising observation :
“ Results of the research indicate that great presidents , besides being stubborn and disagreeable , are more extroverted , open to experience , assertive , achievement striving , excitement seeking and more open to fantasy , aesthetics , feelings , actions , ideas and values .
Historically great presidents were low on straightforwardness , vulnerability and order . ”
Which flies in the face of how the well mannered , A - student , stately - goody - two - shoes personality profile candidates are expected to fit into during campaign season .
The 30 minute prep for picking a good president
Here it is .
In 30 minutes you too can have a solid grounding on what makes for a good president , and have everything necessary to make a choice truly in the best interest of the United States .
Read the Constitution ( 10 minutes ) .
It ’s probably been years since you have , if you ever did .
This is the engine the president helps run – how can you pick a president if you do n’t understand what they ’re running ?
Essential reading .
Should be included in every ballot .
Skim the Bill of Rights + Amendments ( 5 minutes ) .
These are the rules the President and government are obligated to play by and protect .
Also essential .
Read the job specs for the Presidency ( 5 minutes ) .
Written by former editor and chief of Time Magazine , outlines 30 attributes we should be looking for .
Study the qualities that bear on presidential performance .
Princeton professor Greenstein ’s short , and excellent , essay ( 5 minutes ) .
Make a position and issue list .
Half the list should include your top issues and concerns for the next year , and half should include issues and concerns you imagine over the next ten years .
Make a scorecard .
With the above , you ’re now informed about the history of good presidency .
Make your own list of ten attributes , and use it to score the candidates .
You ’re now prepared to watch debates , listen to the news , and provide historic context and bullshit detection upon what ’s said by both pundits and candidates alike .

World leaders have vowed to help prevent future financial meltdowns by creating international accounting standards so all companies would play by the same rules , but the effort has instead been mired in loopholes and political pressures .
In October , largely hidden from public view , the International Accounting Standards Board changed the rules so European banks could make their balance sheets look better .
The action let the banks rewrite history , picking and choosing among their problem investments to essentially claim that some had been on a different set of books before the financial crisis started .
The results were dramatic .
Deutsche Bank shifted $ 32 billion of troubled assets , turning a $ 970 million quarterly pretax loss into $ 120 million profit .
And the securities markets were fooled , bidding Deutsche Bank 's shares up nearly 19 percent on Oct. 30 , the day it made the startling announcement that it had turned an unexpected profit .

Building an add - on for IE is so difficult , he said , your browser app competitors wo n't even bother .
" It 's harder to write apps for IE - so it 's a harder market for competitors to get into , " Allen told developers this morning at Add - on - Con , a Mountain View , California , mini - conference dedicated to , yes , building browser add - ons .
Of course , Allen also argued that IE has more market share .
" You want to get to that 70 per cent of the market that uses Internet Explorer , " he said .
" Right now , IE 6 probably has more market share than Firefox . "
And he pointed out that Firefox users are more likely to " mess " with your business model .
" They tend to install things like ad blockers , whereas the Internet Explorer user is more mainstream . "
Allen acknowledged that add - on makers are more likely to launch their tools on Firefox , a platform that offers real developer tools .
He even said that launching on Firefox is the way to go because Michael " TechCrunch " Arrington is more likely to review your product .
Arrington - blogging 's king maker to start ups - is a Mac man , and Macs do n't run IE .
But Allen is happy to say IE 8 will solve the developer tools problem .
And he insisted that although porting add - ons to IE is annoying , it can be done .
" With Firefox , you 've got this more enthusiast audience , more of a controlled test bed .
It 's a good place to try out ideas before porting them to Internet Explorer , " he said .
If you port your Firefox add - on to IE , you may have to use C++.
And Allen admitted that this is a bit 1998 .
" The first thing people say is ' That 's horrible .
No one programs in C++ anymore , ' " he said .
But he reckoned there are ways of using languages like Python or Microsoft's C# .
This involves using the .NET Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) .
But the trick here is that you 'll have to make sure your add - on works on all versions of the CLR .
Microsoft only loads one version of the CLR for each IE executable , so you have to make sure there are no breaking changes between versions .
" It 's a little bit tricky , " Allen said .
But go ahead .
Give it a shot .
Yours competitors wo n't . ®
Lightning power generator Harness the power of random electrostatic discharge
( 0 ) [ vote for ,
against ]
An idea that I 'd long ago thought about was the possibility of using lighning to generate electricity , or harness it directly .
One idea is using a flywheel connected to a cable .
The other end of the cable is connected to an Electromagnetic rail ( a la bullet - train ) powered by the lightning ( one end grounded , the other in the air .
The large discharge would rev up the flywheel , which would slowly be " discharged " by a generator .
A the same idea could be done but with an electric motor attatched instead of the cable idea .
Direct harnessage could be done with a high - resistance circuit that would slow down the surge to a " usable speed " .

Lightning will knock down your soul [ tiromancer , Feb 07 2005 ]
Exclusive to STR
December 30 , 2008
I recently attended the 3rd North American Secessionist Convention held in Manchester , New Hampshire .
While the topic of secession is not uncommon to readers of this daily journal , the idea of secession is unique and unappealing to most Americans .
The term often brings forth images of the Civil War , slavery , the assassination of a President and a defeated Confederacy .
Americans seem blissfully unaware that the Declaration of Independence was an act of secession from Great Britain and that the history of nation - states throughout the world is replete with sections breaking away from larger political bodies to go their own separate way , the latest being the attempt of South Ossetia to leave the nation of Georgia .
Because secession is a frequent fact of geopolitical life , the Middlebury Institute was founded a few years ago in Cold Springs , New York , to promote the serious study of separatism , secession and self - determination in North America .
The Institute publishes scholarly papers on the subject of secession and hosts an annual convention where representatives from the thirty - odd secessionist groups in North America get together to give progress reports to each other .
The Institute also encourages observers to attend and it was in that capacity that I listened to the presentations .
On the long flights from Seattle to Manchester , I could n't help but wonder what I would find , perhaps a room full of looney - tune characters or ranting , wild - eyed radicals .
I found neither .
What I did find was a group of serious men and women concerned about the direction the United States was going at home and abroad .
Law professors were in attendance as well as scholars from several disciplines .
Many were there because of an interest in the subject and to assess the feasibility of secession .
Those representing secessionist groups came from Texas , New England , the Deep South , Alaska , Hawaii and other locales across the continent .
What was striking was the political diversity .
Liberal progressives , libertarians , and paleoconservatives were in abundance , all drawn together by what they perceived as a federal government running amok while centralizing its power , a government that is corruptly serving the interests of large corporations and other powerful groups at the expense of the people , a government leading the nation into empire building with the resultant endless wars and economic crises , a government that has obligated Americans to pay nearly $ 100 trillion of unfunded liabilities , and a government that finds it increasingly impossible to recognize and allow regional differences in culture , economies , values and lifestyle .
In short , they spoke of a government that has no moral authority .
Despite their political differences on many issues , they believed that it was no longer merely a case of Left versus Right , but rather , a case of all versus the Empire .
They advocated that secession be placed on the national political agenda , and that , ultimately , the United States must be and will be dissolved into individual states or regions of states that will become independent republics better serving their citizens through smaller central governments closer to home .
Each republic could then determine for itself the nature of its government , whether statist or minimalist , progressive or conservative .
If a person did n't like how their republic governed .
they could emigrate to another area more to their liking , as thousands of African - Americans did when they moved North after the Civil War .
No one seemed to believe that any of this would happen soon .
But they thought the time would come when an increasingly oppressive and corrupt federal government would make secession a desirable alternative .
The secessionist groups did not promote violence , believing that several regions deciding to secede at the same time with the recognition of many of the world 's nations could be negotiated and peacefully accomplished .
The many hours on the return home allowed me to contemplate all that I heard .
While I remain uncertain of secession 's eventual triumph , I could n't help but recall the words of the renowned anthropologist , Margaret Mead , ' Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful , committed citizens can change the world .
Indeed , it is the only thing that ever has . '
Barack Obama clearly intends to get things done in Washington , said Chris Cillizza in The Washington Post online .
That much was clear when he picked the first high - level member of his administration —
Ill. Rep. Rahm Emanuel , who will be Obama 's chief of staff .
Emanuel has a hard - nosed reputation , but he's the " ultimate political pragmatist " and understands that " reaching across the aisle for Republican support is absolutely essential to Obama 's political brand . "
Obama talks a lot about bipartisanship , said Pejman Yousefzadeh in RedState .
But choosing a Democratic attack dog like Rahm Emanuel as chief of staff " does n't remotely " match Obama 's words .
" No amount of rhetorical eloquence " can cover up the fact that Obama is " not the Messiah " after all — " he's just another politician . "
Emanuel " is a brawler , " said Ezra Klein in the American Prospect online , so this appointment is bound to be disheartening to anybody who hoped that " the Obama administration would be all about bringing people together " by saying please .
But picking Emanuel , a veteran of the Clinton administration , " suggests Obama is taking the politics of congressional persuasion extremely seriously , and in that sense , it 's heartening . "
TIJUANA , Mexico 
The sedated patient , his bullet wounds still fresh from a shootout the night before , was lying on a gurney in the intensive care unit of a prestigious private hospital here late last month with intravenous fluids dripping into his arm .
Suddenly , steel - faced gunmen barged in and filled him with even more bullets .
This time , he was dead for sure .
Hit men pursuing rivals into intensive care units and emergency rooms .
Shootouts in lobbies and corridors .
Doctors kidnapped and held for ransom , or threatened with death if a wounded gunman dies under their care .
With alarming speed , Mexico ’s violent drug war is finding its way into the seeming sanctuary of the nation ’s hospitals , shaking the health care system and leaving workers fearing for their lives while trying to save the lives of others .
“ Remember that hospital scene from ‘ The Godfather ? ’ ” asked Dr. Héctor Rico , an otolaryngologist here , speaking about the part in which Michael Corleone saves his hospitalized father from a hit squad .
“ That ’s how we live . ”
An explosion of violence connected with Mexico ’s powerful drug cartels has left more than 5,000 people dead so far this year , nearly twice the figure from the year before , according to unofficial tallies by Mexican newspapers .
The border region of the United States and Mexico , critical to the cartels ’ trafficking operation , has been the most violent turf of all , with 60 percent of all killings in the country last month occurring in the states of Chihuahua and Baja California , the government says .
And it has raised fears that violence could spill across the border , because dozens of victims of drug violence have been treated at an El Paso hospital in the last year .
There is probably no easy way to combat ageing Diets and creams claiming their antioxidant properties could cheat ageing may be worthless , a study says .
Using Nematode worms , scientists found even those given enhanced antioxidant powers to deal with tissue damaging " free radicals " did not live longer .
The team from University College London said , in the Genes and Development journal , there was " no clear evidence " they could slow ageing .
Antioxidants are a staple of the beauty and health industries .
This has been based on a 50 - year - old theory .
The free radical theory has filled a knowledge vacuum for over 50 years now , but it does n't stand up to the evidence
Dr David Gems
UCL
In 1956 , it was suggested that ageing was caused by a build - up of molecular damage caused by reactive forms of oxygen , called superoxides or free radicals , circulating in the body .
This is known as oxidative stress .
Antioxidants supposedly worked to mop up these free radicals , minimising their damage .
This week 's study , however , could explain why many studies aimed at proving the theory have been inconclusive .
Nematode worms
The tiny Nematode worm , despite appearing to be far - removed from the human species , is a useful tool for scientists who want to explore how our bodies work .
They share many genes with humans , and , crucially , have a lifespan measured in days , which allows scientists to get clues about long - term changes .
The UCL team , led by Dr David Gems , genetically manipulated nematodes so that their bodies were able to " mop up " surplus free radicals .
This in theory , should give them an advantage over normal nematodes in terms of ageing and lifespan .
However , these worms lived just as long as the others , suggesting that " oxidative stress " is less of a factor in the ageing of our cells and tissues as some have suggested .
Dr Gems said : " The fact is that we do n't understand much about the fundamental mechanisms of ageing - the free radical theory has filled a knowledge vacuum for over 50 years now , but it does n't stand up to the evidence .
" It is clear that if superoxide is involved , it plays only a small part in the story - oxidative damage is clearly not a universal , major driver of the ageing process . "
He said a healthy , balanced diet was important for reducing the risk of many " old age " diseases , such as cancer , diabetes and osteoporosis , but there was no clear evidence that eating antioxidants could slow or prevent ageing , and even less evidence to support the claims made by antioxidant pills and creams .
' No magic bullet '
The research was supported by the Wellcome Trust , and Dr Alan Schafer , its head of molecular and physiological sciences , said : " Research such as this points to how much we have to learn about ageing , and the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind this process . "
A spokesman for the British Dietetic Association said that it had been hard to find the evidence to support antioxidants from previous studies .
She said : " All the evidence has come from epidemiological studies looking at the whole diet - where there was some sign of benefit to people who ate diets with antioxidants , but also who ate lots of other good things .
" What this shows is that there is likely to be no one ' magic bullet ' in terms of diet and health - the important thing is still achieving a healthy balance . "
A spokesman for the Cosmetic Toiletry and Perfumery Association said cosmetic companies carry out extensive research and rigorous scientific studies to ensure claims are supported by robust evidence .
" Findings on the genetics of a particular nematode worm may not be directly relevant to the complex process of ageing as it happens in higher animals such as the human , " the association added .
Pamela Mason , of the Health Supplements Information Service , said : " Antioxidant vitamins , like any other vitamins were never intended for the prevention of chronic disease and mortality .
They are not magic bullets .
" They are intended for health maintenance on the basis of their various physiological roles in the body and in the case of the antioxidant vitamins , this does , in appropriate amounts , include a protective antioxidant effect in the bodys tissues . "

Inquisitive Dave
Help
Dave find items and figure out how to use them in this odd adventure game .
Use the WASD or arrow keys to move .
Use CTRL or space bar to inspect objects .
I will reluctantly admit it : I sort of like vi .
It is a grudging like , for vi is not my favorite editor and it has its weaknesses , but still , there are things about vi that I keep finding cool and nice and attractive .
One significant reason is vi's regularity and what I will call ' composability ' .
( Let me note that by ' vi ' I mean the entire vi family . )
To make up terminology , vi more or less has two sorts of commands : commands that change the text ( call them ' action commands ' ) , and commands that move the cursor ( movement commands ) .
Vi's regularity and composability is that pretty much every action command can be used with pretty much any movement command to specify what to operate on .
Once you learn this and it really sinks in ( which took a while in my case ) , what you get is an immense amount of leverage for your vi knowledge .
If you know a navigation trick , you can extend it to select text for action commands .
When you master a new movement command , all of your action commands also get more powerful ; when you master a new action command , all of your movement commands get more useful .
When you learn something new , it does n't just add to your abilities , it multiplies them in a virtuous feedback loop .
( I think that this is a great way of growing people 's expertise and rewarding them for it .
Unfortunately it is hard to copy in other contexts . )
This interacts nicely with another reason I like vi : its support for pipes , specifically piping text through commands .
Pragmatically , this means that I can extend vi ( in some ways ) by writing shell scripts and hooking it to specialized superintelligent programs like par .
Since piping is just another action command , it takes all of the usual movement commands for text selection .
As a side note , this composability also gives you little things to figure out and learn all the time .
Even if you 're not learning new movement and action commands , you can always see if you can come up with anything useful to do with a combination you have n't tried before .
( Since this experimentation gives you a stream of little rewards for playing around with vi , it is perhaps no wonder that people wind up loving it . )
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- --
With six weeks before taking office , President - elect Barack Obama is having one heck of a honeymoon , a new national poll suggests .
A new CNN poll gives Barack Obama a 79 percent approval rating in the way he 's handling the transition .
Nearly eight in 10 Americans questioned in a CNN / Opinion Research Corporation survey out Tuesday morning are giving the president - elect the thumbs up when it comes to his handling of the transition .
Seventy - nine percent approve of Obama 's performance so far during transition , with 18 percent disapproving .
Obama 's approval rating is 14 points higher than the approval rating for President - elect George Bush in 2001 and 17 points higher than President - elect Clinton 's rating in 1992 , CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said .
Obama 's current approval rating is also more than 50 points higher than President Bush 's current approval rating , which now stands at 28 percent --- with 71 percent disapproving of the way Bush is handling his job as president .
" An Obama job approval rating of 79 percent -- that 's the sort of rating you see when the public rallies around a leader after a national disaster , " said Bill Schneider , CNN 's senior political analyst .
" To many Americans , the Bush administration was a national disaster . "
iReport.com : Dear Mr. President ...
The poll indicates that 79 percent of the public thinks Obama will do a good job as president -- up 4 percentage points from last month .
Eighteen percent think Obama will do a poor job as president , down 3 points from November .
And 78 percent of those questioned said they believe Obama will be a uniter -- 20 points higher than those who felt the same way about then President - elect Bush in 2000 .
Twenty percent say Obama will be a divider , 16 points lower than those who said the same about Bush .
" Bush came in promising to be a uniter , not a divider .
That 's a promise Bush failed to deliver -- as he himself acknowledged last week in an interview with ABC News when he said that one of his big disappointments is that the tone in Washington got worse rather than better , " Schneider said .
" Nearly 80 percent describe Obama as a uniter .
So far , so good . "
Seventy - six percent of those polled have a favorable opinion of Obama .
" And the president - elect is not the only one who is popular right now .
Sixty - seven percent have a favorable view of Michelle Obama and 56 percent have a positive view of Vice President - elect Joe Biden , " added Holland .
The Democratic party continues to be much more popular than the GOP .
Six in 10 have a favorable view of the Democratic Party , while a majority have an unfavorable opinion of the Republican party .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted December 1 - 2 , with 1,096 adult Americans interviewed by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is 3 percentage points .

Andy Burnham says people need help navigating the internet Film - style age ratings could be applied to websites to protect children from harmful and offensive material , Culture Secretary Andy Burnham has said .
Mr Burnham said the government was looking at a number of possible new internet safeguards .
He said some content , such as clips of beheadings , was unacceptable and new standards of decency were needed .
He also plans to negotiate with the US on drawing up international rules for English language websites .
Mr Burnham , a father of three young children , believes internet service providers should offer child - friendly web access .
' Clearer signposting '
He told the BBC : " The internet is becoming a more and more pervasive entity in all our lives and yet the content standards online are not as clear as we 've all been used in traditional media .
" I think we do need to have a debate now about clearer signposting and labelling online because it can be quite a confusing world , particularly for parents who are trying to ensure their children are only accessing appropriate stuff . "
Mr Burnham 's plans are likely to anger those who advocate the freedom of the worldwide web .
He insisted he was not trying to curb free speech , but wanted to protect the public from " unacceptable " material .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" It 's not about banning or stopping people having that freedom of expression , " he said .
" It 's simply about clearer signposting , more information , so people know where they 're working . "
John Carr , secretary of the UK Children 's Charities ' Coalition for Internet Safety , said other countries were looking at similar measures .
" Nobody would deny there are enormous practical problems , " he told the BBC .
" There is n't a body , an obvious body , that could do this type of classification here in the UK at the moment , but it 's definitely an aspiration that many governments across the world are now reaching to . "
Concerns over children 's safety on the internet have already led to calls from the NSPCC for computer manufacturers and retailers to install security to stop children finding violent or sexual content .
A poll carried out by the children 's charity in October suggested three out of four children had been disturbed by images they had seen on the internet .
In July this year , the Commons culture , media and sport select committee criticised video - sharing website YouTube , saying it needed to do more to vet its content .
At the time , Google , the firm which owns YouTube , stressed the site had strict rules and a system that allowed users to report inappropriate content .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This suggestion has obviously been made by somebody who knows nothing about how the internet works Brendan , Birmingham , UK Prominent warnings Diana Sutton , head of policy and public affairs at the NSPCC , told the BBC News website she welcomed Mr Burnham 's suggestions , but there were issues around how they would work .
" It 's one thing to have a political commitment , but it 's much harder to actually enforce it , " she said .
" We want these ideas to have teeth .
" And these mechanisms on their own are n't enough .
They 've got to be combined with greater parental awareness .
Most parents have no clue what their children are up to online . "
She said warnings about content , such as on social networking websites , must be displayed more prominently .
" What I think is missing from these proposals is that it 's not just about what sites children might see , it 's about who they might meet online , " she added .
A spokesman for internet service provider BT said the company would need to see the details of Mr Burnham 's plan before making any further comment .
In Saturday 's wide - ranging newspaper interview , Mr Burnham also suggested he would allocate money raised from the BBC 's commercial activities to fund other broadcasters , such as Channel Four .
On the future of the licence fee , he said : " Top - slicing the licence fee [ to fund other broadcasters ] is an option that is going to have to remain on the table . "
But he added : '' I have to say it is not the option that I instinctively reach for first .
I think there are other avenues to be explored . "

We do n't expect much from album covers .
Wear something revealing if you 're a pop starlet .
If you 're Prince , just make sure to wear something .
If your album 's called The Wall , maybe sketch some bricks on there .
Honestly , our expectations could n't be any lower .
Which is why it 's so baffling that we get album covers like : Advertisement
15 Guns n' Roses - Appetite for Destruction
The cover art for a band 's debut album is especially important .
It has to express what your music sounds like to people who have never heard of you .
And while we can't speak from a place of experience , we do n't imagine that violent robot rape is quite as melodious as " Sweet Child O' Mine . "

Unluckily for Axl , this is apparently what the music sounds like inside his head .
14 Birth Control - Operation
Feeding infants to a giant insect is n't an effective form of birth control , primarily because , you know , you 've already given birth .
But even if it were available on the consumer market we 're pretty sure it would n't be enough to get the Pope to change his stance .

13 Boned - Up at the Crack Well Boned , we probably should n't be surprised at this point .
When your song titles include such gems as " Drain the Main Vein , " " Ain't No Talkin ' With Your Mouth Full " and " Tails Up Heads Down " you 've pretty much beaten subtlety to death , looted the corpse , tossed it in the Brooklyn river and then watched an episode of Law and Order based on the crime .
12 The Scorpions - Lovedrive Continue Reading Below Advertisement
This is the album cover equivalent of a bad political cartoon that nobody quite understands .
What does any of this have to do with being rocked like a hurricane ?
We 've always defined lovedriving as an act occurring between two consenting adults behind a beaded curtain .
Scorpion 's definition apparently involves Bubble Yum , an expensive car and a nonplussed society lady .
NEW YORK , June 27 ( Reuters ) -
The cost and lead time involved in acquiring new equipment are among the impediments to raising coal production in the United States , a coal company executive said on Friday .
The cost of both machines and supplies has risen sharply , and manufacturers need lead times of as much as 36 months to deliver equipment , said Paul Vining , CEO of Magnum Coal .
“ The price of poker has gone up , ” Vining told the 2008 McCloskey Coal USA conference .
U.S. coal producers are trying to increase production because export demand is skyrocketing due to the Asian economic boom and delivery problems in producing countries .
So far , although exports are up sharply , total output is up only modestly , analysts said .
For example , the cost of roof bolts , the long rods driven into mine ceilings to secure tunnels , has risen 60 to 80 percent in three years due to higher steel prices , Vining said .
Tires , explosives and other supplies are in short supply and more costly , he said .
As for lead time , it takes 18 to 24 months to get a new mining machine and up to 36 months to get a big coal - hauling truck .
Even tunnel tram cars take 15 months , he said .
The equipment and supply issues come atop tighter government safety and environmental regulation , a shortage of qualified labor and declining reserves , Vining said .
He said productivity in the key Central Appalachian area -- the amount of coal produced per worker -- is down 15 percent in the past three years due to the various challenges .
( Reporting by Bruce Nichols ; editing by Jim Marshall )
Last month fishermen in the icy Ross Sea encountered a deep - sea giant .
Almost 20 feet ( 6 meters ) long , with spiked tentacles and huge , protruding eyes , it was feeding on Patagonian toothfish caught on longlines set by the fishermen .
The creature was hauled aboard and taken to New Zealand for analysis .
This confirmed the encounter as the first live sighting of a colossal squid .
Usually called Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni , scientists who examined the Ross Sea specimen coined the term " colossal squid " to distinguish it from giant squid ( Architeuthis ) .
They say the species is the biggest and most fearsome squid known to science and could grow to 40 feet ( 12 meters ) in length — longer than a whale .
Thought to be only the second intact example ever recovered , the massive cephalopod was armed with two huge beaks and rotating hooks along its tentacles .
This latest find has revived interest in sea monster legends of old .
Could it be such monsters really existed , and still exist today ?
Scientists who identified the Ross Sea squid have fueled such speculation .
New Zealand squid expert Steve O'Shea , from Auckland University of Technology , has described the squid as " a true monster . "
He told the BBC : " Giant squid is no longer the largest squid that 's out there .
We 've got something that 's even larger , and not just larger but an order of magnitude meaner . "
Auckland University of Technology research associate Kat Bolstad , also talking to the BBC , added : " This animal , armed as it is with the hooks and the beak that it has , not only is colossal in size but is going to be a phenomenal predator and something you are not going to want to meet in the water . "
Other scientists dismiss such claims .
Richard Ellis , author and research associate at the American Museum of Natural History , said the colossal squid " is no more a monster than Architeuthis is . "
He added : " I wrote The Search for the Giant Squid to try and dispel some of the crazy ideas that this cephalopod is in any way dangerous to humans , and the same holds true for Mesonychoteuthis . "
Sea Monsters
Some of the earliest tales about huge , tentacled sea monsters date back to the 12th century when Norwegian seafarers described an awesome beast called a Kraken .
By the 18th century the Kraken still had a fearsome reputation .
In The Natural History of Norway , the Bishop of Bergen likened it to a " floating island , " adding , " It seems these are the creature 's arms , and , it is said , if they were to lay hold of the largest man - of - war [ a ship ] , they would pull it down to the bottom . "
Over time the reputed size of these " monsters " was scaled down considerably , but stories persisted .
An alleged encounter between a giant squid and a French naval vessel was the basis for Jules Verne 's " squid of colossal dimensions " which was featured in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea .
There is also an account of sailors being attacked by a giant squid after their ship sunk during the Second World War .
At least one sailor was supposedly eaten .
And even this year , French yachtsmen taking part in the appropriately named Jules Verne Trophy reported that a 26 - foot - long ( 8 - meter ) squid clamped itself to their boat .
An early description of what is thought to be Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni appeared in an article entitled Hunting Sea Monsters in 1953 .
It was , Gilbert Voss wrote , " a squid that could qualify in the most lurid deep - sea drama . "
There is some truth to this observation .
Whalers who once worked the southern oceans were well aware of " deep - sea dramas " played out between colossal squid and sperm whales which fed in Antarctic waters .
The whalers often discovered giant squid beaks inside the stomachs of these whales .
Professor Paul Rodhouse , head of biological sciences at the British Antarctic Survey , says whalers also noted deep scars and circular marks around the heads of their quarry .
" It 's certain these were caused by the suckers and hooks of big squid , " he said .
" The whales would suffer quite a lot of damage in subduing Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni . "
Whale Stories
However , Rodhouse is quick to scotch stories about such squid killing and even eating sperm whales .
" Whalers could see the damage these squid caused so it was well known what was going on , but the stories got elaborated and expanded on , " he said .
" The only sperm whales that go into Antarctic waters to feed on these creatures are the large bulls .
These are very powerful predators and my guess is they would be able to capture even the biggest squid . "
Richard Ellis also believes such stories have been blown out of proportion .
" This creature , like Architeuthis , is probably a deep - water dweller , " he said .
" What earthly — or oceanic — reason would a squid have for attacking a ship ?
I think both these squid are fish - eaters .
The long tentacles of Architeuthis and the hooks of Mesonychoteuthis support this contention , and do not indicate any predilection to attack whales , people or ships . "
Rodhouse is more concerned about the colossal squid than the fate of humans who may encounter one .
In particular , he is worried about the recent influx of fishing vessels into Antarctic waters that target Patagonian toothfish .
He says the fish is a major prey species for colossal squid .
" The fish can grow to over 2 meters ( 6 feet ) but it 's being overfished in many parts of the southern ocean , " he said .
" Toothfish and these squid form part of a deep water ecosystem that we know virtually nothing about — yet were are already exploiting it with commercial fisheries . "

Opera
09 Oct 2008
Finally , I can announce my big news , that I ’ve keeping quiet about for what seems like ages .
From the end of this month , I will be Senior Designer at Opera Software !
Like fellow UK members of the Opera team Chris Mills , Bruce Lawson and Henny Swann I ’ll be working remotely .
Opera has been a browser vendor whose ideals and feature list I ’ve applauded , but whose Mac interface design I ’ve been , well , critical of to be honest .
Now I ’ve got a chance to ‘ put my money where my mouth is ’.
I ’ll primarily be responsible for Opera desktop , Widgets and Mobile / Mini browsers , but general design too .
I ’ll hopefully get to implement the ideas I have for the logo and branding too .
I ca n’t wait to get my teeth into it !
My ego would love to say that I was ‘ head - hunted ’ for the job , but that was n’t the case .
Neither was the business failing - forcing me to look for a job .
I was doing more work than ever .
I simply saw the job advert , and an opportunity to do the kind of work that I really wanted to do , so I took it !
I went up to Oslo in early August , and found them open , flexible , and jolly lovely fellows to talk to , with exciting projects .
After all getting to work full - time on a browser ?
It ’s a dream !
Finally , some folks might be wondering what ’s happening to Hicksdesign as a company ?
Without going into too much detail , it ’s still here .
While I ’m full - time with Opera , Leigh will continue to steer the ship - she tells me that she ’ll be recruiting a replacement for me soon ( as well as building up Hicksmade ) .
I ’ll be what is possibly called a sleeping partner . ;o )
For posterity , this news has been covered on :
' What an ideology is , is a conceptual framework with the way people deal with reality , " Alan Greenspan told the Congressional House oversight and government reform committee on 23 October .
" Everyone has one .
You have to - to exist , you need an ideology .
The question is whether it is accurate or not . "
As the former chairman of the Federal Reserve , from 1987 to 2006 , Greenspan stood at the helm of US monetary policy during the time conditions for the current meltdown were being created .
" And what I 'm saying to you , " he continued , " is , yes , I found a flaw .
I do n't know how significant or permanent it is , but I 've been very distressed by that fact ... [ I found a ] flaw in the model that I perceived is the critical functioning structure that defines how the world works . "
Greenspan 's ideology was unfettered , free - market capitalism .
Its understanding of how the world works was rooted in self - interest .
It was a value system that placed the private before the public , the individual before the collective , and the wealth of the few before the welfare of the many .
So pervasive was this worldview that , after a while , it was not even understood to be a view at all .
It was just the hard - nosed reality against which only lunatics and leftists raged .
" Unlike many economists , " Bob Woodward wrote of Alan Greenspan in his book Maestro ( the title speaks volumes ) , " he has never been rule driven or theory driven .
The data drive . "
They drove a sleek black limousine over the edge of a steep cliff .
And since the invisible hand of the market ostensibly guided everything , there was no one who could really be held accountable or responsible for anything .
The buck did n't stop anywhere .
Indeed , for those who were already wealthy , the bucks just kept rolling in .
But the flaw in Greenspan 's ideology did not just govern finance - it infected all spheres of human relations , including politics .
" This process has become a great deal about money .
A lot of money , " said Tom Vilsack ( whom Barack Obama has just picked as his agriculture secretary ) , as he withdrew from the Democratic primaries almost a full year before a vote had been cast .
" So it is money , and only money , that is the reason why we are leaving today . "
A poll released by Judicial Watch the day before Greenspan testified revealed that almost two - thirds of Americans " strongly agree " with the statement that political corruption played a big role in the US 's recent financial crisis .
A further 19 % said they " somewhat agree " .
The two most prominent scandals in recent weeks illustrate how the line between what is unethical and what is illegal in politics , and what is reckless and what is fraudulent in finance , has been so blurred as to have erased much in the way of meaningful distinction .
Credibility in public life , like Greenspan 's ideology and the stock prices it relied on , is in freefall .
The first scandal is the demise of Bernard Madoff , who was arrested after he confessed to defrauding investors of about $ 50bn in an elaborate , global Ponzi scheme .
Madoff 's alleged transgression went beyond just the financial .
A pillar of the Jewish and financial communities , he traded on trust .
" In an era of faceless organisations owned by other equally faceless organisations , " said his firm 's website .
" Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities LLC harks back to an earlier era in the financial world : the owner 's name is on the door . "
Investors had to be recommended by friends - the exclusivity made it attractive - and the returns were constantly excellent .
Madoff paid out about 15 % a year , regardless of what the market was doing .
In Palm Beach , Florida , people joined the Country Club and the golf club just so they could meet him .
They virtually begged him to take their money .
The roll call of the swindled is illustrious : Steven Spielberg , Jeffrey Katzenberg , author and humanitarian Elie Wiesel , New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberg , and the New York Daily News ' publisher , Mortimer Zuckerman .
It was as though America 's rich and famous had succumbed to a huge online scam .
The level of returns seemed too good to be true , and it was .
But the sense of entitlement the wealthy have to even more wealth is just too entrenched to bother with truth .
In a heartbeat , generations of savings and entire charities have been extinguished .
The second scandal concerns the foul - mouthed Democratic governor of Illinois , Rod Blagojevich , who has the right to appoint a successor to the Senate seat left vacant by Obama .
He was arrested after federal wiretaps allegedly revealed he was poised to sell the seat to the highest bidder .
The day after the election , as at least half of the nation basked in the warm glow of Obama 's victory , Blagojevich , it seems , was trying to line his pockets .
He told one aide : " I 've got this thing and it 's fucking golden , and , uh , uh , I 'm just not giving it up for fucking nothing .
I 'm not gonna do it . "
Suggestions that both men must have been seized by psychological disorders do not seem outlandish .
Particularly Blagojevich , who has been under at least a dozen federal investigations since 2005 and knew he was being wiretapped .
But far more worrying is the greater likelihood that they are entirely sane and rational .
Blagojevich may be crude and sociopathic , and Madoff socially manipulative .
Their actions may have violated the letter of the law .
But they were consistent with the spirit of the ideology that has governed American life for at least a generation .
Blagojevich did not invent the notion that wealth and political influence go hand in hand .
Had he been more patient , the lobbying deals and board memberships that routinely come after political office would have come his way .
And anyone seeking a seat would have to show they could pay their way .
Indeed , the New York governor , David Patterson , seems set to hand over Hillary Clinton 's Senate seat to Caroline Kennedy at least in part because Kennedy can raise vast sums of money for a run in 2010 .
Unlike Blagojevich , Patterson is not looking to benefit from it personally .
But no one is expecting him to end up in the poorhouse when his term is done .
As for Madoff , if the Securities and Exchange Commission , the financial services watchdog , had been doing its job , it could have prevented him from committing this crime .
But if he had done it by the book , an analogous situation could have occurred that would have left his investors almost as broke .
His fraud was exposed after some investors sought to withdraw more capital than he could produce .
That is essentially the same as the bank runs we have seen over the last few months .
But while Madoff is under house arrest , the bankers are about to reap huge bonuses .
When a political system where you have to pay to play meets a financial system run like a giant Ponzi scheme , widespread criminality , corruption and calamity are the only feasible outcomes .
The only remaining questions then are what society is prepared to excuse , accountants are able to write off or lawyers are able to defend .
" It is easier to rob by setting up a bank , " argued the German playwright Bertolt Brecht , " than by holding up a bank clerk . "

The Royal London Hospital is among the three hit by the computer bug
Three London hospitals have been forced to shut down their entire computer systems for at least 24 hours after being hit by a virus .
St Bartholomew's ( Barts ) in the City , the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel and The London Chest Hospital in Bethnal Green are affected .
A spokesman said well - rehearsed emergency procedures were in place .
Theatres and outpatient departments had remained operational , and patients with appointments were still being seen .
The spokesman said walk - in patients were being accepted at accident and emergency , and processed using manual back - up systems .
But ambulances were being diverted to neighbouring hospitals to ensure that seriously ill patients did not suffer as a result of the slower manual systems being used .
The patient transport system used by elderly or disabled patients to attend routine appointments has also been disrupted .
The spokesman said the virus was " not malicious " , and the infection was " self - contained " .
As a customary international law ( albeit one that has fallen out of use since the decline of traditional piracy ) it cuts through the Gordian knot of individual states ’ engagement rules .
Pirates are not ordinary criminals .
They are not enemy combatants .
They are a hybrid , recognized as such for thousands of years , and can be seized at will by anyone , at any time , anywhere they are found .
And what of the Emden ’s problem ?
Are pirates a species of terrorist ?
In short , yes .
The same definition of pirates as hostis humani generis could also be applied to international organized terrorism .
Both crimes involve bands of brigands that divorce themselves from their nation - states and form extraterritorial enclaves ; both aim at civilians ; both involve acts of homicide and destruction , as the United Nations Convention on the High Seas stipulates , “ for private ends . ”
For this reason , it seems sensible that the United States and the international community adopt a new , shared legal definition that would recognize the link between piracy and terrorism .
This could take the form of an act of Congress or , more broadly , a new jurisdiction for piracy and terrorism cases at the International Criminal Court .
There is ample precedent .
In the 1970s , the hijacking of airliners was defined by the United Nations as “ aerial piracy . ”
In 1985 , when Palestinian terrorists seized the cruise ship Achille Lauro and held its passengers hostage , President Ronald Reagan called the hijackers “ pirates . ”
Recent evidence also indicates that the Somali pirates hand over a part of their millions in ransom money to Al Shabaab , the Somali rebel group that has been linked to Al Qaeda .
The similarities and overlaps between the two crimes have prompted some jurists to advocate abandoning the term piracy altogether in favor of “ maritime terrorism . ”
By reasserting the traditional definition of pirates as hostis humani generis , and linking it to terrorism , the United States and other nations will not only gain a powerful tool in fighting the Somali pirates , but other incidents of terrorism around the world as well .
Recognizing piracy as an international crime will do something else :
It will give individual states that do n’t want to prosecute pirates an alternative  the international court .
If pirates are recognized under their traditional international legal status  as neither ordinary criminals nor combatants , but enemies of the human race  states will have a much freer hand in capturing them .
If piracy falls within the jurisdiction of the international court , states will not need to shoulder the burden of prosecution alone .
Formula one teams are set to demand a bigger share of the sport 's revenues after growing alarmed at the amount of interest being paid by its owners to service $ 5 bn ( £ 3.2 bn ) in debts .
Teams are resisting efforts by the FIA , motorsport 's governing body , to force them into a series of controversial cost - cutting measures .
The first steps in the FIA 's plan came last week when tenders closed for the standard - engine contract , the cornerstone of the thrift programme .
Analysis of accounts for the 12 months to last December of formula one 's holding company , Delta3 ( UK ) , shows that CVC Capital , which bought the sport from a consortium of banks two years ago , loaded more than $ 2.4bn of bank loans on to it during the leveraged buyout .
In addition to these were almost $ 2.6 bn of loans from CVC , although the private equity firm insists it will not enforce repayment of this debt since it acts only as a standard tax - reduction mechanism .
Paying the loans cost Delta3 $ 229.6 m in interest last year - equivalent to almost half the central distribution to the constructors - a fact that has dismayed teams , who five years ago threatened to break away from the sport .
" There is anger felt from many teams , " said one insider at the Formula One Teams Association ( Fota ) .
" We have had banks , oil companies , financial institutions and pharmaceutical companies with us as sponsors .
We have raised this money .
Why do we have to keep cutting costs ?
The sport earns a lot of money so let 's look at our share . "
Last year the paper losses were huge .
With loans " rolling up " interest - nearly $ 500 m had accrued in the 13 months since November 2006 - Delta3 made a loss after tax of $ 458 m on turnover of $ 938 m .
This prompted the accountants to acknowledge that Delta3 will only be a " going concern " if CVC continues to support it " to meet its liabilities " .
CVC , which has recently raised $ 20bn in funds that are committed for 10 years , insists it is a long - term investor .
CVC also points out that the constructors already receive a larger take than ever from central funds under the terms of the 2008 - 2012 commercial agreement .
The prize fund has doubled from $ 250 m a year .
That has added significantly to Delta 3's costs since the last available accounts .
The CVC director Nick Clarry said that despite the financial downturn the sport 's revenues this year have grown almost 40 % to $ 1.3bn , providing a comfortable margin for bank obligations to be met .
" There is a lot of headroom , " said Clarry .
" Our revenues need to go down $ 400 m before we have any pressure from the banks . "
CVC must repay the majority of the $ 2.4bn loans on expiry in 2014 but says they are being paid off ahead of schedule from " excess profits " formula one generates .
It currently has no available estimates of what Delta3 's 2008 profits will be .
Now the teams want to go back to the negotiating table with the sport 's commercial operators at Delta3 , led by formula one 's commercial rights holder , Bernie Ecclestone .
" What 's changed since [ 2006 ] is the teams have seen how much debt CVC has put on the sport , " said another Fota insider .
" We thought CVC 's interest was to get income from running the business but not to such an extent that the sport has to perform to its maximum ability for five or six years just to recover the debt .
This is why there is interest in new negotiations . "
Despite the increased revenues from the 2008 commercial memorandum , no formal contract has been concluded with the teams .
CVC is confident a new agreement will soon be reached , considering the obstacle to be the engineering minutiae of regulations .
Yet tensions remain .
" The logistical costs are so high now , " added one source .
" [ The championship ] used to be 12 races , then a maximum of 17 .
There used to be 80 % of the races in Europe and now 80 % are across Asia : the costs to the teams are much higher now . "
Ecclestone has sought more dates in more exotic locations due to the higher race fees received in places such as Bahrain and Singapore .
These have been pivotal in raising 2008 revenues .
But an equally controversial development is the FIA 's thrift programme .
Teams suspect that the ruling by Max Mosley 's FIA to introduce the cost cuts has been directed by Ecclestone and Delta3 .
Clarry said no pressure had been applied .

The Bank of England did not understand the severity of economic problems before the current financial crisis , its deputy governor says .
Sir John Gieve told the BBC that the Bank knew " crazy borrowing " was taking place and the price of houses and other assets was rising unsustainably .
But the Bank thought this problem was less serious than it turned out to be , he said in an interview for Panorama .
The Bank relies too much on interest rates to control the economy , he added .
Sir John , who will be stepping down next year , also sits on the Bank 's interest rate - setting committee .
In the interview with BBC business editor Robert Peston , he said interest rates were " a blunt instrument " , because they affected the whole economy .
There are some books ... which the taxpayer 's now holding , which clearly have a level of defaults in them
Sir John Gieve
' No recovery soon ' in bank credit Robert Peston 's blog " We need to develop some new instruments , which sit somewhere between interest rates , which affect the whole economy ... and individual supervision and regulation of individual banks , " he said .
" We need to develop something which bridges that gap and directly addresses the financial cycle and prevents the financial cycle and the credit cycle getting out of hand . "
Commercial future Sir John has specific responsibility for financial stability .
He was savaged when interrogated last autumn by the Treasury Select Committee for allegedly being insufficiently on top of the crisis at Northern Rock .
His colleagues regarded the attack as unfair .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It seems to me that the Bank of England does n't have much control over anything Steve , Blackburn
In his BBC interview , he cast doubt on whether the exchequer would get all of the money back that it has pumped into the banking sector .
" There are some books : Northern Rock , Bradford & Bingley , which the taxpayer 's now holding , which clearly have a level of defaults in them , [ I'm ] not quite sure how that will balance out against the residual of the capital , " he said .
" As for the more mainstream banks , yes I think they 've got a commercial future and I 'm sure that in time they will ... revive and start building and growing as commercial entities again . "
Meanwhile , the boss of Barclays bank tells the programme that consumers and companies will continue to find it difficult to access credit for the next one to two years .

Outgoing Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang
If Microsoft 's offer for Yahoo was wrong - headed , Yahoo's opposition to it was downright bone - headed .
It took until July , when Microsoft finally throws up its hands and walks away , for Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang to fumble a deal that would have rewarded shareholders with a payday that was three times what Yahoo shares were fetching at year - end .
Along the way , Yahoo flirts with Google - only to see any potential deal scuttled by antitrust regulators .
As 2009 approaches , Yahoo's chances of turning itself around look slim .
Where in the World is Nick Lachey ?
Has anyone seenlately ?
The last time we saw the former 98 Degrees singer was back in September when he co-hosted the Live with Regis and Kelly show .
The reason for our curiosity is because today is Nick 's 35th birthday .
Hopefully tomorrow we will have some great photos of him celebrating his ' b ' day with girlfriend and former MTV VJ Vanessa Minnillo , who is rarely photographed out in public .
One has to wonder if Lachey 's former wife Jessica Simpson is the reason for his need for privacy .
When the two were together , their union was open for the world to scrutinize on the MTV reality show Newlyweds : Nick and Jessica .

You ’d never know I ’ve been a fairly serious hobby photographer for the best part of the last 10 years , after the golden rule I broke this week .
Page one , chapter 1 , in the book of “ So you ’ve decided to take up photography ” is never , repeat NEVER take a new , untested bit of kit to a shoot you ca n’t afford to miss .
And yet that ’s exactly what I did when I attended my cousin ’s wedding with my less than one day old Canon G10 .
I knew from weeks of reading up on the much anticipated successor to the lineage of compacts , which upped the game among prosumer camera manufacturers , to expect mixed results .
I have been somewhat spoiled for the past 7 or 8 years by my Canon 300D ; the first sub -£ 1000 digital SLR on the market and still an amazing bit of kit .
But the 300D ’s awkward size and low battery life , small screen and plastic body , not to mention it ’s weight and insufferably long read / write compact flash lag time had put me off experimental creative photography long ago .
Even a hacked firmware patch to include hidden features turned off by Canon in the factory , but enabled on it ’s more expensive sister cameras , like the 350D and 10D , could n’t breath new life into a camera I ’ll always be grateful to , for teaching me the basics of manual photography , but never quite portable enough to “ just snap ” when I ’m out and about .
Apart from missing some great shots at my cousin ’s wedding , though lack of preparation , in the short time I ’ve had to adjust to the compact camera form factor , I ’ve already began to see why I found it so hard to find anyone critical of the G10 , in my research prior to purchase — and as I slip between writing this and trying out new things as I go , I ’m finding more reasons to be glad I own this very handy bit of kit all the time .
The Home Secretary 's fingerprints are missing , and being held by No2ID at an undisclosed location .
Earlier today , No2ID General Secretary Guy Herbert told The Register , a water glass thought to have Jacqui Smith 's fingerprints on it was ' borrowed ' from a Social Market Foundation event where Smith was speaking .
And , improbably enough , claiming that ID cards are on time and on budget .
The first ID cards are due to ship to foreign nationals in less than three weeks , but the Home Secretary 's dabs may be all over the country a little in advance of that .
If the glass turns out to contain genuine Jacqui Smith fingerprints .
" We have witnesses , " said Herbert when quizzed as to how he'd know that any fingerprints found on the glass were the real thing .
And on the other hand ( as it were ... ) , it seems unlikely that the Home Office will find itself able to prove that any prints are n't genuine , without fingerprinting the Home Secretary .
Earlier this year No2ID offered a reward of £ 1,000 , to be paid to the finder 's favourite charity - for the fingerprints of Jacqui Smith and Gordon Brown , so Brown 's still up for dabs .
Once the group has fingerprints , it intends to make them public , as the Chaos Computer Club did with the fingerprints of German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schauble .
The venue of Smith 's speech today was kept secret until the last minute for reasons of security - and possibly demo dodging .
But unless Smith was prepared to wear gloves for the rest of her life , or to be followed around by a duster - armed security squad , it was inevitable that she would one day be fingered .
And Gordon Brown 's days , too , must be numbered .
According to Herbert the glass will be returned once No2ID has had its wicked way with it .
" We would n't want to be doing anything illegal , " he assured The Register . ®
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
Those eager to put 2008 behind them will have to hold their good - byes for just a moment this New Year ’s Eve .

The world ’s official timekeepers have added a “ leap second ” to the last day of the year on Wednesday , to help match clocks to the Earth ’s slowing spin on its axis , which takes place at ever - changing rates affected by tides and other factors .
The U.S. Naval Observatory , keeper of the Pentagon ’s master clock , said it would add the extra second on Wednesday in coordination with the world ’s atomic clocks at 23 hours , 59 minutes and 59 seconds Coordinated Universal Time , or UTC .
That corresponds to 6:59:59 p.m. EST ( 23:59:59 GMT ) , when an extra second will tick by -- the 24th to be added to UTC since 1972 , when the practice began .
UTC is the time scale kept by highly precise atomic clocks around the world , accurate to about a billionth of a second per day , the Naval Observatory says .
For those with a need for precision timing , it has replaced Greenwich Mean Time , or GMT .
The decision to add or remove a second is the responsibility of the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service , based on its monitoring of the Earth ’s rotation .
The goal is to make sure clocks vary from the Earth ’s rotational time by no more than 0.9 seconds before an adjustment .
That keeps UTC in sync with the position of the sun above the Earth .
Mechanisms such as the Internet - based Network Time Protocol and the satellite - based Global Positioning System depend on precision timing .
The first leap second was introduced into UTC on June 30 , 1972 .
The last was added on December 31 , 2005 .
They have been added at intervals ranging from six months to seven years , Daniel Gambis , head of the IERS Earth Orientation Center at the Observatoire de Paris , wrote in an explanatory piece this month ( hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/ ) .
Among the reasons for Earth ’s slowing whirl on its axis are the braking action of tides , snow or the lack of it at the polar ice caps , solar wind , space dust and magnetic storms , according to the U.S. Commerce Department ’s National Institute of Standards and Technology , another timekeeper .
By contrast , a leap day , February 29 , occurs once every four years because a complete turn around the sun -- our year with all its seasons -- takes about 365 days and six hours .
In 1970 , an international agreement established two time scales : one based on the Earth ’s rotation and another on highly accurate atomic clocks .
The U.S. Naval Observatory ’s master clock is based on a system that now includes 50 atomic clocks , 36 based on the element cesium and 14 known as hydrogen masers .
With the Earth ’s rotation gradually slowing , the periodic insertion of a leap second into the atomic time scale is needed to keep the two systems within a second of each other .
McMaster University in Canada has recently installed the most advanced and powerful electron microscope ever built , named Titan 80 - 300 , which is capable of unprecedented resolution .
The microscope ’s purposes include medical research and the examination of various products at the nano level in order to improve their efficiency .
The new microscope , installed in the Canadian Center for Electron Microscopy at McMaster University , expands the limits in which mankind could explore and research the closest bonds that materials consist of .
According to the university , the microscope will be used to help produce more efficient lighting and better solar cells .
Other intended subjects for study are proteins and drug - delivery materials used to target cancers .
Furthermore , it will assess atmospheric particulates and help create lighter and stronger automotive materials , more effective cosmetics , and higher density memory storage for faster electronic and telecommunication devices .
“ We are the first university in the world with a microscope of such a high caliber , ” says Gianluigi Botton , the Canadian Center ’s director and the project ’s leader .
“ The resolution of the Titan 80 - 300 Cubed microscope is remarkable , the equivalent of the Hubble Telescope looking at the atomic level instead of at stars and galaxies .
With this microscope we can now easily identify atoms , measure their chemical state and even probe the electrons that bind them together . ”
Since a regular microscope ’s results could be affected if somebody breathes heavily nearby , the Titan 80-300 requires even more precautionary measures .
Therefore , it is housed in a stable , specially designed facility able to withstand ultralow vibrations , low noise , and minute temperature fluctuations .
Operation of the instrument will also be done from a separate room to ensure results of the highest quality .
The microscope was built in the Netherlands by the FEI Company , and each microscope cost about $ 15 million .
The funding for the McMaster University Titan was provided by the Canada Foundation for Innovation , the Ontario Innovation Trust , the Ministry of Research and Innovation of Ontario , and the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Trade , through a partnership with FEI and McMaster University .
In order to demonstrate the impression the Titan 80-300 recently made on many visiting scientists , John Capone , Dean of Science at McMaster said : “ They were astounded by its capability , and by the fact that there is such support in this country for a venture of this magnitude ; we should be very proud that McMaster has taken the initiative to secure this facility .
There are many applications for it in life sciences .
This particular instrument will enable many new discoveries in the areas of fundamental biological and physical sciences that will help us to better understand the nature of diseases and the development of new cures . ”
Dean of engineering , David Wilkinson , speaks of other benefits that the Titan offers .
“ Its ability to probe the structure of solid materials to the atomic level will have an impact on the development and commercialization of new technologies from biomedical devices to water quality monitoring and improved energy storage systems , ” he said .
“ McMaster is committed to applying advanced research tools such as the Titan to the needs of our industrial partners , strengthening their ability to innovate and to compete globally . ”
Mo Elbestawi , McMaster ’s vice - president of research and international affairs , adds : “ The addition of the Titan 80 - 300 to the Center ’s suite of microscopy instruments that include a Titan cryo - in situ solidifies Ontario ’s and Canada ’s lead in nanotechnology , and places us among the world ’s most advanced materials research institutions . ”
TFOT has also covered the development of an ultra smooth mirror that could be used to create a revolutionary new atomic microscope within the next several years ; the Finchscope , a technology which may enable cheaper , faster , and more accurate three - dimensional imaging , and a new scanning , tunneling microscope , which enables the production of images of individual atoms on a surface .
Another related TFOT story is the cell - phone microscope , which will enable visualization of patient samples that are critical for disease diagnosis in remote areas .
John McCain at the Lakeville , Minn. , event where an audience memeber said she 'd heard Barack Obama was \ " an Arab . \ "
McCain avoids trouble from crowds
First , there was the angry man who told John McCain to hit Barack Obama “ where it hurts . ”
Then came the woman who called the Democratic nominee “ an Arab . ”

And do n’t forget the man who stood up before a packed crowd and said he was “ scared ” of an Obama presidency — nevermind the racially tinged cat calls and rounds of boos from McCain ’s other gymnasium crowds .
The town hall format was supposed be the Republican nominee ’s favorite campaign forum , highlighting his shoot - from - the - hip style , his broad knowledge on a slew of issues and his irreverent wit .
He loved it so much that he challenged Obama to a string of town hall debates .
But with their potential for amplifying unscripted outbursts and attention - diverting disasters , the microphones at high school gymnasiums and basketball arenas across the swing states have gone silent during the final stretch of the presidential campaign .
McCain , a man who has prided himself on discussions with the common man , has not entertained a single question from audience members since Oct. 10 , when he faced a belligerent crowd in Lakeville , Minn. , that at times turned against him .
The disappearance of the town hall format from McCain ’s campaign is striking , political observers said , offering a vivid example of how a signature strength became a potential liability and was abandoned .
( Obama , too , has done away with the town halls , last taking questions from voters on Sept. 12 in New Hampshire . )
“ The town hall format proved to be a little embarrassing for the campaign , and it built a negative picture about what this campaign is all about , ” said Julian Zelizer , a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University , adding that the encounters were “ too costly . ”
Over the past few weeks , McCain has replaced his beloved town halls with large rallies , press statements delivered at factories and in hotel ballrooms , “ town square ” stump speeches given in the center of small towns , and stops at restaurants and other local landmarks .
That could change on Sunday .
Down in the polls with just a few days remaining before Election Day and apparently willing to risk the uncontrolled format , McCain is scheduled to hold a town hall meeting in New Hampshire , where independent - minded voters gave him victories in both the 2000 and 2008 primaries .
The most recent polling shows Obama with a sizable lead in the Granite State .
" We think New Hampshire has always been a battleground .
We would n’t go there just for nostalgia purposes , " campaign manager Rick Davis said in a conference call with reporters .
“ We are pretty committed to finishing the campaign in New Hampshire . ”
Town halls are typically smaller events than rallies , making them less than ideal forums to reach large numbers of independent and undecided voters , said one senior McCain aide , who explained that only the most dedicated McCain supporters got tickets .
But the angry crowds — including people who screamed " terrorist " and " liar " in reference to Obama — worried McCain and his campaign aides , who feared a backlash from undecided and less partisan voters .
McCain himself on occasion sought to soothe his crowds ’ emotions after media reports started focusing on their out - of - control comments .
“ We want to fight , and I will fight , ” McCain told supporters earlier this month in Minnesota .
“ But I will be respectful .
I admire Sen. Obama and his accomplishments .
I do n’t mean to reduce your ferocity .
... I just mean to say , you have to be respectful . ”
The crowd largely ignored his plea .
“ I ca n’t trust Obama , ” one woman said , rising to her feet and staring into McCain ’s eyes .
“ I have read about him ... and he ’s an Arab . ”
McCain quickly denied it .
Obama was “ a decent family man , ” McCain said , and a “ citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues , and that ’s what this campaign is all about . ”
After another man told McCain he was scared of an Obama presidency , McCain replied : “ I have to tell you , Sen .
Obama is a decent person and a person you do n’t have to be scared of as president of the United States . ”
“ Come on , John ! ” a man in the crowd yelled out as others booed .
The next day , Mark Salter , McCain ’s senior adviser , promised more town halls to come , saying the candidate “ loves town halls ... and he ’ll continue to do them .
He ’s doing a couple next week . ”
But two town halls scheduled for the following week were scrapped .
Observers say it ’s not surprising the McCain camp shed the format .
Susan MacManus , a political science professor at the University of South Florida , said the McCain campaign purposely pulled back to avoid negative commentary .
“ They were taking disproportionate hits for the questions being posed , ” MacManus said .
“ If you can avoid that kind of negativity , you certainly do so , especially when you ’re trying to close the gap . ”
McCain “ has the political instincts to know that was n’t going to look good and play well to a national audience , ” MacManus added .
But Zelizer and MacManus said the campaign also changed tacks because McCain was down in the polls .
“ When you ’re this far behind , you need larger crowds , ” Zelizer said .
“ I ’m not sure that if he had more town halls it would change the dramatic fall in the polls that we ’ve been seeing . ”
“ The final weeks are all about volume , volume , volume , ” MacManus added .
So for McCain , town halls were out and more traditional campaign rallies were in .
On Thursday , several thousand people waited in the cold to see McCain ; his wife , Cindy ; daughter Meghan ; and close friend Sen. Lindsay Graham ( R - S.C. ) launch a two - day Ohio bus tour with a rally in Defiance , Ohio , in the northwest corner of the state .
High school students in varsity letter jackets huddled together to stay warm , while adults listened enthusiastically as the McCain entourage addressed the group outside of the town ’s junior high school .
Even though no one had the chance to ask a single question , Graham attempted to warm up the freezing crowd with some jokes .
“ Anyone see the infomercial last night ? ” he said , referring to Obama ’s half - hour commercial .
“ Thank God for cable .
If we had played that at a prison camp , it would have violated the Geneva Convention . ”
Later , several dozen people lined Market Street in Tiffin , Ohio , cheering and clapping as the Straight Talk Express passed .
McCain jumped off the bus , shook some hands and made his way through the crowd into a local coffee shop , aided by the town ’s mayor .
At another stop , in Sandusky , Ohio , McCain gathered a modest - sized crowd for a short stump speech around a large wooden gazebo .
All of this without taking a single question from supporters .
November 's Lowdown
What the hell 's happening here ?
Why is my bank in the tank ?
And my house and job ?
And my retirement money ?
Even my state 's teetering on the brink of broke !
Who did this to us ?
Fair questions , but we 're not getting honest answers .
Last year , at the first signs of the global financial slide toward the abyss , we were told that it 's just a little hiccup caused by something called subprime mortgages .
Not to worry , the Powers That Be declared confidently , for we have the damage contained .
And rest assured that " the fundamentals of our economy are sound . "
Then , this spring , Bear Stearns cratered , requiring an emergency federal subsidy to cover billions in bad loans .
Okay , admitted those in charge , that subprime stuff actually is leveraged on up the financial system , and maybe there 's been a bit of greed among a few of the big players , but we really do have the problem contained now , and , hey , " the fundamentals of our economy are sound . "
But in September -- Omigosh !-- there went Lehman Brothers , Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , AIG , Merrill Lynch , Goldman Sachs , Citigroup , WaMu , Wachovia , and others .
Well , yes , conceded the now - frazzled financial establishment , but gollies , we 're throwing hundreds of billions of your tax dollars into sandbags to contain the problem , and remember : " The fundamentals of our economy are sound . "
In October , the contagion rolled through Britain , Canada , and Europe ; it spread to Brazil and across to China and Japan ; and -- Holy Schmoly -- suddenly all of Iceland was melting in bankruptcy !
Stay calm , cried an openly panicked chorus of Washington officials , for we 're holding some big summit meetings soon and consulting our Ouija boards , and ...uh...ah...um...y' all just keep clinging to the thought that " the fundamentals of our economy are sound . "
Laissez Fairies
You do n't have to be in Who 's Who to know What 's What , do you ?
The fundamentals are NOT sound .
Wall Street and Washington ( excuse the redundancy there ) want us commoners to believe that this viral spread of economic grief was caused by those lower - income homeowners who could n't pay their subprime loans -- merely an unforeseeable glitch in a complex and otherwise healthy financial system .
Hogwash .
The source of today 's pain is the same as it was in America 's previous financial collapses : the unbridled greed of economic elites , enabled by their political courtesans in Washington .
This unbridling has been the long - sought goal of a cabal of deregulation ideologues who dwell in laissez - fairyland .
During the past two decades , they have relentlessly pushed their economic fantasies into law .
Their theory was that ( to use Ronald Reagan 's simple construct ) " the magic of the marketplace " would create an eternal rainbow of prosperity through financial " innovation " -- if only the market was unshackled from any pesky public regulations .
What the dereg theorists missed , however , is that magicians do n't perform magic .
They perform illusions .
Let 's meet some of the illusionists who are directly responsible for hurling you , me , America , and most of the world into this dark and as - yet unplumbed economic hole .
Snide , sour , and sanctimonious , this former senator from Texas is now head lobbyist for the Swiss - based banking giant , UBS , as well as chief economic adviser for his old chum John McCain .
A bathed - in - the - blood , footwashing , free - market absolutist , Gramm advocates a virulent brand of antigovernment , market - knows - best , Rambo capitalism .
In 1999 , as chair of the Senate Banking Committee , he had the power to implement some of his cockamamie dogmas .
First , he pushed through a bill to dissolve the 1933 Glass - Steagall Act , a New Deal reform that prohibited banks , investment houses , and insurance companies from combining into one corporation .
By keeping these components of our financial system separate , Glass - Steagall made sure that the crash of one of them would not bring down the other two .
But a number of Wall Street banks , led by what would become Citigroup , saw a profit windfall for themselves if only they could scuttle the old law and merge banking , investment , and insurance into huge financial conglomerates .
The senator was their ideological soul mate , and he was delighted to rig the system for them .
On November 12 , 1999 , a gloating Gramm celebrated having sledgehammered the regulatory walls that separated the three financial functions :
" We are here today to repeal Glass - Steagall because we have learned that government is not the answer .
We have learned that freedom and competition are the answers .
We have learned that we promote economic growth and we promote stability by having competition and freedom .
I am proud to be here because this is an important bill ; it is a deregulatory bill .
I believe that 's the wave of the future , and I am awfully proud to have been a part of making it a reality . "
But repealing Glass - Steagall was only step one for this free - market holy roller .
In literally the dead of night , just before Congress 's Christmas break in 2000 , Chairman Gramm snuck a short provision into an 11,000 - page appropriations bill .
The item , which only a few lobbyists and lawmakers knew had been inserted , became law when the larger bill was signed by then - President Bill Clinton .
Gramm 's little legislative sticky note decreed that a relatively new , exotic , and inherently risky form of investments called " derivatives " were not to be regulated -- or even monitored - - by the government .
It should be noted here that Democrats were also butt - deep in the dereg orthodoxy .
Such Wall Street sycophants as Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) had drunk deeply from the holy cup of derivatives deregulation , and Clinton 's top economic advisors Robert Rubin ( formerly with Goldman Sachs and now with Citigroup ) and Lawrence Summers ( also a veteran of Wall Street ) were in harness with the Republicans on this effort .
By 2008 , the freewheeling derivatives market , including derivatives based on those lowly subprime housing loans , bloated to a stunning $ 531 trillion .
That 's 531 followed by 12 zeroes !
These little - understood , essentially secret investment schemes came to dominate our entire financial system -- and when thousands of regular folks began defaulting on their subprime loans , the derivatives based on them essentially became worthless .
Investment houses , which were up to their corporate keisters in these funny - money subprime derivatives , began collapsing , and the now - interlocked banks and insurance companies began tumbling down with them .
Gramm 's deregulatory " wave of the future " had become a financial tsunami .
This guy 's mug should be on wanted posters in every post office in America .
As Federal Reserve chairman from 1987 to 2006 , he held the regulatory power to prevent the irrational inflation of the huge derivatives bubble that has now burst -- yet he fought fiercely through four presidencies to prevent even the meekest oversight by the Fed or any other agency .
Nicknamed " The Oracle , " Chairman Greenspan was inscrutable and arrogant , but he also possessed a detailed knowledge of financial minutiae and an air of superiority that simultaneously bedazzled and intimidated presidents , lawmakers , and other public officials .
However , not everyone was sanguine about the chairman 's reliance on derivatives as the pillar of Wall Street 's financial strength .
Many wise heads viewed these financial " products " as speculative mumbo- jumbo .
Billionaire financier George Soros says his firm never invested in them " because we do n't really understand how they work . "
Investment banker Felix Rohatyn described them as " hydrogen bombs . "
Back in 2003 , investment guru Warren Buffett called them " financial weapons of mass destruction " that were " potentially lethal " for our economy .
Derivatives :
What are these things ?
Derivatives amount to a casino game .
They are pieces of paper whose only real value is derived from the anticipated value of some other tangible asset ... [ read more ]
But Greenspan 's voice was the most powerful , and he was both a determined bureaucratic protector and an exuberant cheerleader for derivatives .
Meanwhile , wealthy investors worldwide were making a killing from their investments in these bizarre pieces of paper , and few in Washington were willing even to question The Oracle .
" I always felt that the titans of our legislature did n't want to reveal their own inability to understand some of the concepts that Mr. Greenspan was setting forth , " said Arthur Levitt , a well - regarded Wall Street regulator under Clinton .
" I do n't recall anyone ever saying , ' What do you mean by that , Alan ? ' "
So the bubble kept expanding .
Why was Greenspan so insistent on no regulation ?
Because he is the hardest of hardcore laissez - faire ideologues , holding a blazing disdain for government .
An avowed worshiper of libertarian novelist Ayn Rand , he views public oversight of business as an evil force that deters the creativity of smart elites .
He is so psyched by his religious - like faith in the " free market " that he fervently believes in what he considers to be the innate good will and moral superiority of investors and bankers .
He asserts that these self - interested individuals can simply be trusted to do the right thing , and that government should not second - guess their decisions .
Even the faith of snake handlers is not as devout as Greenspan's .
Unfortunately , however , he was able to hitch our nation 's economic well - being to his own absurdist ideological fancy .
The guy who was lionized as the smartest , most - stable economic thinker in the land essentially turns out to have been a quasi- religious nut .
A GOP member of Congress for 17 years , Cox was another deregulation diehard and a reliable advocate for Wall Street 's pampered CEO class -- a role he continued to play after Bush chose him in 2005 to succeed Donaldson as SEC chair .
At the commission , he weakened the ability of the enforcement staff even to investigate securities violations by Wall Street firms , much less prosecute them .
Also , in an act of pure ideological folly , he eliminated an office that had been set up specifically to watch out for future problems with such high - risk investments as derivatives .
In essence , he took the cops off the beat at the very time more cops were needed .
In October , when the stuff was hitting the fan , a chagrined Cox offered this brilliant insight : " The last six months have made it abundantly clear that voluntary regulation does not work . "
Thanks , Chris .
The Securities and Exchange Commission supposedly regulates investment banks , and in 2004 it was headed by -- guess who ?
--a Wall Street investment banker , Bill Donaldson .
On April 28 of that year , he presided over a little - noticed SEC meeting held in the commission 's basement to consider an obscure rule change urgently requested by the Big Five investment banks ( including Goldman Sachs , then headed by Henry Paulson - - yes , the same treasury secretary who just designed George W's Wall Street bailout ) .
The bankers wanted an exemption from a sensible requirement that they keep a sizeable pool of money on hand to cover potential losses .
Turn these reserve funds loose , pleaded the bankers , so we can put more of our investors ' money into this opaque but lucrative area known as derivatives .
After less than an hour of discussion , Donaldson and his four SEC colleagues voted unanimously to do this favor for the bankers .
As a bonus , the generous commissioners also decided to let the banks themselves monitor the level of risk they were putting on investors -- and ultimately on the backs of taxpayers .
In this one meeting , which was not covered by the media , the dereg geniuses had struck another major blow for banker recklessness , and the likes of Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch , and others were sent further down the giddy path to their -- and our -- ruin .
" The problem with such voluntary [ regulations ] , " said Roderick Hills , Gerald Ford 's former SEC chairman , " is that , as we 've seen throughout history , they often do n't work . "
Duh !
As honcho of Goldman Sachs , Hank drew a $ 37 million paycheck the year before Bush waved him into the Treasury Department to oversee the whole U.S. economy .
At Goldman , he was considered one of Wall Street 's " smart guys " who had figured out how to make billions in brokerage fees by packaging and selling these wondrous pieces of wizardry called derivatives , and he came into government as an unquestioning believer in deregulatory doctrine .
Now that deregulated derivatives have turned out to be so much hokum , Hank 's in charge of the bailout -- and his former firm is in line to get at least $ 10 billion from it .
The Paulson bailout plan is flawed in many awful ways , but start with this basic one : the money ( some estimates now put the total taxpayer cost above $ 2 trillion ) is being handed to the same schemers and finaglers who caused the crash .
The public gets to contribute the funds , but it gets no seat at the table to decide how the system ( and who in it ) will be " rescued . "
With typical antigovernment extremism , Paulson 's plan makes the public passive investors in the banks we 're saving , leaving all the say - so to the banks ' current executives and directors .
Our money is being given away by the Bush ideologues with no strings attached -- not even a requirement that it go into new loans so credit can quickly flow into the American economy again !
Excuse me ?
Unclogging that credit flow was Paulson 's rationale for giving $ 125 billion to nine giant banks ( Bank of America , Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , Wells Fargo , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , Bank of New York , and State Street ) .
He now says he " hopes " the banks will use the money to make loans , but he refuses to require them to do so .
Meanwhile , bankers themselves say they are more likely simply to sit on the money for awhile or -- get this -- use it to buy up smaller competitors !
Yes , that means that our tax dollars will go toward eliminating competition in America 's banking market .
Not only will this leave consumers and businesses with fewer choices , but this will also increase the size of poorly managed megabanks that have already been designated by the Bush - Paulson regime as " too big to fail . "
Laissez - faire follies
One positive to come from this collapse is that it exposes the bankruptcy of several core ideas that have been pushed by free - market illusionists .
For example , market infallibility -- the notion that Wall Street investors , analysts , and bankers know more than anyone else , and the government ( aka the public ) should just get the hell out of the way and behold unfettered genius at work .
So , behold .
( And , by the way , these are the exact same people who only months ago were insisting that Americans would be so much better off if they would move their Social Security money from government hands to the more adventuresome wizards of Wall Street . )
Yet , those bankers and politicos who pushed this antigovernment ethos to today 's disastrous conclusion remain delusional .
They cry for trillions of our tax dollars , but they insist that the profiteers must control the bailout and remain free of public supervision .
George W himself still sticks with fantasy over reality , claiming that the fundamentals of the system are sound and that it is " essential " that any reforms not interfere with the " free market . "
It 's been a scream to hear these devout market ideologues explain how they 've just become Wall Street socialists .
Having big , bad government buy up the failed investments , then partially nationalize America 's financial system , is an unwelcome choice for Bush .
" I frankly do n't want the government involved , " he said .
" It was necessary . "
Bailout chief Paulson ( dubbed " King Henry " by Newsweek ) said , " We regret having to take these actions " -- but they 're necessary .
Why necessary ?
Because laissez - faire ideology is a crock .
It failed .
Americans are not being told the blunt truth , which is that the financial mess we 're in today is a direct result of the laissez - faire fraud that Wall Street and Washington willfully imposed on our nation .
CEOs and banking lobbyists , presidents and treasury secretaries , regulators and lawmakers ( of both parties ) failed to protect America from money - grubbing bankers , hedge - fund speculators , and other big players .
As we 've learned in the past few weeks , there is no " free " market .
Indeed , it 's quite pricey when it trips and falls over the inevitable outcroppings of greed .
That 's why strong , vigilant , and aggressive public regulation is essential .
Do n't be fooled by claims that just throwing money at the hucksters will fix the problem .
The only way to make America 's financial system trustworthy is to return to the sound fundamentals of public oversight -- starting with the bailout itself .

As American taxpayers bear the burden of bankrolling multiple financial scams now and into the foreseeable future , the Federal Reserve has refused to disclose the names of recipients or details of assets put up as collateral on two trillion dollars of " emergency " loans given to address the " financial emergency " rushed through congress .
The Federal Reserve Bank responded to Bloomberg by saying it's allowed to withhold internal memos as well as other information requested by Bloomberg .
This display of arrogance of power is unprecedented .
The government wants taxpayers to take its word for how it 's spending an enormous amount of money .
How gullible does the Federal Reserve think the American people are ; the answer , very gullible or they would n't have gotten away with the scam .
What started as $ 700 billion has grown to $ 2 trillion .
Total Federal Reserve lending exceeded $ 2 trillion for the first time November 6 .
It rose by 138 percent , or $ 1.23 trillion , in the 12 weeks since September 14 , when central bank governors relaxed collateral standards to accept securities that were n't rated AAA .
House Financial Services Committee Representative David Scott , a Georgia Democrat , said Americans had " been bamboozled . "
Congress may have been bamboozled but it is the American taxpayer who is left holding the bag because of congressional incompetence .
Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in September they would provide transparency in the $ 700 billion bailout of the banking system ; they also said the money would be used to buy up " toxic mortgages " but the rules changed immediately after Congress gave Bernanke total discretion to distribute the billions of dollars .
So now all that Americans can do is complain .
Americans have short memories so it is doubtful voters will remember this fiasco in the 2010 congressional elections .
The chances are that the so - called asset - back securities and other paper tied to leveraged buyouts are consumer debt and who knows what other kinds of garbage lies on the banks balance sheets .
Yet the Federal Reserve still wants to protect the identities of the banks that are essentially continuing to thrive and expand by buying other banks with American taxpayers ' money .
That 's outrageous .
" Notwithstanding calls for enhanced transparency , the Board must protect against the substantial , multiple harms that might result from disclosure , " Jennifer J. Johnson , the secretary for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors , said in a letter e-mailed to Bloomberg News .
" In its considered judgment and in view of current circumstances , it would be a dangerous step to release this otherwise confidential information , " she wrote .
Oh really ?
Maybe the people who provide the cash should get to be the judge of that .
And in any case , who , exactly , will be endangered ?
Dangerous - for whom ?
And what is the danger ?
You mean some fat cats might lose their jobs or their homes ?
Or some bankers might have to pay more dues for their country clubs ?
Congress has put two trillion dollars , about 1/20 of world GDP , under the control of one man , with no checks and no accountability , and we do n't know where the money went , or to whom .
What we do know is that there has been no visible improvement of the financial problems all this money was supposed to correct .
What we can assume is that it 's going to the very same people who caused the problem ; they will be the ones benefiting .
Does this sound like Constitutional government to you ?
To me , it sounds like a financial dictatorship .
You think Madoff's $ 50 billion fraud was something ?
He 's a piker compared to these guys .
The Federal Reserve responded to Bloomberg 's law suit by saying that there is a trade - secret exemption in the Freedom of Information
Act that could be expanded to include potential harm to any of the central bank 's customers .
But Bruce Johnson , a lawyer at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP in Seattle , said that expansion is not contained in the freedom - of - information law .
Furthermore , Trade secrets ?
A trade secret is something like the formula for Coca Cola .
A trade secret is an unpatented business or technical process the release of which would harm the competitive position of the holder .
I can't imagine what sort of " trade secrets " might apply to the acquisition of bad debt from poorly managed financial institutions .
The Federal Reserve Bank is a " private " organization , and is NOT a U.S. government agency or entity .
Remember how Congress approved about $ 700 billion but did not require oversight to actually give the money out ?
This is what happens when you have a for - profit institution that has absolutely ZERO congressional oversight or transparency requirements .
And yet people still think the Federal Reserve Bank is a good idea .
The Democrats are in charge and Democrat representative Barney Frank is Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .
In an interview November 6 , Barney Frank said " The Fed 's disclosure is sufficient and the risk the central bank is taking on is appropriate in the current economic climate . "
Barney Frank said he has discussed the program with Timothy F. Geithner , president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
" I talk to Geithner and he was pretty sure that they 're OK .
If the risk is that the Fed takes a little bit of a haircut , well that 's regrettable . '' -
" Such losses would be acceptable if the program helps revive the economy . "
Barney Frank said the Fed should n't reveal the assets it holds or how it values them because of the " delicacy with respect to pricing . ''
He said such disclosure would " give people clues to what your pricing is and what they might be able to sell us and what your estimates are . ''
He would n't say why he thought that information would be problematic .
This is who we have " protecting the public interest . "
People seem to forget that those who run the United States government are nothing more than stewards and representatives for the American people .
When the President and Congress spend money causing astronomical massive debt they ignore that it is not their personal debt but the collective debt of the American people which is now well over 12 TRILLION DOLLARS and counting .
The so called representatives of the American people in our government just gave out 2 trillion dollars to bailout failing and inefficient private corporations and yet are refusing to specify to the American taxpayers exactly WHO they gave all of our money to in these bailouts ; Americans should not stand for it .
Vincent Gioia is a retired patent attorney living in Palm Desert , California
The disabled 60 - year - old driving a royal blue Chevy Malibu on New Hampshire 's Spaulding Turnpike did n't look like an emissary of Al Qaeda .
But there was something menacing coming from his car .
On his way home last month after receiving a PET scan at Portsmouth Regional Hospital , Michael Rosenthal noticed a State Police sport utility vehicle driving next to him and the trooper inside staring at him strangely .
The trooper then sped in front of Rosenthal , slowed down , and pulled behind him .
" I was in the granny lane , driving on cruise control , taking my time , when all of a sudden I looked over and I saw this trooper with a puzzled look , " said Rosenthal , a former New York City police officer who lives in East Wakefield , N.H.
" When he put on his blue lights and pulled me over , I knew it was n't a normal traffic stop . "
The trooper , Bill Burke , walked over to Rosenthal , but the State Police veteran did n't ask for his license or registration .
Instead , he had an all - too - knowing , Big Brotherlike question .
" Were you in contact with any radioactivity today ? " he asked .
Rosenthal began to wonder whether his veins were glowing from the chemicals injected for the scan .
" I thought it was an odd question , like I was on ' Candid Camera , ' " Rosenthal said .
He asked Burke why he was asking the question , and the trooper explained that he carries a radioactivity sensor and that something in Rosenthal 's car set off the alarm .
" It 's very rare that you get them going off for a vehicle going by , " said Sergeant John Begin of State Police Troop G , which monitors radioactive waste in commercial vehicles passing through New Hampshire .
" I can only think of three or four cases . "
Rosenthal registered a six on the sensor 's scale , which goes from one to nine , with nine the highest amount of radioactivity .
Begin said that about 30 New Hampshire troopers carry the sensors , which are the size of a bulky cellphone and can detect radioactivity as far away as 100 feet .
New Hampshire bought the radiation - detecting equipment , called Mini rad-Ds and made by D-tect Systems , with a grant from the US Department of Homeland Security before the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston as part of efforts to prevent attacks on the city .
On the side of the turnpike that Nov. 21 , Rosenthal explained to Burke that he had just come from having a positron emission tomography scan , which requires an injection of short - lived radioactive isotopes to identify any unhealthy cellular activity .
The isotopes can remain in the body for as long as 18 hours , and patients are advised to keep their distance from others for that period .
" I told him I was surprised his equipment could detect the radioactivity in my body , " Rosenthal said .
But Burke did n't take Rosenthal 's word for it .
He asked him to prove it .
" I was very lucky that I had the documents with me from the hospital , " he said .
" After that , he was satisfied and sent me on my way . "
Like hospitals around the country , Portsmouth Regional does hundreds of scans a week .
Nancy Notis , a hospital spokeswoman , said Rosenthal 's case is the first time they 've heard of a patient being pulled over for emitting radioactivity .
As a result , she said , the hospital is reviewing whether to alert patients that they could be stopped by police .
Despite his delay getting home , Rosenthal said he is happy to know the police are on the prowl for terrorists .
" It made me feel good in one respect - that our money is going to good purposes , " he said .

Religious leader Rick Warren has been picked to provide the invocation at President Elect Obama 's inauguration .
Does his extremist position on social issues represent the common ground Obama is striving for ?
Rick Warren understands politics .
It was announced today that Warren would be giving the invocation at President Elect Obama ’s inauguration .
It ’s shocking , to say the least , but a little less surprising considering Warren ’s Saddleback Forum , a campaign season event in which Warren questioned Senator Obama and Senator McCain about faith and politics – two issues Warren feels very comfortable merging .
The Saddleback Forum , however , was no more an opportunity to discuss faith than it was an opportunity to discuss science .
It was an opportunity for Rick Warren to " catch " the candidates in what he deemed inappropriate positions .
WARREN : That was a freebie .
That was a gimme .
That was a gimme , OK ?
Now , let ’s deal with abortion ; 40 million abortions since Roe v. Wade .
As a pastor , I have to deal with this all of the time , all of the pain and all of the conflicts .
I know this is a very complex issue .
Forty million abortions , at what point does a baby get human rights , in your view ?
It is beyond me how Warren feels that a perspective that so few Americans hold ( reflected this election by the sound defeat of three anti-choice measures , the victory of pro-choice Democrats in Congress and , well , Obama ’s win ) , is a viable basis for a question for our presidential candidates ?
Luckily , Obama understands what most Americans do – it ’s about prevention and education , not religious extremism , and he responded :
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

OBAMA : But let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion , because this is something obviously the country wrestles with .
One thing that I ’m absolutely convinced of is that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue .
And so I think anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue , I think , is not paying attention .
So that would be point number one .
But point number two , I am pro-choice .
I believe in Roe v. Wade , and I come to that conclusion not because I ’m pro-abortion , but because , ultimately , I do n’t think women make these decisions casually .
I think they — they wrestle with these things in profound ways , in consultation with their pastors or their spouses or their doctors or their family members .
And so , for me , the goal right now should be — and this is where I think we can find common ground .
And by the way , I ’ve now inserted this into the Democratic party platform , is how do we reduce the number of abortions ?
The fact is that although we have had a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years , abortions have not gone down and that is something we have to address .
Rick Warren is also the man behind these ( recent ) statements on abortion :
“ But to me it is kind of a charade in that people say ‘ We believe abortions should be safe and rare , ’ ” he added .
“ Do n’t tell me it should be rare .
That ’s like saying on the Holocaust , ‘ Well , maybe we could save 20 percent of the Jewish people in Poland and Germany and get them out and we should be satisfied with that , ’ ” Warren said .
“ I ’m not satisfied with that .
I want the Holocaust ended . ”
Now we unveil the story of a religious leader who is adamantly against prevention ; in favor of reducing abortion by stripping women of their rights ; a leader who compares embryos in utero and mothers who make the best , most loving choices they can when faced with an unintended pregnancy or medical condition , to a murderous movement of anti-Semites who brutally slaughtered Jewish women , men and children .
We do not have a religious leader here who agrees , in any way shape or form , with what Obama and the emerging common ground movement members believe – that to ensure women ’s optimal health and lives , elevate women ’s status in society and safeguard public health , we need to focus on comprehensive sex education and prevention measures like family planning and contraception access — not more of the same extremist elements of the anti-choice movement .
There are so many religious and spiritual leaders who understand the above .
They understand that justice in the form of equal access to health care and respect for women ’s health , decisions and privacy are critical components of any health measure – including one to reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancy and ensure women have the tools to plan for the families they want now or in the future .
In The American Prospect , Sarah Posner discusses the Religious Declaration on Sexuality Morality , Justice and Healing ,
… which advocates comprehensive sex education and " a faith - based commitment to sexual and reproductive rights , including access to voluntary contraception , abortion , and HIV / STD prevention and treatment . "
The Religious Institute on Sexuality , Justice , and Healing , which authored the declaration , has also called on Obama to adopt an approach focused on preventing unintended pregnancies .
Rewire has featured the voices of Rev. Debra Haffner , Rev. Carlton Veazy and so many others who advocate for a faith - based approach to sexual and reproductive health and rights , one that aligns so well with President Elect Obama ’s vision .
And , yet , it ’s Pastor Rick Warren who will join President Elect Obama on stage when he is inaugurated .
Warren who advocates strongly for the abstinence - only based ideological restrictions in our Global AIDS Plan – PEPFAR .
It ’s Warren who has advocated to retain these restrictions which clash wholeheartedly with Obama ’s plan to strip them away .
Warren awarded President Bush the first ever " Medal of P.E.A.C.E. " for his work on HIV / AIDS , as Lindsay Beyerstein reported for Rewire .
However , as Beyerstein writes ,
For all the mutual good will on display ,
Warren ’s agenda may well clash with Obama ’s plans to reshape American
AIDS policy .
It is hard to imagine Obama and Warren ’s agendas for any sexual or reproductive health issues aligning at this point , making it all the more puzzling why Obama chose Warren for this role .
In an expose on Religion Dispatches , Tom Davis writes of Warren ’s die - hard positions on social issues all while taking more " moderate " stances on issues of global warming , poverty , war and AIDS ( though , as I note above , supporting the imposition of religious restrictions on global AIDS policy is not moderate ) .
Davis writes of Warren ,
On the eve of the 2004 presidential election , he sent a letter to his congregation telling them that there were five non-negotiable issues that should determine their vote — abortion , stem - cell research , cloning , homosexual marriage , and euthanasia .
In fact , these five issues are barely mentioned in the Bible ; Jesus never spoke about them , nor did the prophets .
Curiously , however , Warren made no mention of those issus that he had claimed to care deeply about as a " new evangelical " – global warming , poverty , and war .
Warren seems to have empathy for some and not for others – and this is where Davis identified Warren ’s weakness :
As far as empathy is concerned , there seems to be scant evidence that Rick Warren and many other evangelical writers have tried to put themselves in the woman ’s position , or that they can imagine what it would be like to have to make that decision .
Rick Warren is not a man that symbolizes common ground .
Warren has positioned himself as a key player in what in words has been called a new evangelism but in practice is nothing more than shining up some old shoes .
As soon as the announcement was made that Warren would provide the invocation , protests sprung up on Facebook and elsewhere .
We ’ll see if Warren really does have such a front and center role at the inauguration after all .
As a religious leader , he is a brilliant politician .

Next time you see the dingaling bell ringers on the sidewalk , and before you drop your coin in the red kettle , consider this :
If you ’re an officer for the Salvation Army , you also live Salvation Army .
Meaning the country ’s second largest charity ( behind the United Way ) mandates that their leaders ( not priests , mind you , business professionals ) do n’t drink or smoke , and that they marry only other officers .
This all because the charity is a devoutly religious one , founded by an evangelical Christian in 1865 .
Still , Salvation
Army gets a hefty chunk of its budget from government funding ( via faith - based funding that Obama says he ’ll expand ) so the marriage restriction seems to fly in the face of employment discrimination principles .
Take Captain Johnny Harsh , the head of Salvation Army ’s Oshkosh , Wisconsin chapter .
His wife , also a captain , died of a heart attack in June .
Johnny has since fallen in love with a nurse he met on a Christian online dating site , a nurse who , incidentally , is not a Salvation Army officer .
Still , they got engaged .
( The harsh consequence after the jump . )
The charity responded by suspending Harsh who ’s been with the Salvation Army for 14 years .
Harsh says the rule is outdated and he wo n’t call off the wedding .
And despite the fact that he ’ll probably be dismissed when he goes before the review board next week , he ’s publicly asked people to not stop giving to the charity during the holidays .
He told FoxNews.com : “ I want to tell people , and use the media , to say do n’t stop giving to the Salvation Army because of this .
That would be terrible . ”
Speaking of terrible , being fired from your job , by a charity no less , because of who you want to marry seems criminal , especially in this day and age .
I say Harsh proposes to one of his male officer friends .
Let ’s see how the holy army takes that marriage arrangement .
“ Some have argued that with new technology there is a diminished expectation of privacy , ” said Marc Rotenberg , executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center , a privacy rights group in Washington .
“ But the opposite may also be true .
New techniques may require us to expand our understanding of privacy and to address the impact that data collection has on groups of individuals and not simply a single person . ”
Mr. Brown , for one , is n’t concerned about losing his privacy .
The M.I.T researchers have convinced him that they have gone to great lengths to protect any information generated by the experiment that would reveal his identity .
Besides , he says , “ the way I see it , we all have Facebook pages , we all have e-mail and Web sites and blogs . ”
“ This is a drop in the bucket in terms of privacy , ” he adds .
GOOGLE and its vast farm of more than a million search engine servers spread around the globe remain the best example of the power and wealth - building potential of collective intelligence .
Google ’s fabled PageRank algorithm , which was originally responsible for the quality of Google ’s search results , drew its precision from the inherent wisdom in the billions of individual Web links that people create .
The company introduced a speech - recognition service in early November , initially for the Apple iPhone , that gains its accuracy in large part from a statistical model built from several trillion search terms that its users have entered in the last decade .
In the future , Google will take advantage of spoken queries to predict even more accurately the questions its users will ask .
And , a few weeks ago , Google deployed an early - warning service for spotting flu trends , based on search queries for flu - related symptoms .
The success of Google , along with the rapid spread of the wireless Internet and sensors  like location trackers in cellphones and GPS units in cars  has touched off a race to cash in on collective intelligence technologies .
Attention Users of Functional Languages : ICFP wants the Benefit of your Experience !
The ACM International Conference on Functional Programming ( ICFP ) is actively soliciting practitioners to write and present Experience Reports that describe how functional programming works --- or fails to work --- in the real - world .
What is ICFP ?
What is an Experience Report ?
Possible topics for Experience Reports might include :
insights gained from real - world projects using functional programming
comparison of functional programming with conventional programming in the context of an industrial project or a university curriculum
project - management , business , or legal issues encountered when using functional programming in a real - world project
curricular issues encountered when using functional programming in education
real - world constraints that created special challenges for an implementation of a functional language or for functional programming in general .
Why does ICFP want Experience Reports ?
Why should I write an Experience Report ?
I 'm interested ; what 's next ?

Trends for 2009 : The Death - Spiral of Local Government and Small Business
December 29 , 2008
State and local governments are responding to shortfalls in tax revenues and spiraling pension costs by raising " fees " ( a.k.a. taxes or junk fees ) just as the backbone of the economy -- small business -- is struggling for survival .
The more government employees demand " what was promised " in pensions , the more small businesses will fold , cutting government revenues in a death - spiral with only one end : state , county and city insolvency .
I am starting a new series today entitled " Trends for 2009 " which will attempt to describe those trends which will be working beneath the MSM - induced " everything 's gonna return to 2007 real soon " fantasy .
Let 's start with the death - spiral of state and local governments raising taxes and fees to offset their collapsing tax revenues .
Contrary to the illusion created by glossy adverts and a corporate - owned MSM ( mainstream media ) , huge global corporations are not the primary provider of jobs and taxes in the U.S. -- that role is filled by small business , which also provides roughly 80 % of the job creation and innovation in the economy .
The MSM tries to make a distinction between " marginal small businesses " and " small business , " but all small enterprises are marginal in our high - overhead , high - tax , high - fixed cost economy .
So guess what happens as revenues decline but fixed costs ( rent , business license fees , utilities , health insurance , etc. etc. ) stay high ?
Small businesses will close en masse .
Slump Batters Small Business , Threatening Owners ' Dreams ( WSJ )
Now put these two together : higher taxes / fees and small businesses on the precipice .
Welcome to " death spiral 2009 " in which public employee union demands for higher taxes to pay their bloated pension and healthcare benefits will kill off an ever - rising number of small businesses , further depressing tax revenues .
Note to politicos , government managers , public employees and their unions : we do n't have to keep our door open .
You seem to think we do , but we do n't .
When we can't pay ourselves and / or we get tired of the endless stress and grind of all your regulations and taxes and fees , then we 'll close our doors and issue a big sigh of relief .
We 'll make do somehow without employees , storefronts , offices , permits , and all the other sources of income you , our governments ' employees , depend on for your paychecks .
I have to chuckle ( bitterly ) when I hear some corporate or government manager complaining of stress .
If you have a steady paycheck , you have never experienced full - court stress .
( With the exception of emergency medical care staff and U.S. Armed Forces personnel in combat duty , of course ; I mean " regular civilian employment . " )
Small business owners have to wear more hats than any corporate manager or government employee , and they do so without pay as times get tough .
Many tap their own credit cards to pay employees and fill orders for good customers .
You want stress ?
Then do whatever job you do for a paycheck but imagine that you 're doing so with only the hope of future paychecks -- a hope that dwindles every week that the economy continues its free - fall .
This is why I have predicted that local and state governments are completely ill - prepared for the tidal wave of small business failures which are about to decimate their tax revenues .
The average municipal manager is assuming everything will return to normal soon , as all those faceless small - business worker bees will persevere and keep paying their rent , taxes and fees regardless of the hardships , stress and rising debts .
Nobody can operate their business for long when they 're losing money .
I would guess that over half of small businesses in the U.S. are already marginalized in terms of survivability , and very little separates those from their " if we can just get through 2009 we 'll make it " brethren who still have a bit of cushion .
As noted here before , an entrepreneur always has an alternative " Plan B " livelihood : whatever one used to do in a formal , high - cost way , then do it informally from home .
Do it for barter , do it for cash ; pay no office or warehouse rent , have no employees , pay no business taxes , and whatever net income is left , it will be so low that the income taxes will be negligible .
If the politicos and government employees think they 're in trouble now , wait until the end of 2009 .
When the streets are lined with closed storefronts , the chain stores and malls have been shuttered , and the auto dealerships are weed - filled empty lots , then go ask the survivors to pay more taxes and fees .
Oh , and here 's where some state / local tax revenues are going ( link courtesy of Cheryl A. ) : Double - Dipping Government Employees in Florida .
Sadly , there wo n't be many left to hear your pleading for more tax revenue .
But go ahead and raise taxes and fees anyway , and drive the survivors under .
Then the last businesses you can try to load up with higher costs will be Wal - Mart and Safeway and the local branch of Citicorp / WAMU / BofA / Countrywide / Morgan / Chase or whatever it will be called .
You can try raising property taxes , but as homeowner net worth and equity continues sliding , you may find some resistance to higher property taxes .
You can start charging $ 10 to use the county park , and guess what , you 'll find nobody needs to go there now .
You can charge $ 10 a month to use the library , and guess what , you will either face a citizen insurrection or few will enter what was once considered a sacrosanct civil institution -- the public library .
Or you can take stock and realise that government is an enterprise , too ; it too needs to live within its means -- especially as those means diminish along with the economy which supports you .
Unlike the Federal government , you can't print money to pay yourselves or fund your pensions .
You might want to focus on helping the goose which lays the eggs -- small business -- survive rather than devote all your energy to strangling it with higher taxes and fees .
You can either keep the libraries open , or you can fund your pensions .
But you wo n't be able to do both .
The more taxes and fees are raised , the less tax revenue will be collected as the pool of small - business survivors melts under the strain .
It 's called a death - spiral , and we will all have ringside seats as 2009 unfolds its dark wings .
Lest you think this is just some outlier attitude , please read this commentary from an astute reader .
This was written in response to my essayProductive and Unproductive Capital ( December 27 , 2008 ) , but it resonates with the death - spiral I describe today :
" I compare today to say America in 1832 to 1942 , what we did , what we believed , how we lived with mostly independent agrarian life , no distances , no transit , only walking to the homecoming game with your pal and your gal at the school 3 miles away .
I keep saying , " does that sound so bad ? "
Is it so terrible to work where you live , in small , modest shop of our own making small , modest profits ?
Your last post was insightful in this , which has a near - absolute effect on people who control and deploy capital .
If there 's all risk and no return , why deploy it ?
This single change could probably do more than any other .
I am one of those capable of deploying capital , but all my life I have n't even once : the legal maze is incredible , the taxes are near 100 % of profits , and the risk is total loss of everything you own , and with liability and garnishing wages , everything you might ever own .
This same math drove my father out of small business altogether , and that was the early 90s when the gov't ( including Fed debt ) was 1 /4 of todays ' size .
Was it too small then ?
For example , here in Rochester , NY , there are 12 - BR Craftsman mansions , all woodwork , fireplaces , show homes , 20 min from the city , already cut into 3 apts for , oh $ 220,000 .
That 's like giving it away .
Replacement cost would be in the millions .
You know what ?
The return on that investment is zero ; the rents + taxes + risk would take ALL the profits , every penny : to the state , the bank , and the insurance companies .
That 's why the present owner is trying just to sell it at breakeven .
He does n't want it either .
That 's what I 'm talking about in deploying capital , although laundromats , farms , restaurants , are all the same math .
You work entirely for the State .
Any profits are more than overshadowed by the additional risk .
So I do nothing ; and neither does anybody else .
Do we get anything for this cost and nuisance ?
No .
At least 30 miles north , in Canada , they GET something for their equivalent taxload : universal health care , and a system that has no personal risk .
The dole is easy to get on , and there 's no real stigma or bother attached to it .
In NY we do n't even get good roads .
It 's nonsense .
Go back to how it was -- let the roads go back to dirt for all I care , cancel health care and everything else -- despite the promises we do n't really get it anyway .
Most people out here would agree with me .
If we steal from workers and savers to give to speculators and borrowers , then why should people work for themselves anymore ?
And I can attest that here in NY , they do n't .
The farms were economically firebombed years before the rest of the economy .
There 's now no work people wish to do -- although astonishingly there 's still a lingering work ethic .
So we do nothing , and nothing gets done .
Money wo n't solve this problem .
That 's the real point .
Only work in the real world will .
To get that , we need to reverse the reward structure 180 ' and reward people who work instead of those who shuffle , actively prevent the work of others , or who speculate .
History shows that will happen and despite recent appearances , it seems this may even happen peacefully , if with great hardship .
Time will tell but the American people seem to be avoiding that path by not getting riled even when VERY put upon .
They seem to be content with simply playing out all the rope that the present system needs .
When it is completely nonfunctional , it will more or less hang itself without our needing to get off the couch .
That 's unconscious , and it's giving great benefit to the people , but here in the country , people KNOW they 're getting screwed into poverty every day -- and I mean actual no - heat , lose - the - house poverty .
It 's not as they say in the suburbs : that people are fat and lazy and do n't know .
THey seem to know well enough here but still prefer to play out the rope .
I think people are more or less terrified of the explosion that might occur if they allowed themselves to get angry and take action .
History would show , I believe , that their common sense in this is correct .
I liked the reader who spoke of " living on the land " -- he has the relaxed and patient method I wish I had , although he was n't able to flesh out this important idea so thickly .
Living in farm country , thick with turkey and deer I can agree -- hunting in a Depression is a dangerous fantasy .
It took from 1932 to 1990 for turkey to return here , and only when re-introduced .
Deer were virtually wiped out until the late 50s .
There are no fish now even in normal times .
Imagining hunting might work is an excellent way to get killed .
Far better to buy a few hundred in garden seeds and a shovel , something I intend to write on if I can clarify a plan before people are already inside the storm .
But you just can't write a 100 - word essay on growing food .
It 's like being a doctor or a mason , it takes decades to learn to do well , everything is a soft - case exceptions , and only experience can teach you .
It seems like that idea that non-edible savings itself is illusionary , and that money is useless compared to real work are ideas that need to be explored .
I look forward to seeing what you discover . "
Thank you , reader .
Here are two ideas to start with : tax the heck out of unproductive capital and unearned income , not just to raise revenue but to drive that capital into productive uses , and lighten the tax burdens placed on small business .
The more that survive , the more tax revenues you 'll actually gather .

The downturn is following a path so predictable , day by day , that people who comprehend the business cycle do n’t even need to read the news .
You can intuit what will happen next because it ’s happening like a textbook case — even as it is reported with a continued sense of surprise .
Press reporting on the downturn has been like reports from a committee that knows nothing about gravity , but which has nonetheless been assigned to watch what happens when you drop objects from high places .
They keep filing surprised reports about how the objects fall — what a bizarre and unwelcome turn of events — and then they conjure up ways to keep this from happening through some outside intervention .
They recommend bailouts , spending , programs , controls , and inflation .
You just want to get their attention and explain : what you are observing is part of the structure of reality itself , and there is nothing you can do to stop it .
You can cover your eyes , put up fancy mirrors , turn somersaults , speculate and talk and decry all you want .
But in the end , the downturn is a necessary and inevitable response to the previous boom .
It must be allowed to continue on its course .
Most recently , for example , we have seen an uptick in the unemployment rate , now at 6.7 % according to official statistics .
Here we have the human face of recession .
It is also the inevitable response to the boom .
The people over - employed in bubbled - up industries are led from failing sectors into viable ones — with a serious transition cost .
Wages adjust downward and people move from uneconomic undertakings to more economically viable ones .
What is enough to make a person crazy is how all this is reported as something correctable , as if they all constituted marching orders for Washington .
A bank is failing ?
Someone had better bail it out !
Home prices are falling ?
Spend trillions to boost them .
People are losing jobs ?
Make work for them or subsidize their unemployment to make it last longer .
On unemployment in particular , this is the issue that led to many calamities in the 20th century .
The problem itself is largely artificial in the sense that it has been created by the boom - bust cycle , which itself is a consequence of the central bank ’s loose money policy .
In every society with sound money , there is no problem with unemployment .
This is because , as Mises wrote , in a free market , all unemployment is purely voluntary .
What do we mean by this ?
It is a feature of the world itself .
We live in a world of scarcity so there is always and everywhere work to do .
Economically useful work pays a return of wages and salaries , which act as compensation for the opportunity costs of work over leisure and reflect the value of the work to overall output .
Because there is always work to do at some price , unemployment is not a feature of the market economy , and this is one reason we only begin to note the existence of long periods of unemployment in the 20th century .
The attempt to " cure " the problem has only reinforced it .
But in economies with business cycles , it is not only capital that is misdirected toward sectors where it does n’t belong .
Labor chases bubbles created by subsidized credit .
When those bubbles pop , the jobs are eliminated .
There are ripple effects too that flow from sector to sector .
A widespread shifting takes places .
There is no reason to assume that labor is less able than capital to shift from one production line to another .
But when there are labor unions , minimum wage floors , mandated benefits , and other interventions , these shifts can take longer than they should , and that ’s when we begin to see high unemployment that lasts and lasts .
The surest way to guarantee that the problem grows worse is to attempt to fix it by means of unemployment insurance , government spending , jobs programs , and the like .
All of these interventions delay the necessary adjustment and prolong the crisis .
Vedder and Gallaway devoted many years of study to questions of unemployment in the 20th century , and ended up proving with a mass of historical detail that the entire problem is due to the attempt to fix the problem .
Their results are reported in their book Out of Work — a work which should have put an end to labor - based interventions forever .
Sadly , the political class cares nothing about facts and logic , so they barrel ahead with the cheers of the media to repeat all the mistakes of the past .
The bottom line is that these people can create all the unemployment they want so long as they continue to try to " do something " about it .
The public goes along because the entire subject is among the most alarming and scary of all economic concerns .
Surely there is something that the political class can do !
If we are really sincere about not wanting to repeat the 1930s , the political classes should do nothing but cut taxes and free the labor market , but otherwise do nothing to " help " the problem .
Just as objects fall when you drop them , so markets must adjust during recessions .

[ Haskell - cafe ] RE : Haskell Performance
Dear Dave |
My question to you is , if you were asked to make a recommendation on | which programming language to use for a program which would run on a | multiple core processor , but also required adequate memory and running | time performance , would you lean towards or away from Haskell ?
What | other factors would you consider ?
In other words , was I correct in my | initial opinion that Haskell was more concerned about code expression | rather than performance ?
Thanks for your email .
I 'm ccing the Haskell Cafe , which is full of people with practical experience ( many more than I ) of using Haskell for real applications .
I do n't think it 's possible to give a categorical yes / no answer to your question .
Yes , Haskell is designed primarily for high - level expressiveness rather than performance .
This is good for programmers , but it cuts both ways for implementation .
On the one hand , the programmer is taking less control , and the implementation may not be as clever as a programmer could be ( the quicksort example you cite is a good example ) .
On the other hand , the high - level - ness gives the opportunity for the implementation to do stuff that the programmer could not feasibly do by hand ; the vectorisation transformation in nested data parallelism is a good example ( http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/ndp/index.htm).
Long term , my bet is that the second trend will win .
If you want to write parallel programs , it makes sense to start with a language that is by - default parallel , rather than by - default sequential .
But that does not mean that you get parallel performance without tears .
Far from it : parallelism is a complex , multi- faceted beast ( concurrency , communication , locality , granularity ... ) .
So the short - term answer might be different to the long term one .
That said , GHC comes out very competitively in the ( flawed , but available ) language shootout http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=all.
So performance is not at all bad .

Pesto Genovese is a staple sauce of Genoese cuisine .
Pesto is made by chopping and grinding fresh basil leaves adding pine nuts , extra virgin olive oil , garlic and grated cheese .
The best cheeses for this sauce are Parmesan , Grana Padano , Pecorino Sardo or Pecorino Romano .
This sauce recipe originated in Liguria in the nineteenth century , but it might have been a version of earlier traditional Ligurian sauces .
In the past , all the ingredients of this sauce were pounded in marble mortars by a marble pestle .
But even in modern Italy housewives sometimes will use this method .
Of course , with today ’s food processors , our task is simpler .
Pesto ’s ingredients marry well and compliment each other to create a superior and delicate taste .
It is the best sauce imaginable for pasta , fish , gnocchi and what not .
You can make crispy crostini and bruscetti with this sauce .
While enjoying the taste , we get many useful substances this sauce is rich with .
There is no thermal treatment involved , so all vitamins are preserved .
Ingredients for Pesto Genovese Sauce
50 - 60 g Parmesan cheese
100 - 150 g basil leaves
3 - 4 garlic cloves
½ cup ( 150 ml ) olive oil
30 - 40 g pine nuts
Salt to taste

Nick Nolte Injured in House Fire
Tropic
Thunder starsustained injuries this morning when his home caught fire and he tried to put the blaze out by himself .
The L.A. County fire department arrived on the scene at 11:34 a.m .
The damages are being estimated at $ 500,000 in content damages and $ 1,000,000 in structural damages .
The blaze was reportedly due to an electrical malfunction in the bedroom .
Nolte 's injuries were smoke inhalation and abrasions .
The actor was still at the grounds of his home and had not yet seen a doctor for his injuries , according to TMZ , though Nolte indicated he does plan to be checked out by his personal physician .

With President - elect Barack Obama tossing about multi-hundred - billion - dollar stimulus package numbers , everyone with some access to the incoming administration has plans about how to spend the cash .
Free Press is no exception ; the group , last seen prodding the FCC to act against Comcast for its P2P blocking techniques , has a plan for spending a modest $ 44 billion ( PDF ) over the next three years on broadband .
After all , if Obama wants to invest in infrastructure like highways , why not cough it up for the information superhighway ?
Compared to the $ 100 billion EDUCAUSE plan for " big broadband , " the Free Press scheme sounds like a bit of a bargain ( though it is perhaps less comprehensive in scope ) .
The goals of both groups are the same , though : 100 M bps pipes in both directions .
To get there , Free Press believes that most of the money should be pumped into the infrastructure side of the equation , putting the progressive group firmly in the supply - side camp .
The argument here is that broadband demand is strong but that it's not a good value , primarily because of lack of competition .
Thus , all the incentive plans call for building out broadband to underserved areas , only funding truly fast connections , and encouraging measures that might lead to something more than a cable / telco duopoly .
Room for improvement ( Source : OECD )
Most intriguing of these is the " competitive fiber tax incentive program " ( $ 5 billion ) in which tax credits are dished out to companies that lay multiple strands of fiber to an end user 's location .
The cost of such deployments is largely a function of paying for men and machines to dig up streets , sidewalks , and front yard ; the conduit and fiber is comparatively cheap .
Any company that wanted to upgrade its network or build a new fiber network could qualify for the credits so long as more than one strand of fiber goes in .
The extra fibers could then be sold to third parties or to the customer , a model that Switzerland has recently been experimenting with .
The other ideas are straightforward ( though not straightforward enough that we 're actually implementing them yet ) .
A full $ 20 billion of the $ 44 billion would be spent on Universal Service Fund projects to bring 5 M bps + connections to every home in America and provide wireless voice and data services to rural and underserved areas .
Companies that invest in broadband infrastructure could claim accelerated depreciation for that equipment ( $ 1.5 billion ) , though with the caveat that it must be new investment into much faster technology ; incremental and regularly - scheduled upgrades would not qualify .
On the demand side , Free Press envisions spending a total of $ 5.8 billion on subsidizing home Internet access in places where it 's available , but out of reach economically .
Funding would also go toward the Broadband Data Improvement Act , which directs the FCC to actually collect useful data on broadband deployments instead of how many people are served in a given ZIP code .
According to Free Press , the cash fits all the Obama goals for the stimulus .
It offers short - term help to telecom companies , workers , and equipment makers .
Long term , it will spur web businesses , telecommuting , education , e-health , smart grids , and more .
The plan also comes with a set of accountability criteria , including mandatory build - out schedules and audits .
Given the influence such groups will have with the incoming Obama tech team , and given the coalescing conviction among many groups that aiming for 100 M bps fiber has to be the goal of public investment , some version of the basic plan looks quite likely to pass in 2009 , whether it makes it into the initial stimulus package or not .
Obama , who may be the first US president to really " get " the Internet , has repeatedly stressed the importance of broadband infrastructure and network neutrality ; the real surprises will come when we see what actually gets passed , what Congress and the President are willing to spend on it , where the money goes , and just how accountable the entire payout will be .

Instead , I am writing to say good - bye .
Recently , on the front page of Section C of the Wall Street Journal , a hedge fund manager who was also closing up shop ( a $ 300 million fund ) , was quoted as saying , “ What I have learned about the hedge fund busines s is that I hate it . ”
I could not agree m ore with t hat statement .
I was in this game for the money .
The low hanging fruit , i.e. idiots whose parents paid for prep school , Yale , and then the Harvard M BA , was there fo r the taking .
These people who were ( often ) truly not worthy of the education they received ( or supposedly received ) rose to the top of companies such as AIG , Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and all levels of our government .
All of this behavior supporting the Aristocracy , only ended up making it easier for me to find people stupid enough to take the other side of my trades .
God bless America .
There are far too many people f or me to sincerely thank for my s uccess .
However , I do not want to sound like a Hollywood actor acc epting an award .

The PageRank algorithm is a great way of using collective intelligence to determine the importance of a webpage .
There ’s a big problem , though , which is that PageRank is difficult to apply to the web as a whole , simply because the web contains so many webpages .
While just a few lines of code can be used to implement PageRank on collections of a few thousand webpages , it ’s trickier to compute PageRank for larger sets of pages .
The underlying problem is that the most direct way to compute the PageRank of webpages involves inverting an matrix .
Even when is just a few thousand , this means inverting a matrix containing millions or tens of millions of floating point numbers .
This is possible on a typical personal computer , but it ’s hard to go much further .
In this post , I describe how to compute PageRank for collections containing millions of webpages .
My little laptop easily coped with two million pages , using about 650 megabytes of RAM and a few hours of computation – at a guess it would max out at about 4 to 5 million pages .
More powerful machines could cope with upwards of 10 million pages .
And that ’s with a program written in Python , an interpreted language not noted for its efficiency !
Of course , this number still falls a long way short of the size of the entire web , but it ’s a lot better than the naive approach .
In a future post I ’ll describe a more scalable parallel implementation that can be used to compute PageRank for hundreds of millions of pages .
Let ’s quickly run through the basic facts we need to know about PageRank .
The idea is that we number webpages .
For webpage number there is an associated PageRank which measures the importance of page .
The PageRank is a number between and ; the bigger the PageRank , the more important the page .
Furthermore , the vector of all the PageRanks is a probability distribution , that is , the PageRanks sum to one .
How is the PageRank vector computed ?
I ’ll just describe the mathematical upshot here ; the full motivation in terms of a crazy websurfer who randomly surfs the web is described in an earlier post .
The upshot is that the PageRank vector can be defined by the equation ( explanation below ) :
What this equation represents is a starting distribution for the crazy websurfer , and then steps of “ surfing ” , with each action of representing how the distribution changes in a single step .
is an - dimensional vector , and is an matrix whose entries reflect the link structure of the web in a way I ’ll describe below .
The PageRank is defined in the limit of large – in our examples , convergence occurs for in the range to .
You might wonder how is chosen , but part of the magic of PageRank is that it does n’t matter how is chosen , provided it ’s a probability distribution .
The intuition here is that the starting distribution for the websurfer does n’t matter to their long - run behaviour .
We ’ll therefore choose the uniform probability distribution , .
How is the matrix defined ?
It can be broken up into three pieces
which correspond to , respectively , a contribution representing the crazy websurfer randomly picking links to follow , a contribution due to the fact that the websurfer can’t randomly pick a link when they hit a dangling page ( i.e. , one with no outbound links ) , and so something else needs to be done in that case , and finally a contribution representing the websurfer getting bored and “ teleporting ” to a random webpage .
We ’ll set and as the respective probabilities for randomly selecting a link and teleporting .
See here for discussion of the reasons for this choice .
The matrix describes the link structure of the web .
In particular , suppose we define to be the number of links outbound from page .
Then is defined to be if page does not link to , and if page does link to page .
Stated another way , the entries of the th column of are zero , except at locations corresponding to outgoing links , where they are .
The intuition is that describes the action of a websurfer at page randomly choosing an outgoing link .
The matrix is included to deal with the problem of dangling pages , i.e. , pages with no outgoing links , where it is ambigous what it means to choose an outgoing link at random .
The conventional resolution is to choose another page uniformly at random from the entire set of pages .
What this means is that if is a dangling page , then the th column of should have all its entries , otherwise all the entries should be zero .
A compact way of writing this is
where is the vector of dangling pages , i.e. , the th entry of is if page is dangling , and otherwise is zero .
is the vector whose entries are all s .
The final piece of is the matrix , describing the bored websurfer teleporting somewhere else at random .
This matrix has entries everywhere , representing a uniform probability of going to another webpage .
Exercises
This exercise is for people who ’ve read my earlier post introducing PageRank .
In that post you ’ll see that I ’ve broken up in a slightly different way .
You should verify that the breakup in the current post and the breakup in the old post result in the same matrix .
Now , as we argued above , you quickly run into problems in computing the PageRank vector if you naively try to store all elements in the matrix or .
Fortunately , it ’s possible to avoid doing this .
The reason is that the matrices and all have a special structure .
is a very sparse matrix , since most webpages only link to a tiny fraction of the web as a whole , and so most entries are zero .
is not ordinarily sparse , but it does have a very simple structure , determined by the vector ( not matrix ! ) of dangling pages , , and this makes it easy to do vector multiplications involving .
Finally , the matrix is even more simple , and it ’s straightforward to compute the action of on a vector .
The idea used in our algorithm is therefore to compute by repeatedly multiplying the vector by , and with each multiplication using the special form to avoid holding anything more than - dimensional vectors in memory .
This is the critical step that lets us compute PageRank for a web containing millions of webpages .
The crux of the algorithm , therefore , is to determine for each index , where is an arbitrary vector .
We do this by computing and separately , and then summing the results , with the appropriate prefactors , or .
To compute , just observe that .
This can be computed by summing over all the pages which have links to page , with in each case .
We see that the total number of operations involved in computing all the entries in is , where is the total number of links in the web graph , a number that scales far more slowly than .
Furthermore , the memory consumed is .
I ’m being imprecise in analysing the number of operations and the memory consumption , not worrying about small constant factors .
If we were really trying to optimize our algorithm , we ’d be careful to keep track of exactly what resources are consumed , rather than ignoring those details .
However , as we ’ll see below , the advantages of the approach we ’re now considering over the approach based on matrix inversion are enormous , and so ignoring a few small factors is okay for the purposes of comparison .
To compute , observe that , and so it suffices to compute the inner product , which in the worst case requires operations , and memory , to store .
Finally , to compute is easy , since it is just , which requires virtually no additional computation or memory .
It follows that we can compute using a total number of operations , and total memory , and thus approximate the PageRank vector
with a total number of operations , and with memory consumption .
These are imposingly large numbers .
Suppose we have webpages , links , and use iterations .
Then the total amount of memory involved is on the order of floating point numbers , and the total number of operations is on the order of .
On the other hand , if we ’d used the method that required us to store the full matrix , we ’d have needed to store on the order of floating pointing numbers .
Furthermore using Gaussian elimination the matrix inversion requires on the order of operations , give or take a few ( but only a few ! ) orders of magnitude .
More efficient methods for matrix inverstion are known , but the numbers remain daunting .
The code
Let ’s think about how we ’d code this algorithm up in Python .
If you ’re not already familiar with Python , then a great way to learn is “ Dive into Python ” , an excellent free online introductory book about Python by Mark Pilgrim .
You can read the first five chapters in just a few hours , and that will provide you with enough basic understanding of Python to follow most code , and to do a lot of coding yourself .
Certainly , it ’s more than enough for all the examples in this post series .
The most important part of our implementation of PageRank is to choose our representation of the web in a compact way , and so that the information we need to compute can be retrieved quickly .
This is achieved by the following definition for a class web , whose instances represent possible link structures for the web :
class web : def __init__ ( self , n ) : self .size = n self .
in_links = {} self.number_out_links = {} self.dangling_pages = {} for j in xrange ( n ) : self.in_links[j ] = [ ] self.number_out_links[j ] = 0 self.dangling_pages[j ] =
True
Suppose g is an object of type web , created using , e.g. , g = web ( 3 ) , to create a web of 3 pages .
g.size = 3 for this web .
g.in_links is a dictionary whose keys are numbers for the webpages , 0,1,2 , and with corresponding values being lists of the inbound webpages .
These lists are initially set to contain no webpages :
g.in_links = { 0 : [ ] , 1 : [ ] , 2 : [ ]}
Note that in Python lists are indexed , and this makes it convenient to number pages , rather than , as we have been doing up to now .
The advantages of storing the in - links as a dictionary of lists are two - fold .
First , by using this representation , we store no more information than we absolutely need .
E.g. , we are not storing information about the absence of links , as we would be if we stored the entire adjacency matrix .
Second , Python dictionaries are a convenient way to store the information , because they do n’t require any ordering information , and so are in many ways faster to manipulate than lists .
You might be wondering why there is no attribute g.out_links in our class definition .
The glib answer is that we do n’t need it – after all , it can , in principle , be reconstructed from g.in_links .
A better answer is that in real applications it would quite sensible to also have g.out_links , but storing that extra dictionary would consume a lot of extra memory , and we avoid it since we can compute PageRank without it .
An even better answer would be to make use of a data structure that gives us the speed and convenience provided by both g.in_links and g.out_links , but only requires links to be stored once .
This can certainly be done , but requires more work , and so I ’ve avoided it .
Let ’s finish our description of the attributes of g .
g.number_out_links is a dictionary such that g.number_out_links[j ] is the number of out - links from page j .
Initially these values are all set to zero , but they will be incremented when links are added .
We need to store the number of outgoing links in order to compute the probabilities used in the PageRank algorithm , as described earlier .
While this could in principle be computed from the dictionary g.in_links , in practice that would be extremely slow .
Finally , g.dangling_pages is a dictionary whose key set is the set of dangling webpages .
The values of the keys are placeholders which are never used , and so we use True as a placeholder value .
Initially , all webpages are dangling , but we remove keys when links are added .
With these data structures in place , the rest of the program is a pretty straightforward implementation of the algorithm described earlier .
Here ’s the code :
# Generates a random web link structure , and finds the # corresponding PageRank vector .
The number of inbound # links for each page is controlled by a power law # distribution .
# #
This code should work for up to a few million pages on a # modest machine .
# # Written and tested using Python 2.5. import numpy import random class web : def __init__ ( self , n ) : self .size = n self .
in_links = {} self.number_out_links = {} self.dangling_pages = {} for j in xrange ( n ) : self.in_links[j ] = [ ] self.number_out_links[j ] = 0 self.dangling_pages[j ] = True def paretosample ( n , power=2.0 ) : ''' Returns a sample from a truncated Pareto distribution with probability mass function p( l ) proportional to 1/ l^power .

''' n = g.size v = numpy.matrix( numpy.zeros (( n,1 ) ) ) inner_product = sum ( [ p[j ] for j in g.dangling_pages.keys ( ) ] ) for j in xrange ( n ) : v[j ] = s*sum ( [ p[ k]/g.number_out_links[k ] for k in g.in_links[j ] ] )+s*inner_product/n+(1-s ) /n #
We rescale the return vector , so it remains a # probability distribution even with floating point # roundoff .
return v/numpy.sum( v ) def pagerank ( g, s=0.85,tolerance=0.00001 ) : ''' Returns the PageRank vector for the web g and parameter s , where the criterion for convergence is that we stop when M^( j+1 ) P-M^jP has length less than tolerance , in l1 norm . ''' n = g.size p = numpy.matrix ( numpy.ones ( ( n ,1 ) ) ) / n iteration = 1 change = 2 while change > tolerance : print " Iteration : %s " % iteration new_p = step ( g , p , s ) change = numpy.sum( numpy.abs ( p-new_p ) ) print " Change in l1 norm : %s " % change p = new_p iteration += 1 return p print ''' Now computing the PageRank vector for a random web containing 10000 pages , with the number of inbound links to each page controlled by a Pareto power law distribution with parameter 2.0 , and with the criterion for convergence being a change of less than 0.0001 in l1 norm over a matrix multiplication step . ''' g = random_web ( 10000,2.0 ) # works up to several million # pages .
pr = pagerank ( g,0.85,0.0001 )
As written , the code computes PageRank for a 10,000 page web , and I recommend you start with that number of pages , to check that the code runs .
Once that ’s done , you can change the parameter in the second last line to change the number of pages .
If you do that , you may wish to change the tolerance 0.0001 in the final line , decreasing it to ensure a tolerance more appropriate to the number of pages , say .
What determines the tolerance that should be used ?
I have used the norm to quantify the rate of convergence in the code , but that is a rather arbitrary measure .
In particular , an alternate measure might be to look at the magnitude of the differences between individual elements , computing , and requiring that it be substantially smaller than the minimal possible value for PageRank , .
This is less conservative , and arguably a more relevant measure ; the code is easily changed .
Exercises
The code above is complex enough that bugs are likely .
As a test , use an alternate method to compute PageRank for small web sizes , and compare your results against the output from the code above .
Do you believe the code is correct ?
Modify the program described in this lecture so that it works with a non-uniform teleportation vector , as described in an earlier post .
Python is a great language , but it ’s not designed with speed in mind .
Write a program in C to compute the PageRank for a random web .
Can you compute the PageRank for ten million pages ?
What ’s the largest number you ’re able to compute on a single machine ?

Everyone ’s talking about a new New Deal , for obvious reasons .
In 2008 , as in 1932 , a long era of Republican political dominance came to an end in the face of an economic and financial crisis that , in voters ’ minds , both discredited the G.O.P. ’s free - market ideology and undermined its claims of competence .
And for those on the progressive side of the political spectrum , these are hopeful times .
There is , however , another and more disturbing parallel between 2008 and 1932  namely , the emergence of a power vacuum at the height of the crisis .
The interregnum of 1932 - 1933 , the long stretch between the election and the actual transfer of power , was disastrous for the U.S. economy , at least in part because the outgoing administration had no credibility , the incoming administration had no authority and the ideological chasm between the two sides was too great to allow concerted action .
And the same thing is happening now .
It ’s true that the interregnum will be shorter this time : F.D.R. was n’t inaugurated until March ; Barack Obama will move into the White House on Jan. 20 .
But crises move faster these days .
How much can go wrong in the two months before Mr. Obama takes the oath of office ?
The answer , unfortunately , is : a lot .
Consider how much darker the economic picture has grown since the failure of Lehman Brothers , which took place just over two months ago .
And the pace of deterioration seems to be accelerating .
Here 's what 's inside Amazon.com 's limited - edition book of * Harry Potter * tales .
The Tales of Beedle the Bard , J.K. Rowling 's latest companion to the * Potter * series , hit stores Thursday .
Online retailer Amazon.com , which famously purchased an original handwritten copy of * Beedle at * auction last year for $ 2.86 million , is offering the special $ 100 version of the book that mimics the handwritten originals .
That 's a price that might scare away even the most dedicated fans of the boy wizard , although all proceeds from its sales ( and those of the standard $ 13 paperback ) are going to charity .

The front cover fits snugly into the depression that holds the book , so the case stays closed very well .
On the left , we 've got an envelope ; on the right , a burgundy pouch with JKR 's signature stitched in glittering gold thread .
The envelope contains prints that are exclusive to this collector 's edition .
The illustrations used in the book were drawn by Rowling .
Really nice quality paper and all .
Time to open the pouch .
What could be in here ?
Wow .
This is impressive .
The book is really heavy – it 's 180 pages of thick paper with a thick hardcover , and metal whats - its glued onto the front .
Hefting it is like holding a prop from a * Potter * movie .

The introduction , like in the original copies , is handwritten by Rowling .
But the text of the stories – thankfully !
– is not .
What do you think – was this worth $ 100 ?

As yet another indicator of the tough economic times for American families , bankruptcy filings spiked in the month of October .
According to the latest data from Automated Access to Court Electronic Records ( AACER ) , there were 108,595 total bankruptcy petitions filed in the month of October for an average of 4,936 for each of the 22 business days during the month .
October 2008 is the first time since the 2005 changes to the U.S. bankruptcy that there have been more than 100,000 bankruptcy filings in one month .
( Anyone looking for more sensational but less helpful headlines can focus on the absolute number of filings in October 2008 and ignore the fact that the month had one more business day than many other months . )
Why the increase ?
Obviously , one factor is the tough economic climate for everyone .
An important factor that is often ignored is that , in the short - term , decreases in the availability of credit actually drive up the bankruptcy filing rate .
I document this phenomenon and explain it in more detail in my paper , The Paradox of Consumer Credit .
Of course , in the long - run , bankruptcy filing rates rise hand - in - hand with increases in credit availability .
Over the short - term , however , bankruptcy filing rates as individuals find it more difficult to borrow to stave off the day of financial reckoning .
With the seizing up of the credit markets , the October bankruptcy numbers ( and the smaller increases in July , August , and September as I discuss below ) show this scenario has played out again .
“ It ’s all about accountability and viability , ” Ms. Pelosi said .
“ Until we can see a plan where the auto industry is held accountable and a plan for viability on how they go into the future  until we see the plan , until they show us the plan , we can not show them the money . ”

Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid called their news conference to pre-empt a bipartisan plan offered by senators from the states with big stakes in the auto industry , including Senator Christopher S. Bond , Republican of Missouri , and Senator Carl Levin , Democrat of Michigan .
Those senators proposed speeding up access to $ 25 billion in loans for the automakers that have already been approved by Congress by easing restrictions on that money .
The Congressional leaders said the Bond - Levin plan could not win passage this week .
Instead , they said , the House and Senate will hold hearings the week of Dec. 2 to consider plans put forward by the industry .
If the plans pass muster , they said that they were prepared to call Congress back in session to consider legislation the following week .
The hearings will be run by Barney Frank , Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , and Senator Christopher J. Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut , the chairman of the banking committee .
“ Unfortunately , the sad reality is that no one has come up with a plan that can pass the House and the Senate and be signed by President Bush , ” Mr. Reid said .
“ The executives of the auto companies have not been able to convince Congress or the American people that this government bailout will be its last . ”
For those of you concerned about the Fed ’s risky behavior , its ballooning balance sheet , and its acceptance of dodgy collateral , well you may be about to see whether the American democracy can allow this unchecked power to continue without oversight .
Bloomberg News has sued the Federal Reserve to force them to reveal what kind of collateral they are accepting in loaning out trillions of dollars to U.S. banks .
The Federal Reserve , a quasi - government body ( which strictly speaking is a private corporation in that it is owned by member banks ) , has been accepting assets of ever more dubious quality in a bid to liquify the U.S. banking system .
Moreover , their efforts should be considered highly inflationary and a long - term threat to the value of the U.S. dollar and to the American economy .
The Fed balance sheet is expected to balloon to $ 3 trillion by the end of the year , up from $ 900 billion in August — a rise in the Fed ’s balance sheet from 6 % of GDP to more than 20 % of GDP in four months .
In Japan , which was known for quantitative easing during its own deflationary crisis , the central bank ’s balance sheet rose progressively from 9 % of GDP to 29 % of GDP .
But this was over ten years from 1994 to 2004 .
At the current pace , the Fed might do in six months what it took ten years to do in Japan .
Amazing .
Below is the article from Bloomberg describing their bold lawsuit .
Bloomberg News asked a U.S. court today to force the Federal Reserve to disclose securities the central bank is accepting on behalf of American taxpayers as collateral for $ 1.5 trillion of loans to banks .
The lawsuit is based on the U.S. Freedom of Information Act , which requires federal agencies to make government documents available to the press and the public , according to the complaint .
The suit , filed in New York , does n’t seek money damages .
“ The American taxpayer is entitled to know the risks , costs and methodology associated with the unprecedented government bailout of the U.S. financial industry , ” said Matthew Winkler , the editor - in - chief of Bloomberg News , a unit of New York - based Bloomberg LP , in an e-mail .
The Fed has lent $ 1.5 trillion to banks , including Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , through programs such as its discount window , the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and the Term Securities Lending Facility .
Collateral is an asset pledged to a lender in the event that a loan payment is n’t made .
The Fed made the loans under 11 programs in response to the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression .
The total does n’t include an additional $ 700 billion approved by Congress in a bailout package .
Fed ’s Position
Bloomberg News on May 21 asked the Fed to provide data on the collateral posted between April 4 and May 20 .
The central bank said on June 19 that it needed until July 3 to search out the documents and determine whether it would make them public .
Bloomberg never received a formal response that would enable it to file an appeal .
On Oct. 25 , Bloomberg filed another request and has yet to receive a reply .
The Fed staff planned to recommend that Bloomberg ’s request be denied under an exemption protecting “ confidential commercial information , ” according to Alison Thro , the Fed ’s FOIA Service Center senior counsel .
The Fed in Washington has about 30 pages pertaining to the request , Thro said today before the filing of the suit .
The bulk of the documents Bloomberg sought are at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , which she said is n’t subject to the freedom of information law .
“ This type of information is considered highly sensitive , and it would remain so for some time in the future , ” Thro said .
The Fed did n’t give Bloomberg a formal response because “ it got caught in the vortex of the things going on here , ” said Michael O’Rourke , another member of the Fed ’s FOIA staff .
The case is Bloomberg LP v. Federal Reserve , U.S. District Court , Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ) .
UPDATE 8 NOV 2008 1000 AM ET – I have been doing some searches online for more information about the Federal Reserve and its status as a governmental organization subject to the FOIA .
This is what I turned up on their website .
Note , that the papers Bloomberg wants are largely at the NY Fed , run by potential Obama Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , and not in Washington , as the NY Fed performs most open market operations .
The Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) , 5 U.S.C. § 552 , generally provides that any person has a right of access to federal agency records , unless the records ( or any portion of the records ) are protected from disclosure by one of FOIA ’s nine exemptions or by one of three special law enforcement record exclusions .
The Federal Reserve Board ( Board ) maintains public and nonpublic records .
Public records are available at the Board ’ sconventional reading room and electronic reading room .
A FOIA request is not required to obtain these materials .
The submission of a FOIA request is required to obtain nonpublic records .
If you cannot locate the records or information you seek on the Board ’s web site , you may wish to file a FOIA request ( making a request ) .
You can find an overview of the Federal Reserve System in The Federal Reserve System : Purposes & Functions , which the Board publishes .
Additionally , information about the Federal Reserve System as well as general guidance to consumers on matters related to the Board ’s activities can be found at brochures .
For information from other federal banking regulators , you may want to search the following web sites :
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC )
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC )
Office of Thrift Supervision ( OTS )
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ( FFIEC )

To navigate the currents of ecological fate , most creatures adapt — but a few have stuck to their evolutionary guns .
Known as living fossils , they lasted for millions of years with barely a change , even as their relatives went extinct or took different paths across the tree of life .
Many are now threatened or endangered .
But with some luck and a little help , living fossils will be able to survive the age of humans , too .
The Purple frog , discovered just five years ago in western India , likely escaped detection because it lives underground , emerging for just two weeks during the monsoon season .
Distinguished by a pointed snout , it 's related to a family of frogs now found only on the Seychelles islands , which split from India 100 million years ago .

This has been a pretty momentous week for me , our first grand - child was born on Friday October 3rd , at 5:15 pm !
I had worked from home that day ; I had attended a conference call , written up notes from two other calls and spent six hours slaving over a hot spreadsheet .
At about five I decided that I deserved a beer and as I was heading down to The Curlew I received the call that little ’un had arrived so , needless to say , I wet the baby ’s head with a pint ( or two ) of my usual .
However , this was a pretty significant moment and deserved a more serious drink , and I knew just what was needed – you just know there ’s a story coming do n’t you ?
About twenty years ago my son , now the proud father , was working at our local brewery – Crouch Vale .
In those days it was pretty much a two men and a dog operation , and Gaz was the dog .
He did manage to inadvertently ‘ invent ’ one of their brews , but that ’s a story for another day .
While at Crouch Vale , he invested in a case of Thomas Hardy Ale – the 1985 vintage – brewed in those days by Eldridge Pope .
Thomas Hardy
Ale is legendary for being bottle conditioned and primed to continue maturing , it is said to be best after twenty years of maturation , but forty year old bottles can be found .
The case has been stored in my garage , and while we tried a bottle about ten years ago , after discussion with the proud father we agreed that the arrival of his first - born was a good justification for breaking open a bottle or two !
So with due reverence and a steady hand I opened the bottle and carefully poured it into a goblet .
An ale like this should be treated with respect .
This was bottle M51919 , and I put another bottle alongside the glass for the photograph .
As you can hopefully see the beer is a dark ruby colour , with no noticeable head , and no lacing on the glass .
The nose was closer to a sherry than any beer I ’ve tasted , this is beyond beer , this is where beer goes when it has a chance to grow up .
The flavour itself is again close to sherry , rich and vinous , with nothing to betray its humble hops and barley origins .
As you might expect , there ’s a full mouth experience and a distinct warming as you finally swallow .
As for the strength , I estimate this coming in in the upper teens , maybe 16 - 18 % alcohol , very waming .
And yes after a full 6.34 oz of the ale I knew I ’d had a drink !
All in all an interesting experience , I just hope we can save a few bottles for young Kelin ’s coming of age !

Illustration : Headcase Design Microsoft will issue an emergency security patch Wednesday for all versions of Internet Explorer .
The patch is considered a critical fix for the security flaw currently plaguing the IE browser .
So far , more than 2 million computers are believed to have been infected .
Vulnerability Protection
An advance notification of the patch published Tuesday describes it as protection for a " remote code execution " vulnerability .
The move follows Microsoft 's security advisory posted last Wednesday and updated Monday explaining the vulnerability and suggesting temporary " workarounds " for protection .
Serious Flaw
The flaw can be used to let attackers steal personal data such as passwords if a user visits a compromised Web site , of which at least 10,000 are thought to already exist .
Thus far , the vulnerability has been used primarily for grabbing gaming passwords for black market sales .
The hole could , however , potentially also be used to steal more sensitive information such as banking passwords and other private information .
Some security analysts had gone as far as to suggest all IE users switch to a competing browser until Microsoft found a suitable fix .
Getting the Patch
UPDATE : The patch is now available here .
Microsoft 's emergency security patch will become available Wednesday at 1 p.m. EST at the Microsoft Update site as well as at the Microsoft Download Center .
All users of IE5 , 6 , and 7 are advised to install it .
A separate patch is expected to be made available for users of IE8 Beta 2 .
Expect to see far more detail by midday Wednesday when Microsoft officially issues its security bulletin .
I have to admit once being not enamored of , but hopeful about the candidacy of Barack Obama .
In “ The Year of the Insurgents , ” I underlined why I thought the conventional wisdom about this election year was dead wrong , and I was right about that .
But what I was n’t right about was the extent to which Obama would be willing to deviate from the foreign policy elite ’s party line when it comes to the pressing issues of the day .
We all know where Obama is right  or , as we used to say in the Sixties , “ right on . ”
The importance of negotiations , the profound strategic and moral wrongness of the Iraq war , the sheer craziness of a neocon - run foreign policy  these are the basics that have brought many millions to rally ’ round Obama ’s banner .
They were also the reasons for my initial enthusiasm for the previously unknown senator from Illinois , aside , that is , from his apparent thoughtfulness and his seemingly inherent presidential mien .
As the campaign progressed , however , it soon became all too obvious that a candidate raised up by the “ antiwar ” wing of the Democratic Party was and is a committed interventionist  and , not only that , but one who is still maintaining some of the hoariest old clichés of interventionist dogma , such as the apparently intrinsic aggressiveness that animates the Russian elite , the supposed centrality of Israel ’s security to our policy in the Middle East , and the moral imperative of “ humanitarian ” interventionism , starting in Darfur and ending God knows where .
His speech to the AIPAC conference was , perhaps , the low point of his campaign : the pandering , once started , did n’t stop .
Of course , we had been warned when , early on , he declared an attack on Iran was n’t “ off the table , ” and his reiteration of this stance in front of Israel ’s amen corner  he would , he averred , do “ everything , and I mean everything ” to stop Iran from going nuclear  was hardly composed to offer us any solace .
Everything ?
Really ?
What about dropping nukes on Tehran or other major population centers ?
I do n’t want to exaggerate the degree of Obama ’s slide into a moral abyss , but the man is known to measure his words , yet that time he clearly abandoned his customary caution , and , as they say , let it all hang out .
The mask slipped , if only for a moment  and it was n’t pretty , was it ?
On another vitally important issue , the renewal of the Cold War with Russia  a project dear to the hearts of neocons everywhere 
Obama is hardly distinguishable from John McCain .
Indeed , as I pointed out in my analysis of the last debate , the two of them seemed to be competing to see who could be more warlike and provocative when it came to the issue of the Caucasus .
Particularly disturbing is Obama ’s complete denial of what happened in Tskhinvali , the Ossetian capital city , when the Georgians went in and slaughtered hundreds of innocent civilians .
The candidate echoed the War Party ’s bizarre inversion of the established facts , insisting that Russia had invaded Georgia , instead of Georgia invading Ossetia and Abkhazia .
This is no small point : Obama deliberately overlooked the very real human cost of President Mikheil Saakashvili ’s Napoleonic ambitions in the region , because there can be no doubt he knows better .
As McCain gleefully pointed out during the first debate , the Obama campaign initially took a very different position , decrying violence on both sides and calling for a cease - fire .
In McCain ’s view , giving the thousands of Ossetians slaughtered by Saakashvili any acknowledgment at all is inexcusable .
Outside of that , however , McCain is right : Obama did indeed change his position , perhaps after due consultation with his advisers .
This is strong circumstantial evidence that he did have at least some idea of what really went on in Ossetia , and subsequently chose to ignore it .
This is not just an obscure foreign policy point with major moral implications  it is a huge issue , having to do not only with the regional secessionist movements that beleaguer Russia ’s “ near abroad , ” but also with the much larger question of whether we are going to face off with the Kremlin in a replay of the Cold War years .
Absent the existence of international communism as an organized movement centrally directed from Moscow , a new Cold War would seem an impossibility  but do n’t worry , the War Party is quite capable of pulling it off , as we have seen .
Since Putin ’s rise to power , we have heard the drumbeat loud and clear : Russia is “ resurgent , ” the Kremlin is in a newly “ aggressive ” mode , and Russian “ authoritarianism ” is on the march .
Well , to be sure , Russia is no libertarian paradise : far from it .
Yet , looked at objectively , the Russians have come a very long way since the days of the gulag .
Vladimir Putin ’s many Western critics compare his rule to that of his predecessor , former Communist Party local chieftain Boris Yeltsin , and somehow conclude that Yeltsin ’s regime was freer .
But Yeltsin ’s Russia was the closest to a genuine kleptocracy that the world has yet seen .
Those who looted the Russian economy took everything , including the kitchen sink , stashing a great deal of their stolen cash in Western bank accounts .
Today , the exiled oligarchs lash out at Putin ’s Russia because they ’re all on the lam  under indictment for truly spectacular acts of larceny that make our own quite considerable financial scandals pale in comparison .
How much of this cash is finding its way into the Obama campaign , perhaps indirectly , is hard to say .
What is n’t hard to say , however , is that Obama has the full support of one of the world ’s chief Russophobes : George Soros , the man who almost single - handedly funded the network of “ pro-democracy ” and pro-Bosniak front groups that brought us NATO ’s war on the former Yugoslavia .
As much as Obama denounces the Iraq war , all the factors present in the Iraqi adventure were present in Bill Clinton ’s Balkan escapade , up to and including the existence of a “ pro-U.S. ” guerrilla group that provided us with “ intelligence ” later exposed as pure invention .
In both cases , the outcome of U.S. intervention was the ascent of a violent and authoritarian group to power .
Additionally , in Kosovo , as in Iraq , the triumphant U.S. - supported faction carried out ethno- religious “ cleansing ” that involved the death and displacement of many thousands .
Yet all of this has been conveniently overlooked by the Western media and the “ antiwar ” liberals who hate George Bush but valorize the Clintons as the “ saviors ” of the Balkans .
These same liberals will follow Obama into battle wherever he chooses to intervene  of that we can be sure .
It ’s the same old partisan politics , and one of the unfortunate facts of life that weighs particularly heavy on us here at Antiwar.com .
It ’s just something we ’ve always had to live with and have learned to endure .
In the 1990s , when the Clintons were in power and Milosevic was the Hitler du jour , many conservatives gravitated toward anti-interventionism  and this Web site .
During the Bush II era , that changed rather dramatically , with the War Party taking up residence on the Right , and the peaceniks returning to their contemporary stomping grounds on the Left .
This reversal of polarities has happened before  indeed , I once wrote a whole book about how the phenomenon has played out in the history of modern American politics  and it ’s dizzying to contemplate how many more times it will reoccur .
Standing above the partisan fray , defying the rather outmoded categories of “ Left ” and “ Right , ” Antiwar.com will continue to warn its readers of the dangers posed by all political factions to the peace of the world .
Yes , we ’ve had a very rough eight years , and it will , indeed , be a welcome relief to confront a new adversary in the White House  and , make no mistake about it , if and when Obama is elected president , he will be an adversary , and a most formidable one .
Unlike George W. , he ’ll be an articulate exponent of his brand of interventionism , which promises to be no less dangerous simply because it ’s less brazen than its predecessor .
During the Obama years  if I may be so bold as to project that far into the speculative future  a great portion of the “ antiwar ” Left will fall away and eagerly sign up for whatever military crusades Obama has in store for us .
On the other hand , a growing faction of the Right will remember their Clinton - era “ isolationism ” ( i.e. , opposition to wars that have nothing to do with America ’s real interests ) and find their way back to this Web site .
In any case , no matter who wins in November , we ’re more than ready for him , because we start with the understanding that he is our adversary .
We have no illusions about the candidates who are running for the White House this year , and none about the two “ major ” parties whose institutionalization , in law and custom , belies the “ democratic ” virtues we supposedly embody as a nation .
We face the future without any hope of a quick victory .
Long - term optimism married to short - term pessimism : that ’s my own strategic outlook and personal temperament .
As a guiding editorial standard for Antiwar.com , it ’s served us well .
America ’s bid to become a global empire is a project that can end only one of two ways : in utter disaster  financially , as well as militarily and morally  or as a disastrous course averted just in time .
We are fighting , day and night , to ensure the latter result .
But there are no guarantees .
The illusions generated by the Obama campaign will be dissipated soon enough .
Until then , however , you know you can turn to this Web site for clear - headed and nonpartisan commentary on what ’s really going on in the world of foreign affairs  analysis without illusions .

Gazing into the future of a carbon market , two things seem certain : a fundamental change to the economy and sweeping land reforms .
There are two well known and highly charged sayings about land :
— –agriculture is the foundation of economic growth
— –all land use is inherently political
The fast approaching world of a carbon market could see how we use land becoming the most important issue in stopping climate change becoming a disaster for mankind .
Forestry immediately springs to mind .
The Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change in 2009 is expected to incorporate rainforests into global emissions trading , and many carbon offsetting schemes rely upon plant - a- tree initiatives .
Biofuel crops are another example .
These are being developed for agricultural use with the twin aim of reducing carbon emissions and providing an alternative for ever more expensive petroleum based gas .
Now the idea of using wetlands as a carbon sink is starting to gain traction .
As an alternative for carbon storage they have been compared favourably to rainforests and with good reason .
A recent study by the US Geographical Survey has found that restoring drained farmland to wetlands is 30 times more effective at storing carbon than planting forests .
What is more , wetlands are a global habitat available across the world in all climatic conditions .
Their use , management and preservation look set to becoming an imperative in staving off runaway climate change .
Rethinking Environmental Management and Land Use
[ social_buttons ]
However , it need not end there .
Initiatives to work with the natural environment instead of seeking to dominate it should be developed alongside technical and scientific efforts to combat climate change .
For example , the EU has been tinkering with a policy of requiring proportion farmland be “ set aside ” for wildlife for over two decades .
The policy is a direct acknowledgement that we rely upon local and global network of interlinking eco-systems and similar realisation of the interconnected ecology of our environment seems to be growing at the highest levels in the USA .
From the perspective of a carbon market , this realisation could place the Bureau of Land Management , private farmers and various conservation groups at the heart of a carbon neutral economy .
A new Land Management sector could emerge , unifying these now disparate concerns and making them as powerful as oil is today .
However , such a shift would also be inherently political .
The USA may have elected a “ time for change ” president , but there are other , deeper changes going on whose ultimate outcome no politician or economist can fully predict .
The challenges and changes are only just beginning .

Advertisement Surgeons in Spain have carried out the world 's first tissue - engineered whole organ transplant - using a windpipe made with the patient 's own stem cells .
The groundbreaking technology also means for the first time tissue transplants can be carried out without the need for anti-rejection drugs .
Five months on the patient , 30 - year - old mother - of - two Claudia Castillo , is in perfect health , The Lancet reports .
She needed the transplant to save a lung after contracting tuberculosis .
The Colombian woman 's airways had been damaged by the disease .
Scientists from Bristol helped grow the cells for the transplant and the European team believes such tailor - made organs could become the norm .
To make the new airway , the doctors took a donor windpipe , or trachea , from a patient who had recently died .
A pre-surgery CT - the arrow showing the windpipe narrowing
Then they used strong chemicals and enzymes to wash away all of the cells from the donor trachea , leaving only a tissue scaffold made of the fibrous protein collagen .
This gave them a structure to repopulate with cells from Ms Castillo herself , which could then be used in an operation to repair her damaged left bronchus - a branch of the windpipe .
How windpipe transplant works
By using Ms Castillo 's own cells the doctors were able to trick her body into thinking the donated trachea was part of it , thus avoiding rejection .
Two types of cell were taken from Ms Castillo : cells lining her windpipe , and adult stem cells - very immature cells from the bone marrow - which could be encouraged to grow into the cells that normally surround the windpipe .
I was very much afraid .
Before this , we had been doing this work only in pigs
Surgeon Professor Paolo Macchiarini of the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona , Spain
' I was scared , but it went well '
Surgery nearly scuppered After four days of growth in the lab in a special rotating bioreactor , the newly - coated donor windpipe was ready to be transplanted into Ms Castillo .
Her surgeon , Professor Paolo Macchiarini of the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona , Spain , carried out the operation in June
He said : " I was very much afraid .
Before this , we had been doing this work only on pigs .
" But as soon as the donor trachea came out of the bioreactor it was a very positive surprise . "
He said it looked and behaved identically to a normal human donor trachea .
The trachea graft ready for transplantation
The operation was a great success and just four days after transplantation the hybrid windpipe was almost indistinguishable from adjacent normal airways .
After a month , a biopsy of the site proved that the transplant had developed its own blood supply .
And with no signs of rejection four months on , Professor Macchiarini says the future chance of rejection is practically zero .
" We are terribly excited by these results , " he said .
" She is enjoying a normal life , which for us clinicians is the most beautiful gift . "
Today Ms Castillo is living an active , normal life , and once again able to look after her children Johan , 15 , and Isabella , four .
She can walk up two flights of stairs without getting breathless .
I was a sick woman , now I will be able to live a normal life
Claudia Castillo Professor Martin Birchall , professor of surgery at the University of Bristol who helped grow the cells for the transplant , said : " This will represent a huge step change in surgery .
" Surgeons can now start to see and understand the potential for adult stem cells and tissue engineering to radically improve their ability to treat patients with serious diseases . "
He said that in 20 years time , virtually any transplant organ could be made in this way .
US scientists have already successfully implanted bladder patches grown in the laboratory from patients ' own cells into people with bladder disease .
The European research team , which also includes experts from the University of Padua and the Polytechnic of Milan in Italy , is applying for funding to do windpipe and voice box transplants in cancer patients .
Clinical trials could begin five years from now , they said .
Between 50,000 and 60,000 people are diagnosed with cancer of the larynx each year in Europe , and scientists say about half them may be suitable candidates for tissue engineering transplants .

These astonishing images show a vast tent city housing thousands of Muslims in Saudi Arabia for the holy hajj pilgrimage .
Other pictures show tens of thousands of Muslims swarming the Kabaa , Islam 's holiest shrine .
Up to three million Muslims joined in on the hajj pilgrimage , performing stoning symbols of the devil to symbolize rejection of temptation and a new , purified self .
Thousands of tents housing Muslim pilgrims are crowded together in Mina near Mecca , today
Thousands throng the roads into and through the sprawling city
Later in the day , pilgrims enjoyed a feast of freshly slaughtered sheep , goats and camels at a huge tent city in Mina , a desert valley east of Islam 's holiest city , Mecca , where the Kabaa resides .
Similar sacrifices , marking the start of the Eid al - Adha , or Feast of the Sacrifice , were carried out by Muslims around the world .
The holiday commemorates a story celebrated by Muslims , Jews and Christians in which God asked the prophet Abraham to sacrifice his son to prove his faith , but then in the end offered a sheep to kill instead .
Muslim tradition says it was at Mina , 3 miles ( 5 kilometres ) from Mecca , that the devil tried to tempt Abraham to disobey God by refusing to sacrifice his son .
This aerial image made from a helicopter shows tens of thousands of Muslim pilgrims moving around the Kaaba , the black cube seen at centre
Saudi policemen monitor CCTV screens of Muslims performing the annual hajj pilgrimage today
Hordes of pilgrims dressed in their white robes streamed across Mina valley yesterday toward three walls symbolizing the devil known as the Jamarat , chanting " at thy service , my God , at thy service . "
The massive crowds streamed through a four - story platform the size of an airport terminal built around the walls , and each pilgrim stoned the largest wall with pebbles collected earlier on the nearby rocky plain of Muzdalifah .
They will return on each of the final two days of the five - day pilgrimage , which ends tomorrow , to stone all three walls .
The stoning ritual has caused frequent stampedes that have killed more than a thousand pilgrims in past pilgrimages .
More than 1,400 people were killed in 1990 in a stampede in a tunnel leading to the Jamarat .
In 2006 , over 360 people died in a similar incident while they were on a platform performing the stoning ritual .
Turned on its head : A helicopter view of the city
Col .
Khaled al - Mahmadi , the head of security at the Jamarat , said precautionary measures have been taken to avoid a stampede - including expanding the Jamarat platform from two to the current four stories to provide more room for the pilgrims .
" We have become experts in crowd management after handling enormous gatherings on the Jamarat over the years , " he said .
Al - Mahmadi said authorities have banned pilgrims from carrying baggage during the stoning because it can cause people to stumble and fall , causing panic and injuries .
Police have also set up one - way routes to and from the Jamarat monitored by cameras to avoid congestion .
Helicopters flew overhead yesterday to monitor the crowd , and policemen and volunteers on the streets called out , " Yalla , ya hajj " - " Hurry up , pilgrim . "
After the stoning , many of the male pilgrims shaved their heads - the mark of a Muslim who has completed the hajj .
Female pilgrims cut a clip of their hair .
" Now , I feel the burden of sin is off my shoulders .
I feel free and purified , " said Kheirkhah , an Iranian pilgrim .
Bunches of hair littered the pavement around him at the foot of the Jamarat platform .
Islam requires that all Muslims who are financially and physically able to perform the hajj at least once in their lifetime .
The pilgrimage is supposed to cleanse Muslims of their sin .
The hajj begins and ends in the holy city of Mecca , the birthplace of the 7th century Prophet Mohammed and the site of Islam 's holiest shrine , the Kaaba .

A BAPTIST pastor has admitted telling Jewish leaders that Jews were " going to hell " and faced a fate " worse than the Holocaust " because they had not accepted Jesus as their saviour .
But Pastor Kevin Harris of the Illawarra Community Baptist Church in Wollongong says his comments were " misunderstood and misquoted " in a mass email circulated yesterday by the chief of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies , Vic Alhadeff .
Mr Harris , a US - trained minister from Virginia , said his comments applied to all people who rejected Jesus , not only Jews , and were based in scripture .
" The Bible says that all have sinned and all are worthy of hell , " he told the Herald .
" That includes everyone , until we receive Jesus as our saviour .
" Jesus and the Apostles were Jewish .
They explained that the Old Testament Jewish faith looked forward to the messiah and the New Testament reveals Jesus as the messiah . "
But despite Mr Harris 's attempt to clarify his remarks , Mr Alhadeff said he was shocked to hear the leader of a Christian congregation speak so bluntly .
We interrupt your regularly scheduled program to look into an argument that is starting to annoy the tits out of me .
One of the most frequent arguments against Communism that I seem to face almost every day now , is the one that says that human nature is such that a system based on cooperation and altruism could never be achieved .
The claim is that this human nature is necessarily greedy , competitive , aggressive and whatnot .
With such a nature then it ’s only understandable that we ’d have wars , poverty and capitalism as these are the only things that our nature is compatible with .
It ’s then no wonder that Communism has failed every time it was attempted .
It went against human nature !
Nevermind other factors , it was doomed to failure from the start .
These interpretations basically take the view that human nature is generally “ flawed ” and is such that only under Capitalism can it be somehow tamed .
It is with such reasoning that white becomes black and vices become virtues in order to defend the current system .
Against the human nature argument one cannot win for nobody can escape his nature .
Or can they ?
The point of calling something a human nature is that a human cannot escape or avoid it .
I cannot avoid eating for it is my nature to need energy .
Perhaps at some indefinite point in the future we might arrange that we wo n’t need food anymore but we ’ll certainly still need energy , thus our nature remains .
The same goes with anything else that we cannot escape .
And this is where evolutionary psychology comes in and tell us that we have genetical predispositions to various behaviours .
Fight or Flight , children ’s language learning capability etc .
One of these predispositions is then posited to be Competition and thus that the human society must be organised in a way that Competition is put to good use .
Ergo Capitalism .
Putting aside the quite large controversy around Evolutionary Phychology itself , I have the following arguments :
Reason
If one thing is said to certainly be part of our nature , then that is our ability to reason and use logical arguments .
Indeed we are the only known animal that uses it so one can easily even call it our defining nature .
It is the only reason why humans are capable of introspection and thus of managing their own predispositions .
It is with reason that not only can we control our psychological predispositions , but even our biological ones .
It is because of it that I can suppress my urge to eat because I am overweight .
It is because of reason that men can suppress urges to rape women when they otherwise could and are driven to it by their biology .
And it is because of it , that I can suppress whatever urge I have to compete or simply turn it into a noble or friendly competition .
Thus , the strongest and undeniable part of human nature , indeed the one that can be said to be defining humans , is the one that allows us to control all other parts of our nature , whatever they may be .
This means that even if , theoretically , competition , greed or whatever else is in our nature but it is against our benefits , we have the innate capability to suppress it .
Cooperation VS Competition
Humans are a social animal , that much is certain .
As such we have a definite predisposition towards cooperation with other humans .
But is it stronger than any predisposition we may have towards competition ?
I believe that is the case .
Someone reading about the origins of the family and the state can easily see how before civilization , the humans were barely competitive with each other at all .
Within a gentile community , the predominant behaviour was of mutual cooperation and the further back one goes into the stages of barbarism and then savagery , the more powerful this cooperation becomes .
This is simply because the less tools and ability humans had to survive independently , the more they had to cooperate with each other to survive .
The only cause of competition that could have happened , was when meeting another band of humans and there was a lack of resources to go around .
Then , as a results of humans being separated into haves and have - nots , competition emerged .
Other than that , there was no other competition to be had .
Their societies were ones of group marriages and thus there was not even male competition for women .
This cooperative method of living persisted for millions of years with the strongest forms of cooperation lasting longer ( as the lesser forms of evolutionary progress lasted longer ) until eventually , roughly 9000 years ago , humans enterred civilization .
It is with civilization that the monogamy , private property and the state emerged .
This was the reason why humans were separated , for the first time in history , into classes .
And it is because of the friction between those classes that competition became the fact of life .
The larger the society grew , the bigger the class separation , the larger the gap with other humans in one ’s society ,
The impression of individual independence grew even though it is patently false .
Nevertheless , the human within a huge society finds it impossible to perceive it and ends up assuming that he actually has no codependence on other humans .
Thus in this vast society , competition feels like the only choice , add to that the constant reinforcement of this idea by popular media and memes and it ’s no wonder that this feels like “ human nature ” .
But what do you think is evolutionary stronger .
Cooperation which lasted millions of years or competition which in the grand scheme of things is as long as a blink of an eye ?
Not only logic but simple empirical evidence points to the former .
Cooperation survives even in the most hostile environment of Capitalism – the system which honestly expects people to act rationally and individualistic and ends up having to work with emotional cooperative humans .
And to top it all off , we still have reason , as explained above , which can further suppress competition in favor of cooperation when warranted .
If there is any truth to evolutionary psychology , it is as Marx noted , in that humans have the nature of cooperation and individualism .
Our nature do not prevent Communism at all , it yearns for it , for it is both in all of our best interests and also closer to our psychology .

" 20.000 pakistanische Soldaten an die Grenze zu Indien verlegt " : Da hatten international die Alarmglocken geläutet .
Nach den terroristischen Angriffen auf die indische Metropole Bombay war der Druck auf die pakistanische Führung verstärkt worden , die mutmaßlichen Hintermänner aufzuspüren und dingfest zu machen .
Die Spannungen nahmen unverkennbar wieder zu .
Nun signalisierte die Regierung in Islamabad den Willen zur Deeskalation des Konflikts .
Premier Gilani versichert Friedenswillen Pakistans
" Wir wollen nicht kämpfen , wir wollen keinen Krieg , wir wollen keine Aggression im Verhältnis zu unseren Nachbarn " , beteuerte Ministerpräsident Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani am Samstag ( 27.12.2008 ) in einer Fernsehansprache nach den Geheimdienstmeldungen über einen Aufmarsch an der Grenze .
Er betonte jedoch auch , die pakistanischen Streitkräfte seien voll darauf vorbereitet , einen etwaigen indischen Angriff zu erwidern .
Man spreche " nicht über Krieg " und " nicht über Rache " , der " Dialog " sei die stärkste Waffe , hatte auch Präsident Asif Ali Zardari versichert , bei einer Gedenkzeremonie für seine ermordete Ehefrau , die frühere Ministerpräsidentin Benazir Bhutto .
Alles nur " Kriegshysterie " in Pakistan ?
Am Samstag war noch über die Entsendung von weiteren 1300 Soldaten von der Westgrenze zu Afghanistan an die Ostgrenze zu Indien berichtet worden .
Die Streitkräfte äußerten sich zunächst nicht selbst zu diesen Meldungen .
Beobachter werteten die Entwicklung gleichwohl als deutliches Signal , dass Islamabad auch Vergeltungsschläge plane für den Fall , dass Indien die Stützpunkte mutmaßlicher Extremisten auf pakistanischem Territorium angreife .
Mehr als 160 Menschen starben bei der Anschlagsserie auf Luxushotels in Bombay
Der indische Außenminister Pranab Mukherjee sprach von " Kriegshysterie " , die im Nachbarland ausgelöst worden sei .
Pakistan wolle nur vom eigentlichen Problem ablenken , zitiert die Nachrichtenagentur PTI den Minister .
Statt Truppen an der Grenze zu Indien zu verstärken , solle man sich auf die Bekämpfung von Terroristen konzentrieren und die Verantwortlichen für die Anschläge von Bombay verhaften , so Mukherjee .
Indien beschuldigt die Extremisten der Lashkar - e - Taiba ( LeT ) in Kaschmir , für die Überfälle auf Luxushotels in Bombay verantwortlich zu sein , denen Ende November mehr als 160 Menschen zum Opfer fielen .
Die Regierung in Neu - Delhi hat eine militärische Option gegen die Drahtzieher nicht ausgeschlossen .
Der Konflikt zwischen den beiden Atommächten reicht in die Zeit der Auflösung des britischen Kolonialregimes 1947 zurück .
Seitdem haben Indien und Pakistan drei Kriege gegeneinander geführt . ( sc )
Bettie Page , a legendary pinup girl whose photographs in the nude , in bondage and in naughty - but - nice poses appeared in men ’s magazines and private stashes across America in the 1950s and set the stage for the sexual revolution of the rebellious ’ 60s , died Thursday in Los Angeles .
She was 85 .
Her death was reported by her agent , Mark Roesler , on Ms. Page ’s Web site , bettiepage.com .
Ms. Page , whose popularity underwent a cult - like revival in the last 20 years , had been hospitalized for three weeks with pneumonia and was about to be released Dec. 2 when she suffered a heart attack , said Mr. Roesler , of CMG Worldwide .
She was transferred in a coma to Kindred Hospital , where she died .
In her trademark raven bangs , spike heels and killer curves , Ms. Page was the most famous pinup girl of the post - World War II era , a centerfold on a million locker doors and garage walls .
She was also a major influence in the fashion industry and a target of Senator Estes Kefauver ’s anti-pornography investigators .

But in 1957 , at the height of her fame , she disappeared , and for three decades her private life  two failed marriages , a fight against poverty and mental illness , resurrection as a born - again Christian , years of seclusion in Southern California  was a mystery to all but a few close friends .

For more than a month , Israel has imposed a tightened blockade over Gaza ’s one million and a half residents .
Outside aid is forbidden which is why , on Monday , December 1 , the Israeli navy blocked a Libyan ship carrying 3,000 tons of food and medical aid from entering Gaza ,
Israel ’s attempt to clamp a media blackout on the suffering in Gaza did not prevent Israeli journalist Amira Hass from defying the blockade .
Hass , who works now from Ramallah , entered Gaza from the sea , traveling on a boat with international peace activists .
Hass worked for three years as a correspondent in Gaza for the Jerusalem newspaper , Ha’aretz , after which she wrote her ( essential reading ) book , Drinking the Sea at Gaza , a personal story about life under an earlier siege in Gaza in the mid-1990s .
( The book ’s title may be translated from Arabic as a defiant , “ you can go to hell ” ) .
What she found in Gaza on this trip , she told Amy Goodman in a Democracy Now interview , were Gazans who felt like they were living in a “ black hole ” .
This siege .
any siege that punishes an entire population , is immoral .
An immoral act is an action we perform deliberately and with forethought even when we are fully aware that what we are doing is immoral .
A siege contributes nothing to the security of the nation that imposes it .
I believe Barack Obama knows this .
He also knows that the siege of Gaza is a deliberate , ongoing , unrelenting attack on a helpless population , a siege that is fully endorsed and financially backed by the government of the United States .
To be sure , Israel is the front line actor in this immoral conduct .
But Israel would not be maintaining this siege without the blessing of the United States government .
The American media has been conditioned to look the other way in matters involving Israel , which is why the American public remains largely ignorant of what is happening to young boys like the one above , staring from the window in his home in Rafah on the Egyptian border .
Barack Obama is not an ignorant man .
He knows what is happening in Gaza .
Soon it will be happening on his watch .
Still , he remains silent .
This is our new leader who promised us a different vision when he introduced his national security team with a statement that included these words :
To succeed , we must pursue a new strategy that skillfully uses , balances , and integrates all elements of American power : our military and diplomacy ; our intelligence and law enforcement ; our economy and the power of our moral example .
( emphasis added )
Continued support and funding for the siege in Gaza is immoral .
To fail to say this is to close our ears and shut our eyes to the sick , the weak , and the hungry .
This is immoral .
To deliberately and consistently violate the human rights of an entire population , is immoral .
Still Barack Obama remains silent .
Barack Obama has taught US constitutional law .
He knows international law .
It is no secret to him that as Stephen Lendman has written :
Israel is a serial human rights international law abuser .
The UN Human Rights Commission affirms that it violates nearly all 149 articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention that governs the treatment of civilians in war and under occupation and is guilty of grievous war crimes .
The Commission also determined that as an occupying power Israel has committed crimes against humanity as defined under the 1945 Nuremberg Charter .
. . . . . . .
The world community has been silent .
Conditions continue to deteriorate , and Christian Aid is speaking out .
It accused Israel of collective punishment in violation of international law .
Under Fourth Geneva ’s Article 33 : “ No protected person ( under occupation ) may be punished for an offense he or she has not personally committed .
Collective penalties and likewise all measure of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited ( as well as ) Reprisals against protected persons and their property . ”
International law is designed to protect the unprotected .
Lendman writes of specific examples of the impact of the siege on Gaza residents :
Costa Dabbagh from the Near East Council of Churches ( a Christian Aid partner ) says “ Simply letting food into Gaza is not enough , ” and precious little is arriving .
Its people “ are fed and kept alive without dignity and the international community should be blamed for it . ”
It ’s “ not acceptable to be waiting for food to come .
( Gazans ) want to live freely with Israel and other countries in peace .
( They ’re ) not against any individual or government ( but ) are against imprisonment . ”
In March , 1998 , before George Bush replaced Bill Clinton as Israel ’s Best Friend Ever in the White House , and back when Barack Obama was an Illinois state senator , International law expert Francis Boyle proposed that “ the Provisional Government of ( Palestine ) and its President institute legal proceedings against Israel before the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) in the Hague for violating the ” Genocide Convention .
Boyle also stated that “ Israel has indeed perpetrated the international crime of genocide against the Palestinian people ( and the ) lawsuit would …. demonstrate that undeniable fact to the entire world . ”
I believe this is information that is well known to Barack Obama .
So why has he not demanded an end to the siege of Gaza ?
He is no longer running for president ; he no longer must worry about money nor votes , at least not for four years , by which time his actions could have made him a true friend of Israel .
Not the sort of false friends Clinton and Bush have been .
How do we recognize a true friend of Israel ?
Israeli columnist Gideon Levy knows :
. . .
Bush was a friend of Israel .
. . [ who let Israel ] embark on an unnecessary war in Lebanon .
He did not prevent the construction of a single outpost .
He may have encouraged Israel , in secret , to bomb Iran .
He did not pressure Israel to move ahead with peace talks , he even held up negotiations with Syria , and he did not reproach Israel for its policy of targeted killings .
Bush also supported the siege on Gaza and participated in the boycott of Hamas , which was elected in a democratic election initiated by his own administration .
That ’s just how we [ Israelis ] like U.S. presidents .
They give us a green light to do as we please .
They fund , equip and arm us , and sit tight .
Such is the classic friend of Israel , a friend who is an enemy , and enemy of peace and an enemy to Israel .
Let us now hope that Obama will not be like them .
That he will reveal himself to be a true friend of Israel .
Barack Obama is aware that true friends want only the best for others .
Friends do not enable others to cling to the fiction that security comes from oppressing others .
Friends help others to realize that immoral behavior carries its own seeds of destruction .
Barack Obama knows this .
Yet he remains silent on Gaza .
In an essay for the Electronic Intafada , President Obama and the Prospects for Israeli - Palestinian Peace , Ali Abunimah looks back at the destructive behavior of the Bush administration .
It is not a pretty picture .
The outgoing Bush administration took American engagement to unprecedented levels both overtly and covertly .
Contrary to the well - crafted public initiatives , like the Annapolis conference and attempts to revive the “ peace process , ” it was the Bush administration ’s covert activities that had the greatest impact .
Intervening directly in Palestinian internal politics , it pushed for Palestinian elections , and then when Hamas won , attempted to overturn the result .
The administration helped arm and train Palestinian militias opposed to Hamas and vetoed a Palestinian “ national unity government . ”
It has supported the blockade of the Gaza Strip and used financial aid to bolster client Palestinian leaders .
Abunimah looks ahead and finds no positive signs that Obama will be the sort of friend Israel needs :
During the campaign , Obama actively distanced himself from establishment figures , including elder statesman Zbigniew Brzezinski and Clinton aide Robert Malley , who were accused of being “ pro-Palestinian . ”
At the same time , “ the advisers most intimately involved in [ Obama ’s ] Israel - related policies are veterans of the Clinton administration and come out of a pro-Israel milieu . ”
President - elect Obama ’s first major appointment of pro-Israel hardliner U.S. House Representative Rahm Emanuel to serve as White House chief of staff confirms this trend .
The Obama team shows few signs that it recognizes the reality that is Gaza .
And after a month long Israeli - imposed siege , what is that reality ?
The Gaza - based Palestinian Center for Human Rights ( PCHR ) , reports that by December 5 , “ the border crossings into the Gaza Strip had been sealed by the Israeli Occupation Forces ( IOF ) for 30 consecutive days .
The 1.6 million civilians of the Gaza Strip are being denied all their rights to freedom of movement , and are confined inside Gaza , where the humanitarian situation is deteriorating amidst chronic fuel shortages , and shortages of goods , including essential food items .
The Gaza power plant has been forced to shut down due to lack of fuel , and Gazans are now totally dependent on electricity generated from Israel , and to a lesser extent , from Egypt .
There are also chronic severe shortages of domestic cooking gas .
. . . . patients who require urgent medical treatment outside the Gaza Strip are facing immense travel restrictions , with an average of just seventeen patients a day currently permitted to leave Gaza . . . [ for ] emergency medical treatment in Israel .
. . . . . .
Local emergency health services are . . . on the brink of collapse as they try to respond to critical cases .
. . many Gazan families are being denied access to drinking water , as there is insufficient fuel for the electric water pumps that supply domestic drinking water .
This current thirty day siege ( the latest of many ) with all border crossings sealed , behind barriers that enclose 1.6 million Palestinians living in abject poverty , is an act of collective immorality .
And still , a month after his election , there is only silence on Gaza ’s siege from President - elect Barack Obama .
INS Tabar sinks pirate ship in Gulf of Aden

Last Updated : November 19 , 2008 13:49 IST
A week after saving two merchant vessels from sea pirates , the Indian Navy has sunk a pirate ' mother ship ' during a fierce battle in the Gulf of Aden near the Horn of Africa .
Indian Navy spokesperson on Wednesday said its stealth frigate INS Tabar , currently deployed in the Gulf of Aden for anti-piracy surveillance and patrol operations , had successfully sorted out the pirates last evening 285 nautical miles south west of Salalah in Oman .
Giving details of the operation , the spokesperson said the frigate encountered the pirate vessel with two speed boats in tow .
" This vessel was similar in description to the ' Mother Vessel ' mentioned in various piracy bulletins .
INS Tabar closed in on the vessel and asked her to stop for investigation , " he said .
Despite repeated calls from INS Tabar , the pirate vessel 's crew threatened to blow up the naval warship if it sailed closer .
Pirates were also seen roaming on the upper deck of this vessel with guns and rocket propelled grenade launchers and they continued the threats and subsequently fired upon INS Tabar , he said .
The warship retaliated in " self - defence " and opened fire on the mother vessel of the pirates .
" As a result of INS Tabar 's guns booming , fire broke out on the pirate vessel and explosions were heard , possibly due to exploding ammunition that was stored on the vessel , " the spokesperson said .
Almost simultaneously , Indian Navy said , two speed boats were observed breaking off to escape .
The ship chased the first boat , which was later found abandoned .
The other boat made good its escape into darkness , it added .
INS Tabar was deployed on anti-piracy mission in the Gulf of Aden since November 2 .
Western Naval Command has been controlling the anti-piracy operation since October 23 when the government ordered the Navy to deploy a warship in Gulf of Aden with the mandate to save Indian merchant vessels distressed by pirates .
Since deployment , INS Tabar has successfully escorted 35 ships , including a number of foreign - flagged vessels on receiving their request , safely during their transit through pirate - infested waters of the Gulf of Aden , apart from throwing back pirates , who were attempting to hijack an Indian and a Saudi vessels on November 11 .
The Indian action against pirates comes in the wake of Japanese ship M V Stolt Valor with 18 Indian crew members being hijacked from Gulf of Aden by Somalian pirates on September 15 and being held in captivity for over two months .
The vessel and the crew were released by the pirates on November 16 after the Japanese shipping company reportedly paid a huge ransom .
In Iraq 's Anbar province , U.S. forces gave guns , money , and authority to local militias to keep order in their neighborhoods .
Sure , many of these so - called " Sons of Iraq " were former insurgents , and barely - trained .
But these often - tribally - based groups did the job , for the most part .
And the violence came down .
Now , * U.S. News '
* Anna Mulrine reports , the U.S. military is about to try the same trick in Afghanistan .
It 's tentatively , blandly called the " Afghanistan
Social Outreach Program . "
As in Iraq , the Afghan forces would be on the U.S. payroll , which officials hope will also entice some former insurgents to work with
NATO forces .
" We bring money so we can hire young men to be the first line of defense " in small towns throughout Afghanistan , says a senior
U.S. military official in Kabul .
" We would n't be surprised if some of them used to be insurgents .
We figure this is a way to crack the nut . "
The idea has been floating in military circles for more than a year , at least .
But there 's been concerned that Afghanistan 's tribes are too fractured , too shredded by the Taliban – and too much at each other 's throats – to pull it off .
That 's one of the reasons why NATO cancelled an " auxilliary " police program , back in April .
" Afghanistan has long struggled with warring tribes and warlords , " said U.S. Army Brigadier
General Robert Cone , the top coalition training officer , told our own David Axe in a March telephone interview .
" What we saw was that the effect of paying people to support us when we needed them , despite the positive impact over time , also had the effect of arming people who were not necessarily in line with the [ Afghan ]
government . "
So the Afghan program will differ from the Iraq model , as wise observers have counseled .
" While the Sons of Iraq groups were often assembled by local tribes , the tribes of Afghanistan are in disarray , weakened by decades of war , " Mulrine writes .
" U.S .
forces plan to convene special shuras , or meetings of elders , to select the candidates and vouch for them . "
Makes sense .
But the Sons of Iraq also worked as a program because tribal leaders in Anbar were fed up with Al Qaeda in Mespotamia – and had already started to take matters in their own hands .
Is their a similar seed of opposition in Afghanistan ?
UPDATE : William " Mac " McCallister , who served as the Marines ' advisor on the tribes of Anbar , believes the Afghanistan militia program is a good idea .
But he cautions that " arming local fighters in an attempt to empower the Afghan government may not achieve the intended result , if these security forces effectively take their orders from those with rules quite different from those espoused by state leaders . "
* On the other hand our strategy may inadvertently empower a given local political authority who in turn will reestablish and reinforce the traditional means for managing violence .
This is does not necessarily have to be a bad thing .
The social system could start fresh since many of the modernists that participated in governance before the experiment in collectivism ,
Soviet occupation and Taliban rule are gone .
The state building process could begin anew founded on traditional governance and codes of behavior . *
UPDATE 2 : Is the new program a way to split up the Taliban ?
That 's what the Christian Science Monitor 's Anand Gopal says .
In a report highlighted by Spencer Ackerman , Gopal writes :
According to officials at the Afghan Social Outreach
Program , part of an Afghan government initiative to strengthen local governance , a new body is being formed to reconcile such [ Pashtun tribal ] fighters with the government that will use the promise of government jobs and cash inducements .
This body will replace an already existing government organization that many say is corrupt and ineffective .
The second approach will be to sow divisions in the insurgency ’s leadership and isolate elements close to Al Qaeda .
Al Qaeda and the
Taliban have differing strategies :
Al Qaeda ’s policy of global warfare has brought it into confrontation with the Pakistani government , while the Afghan Taliban are on good terms with Islamabad and restrict its fight to Afghanistan .

China is poised to overtake America as the world 's sole superpower .
We are now at an incredibly critical point in history , and we are faced with two choices : allow China to overtake us , or retake our place in this world and stand up to the Red Dragon with the same ferocity with which we slayed the Red Bear so many years ago .
Of course , I am not a proponent of outright military action against China ; I 'd much rather prefer waging an economic war against the People 's Republic .
Today , China is waging an economic war against us – and they are winning .
They effectively own the United States .
We appear to be an independent world power , but are we really ?
We are totally indebted to the Red Chinese , so how could we possibly be truly independent ?
We need to turn the tables against the Chinese by returning to the eternal principles of the Constitution , which will revitalize our economy and dramatically shrink our national deficit , which is skyrocketing by leaps and bounds .
The first step on the road to economic recovery is to dismantle two institutions , the Federal Reserve , which is as federal as Federal Express , and the income tax , which was a blatanly unconstitutional measure that never should have been enacted .
With these two out of the way , our economy will soar .
We can further stimulate economic growth by eliminating the corporate tax , which scares many powerful corporations away .
So many Americans today complain about the economic malaise we are experiencing , and yet they continue to support liberal ( read : socialist ) politicians who enact measures which halt economic growth .
If we support small government and free markets , our economy will recover and we can regain our status as the world 's sole superpower .
We also need to stop buying products from Red China simply because they are cheap .
Yes , buying the cheaper product is an integral part of the free market , but buying cheap products from China comes at the expense of our national sovereignty and our national interests .
Is saving a little money really worth it ?
Anyways , most Chinese products are of inferior quality and many contain hazardous materials and ingredients , such as lead paint on childrens ' toys .
Once we have done these things , we can then attack China , through economic means , of course , by erecting tarriffs on Chinese - made goods .
While we are dependent on China for almost everything we need , they also depend on us to buy their goods .
If we wo n't buy from them , we wo n't have anything , but their economic will collapse as well .
So it is a two way street .
If we put a stiff tarriff on Chinese goods , we will still have them , they 'll still be fairly cheap , but it will give American manufacturers an edge .
It will become cheaper to buy American than it will be to buy Chinese .
And the Chinese have no defense against this .
What are they going to do , stop trading with us ?
We give them far too much money for them to do that .
So it is a win -win situation .
China is weakened , we are strengthened , and as an added bonus , our government will be able to reap massive profits from the tarriffs .
This will allow us to significantly lower other taxes that are currently quite high .
If we follow these steps , America can rise like a phoenix from the ashes and regain it 's rightful place among the superpowers of the world .
Americans must realize that our grip on power is slipping , and we will become a third world country if we do n't do something fast .
Even if we do n't do what I have outlined , we must do something ; inactivity is death !
This is the second part of a three - part article on the sed one - liners .
This part will explain sed one - liners for selective printing of certain lines .
See part one for introduction of the series .
Just like the Awk one - liners , sed one - liners are beautiful , tiny little sed programs that span no more than 1 terminal line .
They were written by Eric Pement and are floating around on the Internet as ' sed1 line.
txt ' file .
If you are intrigued by this article series , I suggest that you subscribe to my posts !
Eric 's sed one - liners are divided into several sections :
Update : Spanish translation of part two is available !
I have also made a sed cheat sheet that summarizes the whole sed utility .
I suggest that you print it before you proceed and keep it in front of you .
It will help you memorize the commands faster .
Awesome news : I have written an e-book based on this article series .
Check it out :
Grab the sed1 line .
txt file and let 's start .
4. Selective Printing of Certain Lines .
44 . Print the first 10 lines of a file ( emulates " head - 10 " ) .
sed 10
q
This one - liner restricts the " q " ( quit ) command to line " 10 " .
It means that this command gets executed only when sed reads the 10th line .
For all the other lines there is no command specified .
When there is no command specified , the default action is to print the line as - is .
This one - liner prints lines 1 - 9 unmodified and at 10th line quits .
Notice something strange ?
It was supposed to print first 10 lines of a file , but it seems that it just printed only the first 9 ...
Worry not !
The quit command is sneaky in its nature .
Upon quitting with " q " command , sed actually prints the contents of pattern space and only then quits .
As a result lines 1 - 10 get printed !
Please see the first part of the article for explanation of " pattern space " .
45 . Print the first line of a file ( emulates " head - 1 " ) .
sed q
The explanation of this one - liner is almost the same as of the previous .
Sed quits and prints the first line .
A more detailed explanation - after the first line has been placed in the pattern space , sed executes the " q " command .
This command forces sed to quit ; but due to strange nature of the " q " command , sed also prints the contents of pattern space .
As a result , only the first line gets printed .
46 . Print the last 10 lines of a file ( emulates " tail - 10 " ) .
sed -e :a -e '$ q ; N;11 , $D;ba '
This one - liner is tricky to explain .
It always keeps the last 10 lines in pattern space and at the very last line of input it quits and prints them .
I 'll try to explain it .
The first " - e : a " creates a label called " a " .
The second " - e " does the following : " $ q " - if it is the last line , quit and print the pattern space .
If it is not the last line , execute three commands " N " , " 11 , $ D " and " ba " .
The " N " command reads the next line of input and appends it to the pattern space .
The line gets separated from the rest of the pattern space by a new line character .
The " 11 , $ D " command executes the " D " command if the current line number is greater than or equal to 11 ( " 11 , $ " means from 11th line to end of file ) .
The " D " command deletes the portion of pattern space up to the first new line character .
The last command " ba " branches to a label named " a " ( beginning of script ) .
This guarantees that the pattern space never contains more than 10 lines , because as line 11 gets appended to pattern space , line 1 gets deleted , as line 12 gets appended line 2 gets deleted , etc .
47 .
Print the last 2 lines of a file ( emulates " tail - 2 " ) .
sed '$ !N ;$ !D'
This one - liner is also tricky .
First of all , the " $ ! " address restricts commands " N " and " D " to all the lines except the last line .
Notice how the addresses can be negated .
If " $ < command > " restricts a command to the last line , then " $ !< command > " restricts the command to all but the last line .
This can be applied to all restriction operations .
In this one - liner the " N " command reads the next line from input and appends it to pattern space .
The " D " command deletes everything in pattern space up to the first "
" symbol .
These two commands always keep only the most recently read line in pattern space .
When processing the second - to - last line , " N " gets executed and appends the last line to the pattern space .
The " D " does not get executed as " N " consumed the last line .
At this moment sed quits and prints out the last two lines of the file .
48 . Print the last line of a file ( emulates " tail - 1 " ) .
sed '$ !d '
This one - liner discards all the lines except the last one .
The " d " command deletes the current pattern space , reads in the next line , and restarts the execution of commands from the first .
In this case it just loops over itself like " dddd...ddd " until it hits the last line .
At the last line no command is executed ( " $ !d " restricted execution of " d " to all the lines but last ) and the pattern space gets printed .
Another way to do the same :
sed -n ' $p '
The " - n " parameter suppresses automatic printing of pattern space .
It means that without an explicit " p " command ( or other commands that act directly on the output stream ) , sed is dead silent .
The " p " command stands for " print " and it prints the pattern space .
This one - liner calls the " p " command at the very last line of input .
All the other lines are silently discarded .
49 .
Print next - to - the - last line of a file .
Eric gives three different one - liners to do this .
The first one prints a blank line if the file contains just 1 line :
sed -e '$ !{h ; d ; } ' -e x
This one - liner executes the " h; d " commands for all the lines except the last one ( " $ ! " restricts " h; d " commands to all lines except last ) .
The " h " command puts the current line in hold buffer and " d " deletes the current line , and starts execution at the first sed command ( " h ; d " gets executed again , and again , ... ) .
At every single line , that line gets copied to hold buffer .
At the very last line " h; d " does not get executed .
At this moment " x " gets a chance to execute .
The " x " command exchanges the contents of hold buffer with pattern space .
Remember that the previous line is still in the hold buffer .
The " x " command puts it back in pattern space , and sed prints it !
There you go , the next - to - last line was printed !
In case there is just 1 line in the file , only the " x " command gets executed .
As the hold buffer initially is empty , " x " puts emptiness in pattern space ( I use word " put " here but it actually exchanges the pattern space with hold space ) .
Now sed prints the contents of pattern space , but it 's empty , so sed prints out just a blank line .
The second prints the first line if the file contains just 1 line :
sed -e ' 1{$ q ; } ' -e '$ !{h ; d ;} ' -e x
This sed - one liner is divided in two parts .
The first part " 1{$q ; } " handles the case when the file contains just a single line .
The second part " $ !{h ; d;} x " is exactly the same as in the previous one - liner !
Thus , I need to explain just the first part .
The first part says - if it is the first line " 1 " , then execute " $q " .
The " $ q " command means - if it is the last line , then quit .
What it effectively does is it quits if the first line is the last line ( i.e. file contains just one line ) .
Remember from one - liner # 44 that before quitting sed prints the contents of pattern space .
As a result , if the file contains just one line , sed prints it .
The third prints nothing for 1 line files :
sed -e ' 1 {$ d ; } ' -e '$ !{h ; d ;} ' -e x
This one - liner is again divided in two parts .
The first part is " 1{$d ;} " and the second is exactly the same as in the previous two one - liners .
I will explain just the first part .
The first part says - if it is the first line " 1 " , then execute " $d " .
The " $ d " command means - if it is the last line , then delete the pattern space and start all over again .
In case the first line is the last ( only one line in file ) , there is nothing more to be done and sed quits , printing nothing .
50 .
Print only the lines that match a regular expression ( emulates " grep " ) .
sed -n '/ regexp / p'
This one - liner suppresses automatic printing of pattern space with the " - n " switch and makes use of " p " command to print only the lines that match " / regexp / " .
The lines that do not match this regex get silently discarded .
The ones that match get printed .
That 's it .
Another one - liner that does the same :
sed '/ regexp /!d'
This one - liner deletes all the lines that do not match " / regexp / " .
The other lines get printed by default .
The " ! " before " d " command inverts the line matching .
51 . Print only the lines that do not match a regular expression ( emulates " grep - v " ) .
sed -n '/ regexp / !p'
This one - liner is the inverse of the previous .
The " - n " prevents automatic printing of pattern space .
The " / regexp / " restricts the " ! p " command only to lines that match " / regexp / " , but the " ! " switch prevents " p " from acting on these lines .
What happens is " p " acts on all lines that do not match " / regexp / " , and they get " p" rinted .
sed ' / regexp / d '
This one - liner is the inverse of the previous ( #50 ) .
This one - liner executed the " d " ( delete ) command on all lines that match " / regexp / " , thus leaving only the lines that do not match .
They get printed automatically .
52 . Print the line immediately before regexp , but not the line containing the regexp .
sed -n '/ regexp/{g;1!p;};h '
This one - liner saves each line in hold buffer with " h " command .
If a line matches the regexp , the hold buffer ( containing the previous line ) gets copied to pattern space with " g " command and the pattern space gets printed out with " p " command .
The " 1 ! " restricts " p " not to print on the first line ( as there are no lines before the first ) .
53 .
Print the line immediately after regexp , but not the line containing the regexp .
sed -n '/ regexp/{n;p;} '
First of all , this one - liner disables automatic printing of pattern space with " - n " command line argument .
Then , for all the lines that match " / regexp / " , this one - liner executes " n " and " p " commands .
The " n " command is the only command that depends on " - n " flag explicitly .
If " - n " is specified it will empty the current pattern space and read in the next line of input .
If " - n " is not specified , it will print out the current pattern space before emptying it .
As in this one - liner " - n " is specified , the " n " command empties the pattern space , reads in the next line and then the " p " command prints that line out .
54 . Print one line before and after regexp .
Also print the line matching regexp and its line number .
( emulates " grep - A1 - B1 " ) .
sed -n -e '/ regexp/{=;x;1!p;g ;$ !N;p ;D;} ' -e h
First let 's look at " h " command at the end of script .
It gets executed on every line and stores the current line in pattern space in hold buffer .
The idea of storing the current line in hold buffer is that if the next line matches " / regexp / " then the previous line is available in hold buffer .
Now let 's look at the complicated " / regexp /{= ; x ;1! p;g ; $ ! N;p ;D;} " command .
It gets executed only if the line matches " / regexp / " .
The first thing it does is it prints the current line number with " = " command .
Then , it exchanges the hold buffer with pattern space by using the " x " command .
As I explained , the " h " command at the end of the script makes sure that the hold buffer always contains the previous line .
Now we have put it in the pattern space with " x " command .
Next , if it 's not the first line , " 1 ! p " prints the pattern space , effectively printing the previous line .
Now the " g " command gets executed .
It copies the original line that was just exchanged with hold buffer back to pattern space .
Now the " $ ! N " executes .
If it is not the last line , " N " appends the next line to the current pattern space ( and separates them with "
" char ) .
Pattern space now contains the line that matched " / regexp / " and the next line .
The " p " command prints that .
" D " deletes the current line ( line that matched " / regexp / " ) from pattern space and finally " h " gets executed again , that puts the contents of pattern space into hold buffer .
As " D " deleted the current line , the next line was put in hold buffer .
55 . Grep for " AAA " and " BBB " and " CCC " in any order .
sed '/ AAA/!d ; /BBB/!d ; /CCC /!d'
This one - liner inverts the " d " command to be executed on lines that do not contain either " AAA " , " BBB " or " CCC " .
If a line does not contain one of them , it gets deleted and sed proceeds to the next line .
Only if all three of the patterns are present , does the sed print the line .
56 . Grep for " AAA " and " BBB " and " CCC " in that order .
sed '/ AAA .* BBB.*CCC /!d'
This one - liner deletes lines that do not match regexp " / AAA.BBB.CCC / " .
For example , a line " AAAfooBBBbarCCC " will get printed but " AAAfooCCCbarBBB " baz will not .
It can also be written as :
sed -n '/ AAA .* BBB .*CCC / p'
This one - liner prints lines that contain AAA ... BBB ... CCC in that order .
57 . Grep for " AAA " or " BBB " , or " CCC " .
sed -e '/ AAA / b ' -e '/ BBB /b' -e '/ CCC /b ' -e d
This one - liner uses the " b " command to branch to the end of the script if the line matches " AAA " or " BBB " or " CCC " .
At the end of the script the line gets implicitly printed .
If the line does not match " AAA " or " BBB " or " CCC " , the script reaches the " d " command that deletes the line .
gsed '/ AAA \ |BBB\|CCC /!d '
This one - liner works with GNU sed .
GNU sed allows alternation operator | to be used to match separate things .
It 's a more compact way of saying match " AAA " or " BBB " , or " CCC " .
If you are using GNU sed , then there is actually no need to escape the pipes |.
You may specify the " - r " command line option to use extended regular expressions .
This way this one liner becomes :
gsed -r '/ AAA|BBB|CCC /!d '
or
gsed - rn '/ AAA|BBB|CCC / p'
58 . Print a paragraph that contains " AAA " .
( Paragraphs are separated by blank lines ) .
sed -e '/./{H ;$ !d;} ' -e 'x ; / AAA/!d ;'
First notice that this one - liner is divided in two parts for clearness .
The first part is " /./{H ; $ !d;} " and the second part is " x ;/ AAA / !d " .
The first part has an interesting pattern match " /./ " .
What do you think it does ?
Well , a line separating paragraphs would be a blank line , meaning it would not have any characters in it .
This pattern matches only the lines that are not separating paragraphs .
These lines get appended to hold buffer with " H " command .
They also get prevented from printing with " d " command ( except for the last line , when " d " does not get executed ( " $ ! " restricts " d " to all but the last line ) ) .
Once sed sees a blank line , the " /./ " pattern no longer matches and the second part of one - liner gets executed .
The second part exchanges the hold buffer with pattern space by using the " x " command .
The pattern space now contains the whole paragraph of text .
Next sed tests if the paragraph contains " AAA " .
If it does , sed does nothing which results in printing the paragraph .
If the paragraph does not contain " AAA " , sed executes the " d " command that deletes it without printing and restarts execution at first command .
59 .
Print a paragraph if it contains " AAA " and " BBB " and " CCC " in any order .
sed -e '/./{H ;$ !d;} ' -e 'x ; / AAA/!d;/BBB/!d;/CCC/!d'
This one - liner is also split in two parts for clarity .
The first part is exactly the same as the first part of previous one - liner .
The second part is very similar to one - liner # 55 and also the previous .
The " x " command in the 2nd part does exactly the same as in previous one - liner , it exchanges the hold buffer , that contains the paragraph with pattern space .
Next sed does three tests - it tests if the paragraph contains " AAA " , " BBB " and " CCC " .
If the paragraph does not contain even one of them , the " d " command gets executed that purges the paragraph .
If it contains all three patterns , sed happily prints the paragraph .
60 .
Print a paragraph if it contains " AAA " or " BBB " or " CCC " .
sed -e '/./{H ;$ !d;} ' -e 'x ; / AAA /b ' -e '/ BBB /b' -e '/ CCC /b ' -e d
The first part is exactly the same as in previous two one - liners and does not require explanation .
The second part that happens to be " - e 'x ; / AAA / b ' -e '/ BBB /b' -e '/ CCC /b' -e d " is almost exactly the same as in one - liner # 57 .
The " x " command exchanges the paragraph stored in hold buffer with the pattern space .
Then it tests if the pattern space ( paragraph ) contains " AAA " , if it does , sed branches to end of script with " b " command , that happily makes sed print the paragraph .
If " AAA " did not match , sed does exactly the same testing for pattern " BBB " .
If it again did not match , it tests for " CCC " .
If none of these patterns were found , sed executes the " d " command that deletes everything and restarts this one - liner .
Here is another way to do the same with GNU sed :
gsed '/./{H ;$ !d;};x ;/ AAA\|BBB\|CCC/b;d '
This one - liner is exactly the same as previous one .
It just compresses the three tests for " AAA " , " BBB " or " CCC " into one " / AAA|BBB|CCC / " as explained in one - liner # 57 .
61 . Print only the lines that are 65 characters in length or more .
sed -n '/^.\{65\}/p'
This one - liner prints lines that are 65 characters in length or more .
It does it by using a regular expression " ^.{65} " that matches any 65 characters at the beginning of line .
If there are less than 65 characters , the regex does not match and the line does not get printed ( as automatic printing was disabled with " - n " command line option ) .
62 . Print only the lines that are less than 65 chars .
sed -n '/ ^.\{65\}/!p'
This one - liner inverts the previous one .
If the line matches 65 characters , then it is not printed " ! p " .
If it does not match , it gets printed .
Another way to do the same :
sed '/ ^.\{65\}/d'
This one - liner deletes all lines that match 65 characters .
All others implicitly get printed .
63 . Print section of a file from a regex to end of file .
sed -n '/ regexp / , $p '
This one - liner uses a tricky range match " / regex / , $ " .
It matches lines starting from the first line that matches " / regex / " to the end of file " $ " .
The " p " command prints these lines .
All other lines get silently discarded .
64 . Print lines 8 - 12 ( inclusive ) of a file .
sed -n ' 8,12 p '
This is another type of range match .
This range matches a section of lines between two lines numbers ( inclusive ) .
In this case it 's lines [ 8 to 12 ] .
sed ' 8,12 !d '
This is the same one - liner , just written differently .
It deletes lines that are outside of range [ 8 , 12 ] and prints those in this range .
65 . Print line number 52 .
sed -n ' 52 p '
This one - liner restricts the " p " command to line " 52 " .
Only this line gets " p" rinted .
sed ' 52!d '
This one - liner deletes all lines except line 52 .
Line 52 gets printed .
sed ' 52q ; d '
This one is the smartest .
It quits at line 52 with " q " command .
The previous two one - liners would loop over all the remaining lines and do nothing .
Remember from one - liner # 44 that quit command prints the pattern space with it .
The " d " command makes sure that no other line gets printed while sed gets to line 52 .
66 . Beginning at line 3 , print every 7th line .
gsed -n ' 3~7 p '
This one - liner uses a line range match extension of GNU sed .
A line range in format " first~step " matches every step 'th line starting from first .
In this one - liner it 's " 3~7 " , meaning match every 7th line starting from 3rd .
The " - n " flag prevents printing any other lines , and " p " in " 3~7 p " prints the matched line .
For everyone else , this one - liner works :
sed -n ' 3 , ${p ; n;n;n;n;n;n;} '
This one - liner executes commands " p ; n ; n ; n ; n ; n ;n " for lines starting the 3rd line .
The " 3 , $ " is a line range match that restricts commands by line numbers .
The " $ " means end of file and " 3 " means 3rd line .
The " p ; n ; n ; n ; n ; n ;n " command prints the line , then skips 6 , prints the 7th , skips 6 , prints the 14th , etc .
As it starts executing at line 3 , the effect is - print line 3 , skip 6 , print line 10 , skip 6 , print line 17 , ....
That is , print every 7th line beginning at 3rd .
67 . Print section of lines between two regular expressions ( inclusive ) .
sed -n '/ Iowa / , /Montana / p'
This one - liner prints all the lines between the first line that matches a regular expression " Iowa " and the first line that matches a regular expression " Montana " .
It uses a range match " / start / , / finish / " that matches all lines starting from a line that matches " start " and ending with the first line that matches " finish " .
An Important Comment About Ranges !
I have an important comment about ranges .
Ranges in form " / start / , / finish / " always match 2 lines or more .
If " / finish / " is on the same line as " / start / " it will not work .
Please see the Sed FAQ 3.3 for more details .
Sed One - Liners Explained E-Book
I have written an e-book called " Sed One - Liners Explained " .
I improved the explanations of the one - liners in this article series , added new one - liners and added three new chapters - an introduction to sed , a summary of sed addresses and ranges , and debugging sed scripts with sed-sed .

Britain 's internet censor has backtracked on its decision to ban a Wikipedia page for containing a " potentially illegal " image of a naked child .
Over the weekend it emerged that the Internet Watch Foundation , which operates a blacklist to screen out images of child abuse that is used by the majority of British internet providers , had banned the image of a 32 - year - old album cover by German rock group The Scorpions .
The decision resulted in a technical glitch which prevented thousands of British web surfers from editing any pages on Wikipedia , as well as confusion over why the image was deemed " potentially illegal " – particularly since the album itself has been on sale in high street shops for more than 30 years .
But after conducting a review of the decision , and amid protests from the Wikimedia organisation on Monday , the IWF today said that it would make the unprecedented decision to reverse its position and remove the image from its blacklist .
In a statement , the IWF said that it had taken a number of factors into account , as well as representations from Wikipedia .
" The IWF board has today considered these findings and the contextual issues involved in this specific case , and – in the light of the length of time the image has existed and its wide availability – the decision has been taken to remove this web page from our list , " it said .
Although the organisation " confirmed that the image in question is potentially in breach of the Protection of Children Act , 1978 " , it also said that further reports concerning the image would be ignored if the files were hosted abroad .
However , it said it could be blocked again if they are on UK - based web servers .
The article in question , about the Virgin Killers album from 1976 , included an image of the record 's controversial cover – which featured a young , naked girl with her genitals obscured only by a crack in the camera lens .
Although the cover caused a storm at the time , and was later replaced by a more family - friendly alternative , it was never banned in Britain or the United States .
The IWF acknowledged that its decision to block the image had the opposite affect than intended – resulting in the image being spread further around the internet , instead of removing it .
" IWF 's overriding objective is to minimise the availability of indecent images of children on the internet , however , on this occasion our efforts have had the opposite effect .
We regret the unintended consequences for Wikipedia and its users , " it said .
The ban affected users of some of Britain 's biggest ISPs , including Virgin Media and Be internet , and led to criticism of the way the IWF operates .
Although not an official censorship body , the Cambridge - based organisation has become the UK's de facto online watchdog , largely focused on preventing images of child abuse from being accessed by British users .
The reversal is a surprising move , because it opens up the possibility that any site which finds itself blocked could appeal against the decision and claim that its content is , contextually , artistic .
It also throws into question the way the banning system – which is carried out by a four - strong team of analysts who work with the police 's Child Exploitation and Online Protection ( Ceop ) unit - is applied .
Scholar : Cheney confessed to war crime David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday December 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley believes that not only did Vice President Dick Cheney " unambiguously " confess to a war crime during an ABC interview on Monday , but the US ' future as a nation may depend on taking action .
Asked by MSNBC's Keith Olbermann whether Cheney had just confessed to a war crime on national television , Turley at first replied wryly , " It 's an interesting question , is n't it ? ...
If someone commits a crime and everyone 's around to see it and does nothing , is it still a crime ? "
" It most certainly is a crime to participate , to create , to in many ways monitor a torture program , " he added .
" What [ Cheney ] is describing is most certainly and unambiguously a war crime . "
During Monday 's interview , Cheney was asked , " Did you authorize the tactics that were used against Khalid Sheikh Mohamed ? " and replied , " I was aware of the program , certainly , and involved in helping get the process cleared . "
" What happens if the next administration does not press this ? "
Olbermann asked .
" Do we let the International Court at the Hague come in and take over all our responsibilities for policing our own act here ? "
" That 's what worries me the most , " Turley replied , " is that you can't talk about change without having some moral component to it .
It 's not just about creating jobs or lowering the price of gasoline . "
" What occurred in the last eight years was an assault on who we are , " Turley said .
" I think that President - elect Obama 's going to have to decide whether he wants power without principle or whether he wants to start with a true change , to say that no matter where an investigation will take us , if there are crimes to be found they will be prosecuted . "
" It will ultimately depend on citizens , and whether they will remain silent in the face of a crime that 's been committed in plain view , " Turley concluded .
" It is equally immoral to stand silent in the face of a war crime and do nothing , and that is what the citizens are doing .
There 's this gigantic yawn . "

A man charged with assaulting two lesbians outside an Oshawa school will not be charged with a hate crime , despite pressure from community agencies .
On Nov. 3 , two women were physically assaulted and verbally abused just after classes let out at Gordon B. Attersley Public School .
Many children and parents witnessed the attack , including the women 's 6 - year - old son .
Another student 's father was arrested at the scene and charged with two counts of assault causing bodily harm .
If convicted , he could serve up to 10 years in prison .
Following the attack , Anji Dimitriou and Jane Currie used a Facebook group to tell their stories .
The couple received an outpouring of support from the community and members of the group staged a rally in Oshawa to demand the charges be elevated from an assault to a hate crime .
Police said although the attack was disturbing and offensive , it did not meet the narrow definition of a hate crime .
Specifically , the attack did not advocate genocide and there was no clear evidence the man incited others to join him in the attack .
" Any act of violence should not be tolerated by our society , especially violence in plain view of children , " said police chief Mike Ewles .
" In instances of this nature , we are obliged to consult with the Crown Attorney and we will not lay a charge unless the evidence supports a charge . "
Mark Scott , 44 , of Oshawa , is scheduled to appear in court on Jan. 8 .
Scott 's lawyer , Mark Jacula , said in a recent news release that his client , who is black , has been a victim of racial and physical abuse .
" The truth surrounding this incident will come to light .
The parties responsible will be held accountable for the racially motivated and unprovoked attack he suffered . "
Durham Regional Police investigate 20 to 25 incidents involving hatred each year .
Few of them meet the definition of a hate crime .
Will online shopping pick up in time for Christmas ?
Online shops are suffering the same fate as the High Street with fewer customers spending money .
US net measurement firm comScore found that online shopping was in decline for the first time since it began measuring it in 2001 .
Online shoppers in the US spent $ 8.2 bn ( £ 5.3 bn ) in November , down 4 % on last year 's figures .
ComScore forecast flat growth for the upcoming Christmas shopping season and did not rule out further decline .
Rising slowly
If there is any more significant bad news just over the horizon , all bets are off
Gian Fulgoni , comScore " With consumer confidence low and disposable income tight , the first weeks of November have been very disappointing , " said comScore chairman Gian Fulgoni .
As with offline shopping , people could be holding out for the sales , he added .
Last year online spending grew 19 % over the holiday season , and 9 % over the first 10 months of 2008 .
" Assuming the stock market does n't deteriorate materially during the season and that there is no apocalyptic news of major financial institutions , manufacturers or retailers failing , we should see online spending growth inch back towards positive as we get deeper into the season , " said Mr Fulgoni .
" However , if there is any more significant bad news just over the horizon , all bets are off . "
Not everyone agrees with the gloomy forecast .
Shopping comparison site Kelkoo has seen more traffic to its site as people turn away from the High Street .
" We dispute the notion that online shopping in a downturn , in the UK and Europe at least , as there is much evidence that shows its is replacing the high street as a primary shopping location , " said Bruce Fair , managing director of Kelkoo .

When GameTap shut down the servers for MystOnline : UruLive earlier this year , it was a major disappointment for the small , but dedicated , fan base the game had acquired over the years .
Those fans will now have a chance to shape the future of the game , as developer Cyan Worlds has announced that the source code for the title will soon be released , giving fans the ability to mold and update the now - open source game as they see fit .
UruLive has experienced a tumultuous existence since first being launched in 2003 .
The massively - multiplayer title was originally to be published by Ubisoft , which promptly left the project while it was still in beta .
The game was kept alive on a number of fan - run servers for nearly three years , at which point it was picked up by GameTap .
This deal continued until February of this year when GameTap dropped the game ; however , in spite of all of these problems , the game has maintained a steady , loyal group of fans .
" Cyan has decided to ... make MystOnline available to the fans by releasing the source code for the servers , client and tools for MystOnline as an open source project , " Cyan Worlds CEO Tony Fryman told Spokane , WA paper Spokesman Review .
" We will also host a data server with the data for MystOnline .
More is still possible , but only with the help from fans . "
According to Fryman , the developer simply does not have the funding or resources necessary to support MystOnline in an official capacity .
With such a strong connection to the property , giving the reins to the fans is a good way to keep the title from slipping into obscurity .
" After the shutdown of MystOnline with GameTap , we again were thinking of ' how can we keep the dream alive , ' " Cyan CTO Mark DeForest , the man in charge of moving the game to open - source , told Ars .
" Our first thoughts were to work on MystOnline on the side , get the servers up and with the help of those many talented fans , MystOnline could slowly grow back up to something viable .
This was the MORE ( MystOnline Restoration Experiment ) project .
" Then the downturn in the economy hit .
One of Cyan 's revenue streams was indirectly affected by Wall Street and that dried up over night .
This forced Cyan to put MORE on hold .
So , again , how can we keep this dream alive ? "
It 's an interesting question , and Cyan found a brave answer .
" After weighing several options , the only thing that made sense was to get those talented and skilled fans directly involved with MystOnline by opening the source to them . "
" I think there are many reasons ( why the game has such a steadfast
fanbase ) , " DeForest explained .
" In my opinion , I think because
UruLive / MystOnline is still a very unique virtual world experience and
these fans do see that promise .
Most MMOGs focus a lot on the ' game '
part and not on the experience part , after all that is what is
currently making money ...
But this group of core fans see that underlying
experience part that they want to keep alive . "
Given the long - running support that MystOnline has received from fans for several years , it seems as though the game will be in good hands .
Currently there is no word on when the game tools will be released , though Fryman expects it to happen " quickly . "
Where will the game go from here ?
It 's up to the fans .
After the release of the code and tools , they 're welcome to do whatever they 'd like with it .
" I 'm not sure I can predict where UruLive / MystOnline will be in the future , " Deforest told Ars .
" But our hope is that it becomes something bigger than even we have ever thought of . "

( CNN ) --
The works of David Foster Wallace , who committed suicide September 12 , are famous for their obsessively observed detail and emotional nuance .
David Foster Wallace reportedly battled depression for 20 years .
Certain characteristics of his prose -- hypersensitivity and constant rumination , or persistent contemplation -- reflect a pattern of temperament that some psychology researchers say connects mental illness , especially bipolar disorder and depression , with creativity .
There have been more than 20 studies that suggest an increased rate of bipolar and depressive illnesses in highly creative people , says Kay Redfield Jamison , professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University and author of the " An Unquiet Mind , " a memoir of living with bipolar disorder .
Experts say mental illness does not necessarily cause creativity , nor does creativity necessarily contribute to mental illness , but a certain ruminating personality type may contribute to both mental health issues and art .
" Unquestionably , I think a major link is to the underlying temperaments of both bipolar illness and depression , of reflectiveness and so forth , " Jamison said .

This theory could help explain why eminent artists throughout history , from composer Robert Schumann to poet Sylvia Plath to Wallace -- suffered mood disorders .

" It 's pretty clear if you read [ Wallace 's ] books that he was a very obsessive , kind of ruminating guy , " said Paul Verhaeghen , associate professor of psychology at Georgia Institute of Technology .
" You can see it in his sentences .
...
They 're breathless and they need to be annotated , and the annotations need to be annotated again . "
The research of Verhaeghen and colleagues shows when people are in a reflective mode , they may become more creative , depressed , or both .
Previous research shows that when people are in a ruminating mode , they are more likely to be depressed , he said .
" If you think about stuff in your life and you start thinking about it again , and again , and again , and you kind of spiral away in this continuous rumination about what 's happening to you and to the world -- people who do that are at risk for depression , " he said .
Verhaeghen , who is also a novelist and describes himself as a " somewhat mood disordered person , " had a particular interest in the connection between creativity and this ruminating state of mind .
" One of the things I do is think about something over and over and over again , and that 's when I start writing , " he said .
Sensitivity to one 's surroundings is also associated with both creativity and depression , according to some experts .
Creative people in the arts must develop a deep sensitivity to their surroundings -- colors , sounds , and emotions , says Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi , professor of psychology and management at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont , California .
Such hypersensitivity can lead people to worry about things that other people do n't worry about as much , he said , and can lead to depression .
" The arts are more dangerous [ than other professions ] because they require sensitivity to a large extent , " he said .
" If you go too far you can pay a price -- you can be too sensitive to live in this world . "
Terence Ketter is professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at Stanford University .
Ketter and his colleagues compared a healthy control group with bipolar patients , depression patients , and a control group of graduate students in writing and the arts .
They found that people with bipolar disorder scored better -- up to about 50 percent higher -- on creativity tests than the healthy control group .
The creative control group had about the same increase in score relative to the healthy control group .
But more research is needed , says Ketter .
The study does not explain the connection or show a causal relationship , he said .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Depression
MayoClinic.com : Depression MayoClinic.com : Bipolar disorder
Some have pointed out that being engaged in creative pursuits makes a person more open to experience , while others say the pressure of being engaged in the arts causes negative emotion , according to Ketter .
Still , the temperamental characteristics in question are thought to be somewhat inherent .
" It 's a little hard to argue that engaging in creative activity could create the temperament , and it may be a little bit more possible that this temperament gives you a creative advantage , " he said .
Verhaeghen 's theory that rumination contributes to negative emotions generally sounds plausible and in some ways consistent with his own views , said Ketter .
Many hope that this type of research will be helpful in developing better strategies to manage and detect mental illness .
These strategies can sometimes mean the difference between life and death .
" Tragically , mood disorders can still present a sudden death in people who have been undiagnosed and untreated , and die from the illness , " says Ketter .
More specifically , Ketter says , just as heart disease sometimes presents itself for the first time as a fatal heart attack , mental illness sometimes presents itself for the first time as a suicide .

The FBI today ratcheted up the clamor to do something more substantive about the monumental growth of copper theft in the US .
In a report issued today the FBI said the rising theft of the metal is threatening the critical infrastructure by targeting electrical substations , cellular towers , telephone land lines , railroads , water wells , construction sites , and vacant homes for lucrative profits .
Copper thefts from these targets have increased since 2006 ; and they are currently disrupting the flow of electricity , telecommunications , transportation , water supply , heating , and security and emergency services , and present a risk to both public safety and national security .
The agency cites a number of scary examples :
In April 2008 , five tornado warning sirens in the Jackson , Mississippi , area did not warn residents of an approaching tornado because copper thieves had stripped the sirens of copper wiring , thus rendering them inoperable .
On 20 March 2008 , nearly 4,000 residents in Polk County , Florida , were left without power after copper wire was stripped from an active transformer at a Tampa Electric Company ( TECO ) power facility .
Monetary losses to TECO were approximately $ 500,000 .
As of March 2007 , farmers in Pinal County , Arizona , were experiencing a copper theft epidemic as scrappers stripped copper from their water irrigation wells and pumps resulting in the loss of crops and high replacement costs .
Pinal County 's infrastructure loss due to copper theft was $ 10 million .
A of April 2008 , highly organized theft rings specializing in copper theft from houses and warehouses were operating in Minneapolis , Minnesota .
These rings or gangs hit several houses per day , yielding more than $ 20,000 in profits per month .
The targets were most often foreclosed homes .
Reports in March 2008 indicate an organized copper theft ring used the Cuyahoga County Sheriff 's foreclosure lists to pinpoint targets in Cleveland , Ohio .
Perpetrators had 200 pounds of stolen copper in their van , road maps , and tools .
Three additional perpetrators were found to be using the US Department of Housing and Urban Development 's list of mortgage and bank foreclosures to target residences in Cleveland , South Euclid , Cleveland Heights , and other cities in Ohio .
The FBI report shows that industry and local officials are taking countermeasures to help address the scrapper problem , but apparently much more needs to be done .
For example , while a variety of physical and technological security measures have been taken there are limited resources available to enforce these laws , and a very small percentage of perpetrators are arrested and convicted .
Additionally , as copper thefts are typically addressed as misdemeanors , those individuals convicted pay relatively low fines and serve short prison terms .
On the plus side some states such as California , Missouri and Arizona now require scrap metal dealers to thumbprint sellers , pay them by check , keep stringent records and report transactions to police , according to an Ithicajournal.com story .
There is a federal bill that would mandate such background data on scrap dealers and a move to further involve the FBI in chasing down scrappers .
Copper theft is an epidemic crime across the nation and the world .
Of course , not all criminals are the brightest bulbs ; some have been killed or maimed pulling out live wires .
Layer 8 reported last year that there was a growing movement by telecommunications vendors to offer rewards leading to the arrest of copper thieves .
Since 2004 , the price of copper has at times hit $ 4 a pound as demand grew in China , India and Brazil , experts say .
Many of my friends and family members have struggled with fertility issues .
Whether the cause is hormone disrupting chemicals , the pill , or aging mothers , the issue of infertility is complex and probably compounded by a variety of factors .
According to a new study , you can add genetically engineered corn to the list of causes of infertility .
An Austrian study released in November 2008 has found that GM corn has a damaging effect upon the reproductive system of mice .
[ social_buttons ]
In one of the very few long - term nutrition studies conducted so far with an approved GM product ( 2 ) , it became apparent over a period of 20 weeks that the fertility of GM corn fed mice was seriously impaired , with fewer offspring than mice fed on non-GM equivalent material .
In a multi- generational trial , mice fed with GM maize had fewer offspring in the third and fourth generations , and this difference was statistically significant .
Mice fed with GM - free corn reproduced more rapidly .
In a series of carefully - controlled trials , it was also discovered that there was a statistically significant decrease in litter weight in the third and fourth litters of mice in the GM - fed group as compared to the control group .
This study ’s results correspond with the results of similar research on GM soya by Irina Ermakova in 2005 .
…rats fed on a diet including GM soya produced offspring which were weak and which had a much higher mortality rate than rats fed on a non -GM diet ( 4 ) .
She also found that when both male and female animals were fed on GM soy they became effectively sterile and produced no offspring .
Such results demonstrate that genetically modified foods are not safe for human consumption , and that the approval process is inadequate .
We should not be genetically modifiying anything , especially our food .
Messing with mother nature at a genetic level is dangerous .
We need to put the personal health of consumers over the interests of GM corporations , like Monsanto .

Getaway drug mule : Smuggler with £ 300,000 cigarette haul tries to outrun police in a horse and cart
There 's drug mules ... and then there 's drug mules .
A Romanian smuggler appeared to be taking the term literally with this getaway vehicle .
Janos Jakab was nabbed trying to outrun border police with £ 300,000 loaded on to this horse and cart .
Getaway vehicle : Smuggler Janos Jakab was nabbed after trying to outrun police in this horse and cart
Police challenged Jakab as he crossed Romania 's northern border with the Ukraine carrying nearly 100,000 packets of cigarettes and tobacco .
After what was described as ' a short chase ' , police overtook Jakab , arresting him and confiscating the cart .
A spokesman for the local border police said : ' In general smugglers are becoming more and more sophisticated in their methods of getting contraband across borders .
' But this case proved the exception to the rule .
' We have a fleet of high - powered vehicles that can chase down the fastest cars , ' he added .
' Outrunning our officers was never a possibility - even if he had a thoroughbred racehorse strapped to his cart . '

Dr. Jay Gordon is a pediatrician and one of the stars of the anti-vaccinationist movement .
( Dr. Gorski wrote an exellent criticism of many of his claims recently on SBM .)
He is , in fact , the pediatrician to Jenny McCarthy ’s son , Evan ( who she claims was injured by vaccines ) .
Several months ago he published an “ open letter on vaccinations ” which is now making the rounds on anti-vaccine websites .
The letter is a work of pure arrogant pseudoscience – a crafted piece of anti-vaccine propaganda .
He begins :
I do n’t give a lot of vaccines .
I still give DPT vaccinations to some children , chicken pox shots to kids who have n’t been able to acquire natural immunity by age ten years or so , and I give polio vaccines very infrequently .
The polio vaccines are given for what I call “ emotional ” reasons because my exposition of the “ numbers ” ( 2000 cases of polio out of six or seven billion people ) does n’t counteract the very strong memory of a beloved aunt or uncle who had polio in fifties or sixties .
And many parents feel much more comfortable traveling to India or parts of Africa with updated polio immunity for their children and themselves .
By the way , 2007 - 2008 statistics do n’t support that discomfort , but I do n’t argue much .
In 2007 , there were 1314 cases of polio on the planet and 127 of them were in “ endemic ” countries : 873 in India , 285 in Nigeria , 41 in the Congo , 32 in Pakistan and 17 in Afghanistan .
As of July 1 , 2008 , halfway through the year , we ’re running a similar pace with 714 cases of polio reported worldwide .
Nigeria has had 353 cases , India 287 .
His argument is that because the risk of catching polio is so low , the benefits to the individual child are not balanced by the risks of the vaccine .
His argument , however , is bogus on many levels .
First , the benefits of the vaccine to the individual child do outweigh the risks .
That is largely due to the fact that the polio vaccine is very safe .
Serious complications are extremely rare .
Also – Gordon is not thinking clearly about the risks of contracting polio .
He is basing his argument on the fact that 2000 out of 6 billion is a very low risk ( equal to one in 3 million ) .
But that is the wrong statistic to use , because it includes those who are vaccinated , which is most people .
The real risk that should be considered is the risk of contracting polio among the unvaccinated only .
This risk is much higher .
Almost all cases of polio occur among the unvaccinated .
He also fails to point out that “ endemic ” countries are endemic because of low vaccination rates .
In fact , the World Health Organization was on the brink of eradicating polio from the earth through an aggressive vaccination schedule .
But these efforts were thwarted by vaccine fear - mongering in Nigeria .
This led to an outbreak of polio in Nigeria that spread to other vulnerable countries .
Gordon also displays incredibly sloppy thinking when discussing the risk / benefit calculation of vaccines .
He acknowledges that vaccines work ( unlike some in the anti-vaccine movement ) , and pays lip service to public health when he writes :
“ Public health is an important topic and ignoring that aspect of the discussion is irresponsible . ”
However , he then irresponsibly ignores public health .
It is unavoidable that as vaccines do their job they render the diseases they protect against increasingly rare .
If we are ever going to eradicate another vaccine - preventable disease ( like we did with small pox ) then we necessarily must pass through a period where the risk of contracting the disease is extremely low .
At some point , the risk of contracting the disease must be lower than the risk of the vaccine – even for extremely safe vaccines ( because no intervention has zero risk ) .
If Gordon had his way , however , as soon as we got close to eradicating any disease we should back off on vaccinations for that disease , which would inevitably lead to its resurgence .
We would forever be playing “ whack a mole ” with the disease , never eliminating it completely .
To be clear , we are not at this point with polio .
The advantages to the individual still outweigh the risks .
If we can maintain an aggressive vaccination program , the time period during which we would need to give the vaccine even when the risk of the disease approaches zero would be very brief , long enough to make sure it is completely gone .
It depends on how sure we want to be .
Some might argue that we only need to give the vaccine in endemic areas .
However , we live in a global community .
Travelers bring diseases from other parts of the world every year , or unvaccinated travelers abroad can become infected .
The only reason they do not spread and form a local epidemic is because of herd immunity – because of the vaccine schedule .
Even if we set aside the possibility of eradication – keeping infections isolated and preventing epidemics depends upon herd immunity , which is only as effective as the thoroughness of the vaccination program .
Every parent who takes Dr. Gordon ’s advice weakens herd immunity , and risks not only their child but their community .
Dr. Gordon also likes to pretend that he is the only one concerned about vaccine safety , or honestly and openly examining vaccine risk .
This is pure hubris .
Vaccine risks and benefits are carefully considered .
For example , in the US the oral polio vaccine ( OPV ) was given rather than the inactivated polio vaccine ( IPV ) because OPV is more effective .
Widespread use of the OPV is essentially what eradicated polio from the Western hemisphere .
In 2000 , however , the US changed over to IPV .
This was due purely to the constant assessment of risks vs benefits .
While OPV is more effective is also carries a 1 in 2.4 million risk of contracting polio from the vaccine .
IPV is less effective , but does not carry this small risk .
It was decided , however , that IPV would be adequate to protect against importation of the polio virus back to the US , without the small risk of the OPV .
Gordon then launches into his reasons for believing that vaccines are not safe .
You would think that a doctor defending a minority opinion on an important public health issue would reference published research to defend his position .
Nope – Dr. Gordon just gives us his personal anecdotal experience , and some tired rhetoric .
In 1980 I abandoned the recommended vaccine schedule .
I received dozens and dozens of phone calls from moms and dads reporting that their child had received shots a couple of days ago and they were acting “ a little different . ”
They could n’t quite put their finger on it but their child was just not acting quite the same as before I gave the shots .
They ’d ask if this was okay … was it normal ?
Initially , as I was trained to do , I replied “ yes . ”
After dozens and dozens and dozens of phone calls , I decided that I had better listen to these moms a lot more .
Ugh !
The “ mommy ” gambit .
RFK Jr. and David Kirby have played that card to death as well .
Gordon is telling us to listen to his uncontrolled gut feelings – not the growing body of carefully collected published data which clearly indicates that vaccines are safe , that they are not associated with autism or other neurological disorders .
He tries to make this scientifically bitter pill go down easier by implying that doctors claim vaccines are safe because that is how they are “ trained ” ( like dogs are trained ) – not because they can think for themselves and perhaps have a better understanding of the published literature than he does .
He also implies that it is out of compassion and open honesty that he is willing to listen to mommies , and other doctors are not .
This is nothing but supreme arrogance in logical fallacy form .
This issue is determined by the best scientific evidence .
Gordon does not have that on his side , however , so he tries to distract with a bit of misdirection .
This is a maneuver familiar to any illusionist , or creationist .
But it gets worse .
He writes :
Now , when you discuss this topic with your pediatrician , he or she will clobber my ideas and me .
So be it .
I have watched children getting or not getting vaccines for thirty years .
I wo n’t publish my data because I have none suitable for “ peer review . ”
I can tell you that my very strong impression is that children with the fewest vaccines , or no vaccines at all , get sick less frequently and are healthier in general .
I truly believe they also develop less autism and other “ persistent developmental delays . ”
First he tries to perform a preemptive strike against his critics , anticipating that they will “ clobber my ideas and me . ”
This is clearly meant to portray himself ( more arrogance ) as an abused whistleblower .
Maybe , just maybe , criticism of Dr. Gordon is legitimate because of his dangerous and incorrect anti-vaccine misinformation .
He reassures us that he has the data to back up his controversial claims , however .
But nothing he can publish .
We ’ll just have to trust him .
Notice the quotes around “ peer review . ”
What does that mean ?
Is he denigrating all peer - review ?
This is not surprising .
He is telling the public not to listen to science .
Do not listen to the consensus of scientific opinion built upon published “ peer - reviewed ” data .
Listen to his “ very strong impressions . ”
He ’s the guru .
He knows best .
He has the audacity of reassuring us not once but twice that he is not “ anti-vaccination . ”
This is contradicted by his “ very strong impression ” that children who received “ no vaccines at all ” are “ healthier in general . ”
His reassurances are just more misdirection .
Next on his list of standard anti-vaccine propaganda is the toxin gambit .
Even though mercury in vaccines as a cause of neurological disease has been thoroughly refuted by the data , Gordon still clings to this failed hypothesis .
He writes :
Mercury has not been removed from all vaccines .
Most flu shots still contain 25 micrograms of mercury as do the tetanus boosters .
This represents 30 - 60 % of the dose a baby or child would have gotten in the “ bad old days ” and completely invalidates the argument that “ we ’ve gotten thimerosal out of shots and autism has not gone down . ”
This is just absurd .
Mercury - based thimerosal was completely removed from the routine vaccine schedule by early 2002 .
Prior to that children received thimerosal in many vaccines , including the occasional flu and tetanus booster .
Now , they are only exposed to thimerosal if they get optional vaccines that include it .
And – many flu vaccines do not contain thimerosal ( and fewer and fewer do ) and some states , like California , have banned thimerosal completely .
This represents a significant decrease in thimerosal exposure .
The original argument of the “ mercury militia ” who blamed autism on vaccines was that as the total thimerosal dose increased ( mostly over the 1990 ’s ) so did the incidence of autism .
Well – if that were true then as the thimerosal dose decreased after 2002 so should have autism .
However , autism rates continued to increase at the exact same rate as prior to 2002 .
So , Dr. Gordon ’s position is that as mercury increased , autism increased , Then , as mercury decreased , autism continued to increase .
And this is because mercury was not completely removed from all vaccines ( even though it was in some states , like CA , where autism diagnoses have also continued to increase ) .
This argument is so brain - dead I have a hard time with the idea that Dr. Gordon believes it himself .
I guess he could be so invested in his media persona as the vaccine - skeptic to the stars that he can compartmentalize as needed .
But seriously , this argument is so demonstrably absurd that by itself it establishes Dr. Gordon as a hard - core antivaccinationist .
He backs up this bit of nonsense with further coy implications :
The CDC says that one out of five children have learning disabilities .
I do not know why we have so many injured children now .
One of the hallmarks of propaganda is subtly loaded language .
First he cites the CDC as a reference , to make it seem as if his next statement is backed by an appropriate authority .
He then makes the coy statement that he does not know why “ we have so many injured children now . ”
Notice the assumption ( without reference or justification ) that children with learning disabilities are “ injured . ”
He makes this bold claim without making it seem as if he is making a claim at all – it ’s just slipped in there as an innocuous statement , which he falsely implies is backed up by the CDC .
There is no evidence to support the claim that many , most , or all of children with learning disabilities have been “ injured . ”
Also notice the little word at the end of the statement – “ now . ”
Why are there so many injured children “ now ” .
This implies that there are more than before .
Therefore something must be going on .
I did acknowledge that autism diagnosis rates are increasing .
However , the data supports the conclusion that this increase in diagnoses are due to a broadening of the definition of autism ( casting a wider net ) and to increased efforts at surveillance ( we are looking for it more ) .
There is no evidence that true autism rates are increasing .
A small real increase cannot be ruled out by the data – but that is just a generic limitation of the amount and quality of the data that we currently have .
Dr. Gordon hedges his bets , however .
He doubles down on the toxin gambit with the next target for the anti-vaccinationists – aluminum .
He declares that there is too much aluminum in vaccines .
Aluminum is added as an adjuvant – it makes the vaccines work better .
There is no evidence that the level of aluminum currently in vaccines poses any risk .
And remember , vaccines and the vaccine schedule are tested and monitored for safety .
There are rare cases of harmful reactions to vaccines , nothing is risk free .
But the risks are very low and far outweighed by the benefits .
What evidence does Gordon have for his claim of too much aluminum ?
An article in Mothering magazine – he apparently does not want to taint his arguments with anything peer - reviewed .
Wait – maybe he does .
He also claims ( again , against the consensus of opinion built upon actual evidence ) that delaying some vaccines is safer .
He writes :
Some vaccination problems are completely verifiable and a strategy of delaying vaccines is , in some small way , supported by this recent article : Delay in diphtheria , pertussis , tetanus vaccination is associated with a reduced risk of childhood asthma .
J Allergy Clin Immunol .
2008 Mar;121(3):626-31 . Epub 2008 Jan 18 .
That is some mighty fine cherry - picking , Dr. Gordon .
Of course , this is one preliminary study .
The implications of this have yet to be worked out .
There is also a suggestion in the literature that more infections as a child reduces overall asthma risk .
A relatively unchallenged immune system may predispose to asthma .
Or there may be some other factor at work .
So are we ready to abandon personal hygiene as well ?
Not quite yet .
It may turn out that the vaccine schedule needs to be tweaked to optimize benefit to risk as new data comes in .
No one claimed the current schedule is perfect and written in stone .
But this small slice of data in no way justifies a broad program of eliminating and delaying vaccines , as Gordon implies .
From a scientific point of view his arguments are just plain lousy .
There is so much more , but Gordon has perfected the “ Gish Gallop ” as it applies to anti-vaccine propaganda .
It takes far less space and time to generate misconceptions than it does to correct them .
This will have to do for now .
One thing is clear .
When Dr. Gordon repeatedly claims that he is not anti-vaccination , “ methinks he doth protest too much . ”

Leaving no merchandising stone unturned , Major League Baseball has authorized the use of team logos on a line of funeral caskets for people who want to carry their fandom unto eternity .
Models for the Yankees ( replete with interior pinstripes ) and the Mets ( with handles of mixed Dodger blue and Giant orange ) went on sale at the Branch Funeral Home in Smithtown , Long Island .
The caskets gleam in cream - colored 18 - gauge steel , with the team logo embossed on both the open lid lining and the loved one ’s head pillow .
They dominate the display room ’s 22 caskets , attracting more interest than the Harvard gunmetal model , the copper Pieta , or the solid cherry Senator , according to John Vigilante , the funeral home manager and a lifelong Mets fan .
For baseball fans , the only distractions lately have been winter trades as teams swap their moribund bullpen arms and flatlining batters in hopes of livelier teams next year .
For those feeling particularly restless between the demise of last season and the birth of spring training , the contemplation of such a resting place may fill the bleak hours .
Mr. Vigilante reports that the home team caskets  priced at $ 5,000 , or 20 percent more than the non-logo model  have drawn admiration and not a word of complaint as they at least give pause to families in grief .
— Not even a vehicle crashing into the restaurant could stop Waffle House patrons from eating there early Thursday .
Raleigh police arrested Larry McDade after he crashed a vehicle into the restaurant at 2624 Westinghouse Blvd .
No one was injured .
Damage to the restaurant was believed to be between $ 1,000 and $ 2,000 .
Waffle House employees continued serving customers while crews made repairs and cleaned up the mess .
Authorities said McDade was impaired when he crashed around 4 a.m.
Police charged him with driving while impaired and possession of cocaine .
Raleigh police said McDade had recently been released from prison on drug charges .
Department of Correction records indicate he was released in August after serving two sentences related to 2003 drug convictions for trafficking and possession .
He has a lengthy criminal record in Wake County , including multiple convictions for selling drugs , dating to 1996 .
Introduction
Following Steven Levithan 's old post about string trimming .
I decided to give it another try after my first proposal .
I made a trim version , based on my aforementioned first attempt .
It seems to be much faster on any browser and with different ( string ) lengths and whitespaces .
First of all ...
I want to make clear that this version does n't trim the exact same characters that other versions do .
In my first version , I simply tried to improve Steven 's version without really giving it a deep thought .
This time I thought :
Are all those characters really relevant ?.
After thinking about this for a while I decided that , whatever /\s/ matches , should be trimmed .
Why ?
because most major js libraries use the regex version .
If their users are content , then those are the needed characters .
Also , if my function would actually do better than others , it could go directly to jQuery 's core ( there 's a ticket for that ) .
So I created a test page .
The results were n't equal for all browsers , IE and Safari 3 yielded far less charCodes .
I decided these are the ones I want to trim .
My Trim function
So , the basic modification I made to my previous version , was to check whether the charCode is lower than 33 instead of the whole map / object .
This one takes much less code and is quite faster , I humbly named it " myBestTrim " , here it is :
function myBestTrim ( str ) { var start = - 1 , end = str. length ; while ( str. charCodeAt ( - - end ) < 33 ) ; while ( str. charCodeAt ( ++ start ) < 33 ) ; return str. slice ( start , end + 1 ) ; } ;
The Benchmark
If you want to try the benchmark , get in here .
The number should you care about ( in my opinion ) is the minimum .
That 's probably the one that ran a lower CPU level .
That test uses a string with 10 K characters .
Sounds like a lot but this blog 's homepage has 55 K of html .
As oposed to a regex - based trim , this one should scale pretty well , because it does n't need to check all the string .
That 's actually why I removed any regex - based approach from this test , because they 'd take too long .
If you have Firebug , I 'd advice you to turn it off before getting into this test .
I made a similar test with small strings .
It uses a string of 30 characters with 3 whitespaces on each side .
In this case , the difference was smaller but still noticeable .
The only situation where another function was faster was on IE , with a small string WITH whitespaces .
In this situation , jQuery 's trim ( the typical regex - based trim ) was slightly faster , my trim got 2nd place .
Most situations do n't really require much trimming and critical situations have very large strings , so I think this function scales well on those 2 .
Conclusion
If all goes well , I 'll put this function into jQuery 's core .
I 'd like though , to get some results from other users , to verify my trim is really fast and effective .
Here 's the ticket requesting a faster trim for jQuery : # 2279 .

Removed a dispensable check , thanks Andrea Giammarchi .
Have ever been a fan of the wonderful Asterix comics , you know that the ancient Gauls were a very brave people who did n’t know the meaning of fear .
However , there was one thing that they were afraid of , and that was the sky falling on their heads .
Of course , the sky actually never fell .
But that did n’t stop the Gauls from thinking that it might fall .
I think the world ’s financial markets have reached a stage when a lot of people are convinced that the sky is actually falling .
The kind of fear and panic one sees around nowadays is unprecedented .
Unlike earlier , the fear and panic is coming from some unusual directions .
In a report assessing economic prospects , the World Bank has predicted that the world ’s annual economic growth will slow to 0.9 % , from 2.5 % in the year 2009 .
The politicians and bureaucrats of the world are the people who seemed to be genetically engineered to be cheerful about economic prospects .
No matter what happens , the official word in most countries is always that things are fine and getting finer .
But for the first time in living memory , over the last few months , these professional optimists have changed their tune .
And that ’s a scary prospect .
In the United States , where the crisis first appeared , the pace and the intensity of the change of tune has been stunning .
As recently as September 15th , the accepted wisdom was that erring financial firms should be left to fend for themselves and the crisis would basically work itself out with a little more pain .
Read
That was the day when Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers was allowed to go bankrupt .
Just one day later , the US authorities decided to change its approach and rescue the insurance company AIG .
And two days after that , they decided that basically everyone who needed to be rescued would get help .
And suddenly , the apparent scale of the crisis changed .
From being calm and confident and reassuring , people like the US Treasury Secretary ( finance minister in Indian terminology ) Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman , Ben Bernanke were openly expressing panic .
It suddenly seemed out in the open that the sky was indeed falling .
The official panic has now rolled around the world .
A few days ago , an emergency summit of the heads of European governments took place in Paris and they decided what the EU should do about the crisis .
Even in India , where such pessimism has always been taboo , the mood has changed .
The prime minister himself said a few days ago that India could not stay insulated from the troubles of the rest of the world .
The RBI ’s sudden CRR cut points towards a sharp worry that was n’t around a few days ago .
Suddenly , the accepted wisdom is that the world is in the middle of a huge financial crisis and unless drastic action is taken immediately , things will rapidly become much worse .
A global economic collapse is being talked about routinely .
To the casual observer , all this is a little bewildering .
It ’s as if you ’re walking down the road and suddenly everyone starts running in panic .
You keep trying to stop people and ask them what ’s happened but no one can explain clearly .
They just keep running and pretty soon you decide to stop asking questions and start running too .
Just to be on the safe side , just to be with the crowd in case the sky is actually falling .
My sense is that even the high and mighty have now joined the herd and are basically , just running .
There are officials who want more powers .
There are politicians who like to be in a I ’m - here - to - save - you situation .
And there ’s the media which can see a story that is selling and will keep selling .
There ’s no doubt there is a global financial problem and there will be some hardship before it subsides .
However , the shift in official mood amounts to nothing much more than what the Americans would call a cover - your - rear strategy , although they would use a less polite word for rear .
BARCELONA , Dec 2 ( Reuters ) -
The world 's biggest mobile phone maker , Nokia NOK1V .HE , could start to use open - source Linux software on its more expensive phone models , a senior company official said on Tuesday .
“ In the longer perspective , Linux will become a serious alternative for our high - end phones , ” Ukko Lappalainen , vice president at Nokia ’s markets unit , told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the “ Nokia World ” industry conference .
Linux 's role in the handset industry is growing as Google GOOG.O has introduced its Linux - based Android platform , but Lappalainen said Nokia was likely to stick to its own Linux development .
Nokia uses Linux maemo software in its niche offering of Internet tablets , while it uses Symbian software for its phones .
“ I do n’t see anything in Android which would make it better than Linux maemo , ” Lappalainen said .

“ We win and they lose . ”
Former defence chief of staff General Sir Mike Jackson has hit out at coalition forces ' post - invasion strategy in Iraq .
Sir Mike was Britain 's most senior military officer during the 2003 invasion which ousted Saddam Hussein from power and his comments will add weight to opposition MPs ' calls for an inquiry into the prosecution of the Iraq war .
Writing in the Sunday Telegraph , Sir Mike said coalition forces had struggled to deal with the disappointment of ordinary Iraqis who hoped Saddam 's exit would result in quick improvements to their standard of living .
" This volatile situation was much exacerbated by the security vacuum created by Washington 's appalling decisions to disband the Iraqi security forces and to de-Baathify the public administration to a very low level ; the latter marginalised the very people who were best placed to help , " he wrote .
" These decisions may well have doubled the time it has taken to get to where we are now . "
Earlier this year Iraq 's parliament controversially approved measures reversing the decision to exclude government officials under Saddam from the current administration .
The issue was in the news again this week after around 35 interior ministry officials were arrested on suspicion of plotting a coup against prime minister Nouri al - Maliki .
They were later released without charge .
Sir Mike also listed Whitehall suffering from " organisational difficulties " and allegations of abuse from Iraqi prisoners among other drawbacks .
His comments follow Gordon Brown 's announcement that British forces will withdraw from Iraq by the end of the first half of 2009 .
And the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have since redoubled calls for an inquiry into the decision to go to war and its subsequent strategy .
The government is refusing to discuss such an inquiry until British troops have left the Middle Eastern country .
Despite the difficulties , Sir Mike concluded : " It has been a long , hard and controversial campaign , but I believe it has largely succeeded .
" If none of this had taken place , if Saddam Hussein had remained in despotic power - no doubt to be followed by his despicable sons - where would Iraq be ?
" We will never know , but I cannot think that Iraq would be a better place , nor that the Iraqi people would wish for such a fate . "
It ’s been Republicans who ’ve been heaping praise on Obama ’s national security and economic teams – at times gushing more than even some Democrats .
Obama enemies are cheering
Republicans spent much of the year portraying Barack Obama as a socialist and weak - kneed appeaser who would kowtow to America ’s enemies .
Not anymore .

It ’s been Republicans who ’ve been heaping praise on Obama ’s national security and economic teams — at times gushing more than even some Democrats .
The GOP is finding little to criticize in Obama ’s choices , defanged , in part , because their earlier charges of radicalism have been rendered inoperative by the individuals Obama has appointed .
Honeymoon aside , it ’s not hard to see why Republicans are flummoxed : Obama has , so far , tapped a range of figures who are not only ideologically moderate but are serious and respected leaders in their field .
Further , Obama has installed people who make it politically tough for Republicans to find fault .
In nearly every position so far , he ’s named the individual who offered the least inviting target for the right .
A few of them would have fit right into a McCain administration .
This extreme role - reversal for the GOP also speaks to that party ’s beleaguered fortunes — where its own economic and foreign policy ideology has been sharply rejected by voters .
Republicans also say they must tread lightly for now in dealing with Obama , or risk looking like sore losers to an election - weary public .
Much like his well - oiled campaign , Obama ’s deft moves are drawing admiration from GOP pros — only now they can say it openly .
" Since election day Obama has been staying one move ahead on the chess board of politics , ” observed Brian Jones , a Republican consultant and former aide to John McCain ’s campaign .
“ Good policy is good politics .
And there is a positive political by - product that comes with the selection of these individuals . "
For Obama , the lack of sniping has helped him find his post- election footing , both to give a smooth start to his administration - in - waiting , and to roll out his picks with a storyline of bipartisanship and competence that is going unchallenged from the right .
The announcement of Obama ’s national security team Monday and subsequent response by the Republican National Committee crystallized the Republican challenge .
Obama ’s defense secretary , Robert Gates , is a being held over from the Bush administration , where he has won almost unanimous praise from Republicans and Democrats alike .
The incoming national security adviser , Jim Jones , has been friends with John McCain for nearly 30 years , advised the GOP nominee during the campaign and even appeared with him once on the campaign trail in his native Missouri .
Both served as lifelong , non-partisan national security officials , Gates in the CIA and Jones in the U.S. Marine Corps , before taking leadership posts at , respectively , Texas A&M and the Chamber of Commerce .
Not exactly the sort of institutions that lend themselves to a conservative critique .
And Hillary Clinton , the third member of the national security team rolled out Monday , is n’t any easier to attack .
She may have been the Republicans ’ favorite target — and unrivaled fundraising draw — for a decade , but Clinton was wooed more than she was whacked by the GOP since losing the nomination to Obama .
Fervently trying to appeal to Clinton ’s blue - collar and female supporters , McCain lavished praise on his colleague from New York , featured her in robocalls and mail pieces — and even picked a female vice - president with her constituency in mind .
As related to Obama , Clinton became a vehicle in the GOP campaign to criticize the then - Illinois senator as left of the Democratic mainstream .
Gone was the pre-2008 charge that she was a radical liberal .
In its place , Republican used her as a character witness against Obama .
“ Senator Clinton questioned Obama ’s willingness to meet with rogue leaders without precondition , his policy on Pakistan , and his stance concerning Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards Corps , among other positions , ” said committee spokeswoman Amber Wilkerson in a statement , again using Clinton ’s positions to hit Obama .
“ One has to wonder whether Senator Clinton still carries those same , real concerns about President - elect Obama and his stances on critical issues confronting the nation . ”
No criticism of Clinton was offered , and Gates and Jones were n’t even mentioned in the statement .
“ The reality is that had McCain been elected , his national security team would have looked much like Obama ’s , ” observed Dan Senor , a Republican strategist and the former spokesman for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq .
“ Jones could have easily wound up as national security advisor to a President McCain .
And McCain would have kept Gates at the Pentagon .
As for state , swap Lieberman for Clinton , and you have an almost identical worldview . ”
Leading congressional Republicans have bestowed almost only praise on the trio .
“ I think they ’re excellent selections , ” said Sen. Richard Lugar ( R - Ind. ) , the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Sunday on ABC ’s “ This Week . ” “ I think it will be a strong team .
I would just say , as an individual , I look forward to working with each one of them . ”
Appearing on Fox News Sunday , Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) , one of McCain ’s closest friends and most loyal campaign supporters , individually gave Obama ’s national security picks high marks , calling them “ great people . ”
Republicans have been no less fulsome — at least by modern partisan political standards — about Obama ’s economic team .
No less a party stalwart than Karl Rove wrote in a Wall Street Journal op - ed last week .
that Obama ’s selection of , among others , New York Fed President Timothy Geithner as Treasury Secretary and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers as National Economic Council Director “ provided surprisingly positive clarity ”
Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - NH ) , the flinty ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee , went even further , saying the choice of Geithner and Summers displayed “ strong and early leadership . ”
“ This announcement is good news for Main Street and is a very positive first step by our incoming President , ” said Gregg in a statement .
The economic picks put the RNC in a similarly awkward position .
The chairman , Mike Duncan , is likely to run again and therefore not inclined to let Obama ’s moves go untouched .
But with prominent figures in the GOP lavishing praise on members of the incoming administration , the party would be hard - pressed to paint them as unacceptable liberals .
As with Jones and Gates , the compromise on the economic team was to largely ignore the personnel .
“ In his first major economic announcement since the election , President - elect Obama proposed billions of dollars in new government spending that will come at a burdensome cost to American families and small businesses , ” said Wilkerson , the spokeswoman , making no mention about Obama ’s economic policy - makers on the day they were announced .
Right now , the party just does n’t have much political space within which to take after the president - elect .
“ The people who we , as Republicans , have legitimate policy differences are n’t yet making policy and the other half of them by and large we agree with , ” said GOP consultant Todd Harris , a veteran of two presidential campaigns .
“ There will be a time once Obama is in office when we can began to draw real , substantive contrasts that are based on his actual record .
But until he has a record of performance all we can do is throw rhetorical hand grenades and the public is not really in the mood for that . ”
Patience is n’t easy , especially for a GOP that is already frustrated at having taken severe beatings in consecutive elections .
Yet the hope is that Obama ’s moves , however shrewd in the sunshine of his honeymoon period , will eventually create openings .
“ This may be frustrating for Republicans , ” acknowledged Senor .
“ But it ’s an opportunity .
It signals that Obama ’s real fight will be with the hard left of his own party .
We should stand with him when he breaks with the left .
It ’s looking like it will be a target - rich environment .
This is a much better course than nit -picking on details , while he ’s doing the right thing on big issues . ”
Mike Whitney : I have a nephew who is finishing up at Quantico after graduating from the Naval Academy last June .
He 's bright and talented and wants to serve in the Marines .
Naturally , his parents and relatives are worried that he will be deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan .
What advice would you give someone like this who is extremely patriotic and may be asked to sacrifice his life in one of these wars ?
Would you give the same advice to your own son ?
Anthony Teolis , Veterans For Peace ( VFP ) : I would ask that your nephew take his oath of office seriously .
An officer ’s job is to support and defend the Constitution above all else and to obey orders ( as long as they follow the regulations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice )
Your nephew should also become familiar with the U.S. Constitution , the Nuremberg Tribunal Charter and the Geneva Conventions .
The gravity of violations to domestic and international law by the Bush administration and members of the U.S. military , should weigh heavily on the conscience of active duty and veteran military and civilian personnel .
If your nephew has concerns about whether his orders violate his oath to defend the Constitution he should look to Lt. Ehren Watada as an example and contact Veterans For Peace for advice .
http://www.thankyoult.org/ and http://www.veteransforpeace.org
My own son is 7 and he accompanied me to my first peace rally in 2005 .
He is well aware that the military is not being used to support the Constitution .
He knows that veterans take an oath that has no expiration date .
He also understands history well enough to know that preemptive war is wrong .
Your nephew should realize that the present structure -- over 700 US bases around the world -- is there to maintain the status quo .
But it comes at a high price .
Your nephew should think about that .
MW Whenever I hear Iraqi veterans speak , I 'm always struck by the number of liberal - looking people in the audience .
Normally , one of the vets will say something like this : " We still consider ourselves soldiers " as though he wanted to clarify that he is not really from the same side of the political aisle as his audience .
Is it harder to be a " conservative " and still be against the war ?
Anthony Teolis : I do n't think veterans try to separate themselves from their audience .
More likely , they are reflecting on their service .
It 's often extremely difficult to think about one ’s military experience .
For some , the day of reckoning comes quicker than for others , but the memories are always with us and result in many good and bad things .
Veterans can speak out with pride , but they are also sharing the horrors of their experiences and trying to manage them as best as they can .
Labeling them conservative or liberal really does n't work , because they 're speaking to people who are brave enough to listen .
That 's what counts .
You do n’t usually find chicken hawks and pro war veterans in an audience that has gathered to support people who are trying to deal with the horrors of war .
Every person who calls himself a conservative should be appalled by the violations to the Constitution .
For veterans , it 's natural to take a “ conservative ” stance and support and defend the Constitution .
Our leaders are using their power to invoke fear .
They are operating secret prisons and torturing people .
They are deploying paramilitary forces that not answerable to congress and spying on the American people .
Our representative form of government has become corrupt , ineffective and unresponsive to its citizens .
The US treats political dissents like traitors .
These are some of the problems we face and every citizen must fight to restore the promise of America .
I have friends who are veterans and consider themselves " conservative " , but they are also accepting of other points of view .
Lately I notice that a change is taking place and there is greater acceptance of the pro-peace sentiment .

There has been a lot written about William Ayers lately .
Ayers is the former member of the Weather Underground who carried out bombings on draft boards and the Pentagon during the Vietnam War .
By the time Ayers was carrying out his attacks , more than 1.5 million Vietnamese –mainly civilians -- had been killed by US forces in a war that had no clear objective .
Every night the evening news ran footage of wounded soldiers being dragged to helicopters in stretchers or children running naked from their villages after being burned by napalm dropped by US pilots .
Without justifying what Ayers did ; can you see that when government 's carry out wars that are deeply unpopular and immoral ; it inevitably leads to violence at home ?
Do you agree with me that the Ayers bombings did not occur in a vacuum , but were the direct ( and predictable ) outcome of the polarization and frustration that were created by America 's bloody intervention in Vietnam ?
Anthony Teolis : Veterans For Peace and responsible citizens do not believe that one 's " opposition to war " justifies violence .
We believe that peace can only be achieved through justice .
Polarization and frustration are never resolved through violence .
Non violent resistance is the real solution .
When people resort to violence , they create hell on earth .
Groups such as the Weathermen are an obstacle to peace .
They were formed during the Vietnam War but they were not necessarily a product of the Vietnam War regardless of their claims .
The Weather Underground achieved neither justice nor peace .
MW Would you explain what happened at the recent presidential debates where Iraqi veterans were beaten back by fully - armed police ?
None of the major media covered the incident even though the veterans who were injured represent 70 percent of the American people who still believe the war in Iraq was a " mistake " and want to see troop withdrawals within the next 12 months ?
Anthony Teolis : ( Watch http://tinyurl.com/6jhccb or search YouTube for Hofstra Univ : 3 injured , 15 arrested )
Approximately , one hour before the final presidential debate ; 14 members of Iraq Veterans Against the War marched in formation to Hofstra University to present questions for the candidates .
IVAW had requested permission from debate moderator Bob Schieffer to ask their questions during the debate but got no response .
The contingent of veterans in dress uniforms and combat uniforms attempted to enter the building where the debate was to be held in order to ask their questions , but were turned back by police .
The IVAW members at the front of the formation were immediately arrested , and others were pushed back into the crowd by police on horseback .
Several members were injured , including former Army Sergeant Nick Morgan who suffered a broken cheekbone when he was trampled by police horses before being arrested .

The economic meltdown has drawn a lot attention away from the war in Iraq .
But just below the surface , the public 's frustration continues to grow .
The media and the two main political parties have effectively silenced dissenters like yourself by giving you no place at the table to articulate your opposition .
It took roughly six years of fighting before the " war came home " during Vietnam and the country exploded in protest and political divisions spilled out into the streets .
Do you foresee anything similar happening in the near future or are most people just apathetically shrugging it all off ?
Anthony Teolis : Violence has already been used against us and has been on the rise for the last couple of years .
I was a security guard for the March 17 , 2007 March on the Pentagon , the September 15 , 2007 March on the Capitol , and Winter Soldier 2008 ( http://ivaw.org/wintersoldier)
Both times , pro war supporters treated us violently .
I read an interesting book on Sophie Scholl and the White Rose which as you may recall was a small but passionate student and German war veteran resistant group that tried to warn the local Munich population of the actions of the Nazi government .
I found some relief to our most troubling question about why most Americans refuse to step forward for justice .
" Opponents to tyranny can never be created by force , only through personal experience . "
An unbiased observer may think that the current financial crisis -- along with the rise in poverty , decline in health care , the breakdown in infrastructure , and the rising cost of education -- would make people angry enough to get involved .
But , it has n't .
Debt is a form of slavery that keeps people scared and inactive .
Many Americans believe that it is impossible to change the government , so they try to get by with as little effort as possible .
We need people to step forward and get engaged .
We need to restore faith in ourselves and strengthen traditional values like frugality , conservation and energy independence .
We need change -- now .

STOP TYRANNY
* Read the US Constitution and the Declaration of Independence .
* Share them with friends , family and neighbors .
Teach your children what they mean .
* Call your congressman and senator and ask for 100 of the pocket sized version which contain both and pass them out to people you pass on the street .
* Find , call , visit and send e-mail to your U.S. Representative , Senators , Governor , State Senators and Representatives : http://www.congress.org/congressorg/home
* Write letters to the editor .
The people of this country need to hear from the troops , their families and friends , veterans of this war and service at other times , those who support and sympathize with them , and activists who are organizing against the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan .

“ Clean ” Coal ’s Dirtiest Secret : Part IV – final in a series
Coal River Mountain from Kayford
Mountain Coal River Mountain from KayfordMountain
Coal River Mountain is one of the highest and wildest peaks in West Virginia .
Unlike much of the surrounding region , it is unscarred by surface mining .
But Massey Energy and WV Governor Joe Manchin are out to change that .
Subsidiaries of Massey propose to blow away 6,600 acres of Coal River Mountain — nearly 10 square miles — and the governor ’s office has issued the permits .
If the operation goes forward , one of the last remaining summits in the Coal River Valley will be leveled .
Despite an acclaimed local campaign to build a wind farm atop Coal River Mountain that would provide green jobs , tax revenues and sustainable energy for up to 150,000 homes for decades to come , state politicians know who lines their campaign coffers .
The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection has rejected the public input of a majority of state citizens who support the wind project , in favor of Massey ’s plans to begin imminent blasting .
But opponents are not giving up .
If anything , the fight for Coal River Mountain has only heightened attention and galvanized action .
Close - up of explosive methods used
in MTR mining Close - up of explosive methods usedin MTR mining
Mountaintop removal ( MTR ) mining is a fast and cost - efficient way to get at the rich coal seams buried within these lush , old mountains .
As the coal industry seeks to keep profits high and power cheap for a nation of profligate energy consumers , Coal River Valley residents remain among the nation ’s poorest , struggling to support their families ’ health and economic well - being , and , increasingly , the very face of the land they have been an integral part of for generations .
But their poverty in material resources is not matched by a paucity in political will .
Citizens are fighting back , buoyed by a growing national awareness of this most destructive of strip - mining methods .
And the rest of us can help .
Just a few years ago , efforts to stop MTR mining were represented by a fragmented collection of a few grassroots organizations .
Today , seven of those groups from five states have joined forces in an effort called End Mountaintop Removal : Action and Resource Center .
Their clearinghouse website offers a host of ways to join the campaign to preserve what remains of America ’s Appalachian heartland .
Here are seven simple steps to start with .
Taking a few minutes to do even one or two of these things will help put an end to the most egregious environmental practice in the U.S. today :
1 ) Educate yourself .
You may have read the other pieces in this series , but there ’s more to learn .
Start with the National Memorial to the Mountains , an interactive site that uses Google Earth software to show the massive scale of destruction occurring in Appalachia .
The memorial maps more than 470 mountains destroyed by mountaintop removal and connects visitors to stories , photos , videos and interviews of local residents to tell the stories of those mountains and nearby communities .
2 ) Track your own connection to MTR mining .
If you ’re on the grid , chances are you are connected in some way to energy produced by MTR coal mining .
By plugging in your zip code , you can find out exactly how .
And then you can learn more about what you can do in response .
3 ) Ask President - Elect Obama to end mountain removal mining in his first 100 days .
President Obama will have the power to stop most current MTR operations if he so chooses .
Find out how , and ask him to make good on his Aug. 27 , 2007 statement that “ we have to find more environmentally sound ways to mine coal than simply blowing the tops off of mountains . ”
And then remind him that no matter how coal is burned or the CO2 sequestered , coal can never really be clean when the method of extracting it is brutal and the damage irreparable .
4 ) Write to Congress and ask them to support the Clean Water Protection Act , H.R. 2169
This bill seeks to protect the quality of life and health of the people most affected by MTR mining in Appalachia .
By protecting their water supply , limits will have to be put on MTR activity .
See if your Representative has signed on in support of this bill , and if not , beseech them to do so .
5 ) E-mail West Virginia ’s governor and ask him to support wind energy development for Coal River Mountain
Time is of the essence if Coal River Mountain is to be saved .
Add your name to an e-mail petition , or make a phone call to Governor Joe Manchin ’s office to express your opposition to MTR mining , and instead , ask him to support the environmental and economic benefits of wind energy potential on the highest ridges .
Share some figures from Coal River Wind ’s report that show how the wind project will benefit people much more than another MTR operation .
6 ) Applaud Bank of America for its leadership role in ending funding for MTR operations .
And while you ’re at it , encourage other large lenders ( Citi , JP Morgan Chase ) to do likewise .
Michael Brune reports at the Huffington Post that “ Bank of America , a lead financier of coal , announced that they will be phasing out financing for companies that practice mountaintop removal coal mining …
The decision is also a testament to the hard work of Appalachian communities and anti-coal activists across the country , whose collective pressure left Bank of America with little choice but to abandon its support for this barbaric form of resource extraction .
There is a powerful movement for clean energy in this country and we are winning ! ” Let Bank of America CEO and President Kenneth D. Lewis know that you appreciate his company ’s courageous decision .
7 ) Get others involved by spreading the word .
Circulate this message ( via the link above ) to your e-mail contact list , post a widget on your Facebook page , find out how to share and track your influence through online methods of helping others become aware of the destruction of the natural and cultural heritage that belongs to us all .

Fears spy called ' The Spaniard ' may have betrayed British and U.S. secrets to Russia for more than a decade
Known as ' The Spaniard ' because he is said to have posed as a Spanish businessman , it is feared that Herman Simm betrayed Britain and the U.S. for more than a decade
A high - ranking spy known as ' The Spaniard ' operating at the heart of Nato is feared to have betrayed British and US secrets to Russian intelligence for more than a decade , it has emerged .
In an echo of the Cold War , Herman Simm is believed to have operated with his wife and is suspected of passing highly sensitive information to Moscow , including details of the controversial US missile shield , its cyber defence programme and Nato operations from Kosovo to Afghanistan .
An Estonian recruited by the KGB when his country was still part of the Soviet empire , Simm , 61 , was described as a ' Russian mole ' who was responsible for handling all his country 's classified and top secret material on Nato .
British and U.S. investigators are said to have flown to the Estonian capital Tallinn in a bid to discover how much intelligence has been compromised .
Experts fear it will become the biggest spy scandal since CIA man Aldrich Ames , a counter intelligence expert , was caught selling secrets to Moscow in the early 1990s .
Simm was arrested in September after making a series of mistakes and investigators are seeking to establish whether he was operating with other Estonian officials .
Amazingly in the modern day , he still used a converted radio transmitter to set up meetings with his contact , apparently posing as a Spanish businessman - leading to his nickname ' The Spaniard . '
As in the Cold War years , the operation appears to have been a husband and wife team .
Simm 's wife , Heete , who once worked as a lawyer at the national police headquarters , has been detained on charges of being an accessory to treason .
Investigators believe Simm was a ' sleeper ' for the Russian intelligence service from the end of the 1980s when the KGB still existed and Estonia was part of the USSR .
At that time , Estonia was already striving for independence , and it was apparent that Moscow would lose the Baltic states but still wished to secure influence in the country .
Simm , once Estonia 's chief of police and a department head at the country 's Defence Ministry , where he was responsible for secret co-ordination with Nato and the EU , amassed a considerable fortune for selling military secrets , it is understood .
An investigator described him as ' a big fish , ' adding : ' He gave Russia practically everything Nato and the EU passed between them . '
A German government official described the leaks as a ' catastrophe , ' and Estonian politician Jaanus Rahumaegi said he feared Simm 's betrayal could cause ' historic damage ' .
Simm is only believed to have been caught because of blunders that have dogged modern espionage ever since the KGB first pitted itself against the West .
He attracted suspicion when bought up several pieces of valuable land and houses , including a farmhouse on the Baltic Sea and a grand white - painted villa outside Tallinn .
These failings were compounded when his contact officer became careless and tried to recruit a second agent – who reported the incident to the security authorities .
Estonian mole - hunters began to reconstruct the movements of the supposed Spaniard and followed the thread back to the agent inside Nato .
Simm had headed government delegations in bilateral talks on protecting secret data flow .
And he was an important player in devising EU and Nato information protection systems .
Simm is likely to be formally arraigned at the beginning of next year after the damage control teams from Nato have completed their work .
If found guilty he could face between three and 15 years in prison .
Neither the Simms , nor their defence lawyer , have commented on the charges .
Nato too has refused to say anything .
But there is no doubting that the case is a serious embarrassment .
Russia may have lost an agent – ' a gold card operative ' according to one Estonian newspaper – but it has achieved a tactical victory by sowing suspicion between western Nato members and the new east and central European entrants .
Race has become the elephant in the room of the 2008 presidential campaign , with Obama ’s prospect of becoming the first black president .
Racists for Obama ?
New polling and a trickle of stories from the battleground states suggest that Sen.
Barack Obama 's coalition includes one unlikely group : white voters with negative views of African - Americans .
Race has become the elephant in the room of the 2008 presidential campaign , with Obama ’s prospect of becoming the first black president drawing some Americans closer to him while pushing others away .
At times , the contest has slipped into a familiar dynamic of allegations of racism and outraged denial — but it's also challenged some easy assumptions about race , racism and prejudice .
Advertisement
“ What you see is it ’s perfectly possible to hold a negative view of at least one aspect of African - Americans and yet simultaneously prefer Obama , ” said Charles Franklin , a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
“ Racial feelings are not as cut and dried — not as black and white — as people often say . ”
Franklin explored those contradictions in a large , national survey taken in mid-September , when the Illinois Democratic senator 's rival , Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , led in many polls and the nation ’s economic woes had not yet produced a deep crisis .
The poll asked voters whether they agreed with the statement that “ African - Americans often use race as an excuse to justify wrongdoing . "
About a fifth of white voters said they “ strongly agreed . ”
Yet among those who agreed , 23 percent said they ’d be supporting Obama .
“ This result is reasonable if you believe that race is not as monolithic an effect as we might easily assume , ” Franklin said , noting that 22 percent of those who " strongly disagreed " said they'd be supporting McCain .
Anecdotes from across the battlegrounds suggest that there ’s a significant minority of prejudiced white voters who will swallow hard and vote for the black man .
“ I would n’t want a mixed marriage for my daughter , but I ’m voting for Obama , ” the wife of a retired Virginia coal miner , Sharon Fleming , told the Los Angeles Times recently .
One Obama volunteer told Politico after canvassing the working - class white Philadelphia neighborhood of Fishtown recently , " I was blown away by the outright racism , but these folks are … undecided .
They would call him a [ racial epithet ] and mention how they do n't know what to do because of the economy . ”
The notion that there might be “ racists for Obama , ” as one Democrat called them , comes against the backdrop of a country whose white voters largely accept the notion of a black president .
“ The economy is trumping racism , ” said Kurt Schmoke , the dean of Howard University Law School and a former Baltimore mayor .
“ A lot of people who we might think would n’t vote their pocketbook because of race — now they are . ”
“ If you go to a white neighborhood in the suburbs and ask them , ‘ How would you feel about a large black man kicking your door in , ’ they would say , ‘ That does n’t sound good to me , ’ ” said Democratic political consultant Paul Begala .
“ But if you say , ' Your house is on fire , and the firefighter happens to be black , ' it ’s a different situation . ”
“ The house is on fire , and one guy seems like he ’s calm and confident and in charge , and that ’s the only option , ” he said .
That is , in less dramatic terms , more or less the campaign ’s official talking point , a version of the longtime Democratic hope that class will — or at least should — matter more than race .
“ Voters are less interested in the hot button and are more interested in the cooling economy , ” said Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. ( D - Ill. ) , an Obama ally who is as on - message as his father is off .
But other , more nuanced , questions of race are also in play .
One senior congressional Democrat mused about prejudice among his own supporters .
“ They ’ve all got one black friend , ” he said , “ and they wo n’t stop talking about their black friend . ”
“ That ’s Obama , ” he said .
And some argue that elements of Obama ’s story and persona make him specifically acceptable to voters who hold broadly negative views of African - Americans .
“ Not all whites associate the generic African - American with Obama , ” said Ron Walters , a longtime student of race and politics and aide to the senior Jesse Jackson ’s presidential campaigns .
“ They give him credit for having half a Caucasian ancestry , and give him credit for his education , and give him credit for his obvious ability to take complex subjects and parse them . ”
The geography of racial conflict and tolerance has been a strong overlay of the electoral map .
Obama has run better than past Democrats in prosperous states with little history of tension , such as Colorado and Iowa , and worse in working - class states in the Appalachian belt .
His campaign has been structured around this dynamic and may actually have overestimated the number of white Democrats in the region unwilling to vote for him because of his race .
Obama had ignored West Virginia , for instance , until a spate of positive polls prompted him to start advertising there this week .
Obama has also ignored Southern states with a history of deep racial division , from Arkansas to Mississippi , in favor of those that have seen an influx of new voters from the north — Virginia , North Carolina and Florida .
Until this fall , both campaigns viewed Michigan — a heavily Democratic state , but one with a history of tension between Detroit and its white suburbs — as Obama ’s Achilles ’ heel .
In 2006 , the state was deeply divided by a referendum to ban affirmative action .
The measure was opposed by most African - American voters as an assault on hard - won gains , but it won broad support among whites and passed by a double - digit margin .
But earlier this month , McCain gave up the state for lost as economic concerns appear to have trumped racial ones .
“ Obama ’s personality — his speech , his look — he provides [ white voters ] with a non-threatening way to move forward on this issue , and that ’s a very positive development , ” said David Waymire , who led the unsuccessful opposition to the anti-affirmative action initiative .
“ He is not Kwame Kilpatrick , ” he said , referring to the Detroit mayor who resigned last month after pleading guilty in a sex and misconduct scandal .
For black observers of American politics in particular , Obama ’s ability to win over voters who harbor negative views of African - Americans at large is a complex , but hopeful , sign .
“ I did n’t think the election itself is necessarily going to transport a lot of people , but I ’ve been changing my view on that a bit lately , ” said Walters .
“ I ’ve been in personal circumstances where I said to myself , ‘ I wonder if this person sees me differently because a black person is about to be the president of the United States ? ’ ”
As Canada 's own investigation into P2P throttling slowly moves to its conclusion , the US investigation into similar practices at cable giant Comcast continues to chug along .
Comcast has quite vocally insisted that the FCC does n't actually have the authority to address the issue , but a staff attorney at Public Knowledge has dug up a fascinating nugget of information showing Comcast making exactly the opposite claim ... when it suits the company 's purposes .
In this case , those purposes include avoiding a lawsuit over deceptive advertising , violation of the FCC 's traffic management principles , and breach of contract .
A California man brought a suit against Comcast over those issues , but Comcast turned around and asked the judge to stay the case since the issues involved have " been firmly placed within the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission , an administrative agency whose authority to regulate Internet broadband access companies ' services is well - established . "
District Judge Phyllis Hamilton agreed , saying that the issue was better handled uniformly at the national level than through a series of lawsuits in different parts of the country .
As the FCC is " already using its recognized expertise to consider some of the exact questions placed before the court here , " Hamilton stayed the case until the FCC makes some sort of decision .
This is exactly what Comcast was asking for , suggesting either that the cable giant has abandoned its quest to gut the FCC 's authority to rule on network management issues or that different parts of the company simply make whatever argument is convenient at the time .
With the FCC , a federal judge , and Comcast itself , all saying now that the agency has the needed authority , perhaps a lawsuit can be avoided if the FCC does choose to lay down the smack .
Comcast has already chosen to move to a protocol - agnostic throttling solution that wo n't discriminate against P2P apps anyway , but FCC watchers have worried that the cable company could tie any ruling up for months or years in the courts simply out of principle ; few ISPs are excited about the idea of FCC regulation , even when they voluntarily choose to do what that regulation would require .
It 's not surprising , then , that the cable lobby 's basic proposal for FCC reform involves gutting the agency .
Pentagon mixed propaganda with PR , report finds John Byrne
Published : Friday December 12 , 2008
Print This Email This The Pentagon may have mixed propaganda with public relations in an effort to win the " war of ideas " as part of the Iraq war , according to a little - noticed report released Thursday .
An inspector general 's report said a whopping $ 1 million had been used to merge propaganda and PR efforts in 2007 and 2008 .
The Senate recently stripped out $ 3 million from the Pentagon budget for a Defense Department " strategic communication " program .
" Without clearly defined strategic communications responsibilities , DoD may appear to merge inappropriately the public affairs and information operations functions , " the inspector general said in a report released yesterday nestled in a Washington Post article .
Such programs should be the province of the undersecretary of defense for policy , it added .
The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs " should only perform strategic communications responsibilities related to its public affairs mission , " while calling attention to a 2005 Pentagon document , " Public Affairs , " which asserted that PR and " information " ops " differ with respect to the audience , scope and intent and must remain separate . "
" The inspector general also raised questions about the Office of Public Affairs ' use of funds and personnel from the Armed Forces Information Service to carry out its functions without specific authority , " veteran intelligence reporter Walter Pincus noted Friday .
" AFIS , which was recently renamed Defense Media Activity , runs Pentagon internal communications including Stars and Stripes as well as the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service .
With a budget of more than $ 160 million and about 1,200 staff members , it nonetheless comes under the authority , direction and control of the assistant secretary for public affairs , whose authorized staff is only 89 , according to the report . "
Strikingly , the Washington Post is the only media outlet to have reported on the report , according to an examination of Google News Friday morning .
Middle East Quarterly SEPTEMBER 1997  VOLUME 4 : NUMBER 3 Prince Charles of Arabia https://www.meforum.org/356/prince-charles-of-arabia
[ T ]he effort for these years to live in the dress of Arabs , and to imitate their mental foundation , quitted me of my English self , and let me look at the West and its conventions with new eyes : they destroyed it all for me .
- T.E.Lawrence Seven Pillars of Wisdom1 Prince Charles has often surprised his future subjects , but few shocks match the allegations of a newspaper article that appeared in October 1996 : 2
The idea of the Prince of Wales lugging around a prayer mat and turning to face Mecca five times a day sounds a tad unlikely - but , then again , so did confessing to adultery on prime - time television a couple of years ago .
So perhaps no one should be shocked by the suggestion in a forthcoming book that Prince Charles has converted to Islam .
This claim was put forward by no less a personage than the grand mufti of Cyprus : " Did you know that Prince Charles has converted to Islam .
Yes , yes .
He is a Muslim .
I can't say more .
But it happened in Turkey .
Oh , yes , he converted all right .
When you get home check on how often he travels to Turkey .
You 'll find that your future king is a Muslim .
" 3 " Nonsense , " replied a Buckingham Palace spokesman , denying Charles 's supposed conversion .
Lord St. John of Fawsley , a constitutional expert , is no less dubious , commenting that " The Prince of Wales is a loyal member of the Church of England . " 4
Some time later , a leak to the press told of Charles 's " desire to play a greater role in the Church of England , " an apparent attempt to reinforce the prince 's Anglican credentials .
5
Rumors about the Prince of Wales 's conversion to Islam may well be inaccurate ; even so , the fact that spokesmen official and unofficial felt compelled to deny this fact results from persistent speculation about Charles 's religious loyalties that arises out of his statements and actions of recent years .
And these , in turn , reflect a larger trend in Western society .
CHARLES'S PUBLIC STATEMENTS ABOUT ISLAM
The future Charles III has made several strong public statements endorsing Islam as the solution to the spiritual and cultural ills of Britain and the West .
His public advocacy of Islam appears to go back to 1989 , when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued an edict ( fatwa ) against Salman Rushdie , a British citizen , for blaspheming the Prophet Muhammad in his novel The Satanic Verses .6
Rather than defend Rushdie 's freedom of speech , Charles reacted to the death decree by reflecting on the positive features that Islam has to offer the spiritually empty lives of his countrymen .
Charles first delivered a major address on Islam on October 27 , 1993 , at the Sheldonian Theatre at Oxford where he is a vice patron of the Centre for Islamic Studies .
7
He declared that the usual attitude to Islam suffers because the way we understand it has been hijacked by the extreme and the superficial .
To many of us in the West , Islam is seen in terms of the tragic civil war in Lebanon , the killings and bombings perpetrated by extremist groups in the Middle East , and by what is commonly referred to as " Islamic fundamentalism . "
The Prince of Wales then explained the causes for this distorted understanding : Our judgement of Islam has been grossly distorted by taking the extremes to the norm .
. . .
For example , people in this country frequently argue that the Sharia law of the Islamic world is cruel , barbaric and unjust .
Our newspapers , above all , love to peddle those unthinking prejudices .
The truth is , of course , different and always more complex .
My own understanding is that extremes , like the cutting off of hands , are rarely practised .
The guiding principle and spirit of Islamic law , taken straight from the Qur'an , should be those of equity and compassion .
Charles suggests that European women may even find something to envy in the situation of their Muslim sisters : Islamic countries like Turkey , Egypt and Syria gave women the vote as early as Europe did its women - and much earlier than in Switzerland !
In those countries women have long enjoyed equal pay , and the opportunity to play a full working role in their societies .
Charles considers Christianity inadequate to the task of spiritual restoration and denigrates science for having caused the West to lose its spiritual moorings .
Echoing a common Muslim theme , he declares that " Western civilisation has become increasingly acquisitive and exploitive in defiance of our environmental responsibilities . "
Instead , he praises the " Islamic revival " of the 1980s and portrays Islam as Britain 's salvation : Islam can teach us today a way of understanding and living in the world which Christianity itself is poorer for having lost .
At the heart of Islam is its preservation of an integral view of the Universe .
Islam - like Buddhism and Hinduism - refuses to separate man and nature , religion and science , mind and matter , and has preserved a metaphysical and unified view of ourselves and the world around us .
. . .
But the West gradually lost this integrated vision of the world with Copernicus and Descartes and the coming of the scientific revolution .
A comprehensive philosophy of nature is no longer part of our everyday beliefs .
He concludes by suggesting that " there are things for us to learn in this system of belief which I suggest we ignore at our peril . "
Among the many titles borne by the British sovereign is " Defender of the Faith , " a reference to the fact that the monarch heads not only the government but also the Church of England .
But the prince has reservations about this title .
In a June 1994 television documentary he declared his preference to be known as " Defender of Faith " rather than " Defender of the Faith , " 8 leading to a rash of speculation that he favors the disestablishment of the Church of England .
9 Charles has continued to discuss the role of Islam in the United Kingdom .
In a speech at the Foreign Office Conference Centre at Wilton Park in Sussex on December 13 , 1996 , he called on Islamic pedagogy and philosophy to help young Britons develop a healthier view of the world .
10 Praising Islamic culture in its traditional form for trying to preserve an " integrated , spiritual view of the world in a way we have not seen fit to do in recent generations in the West , " he went on to say :
There is much we can learn from that Islamic world view in this respect .
There are many ways in which mutual understanding and appreciation can be built .
Perhaps , for instance , we could begin by having more Muslim teachers in British schools , or by encouraging exchanges of teachers .
Everywhere in the world people want to learn English .
But in the West , in turn , we need to be taught by Islamic teachers how to learn with our hearts , as well as our heads .
The results of this study will help Westerners to rethink , and for the better , our practical stewardship of man and his environment - in fields such as health - care , the natural environment and agriculture , as well as in architecture and urban planning .
In addition to these comments on Islam , Charles has taken steps to give that religion a special status .
For example , he set up a panel of twelve " wise men " ( in fact , eleven men and one woman ) to advise him on Islamic religion and culture .
11
This caused much talk , especially as the group was reported to have met in secret .
Some noted that no comparable body exists to inform the crown prince about other faiths practiced in his future realm .
REACTIONS Muslim world .
Charles has traveled extensively in the Muslim world , with recent visits to Morocco , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Bahrain , Qatar , and Bangladesh .
He has visited Turkey so often that some observers believe that to be the country where his rumored conversion to Islam took place .
In addition , he has visited mosques in the United Kingdom , for example , dropping in on one at the end of Ramadan in April 1996 .
Some offices of the British government have found a practical use for the prince 's affection for Islam .
In particular , the Foreign Office uses him as a point man for British business interests in Muslim countries , leading one journalist to comment that " the Charles of Arabia phenomenon is here to stay , " for it helps assure British commerce with the Muslim world .
12 Although some Britons may be bewildered at Prince Charles 's infatuation with Islam , he has become a hero among Muslims .
His February 1997 visit to Saudi Arabia got moderate coverage in the British press - but it was huge news in the host country .
In Saudi Arabia , the overwhelming theme of the welcoming addresses was of the Prince as candid friend of the Islamic world .
The warmth of his welcome was extraordinary .
The writer of this account , John Casey of Cambridge University , warns that the British public lacks a clear understanding of Charles 's standing in the Muslim world :
The extent to which the Prince is admired by Muslims - even to the point of hero - worship - has not yet sunk into the consciousness of the British public .
When it does , that public may or may not be pleased .
Casey concludes that the prince of Wales 's " hero status " in the Arab world is permanent .
" No other Western figure commands this sort of admiration .
" 13 Charles 's Muslim admirers can be generous in their gratitude .
At a private dinner with prince Charles in May 1997 , Prince Bandar bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia announced a donation by King Fahd of $ 33 million to Oxford University to construct a new Centre for Islamic Studies at Oxford , a gift designed " to establish Islamic studies at the heart of the British education system .
" 14 Great Britain .
Charles 's speeches provoked a flurry of comments in England .
In the popular perception , he is a spiritual dilettante , something of a religious butterfly , flitting from faith to faith and veering , increasingly , towards Islam .
. . .
The sight of the Prince in yet another prayer shawl only compounds the image of a well - intentioned eccentric seeking divine inspiration .
15 Others wonder if Charles is aware of the punishments Islamic law metes out to adulterers - and whether he " exacted some sort of guarantee " before traveling to the Muslim world that he would not be " stoned or beaten by devout Saudi or Bangladeshi natives .
" 16 Some Englishmen took their prince 's statements more seriously .
Patrick Sookhdeo , director of the Institute for the Study of Islam and Christianity , raised questions about the coherence of Charles 's approach to Islam , commenting that " It is not fair to compare the best ideals of the Islamic faith with the worst of Western cultural decadence . "
Sookhdeo also reminded Charles that many Muslims see in Western traditions the solution to their own problems :
What do Muslims living in a Muslim context feel ?
Are they content to continue submitting to authority in every detail of their lives ?
Many are not .
We hear much about radical Islamists seeking an even closer adherence to the original teachings of Islam .
But we hear little about the opposite phenomenon : the Muslims who are attracted by democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of conscience , respect for the rights and worth of the individual and other characteristics of Western society .
17 Another commentator reversed Charles 's argument and held that some of Britain 's million and a half Muslims need instruction in British values : it would be interesting to know who they [ the Muslim leaders with whom Charles associates ] are .
Do they include Sheikh Omar Bakri Mohammad , who supports Hamas , agitates for an Islamic state , and recently called for homosexuals to fling themselves off Big Ben ?
Or the dissident Dr. al - Mas'ari , who has used the new freedom of speech which we in this country have given him to call for the extermination of the Jews ?
18 Prime Minister John Major reacted to Charles 's sentiment about wanting to be known as " Defender of Faith " with the understated comment that " it would be a little odd if Prince Charles was defender of faiths of which he was not a member .
" 19 The conflict between Charles 's enthusiasm for Islam and his subjects ' leeriness played itself out recently at Oxford , where the reaction to King Fahd 's huge gift to the Islamic center met with little enthusiasm .
Oxford faculty oppose the gift , claiming its proposed location - on a greenfield site near the heart of the city - would constitute " overdevelopment .
"
20 Presumably their ecological opposition hides other motives as well .
Interestingly , Charles himself has mildly experienced the wrath of fundamentalist Islam .
Just after Ayatollah Khomeini issued his death decree against Salman Rushdie , Charles was in the Persian Gulf and Tehran radio denounced his presence there " as a snub to Islam .
" 21 Because of " heightened security concerns in the wake of Muslim furor over The Satanic Verses , " 22 the prince was forced to withdraw from a polo match in Dubai .
But this brush with Muslim extremists has not dissuaded Charles from reassuring others that Islam 's problem is only one of image .
It bears noting that Charles is not the royal family 's only link to the Muslim world , for Princess Diana , Charles 's ex-wife , has often been linked to Hasnat Khan , a London - based cardiac surgeon .
Just as Charles donned a Muslim prayer shawl , Di wore a traditional shalwar kameez during her visit to Khan 's family in Pakistan .
London 's Sunday Mirror23 reports that Khan 's family has approved a possible marriage of the divorced 35 - year - old princess and their son , then quoted the princess ( via a " friend " ) to the effect that she hoped Khan would father a half - sister to her two sons , princes William and Harry .
While Diana 's divorce from the heir to the British throne removes her personally from the royal family , her sons could be the first heirs to the British throne with a Muslim stepfather .
CONCLUSION
The denigration of the West at the expense of a foreign tradition that Charles engages in occurs quite commonly among the West 's intellectual elite .
For some it is Islam , for others Tibetan Buddhism , Maoist thought , or American Indian spirituality .
In all cases , the alien is assumed superior to the familiar .
Arthur Schlesinger replies to this that there remains a crucial difference between the Western tradition and the others .
The crimes of the West have produced their own antidotes .
They have provoked great movements to end slavery , to raise the status of women , to abolish torture , to combat racism , to defend freedom of inquiry and expression , to advance personal liberty and human rights .
24 Should Charles persist in his admiration of Islam and defamation of his own culture , it could be , as The Independent puts it , that his accession to the throne will indeed usher in a " different kind of monarchy . "

While some users have praised the touchscreen for being " clickable " - allowing it to offer tactile feedback - many say the keys on the virtual keyboard are too close together and the clickable screen is cumbersome for typing long messages .
This is a deal breaker for a device that is designed primarily for email .
" I think dumping an unfinished , buggy device on people was pretty shameful and shoddy , " wrote one user on CrackBerry.com in a view consistent with other accounts .
Vodafone has heavily subsidised the handset cost of the Storm , offering it for $ 0 upfront on a $ 69 - a - month plan that includes unlimited email and internet usage .
Both Vodafone and the US carrier Verizon say the Storm is their fastest selling handset yet .
Vodafone said last month it was forced to push back the Australian launch from Monday due to unprecedented demand .
" In the UK , we 've been selling a Vodafone Storm every 13 seconds , and on the basis of demand from our pre-registration process , which is well into the thousands , we 're expecting demand to be just as hot here in Australia , " Vodafone Australia CEO Russell Hewitt said at the time .
But the honeymoon period has now worn off after overseas users had the chance to play with the Storm for a few weeks .
" Having used many other [ BlackBerry maker ]
Research In Motion devices , I can't remember a device being released with so many bugs , " Allen Nogee , In - Stat Research 's principal analyst for wireless technology , told MSNBC .
" There is no doubt that this device was rushed to market to make the Christmas selling season . "
David Pogue , the gadget reviewer for The New York Times , dubbed it the " BlackBerry Dud " in his review , published late last month .
He found that operating the phone using the touchscreen was far clunkier than on the iPhone 's touchscreen , and picked up several minor but annoying bugs .
" When you open a menu , the commands are too close together ; even if your finger seems to be squarely on the proper item , your click often winds up activating something else in the list , " he wrote .
Another universal complaint about the Storm has been its slow operation , particularly when switching between vertical and horizontal modes using the built - in motion sensor .
The long shutter delay on the built - in camera has also attracted criticisms , as has the crashing media player .
In an update published today , Pogue said he had received 100 comments from readers who bought the Storm and regretted it .
" Where do I begin ?
The address book is a joke .
Ca n't go straight to any given letter , so must scroll all the way through every time , " wrote one agitated Storm user .
" Everything 's slow : Scrolling , screen rotating , selecting apps , search ... everything .
It has crashed several times just trying to play movies .
When you press the screen , it jumps over and ' clicks ' the key next to what you wanted ... this is maddeningly frustrating . "
Research in Motion has so far refused to comment on the complaints .
After a public hearing which was full of passion and anger , the MTA 's board approved its 2009 budget , which includes service cuts and a 23 % increase in revenue from fare and tolls hikes .
The MTA is facing a $ 1.2 billion budget deficit next year , and it 's expected a monthly unlimited Metrocard could cost more than $ 100 while bus lines and subway stops are limited .
The cuts and fare hikes will not go into effect until next spring , which the NY Times points out provides " time for state lawmakers to enact a rescue package to shore up the authority ’s teetering finances . "
( The Post reports , " The MTA legally has to have a balanced budget by year 's end , no matter how the gap is filled . " )
Indeed , MTA Chairman Dale Hemmerdinger said , “ Our fervent hope is that available resources will grow in the coming months , so that this budget can be amended before it is implemented . ”
That sounds like a Christmas miracle — waiting for the state to act !
MTA Executive Director and CEO Elliot Sander said , “ I have called this budget draconian , severe , and extremely painful , and it is all of those things . "
Sander was nearly on the receiving end of one subway rider 's frustration when Stephen Millies , an Amtrak worker , stood up to testify during the public hearing .
Millies called the MTA " a collection agency for the biggest banks and insurance companies " and demanded to know where Sander was , as he reached for his shoe and yelled , " You made $ 300,000 last year , and this shoe is for you ! "
Here 's video :
Police arrested Millies and gave him a summons for disorderly conduct .
Millies told the Daily News , " I was simply showing the sole of my shoes as a sign of contempt ... "

Hi .
I followed up on a story about the Diebold TSx not recording votes on the lower left of the screen at the Sprague Library in Salt Lake City , Utah , and reported it to CNN , which then forwards you to your local county officials .
There I spoke to a young lady ( at 2:51 pm MDT ) who left the phone for a few minutes then came back to tell me that " The machines are working fine . "
She got this from someone she called Scott K , a technician regularly employed by the Salt Lake County Elections office , who had been sent to the Sprague Library and he told this young lady that the machines were working fine .
She also said I could call him at his phone number , 801-468-3470 .
So I did .
Scott told me that he'd heard that a voter was having difficulty voting , so he stopped by to see if there was an issue , but that it turned out to be a human problem , not a machine problem .
I asked if the pollworkers had been aware of the problem , and at this point Scott wanted to know if I was calling as a citizen or was I part of a group .
I said I was a citizen who will post what I find out online because activist organizations across the country were asking individual citizens to get involved in reporting .
We continued .
Scott said that according to the pollworkers , when the voter 's vote had not registered , one of them had tried , and failed , but that they solved the problem before the voter actually finally " cast " the vote .
Scott observed a demonstration of what had happened , and he told me that for the vote attempts that did not register , they were touching the screen in a way that he would n't expect the screen to be responsive .
They were pressing it with a wide surface of their finger , then pressing very hard .
When he heard my typing , Scott asked about it , then said he should have been told that I was doing so , but I simply asked if there was a problem with it , and continued .
Scott reiterated that this was a human problem rather than a mechanical one , that people touch things differently , and that some machines are more responsive than others .
When I interrupted to question that , he said , " Let me rephrase that . "
Some touches , he tried to explain , " The way people touch the screen has something to do with a machine 's responsiveness . "
I questioned whether this was information that the voters knew or that the pollworkers knew ?
Scott 's response was to point out the three " feedback mechanisms " in the system that give the voters a chance to check to see if their vote was properly recorded before voting .
He insisted that this was a voter problem and not a pollworker training issue .
He said that a voter is usually persistent enough to handle this .
Finally , he said that he had told the pollworker that if this should happen again , the voter should be given a pencil , because an eraser head is more precise than a digit .
Then , why do n't the machines have a stylus ?
No response .
Scott 's full name is Scott Konopasek , and his phone at the Salt Lake County Elections office is 801-468-3470 .

What will a Barack Obama Federal Communications Commission look like ?
Veteran telecom attorney Andrew Lipman 's first advice : do n't blink or sneeze while following the Obama transition at the FCC .
" This is the fastest I 've seen it , " Lipman told investors at a briefing on Friday held by Barclays Capital and Bingham McCutcheon .
Lipman has seen a lot of presidential transitions .
He has been practicing Telecom , Media , and Technology law for Bingham for 25 years , advocating before the FCC , state regulatory bodies , Congress , and the courts .
Lipman 's bottom line : With FCC Chair Kevin Martin moving on and his fellow Republican Deborah Taylor Tate termed out when Congress expires , Obama will appoint two , and maybe even three Commissioners relatively soon ( Lipman did n't say who the third ship jumper might be ) .
" We think it 's highly likely that Martin will step down if not immediately , then probably in February at the latest after the DTV transition , " Lipman predicted — in other words , after the February 17 analog - to - digital switch - off for full power TV stations .
Dark horses
What will happen then ?
Obama might make Democrat Michael Copps interim chair , until somebody gets FBI cleared and senatorially approved around the second quarter of 2009 .
Would he give Copps or fellow Democrat Jonathan Adelstein the permanent top job ?
" I would say ' probably not ' , " Lipman suggested , then threw out a bunch of possible " dark horse " candidates for the main position , most " one degree away from Reed Hundt " — Clinton 's FCC Chief in the mid-1990s , now on Obama 's transition team .
These include co-transition team member and Obama Harvard Law Review buddy Julius Genachowski , FCC veteran and former Al Gore adviser Don Gips , former Common Carrier Bureau chief Larry Strickling , former Florida PUC Commissioner Julia Johnson , or broadcast media owner Richard Reingold .
Whoever gets the job will be working with Obama administration 's new cabinet - level position : Chief Technology Officer .
Lipman predicts that the duo wo n't " dial back " because of the recession , because Obama sees high speed Internet as a crucial means to get the country back on its economic feet .
Obama " looks at technology as holistic and as a catalyst for job creation , economic development , closing economic divides , clearly a multiplier impact on the economy , " he says .
" Especially with broadband .
And everybody knows he's an enthusiast for the Internet .
Why not with 370,000 Internet contributions ? "
So the transition may slow down a few dockets , not surprisingly the intractable problem of Universal Service Fund / Intercarrier Compensation reform .
But " expect the vast majority of other issues to keep moving , " the attorney assured his audience .
Hot items to watch include stories we faithfully follow here at Ars : the implementation of the FCC's Order giving the go - ahead to unlicensed white space devices ; the AWS - 3 band , which Martin presently wants contoured for a national free and smut - free broadband service ; and how to finally auction off the 700MHz public safety D Block .
But the front stage lights will shine fullest on the DTV transition .
" This is an issue that is inevitably going to cause hiccups , " Lipman warns .
" The Hill is going to get involved . "
Everyone 's a winner ?
Which portions of the media / telecom industry will do well during the Obama / Biden years ?
A big part of Lipman 's talk focused on potential winners and losers in the saga .
But , in fact , the telecom lawyer did n't mention a lot of losers .
Those he did he called " slight losers , " among them the big telcos .
The favored will include Internet portals and application providers ( " Google , Yahoo ! etc—big winners , " Lipman declared ) .
The reason is pretty obvious .
Obama is a net neutrality supporter , and observers should expect plenty of proactivity in this area from Obama and Congress , including policies " prohibiting discrimination , prohibiting rationing of capacity , " and " prohibiting prioritization of traffic charges . "
Plus Obama " probably would be skeptical of even bandwidth caps , " Lipman speculated .
But the net neutrality fight is " toning down " somewhat , he notes — in part thanks to industry efforts to find private sector fixes for P2P network management hurdles .
The war might tone back up , though , if Comcast 's lawyers beat the FCC's Order sanctioning its BitTorrent throttling in a federal appeals court .
" Expect Congress to move very quickly " if that happens , the attorney warns .
Obama 's FCC will probably make smaller competitive telcos smile , Lipman says .
Do n't expect a lot more forbearance deregulatory breaks going to Verizon and Qwest .
Those special access rates that the smaller carriers depend on for interconnection to the big telcos will probably get looked at , too .
Rural carriers might like the Obama administration as well , among them carriers crabby about exclusive mobile device deals between electronics manufacturers and the big wireless firms .
Anticipate Obama continuing to support the fight to roll back Kevin Martin 's relaxation of the FCC 's limits on newspaper / TV cross ownership , Lipman predicted , and being skeptical of media consolidation in general .
In fact , " I would submit that under an Obama administration some [ finalized merger ] deals could not have gotten done , " he said — XM / Sirius and the AT&T / BellSouth mergers among them .
Expect disability rights groups to get taken seriously about making the next generation of broadband applications more accessible .
And get ready for some Congressional Democrats to grumble about bringing back the Fairness Doctrine , a move that Obama and key reform group leaders say they oppose .
" I 'm not sure that this will be enacted , but expect more pressure here , " Lipman mused .
Even the cable industry may get a better deal from Obama than it 's getting from Martin — at least in some areas .
The President - elect does n't share Martin 's enthusiasm for " a la carte " pricing , letting consumers pick and choose which individual channels to buy .
In any event , " I do n't think that the regulatory environment for cable could be any worse than it is today , " Lipman noted .
Lately , marriage has gotten a bad rap .
It seems like many people these days feel marriage is some archaic arrangement that holds people back from realizing their full potential .
Even if people are n’t particularly anti-marriage , they will avoid getting hitched for as long as they can .
Many men delay marriage because they believe that dating and co-habitating offer all of the benefits ( particularly sex ) of marriage without the commitment and responsibility .
They are fooling themselves .
Nearly all of the true advantages of marriage ( yes , even sex ) apply only to actual married couples , not those couples living together , and certainly not to those simply dating .
Here at the Art of Manliness , we have n’t been shy about the fact that we ’re big proponents of marriage .
We certainly do n’t advocate that men rush into marriage willy nilly , whether they ’re ready or not .
That would be seriously unwise .
But once your find your true love and you ’re sure she ’s the one , there ’s no reason to delay your nuptials .
Why ?
Marriage offers truly significant benefits that can not be found outside of it .
Here are 6 reasons you should grow up , man-up , and stopping being scared of walking down the aisle :
The Benefits of Marriage
More and better sex .
The popular belief is that marriage stifles sexual fulfillment .
The reality is that married men are having better and more frequent sex than their single buddies who go to clubs each weekend trolling for a woman who ’s willing to take them home .
Married men do n’t have to go through all the trouble of having to convince near strangers to sleep with them or crossing their fingers that on the third date they ’re going to get some .
Married sex is even better than co-habitating sex ; 50 % of married men find their sex life physically and emotionally fulfilling , compared to only 38 % of co-habitating couples .
Married sex produces an environment of trust and openness , allowing couples to openly express their sexual needs and desires to their spouse .
This results in better , more satisfying sex .
More money .
Married men are wealthier men .
Married men earn between 10 % - 40 % more than single men .
They also receive promotions more frequently and earn more glowing performance reviews than their single co-workers .
Married men also tend to save more than single men .
It makes sense .
When you ’re married , your entire outlook on money changes .
Realizing that you have someone else to take care of motivates you to do whatever it takes to support her .
If you ’ve been dragging your feet about marriage until you make more money , consider the idea that getting hitched might actually improve your financial picture .
Listen to our podcast on the benefits of marriage :
Better health .
Married men are healthier men .
They stay healthier and live longer than either their single or co-habitating peers .
Just how much healthier are they ?
Take a look at these statistics :
- Married men have fewer infections and a lower risk of heart disease and some cancers .
- Married men are less likely to smoke , drink heavily , and be physically inactive
- Married men are less likely to suffer from health conditions like back pain , headaches , and serious psychological distress .
- Single people spend longer in the hospital , and have a greater risk of dying after surgery
- 9 out of 10 married men who are alive at age 48 are alive at age 65 .
Only 6 out of 10 single men who was alive at age 48 was alive at 65 .
- Married men live 10 years longer than single men .
A whole decade !
So if you ’re looking to kick the grim reaper ’s butt , get married .
A bigger smile .
Married men are happier than their single counterparts .
In the Journal of Marriage and Family , studies showed that 40 % of married people said they were generally happy with their life , while only 25 % of single people said they were .
The bigger smile might be due in part because married men are getting more sex than single men .
But marriage also provides incomparable companionship and forces people to commit to something bigger themselves , which contributes to happiness .
True companionship .
There is an old Swedish proverb that says , “ Shared joy is double joy .
Shared sorrow is half sorrow . ”
Truer words have seldom been spoken .
Marriage basically means always having your best friend around .
My wife Kate always tells people that our marriage is like a “ party every day ! ”
And I concur .
Everything I do from going to the gym to grocery shopping is 10X more enjoyable with my wife by my side .
Some single people say things along the lines of , “ I do n’t need marriage for companionship , I have friends for that . ”
With all due respect to these single folks , you have nothing to compare your level of satisfaction with .
I have been single and married , and nothing comes close to the happiness and companionship your wife gives you .
Your wife is there in the middle of the night when your worries are keeping you up ; she ’s there when you get off work and need to unload the frustrations of your day ; she ’s there to give you a pep talk over the breakfast table on the day you have a big presentation .
No matter how loyal a friend is , they ’re not family .
They move ; they ditch you when they have a hot date , they distance themselves when you have a big fight .
You and your wife made a vow to be together forever ; it ’s wonderful to absolutely know that someone has your back come hell or high water .
Marriage can be as happy as you want it .
With the divorce rate hovering around 50 % , many men view marriage as too risky a chance to take .
But marriage is not a lottery , nor is it a game of Russian roulette .
You do n’t get married and then cross your fingers that you do n’t become one of the statistics .
Divorce is not a disease that some people catch and some people have an immunity to .
There is no more erroneous idea than that of “ falling out of love . ”
Nobody falls out of love .
One or both partners stop working at their relationship and they give up .
Be absolutely sure you pick the right woman to marry , someone who will be just as passionately committed to making the marriage work as you are , and your chances of having a happy marriage are nearly 100 % .
" The U.S. might really have to look at a default on the bankruptcy reorganization of the present financial system " and the bankruptcy of the government is not out of the realm of possibility , Hennecke said .
" In the United States there is already a funding crisis , and they will have to sell a lot more bonds next year to fund the bailout packages that have already been signed off , " Hennecke told CNBC .
In order to solve or stem the economic slowdown , Hennecke suggested the US would have to radically reduce spending across all sectors and recall all its troops from around the world .
As for a stimulus package , there is not much of an industry left to stimulate back into life , Hennecke said .

Yet a research team from the University of Delaware is taking it all in stride .
The physicists , engineers and technicians from the University of Delaware 's Bartol Research Institute are part of an international team working to build the world 's largest neutrino telescope in the Antarctic ice , far beneath the continent 's snow - covered surface .
Dubbed " IceCube , " the telescope will occupy a cubic kilometer of Antarctica when it is completed in 2011 , opening super - sensitive new eyes into the heavens .
" IceCube will provide new information about some of the most violent and far - away astrophysical events in the cosmos , " says Thomas Gaisser , the Martin A. Pomerantz Chaired Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Delaware , and one of the project 's lead scientists .
The University of Delaware is among 33 institutions worldwide that are contributing to the National Science Foundation project , which is coordinated by the University of Wisconsin .
Besides taking a turn as " on-ice lead " for this year 's IceCube construction effort at the South Pole ( or simply " Pole , " as the locals call it ) , Gaisser is managing the University of Delaware 's continued deployment of the telescope 's surface array of detectors , known as " IceTop . "
A huge telescope in the ice
Rather than a giant lens aimed at the heavens , the IceCube telescope consists of kilometer - long strings of 60 optical detectors frozen more than a mile deep in the Antarctic ice like beads on a necklace .
Atop each string of deep detectors sits a pair of 600 - gallon IceTop tanks , each containing two optical detectors .
Ironically , it takes about seven weeks for the water in the IceTop tanks to freeze perfectly , without bubbles or cracks , which could obstruct the tiny flash that occurs when particles pass through the ice .
Neutrinos are among the most fundamental constituents of matter .
Because they have no electrical charge and interact only weakly , these particles can travel millions of miles through space .
Neutrinos can pass right through planets , and they can emerge from deep inside regions of intense radiation such as the accretion disk around a massive black hole .
The surface IceTop detectors measure cascades of particles generated by high - energy cosmic rays showered down from above , while the detectors deep in the ice monitor neutrinos passing up through the planet from below .
When a flash of light is detected , the information is relayed to the nearby IceCube Lab , where the path of the particle can be reconstructed and scientists can trace where it came from , perhaps an exploding star or a black hole .
For Gaisser , this great quest to capture neutrinos is a cosmic journey in more ways than one .
" All of my career at Bartol Research Institute at the University of Delaware has been to study high - energy particles from space , " Gaisser says .
" This experiment we 're building fulfills all of my dreams .
Besides , it 's fun to work here , " he notes .
Working in the deep freeze
A drill camp supports each season of the IceCube project in the 24 - hour daylight of the Antarctic summer .
Drilling is a 24/7 operation with three shifts of drillers .
In the subfreezing temperatures and howling winds , fuel tanks supply generators that make electricity , which is used to heat the water that pulses through the high - pressure hoses that melt the mile - and - a - half - long deep holes into which strings of optical detectors are submerged .
The IceTop team works six days a week from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. , retreating to the warmth of the new Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station , to sleep , eat , and spend what little free time they have reading , watching movies , exercising , or chatting with fellow " Polies . "
Among the new facility 's amenities are constant e-mail communication , a recreation room with enough musical instruments for a band , and a greenhouse where lettuce , cucumbers and tomatoes are grown .
Gaisser and senior electronics instrument specialist James Roth , electronics engineer Leonard Shulman , and physicist Paul Evenson will all work on location at the South Pole over the next several weeks , assisted by Hermann Kolanoski , a colleague who is a professor of physics at the Humboldt University in Berlin .
Ten other scientists and graduate students from the University of Delaware Department of Physics and Astronomy also are involved in the effort , from deployment to data analysis .
They include David Seckel , John Clem , Chris Elliott , Shahid Hussain , Takao Kuwabara , Bakhtiyar Ruzybayev , Todor Stanev , Serap Tilav and Chen Xu .

SSH attacks are in the news again , this time due to new bot - based , distributed brute force campaign .
Essentially , the attackers are bypassing brute force attempts by coming from thousands of different bot - controlled IPs , which allows them to try far more passwords against a given system .
Most brute - force protection focuses on source IP , and with a botnet they have plenty of those to spare .
Here are two simple countermeasures :
Switch to Pure Key - based Authentication
I say pure because it does n’t help to just enable key - based authentication ; you have to disable passwords as an option altogether or you wo n’t be increasing your resistance to brute - forcing at all .
Give it a try and compare your logs before and after .
Move Your SSH Port
There ’s a lot to be said for simply not being there when attacks are coming in .
There ’s a lot of debate on this one , but I stand firmly on the side of obscurity being a good addition to a security posture , as long as the cost of implementation is n’t prohibitive .
So if you have a small user - base , or if you have an easy means of updating the client your users use , simply move your SSH daemon to another port .
These attacks are automated and are n’t likely to hit on any port other than 22 .
The amount of additional effort required to mount similar attacks against all 65,000 + ports makes the attempts a waste of time for attackers , and makes it very much worth the time for you .
As you can see from this crude experiment I did back in March , moving your SSH port does in fact make a difference in the number of brute - force probes you ’ll see , and if you combine this avoidance measure with additional security ( key - based auth ) you ’ll have improved your situation significantly .
From my experiment post :
The stats over the weekend are now over 18,000 connections to port 22 , and five ( 5 ) to port 24
Just remember to always any additional security first , then add avoidance / obscurity afterwards . ::

SAN FRANCISCO — Maybe your old truck is n't responsible for destroying the planet after all .
New climate change scenarios quantify the idea that oil is only a small component of the total global warming problem — the real problem is coal .
If the world replaced all of its oil usage with carbon - neutral energy sources , ecologist Kenneth Caldeira of Stanford University calculated that it would only buy us about 10 years before coal emissions warmed the planet to what many scientists consider dangerous levels .
" There 's an order of magnitude more coal than oil .
So , whether there is a little more oil or a little less oil will change the details in , say , when we reach two degrees warming , but it does n't change the overall picture , " Caldeira said Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union annual meeting .
Many of the efforts to " green " our world 's infrastructure have focused on the importance of changing the world 's transportation systems .
Indeed , one of the images of environmental destruction is the car - choked freeways of Los Angeles — and hybrid vehicles like the Toyota Prius have become a badge of environmental pride .
But as the latest projections show , when it comes to global warming , oil is a bit player on a stage dominated by the massive amounts of coal burning , particularly in the United States and China .
" If we want to change the overall shape of the global warming curve and instead of having it go up , stabilize and eventually go down , we need to deal with coal , " Caldeira said .
The real global warming culprit — as James Hansen and his colleagues at NASA 's Goddard
Institute for Space Studies have long argued — is burning coal to generate electricity .
" Oil and gas by themselves do n't have enough carbon to keep us in the dangerous zone [ of global warming ] for very long , " said Pushker
Kharecha , a scientist and colleague of Hansen at NASA GISS .
While both Kharecha and Caldeira stopped short of saying that the world 's oil usage did n't matter , Caldeira seemed to capture their joint sentiment when he called the combustion of oil a " second - order effect . "
Liquid fuels are so relatively insignificant that no matter what , nothing we put in our cars is likely to change the basic story of climate change .
Even if oil ran out tomorrow and humans began converting coal in its solid form to a liquid you could put in a car — a worst - case scenario for environmentalists — the global warming contribution of that fuel is almost negligible .
Caldeira calculated that swapping out oil for liquified coal would only push the world to dangerous levels of global warming two years earlier than the world 's best business - as - usual estimates .
Either one is dwarfed by the carbon dioxide emissions from traditional coal burned for electrical generation and industrial production .
" I do n't want to say it 's not important what we do to replace oil .
And this is where I 'm being policy prescriptive :
It would be far better to replace it with renewables than with coal liquefaction , " Caldeira said .
" But the big problem is the huge amounts of coal that we 're likely to burn this century and release into the atmosphere in the absence of policy . "
It 's clear : The King of Global Warming Problems is King Coal .

My mother is known for many things , but chief among them is her famous Christmas fudge .
Each year , lucky friends and family make out with a tin or two .
And until my grandfather passed away last year , she would always make an enormous gift basket for him each year at Christmas , filled with several different kinds of the sweet , creamy , toothsome confection .
The fudge is n't coveted so much because the recipe is some great secret .
Instead , it 's the sheer amount of effort and attention required while tending to the fudge that makes it so good .
Certain techniques , certain utensils , a certain level of patience -- all are required to make the perfect batch of fudge .
And if you 're willing to devote yourself to an afternoon over a hot stove , I 'll teach you how to make the kind of fudge that if given to heads of state around the world , would most likely usher in a new era of sweet , fudgy peace .
Mom 's Christmas Fudge
The first thing you 'll need are the proper accessories : a wooden spoon and a big pot , preferably of the Dutch oven variety .
Cast iron to Le Creuset : as long as the pot is deep , thick and heavy , you 're good to go .
Now for the recipe :
3 cups sugar
3/4 cup salted butter ( the butter must be salted ; I strongly recommend Plugra )
1 can ( 5 ounces ) of evaporated milk
1 package ( 12 ounces ) of semisweet chocolate chips ( high quality chocolate chips are important here )
1 jar ( 12 ounces ) marshmallow cream
one cup chopped nuts ( pecans or walnuts but , to quote my mother , " you could live dangerously and use hazelnuts or pistachios " )
1 1/2 tsp. vanilla
Combine sugar , butter and milk in a heavy Dutch oven .
Bring to a full , rolling boil and stir constantly .
Again , to quote my mother , " do n't use this time to change light bulbs , clean the birdcage or trim your herbs ... it needs constant attention . "
Continue boiling until your candy thermometer reaches 234° , again , stirring constantly to prevent scorching .
And here 's the important part : while most recipes will tell you to stir for only five minutes , they are wrong .
Stir until your arm is screaming with pain and until the mixture takes on a -- sorry -- phlegmy consistency , about 20 minutes .
And therein lies the secret to truly great fudge .
Remove the pot from heat and stir in chocolate chips .
Stir until completely melted .
Add marshmallow cream , nuts and vanilla .
Use a hand mixer to beat the mixture on low until well - blended .
Pour into a 13x9 " pan and let cool .
When the fudge has cooled , cut into squares and put into decorative tins , baskets , Ziploc bags , etc. , and present to your awed friends and family .
While they will be utterly amazed by your newly - aquired fudge - making skills , know this : those who live by the fudge , die by the fudge .
People will hound you for this fudge each holiday season for the rest of your life .
But , hey , ca n't say you were n't warned !

Reinforcing conviction that Silverstein was referring to demolition with infamous comments on PBS documentary
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , December 23 , 2008
Newly uncovered video from 9/11 featuring an interview with FDNY lieutenant David Rastuccio on MSNBC confirms that there was a plan to deliberately demolish WTC Building 7 , as was originally indicated in Larry Silverstein ’s infamous statement on the PBS documentary , America Rebuilds .
In the clip , Rastuccio responds to the host ’s statement that “ You guys knew this was coming all day , ” by stating , “ We had first reports that the building was unstable and that it was best for it to come down on its own or it would be taken down , I would imagine that it came down on its own . ”
Though Rastuccio expresses his opinion that the building had collapsed without the aid of explosives , he admits that a plan had been in place to deliberately demolish the structure .
Watch the clip .
This reinforces the fact that when Larry Silverstein infamously told a 2002 PBS documentary that a consideration had been made to “ pull it , ” which is a demolition industry term for deliberate implosion , he did indeed mean that WTC 7 was considered for deliberate demolition .
This would mean that Silverstein ’s later qualification of his comments , that “ pull it ” simply meant to pull the firefighters out of the building , despite FEMA ’s assertion that no firefighting operations even took place inside WTC 7 , was an outright lie intended to deflect possible ramifications arising out of the $ 7 billion dollar payout Silverstein received in insurance after the WTC complex was destroyed .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Numerous other eyewitnesses have come forward to express their conviction that WTC 7 was deliberately demolished .
Emergency Medical Technician Indira
Singh described to a radio show how she learned that WTC 7 was going to be “ brought down ” and the context was clear that it was to be deliberately demolished .
“ After midday on 9/11 we had to evacuate that because they told us Building 7 was coming down .
If you had been there , not being able to see very much just flames everywhere and smoke – it is entirely possible – I do believe that they brought Building 7 down because I heard that they were going to bring it down because it was unstable because of the collateral damage , ” said Singh .
Former Air Force Special Operations for Search and Rescue expert Kevin McPadden also reported his conviction that a countdown preceded the collapse of the building .
“ While we were on the right side , there was firefighters getting ready , they were bussing them back and forth , and a couple of vets that were there – they got the vibe that something was coming down , ” said McPadden .
“ We started asking questions , everybody started asking questions , and the next thing you know there was a Red Cross representative pacing back and forth in front of the crowd holding his hand over the radio – I could n’t hear what it was saying but it was like pulsed – whatever the speech was on there it was pulsed – and that means to me most likely it was a countdown . ”
“ But he took his hand off at the last three seconds and he gave this heartfelt look – like just run for your life – because he did n’t want to bring it on his conscience – he did n’t want to go to his grave with that – and then we had a couple of seconds to put our heads together , ” said McPadden .
Former NYPD officer Craig Bartmer also reported hearing bombs tear down WTC 7 as he ran away from its collapse .
Several TV news networks received advance knowledge that the building was likely to collapse , with both the BBC and CNN reporting at least 26 minutes in advance that the building had already collapsed when it still stood .
Rastuccio ’s newly uncovered comments about a plan to demolish Building 7 are likely to provoke a firestorm of fresh suspicion surrounding the implosion of the structurally reinforced 47 - story skyscraper , which collapsed in 7 seconds within its own footprint despite suffering relatively minor damage from the collapse of the twin towers .

FBI informant : Blagojevich was mob-connected bookie David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday December 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich has gained notoriety for his involvement in a pay - to - play corruption scandal -- but is it possible that he was once a petty criminal ?
Attorney and former police officer Robert Cooley claims that back when he was doing undercover work for the FBI in the late 1980's , Blagojevich was a bookie on the North Side of Chicago who was making payoffs to the mob .
Cooley said in a web interview last week , " I observed Rod , the present governor , who was running a gambling operation out in the western suburbs , he was paying street tax to the mob out there . "
Cooley , whose testimony helped secure 24 convictions for corruption , says he told federal authorities about Blagojevich 's operations almost twenty years ago .
He provided the same information to ABC 7 News in Chicago in 2006 , when Blagojevich was running for re-election .
ABC 7 did not report Cooley 's accusations at that time because he was reluctant to have his identity revealed , but now he is speaking out publicly .
According to Cooley , Blagojevich regularly paid off Robert Abbinanti , an associate of mob boss Marco D'Amico .
" When he ran the first time , " Cooley says of Blagojevich , " I predicted he was a hands - on person who would personally be selling every position there was in the state of Illinois .
That 's exactly what happened . "
A site that reports on organized crime describes one - time mob lawyer Cooley as " the infamously corrupt Chicago attorney of ' Operation Gambat ' fame who bugged his criminal cohorts at the F.B.I.s request for 3 1/2 - years . "
" In the summer of 1989 , " the story continues , " Cooley tipped DAmico off to a high stakes card game to be played outside of Lake Geneva , Wisconsin , where the ' take ' could reach as high as $ 1 million dollars .
... Robert Abbinanti , the Streets and San truck driver , was told to bring along shotguns and a .22 caliber handgun equipped with a silencer to the Wisconsin digs to make a score in hitting the card game . "
Both the attempted robbery and the federal investigators ' plans to arrest the perpetrators on the spot fell through , and " the card game ruse was Cooleys final adventure as an undercover government informant in the DAmico investigation .
Shortly afterward he entered the witness protection program and has been testifying against top level mob guys in one way or another ever since . "
" The reason the city [ of Chicago ] can never be cleaned up , " Cooley now says , " is when the people in power have the money and have the ability to silence the media so the media will not report it .
As long as that goes on , it will never change . "
Blagojevich 's spokeman declined to comment , but his lawyer told ABC 7 he would be delighted to cross-examine Cooley on his allegations .
ABC 7 has more details here .

A few weeks ago , people all over the world were asked to save energy by shutting off their lights on a Saturday evening for at least one hour .
The Washington D.C. - based environmental group that put on Earth Hour , as it was called , did a masterful job of promoting the March 29 event .
Phoenix was one of several cities worldwide that participated on an official level , switching off lights at several municipal buildings .
Hitting the lights is one of the most basic forms of conservation a person could practice , and I can still hear my father not - so - gently reminding me to do so every time I leave a room .
But as it turns out , it ’s not so simple to darken big office buildings .
In Phoenix , the extra labor required to provide the hour of semi-darkness at City Hall and other municipal buildings cost taxpayers $ 3,000 .
That ’s right : Phoenix paid a few grand just to switch its own lights off for an hour .
Some of its lights , that is – the “ non-essential ” ones left on most other times .
As far as I can figure , that ’s far more than the city could have possibly saved in electricity costs for that hour .
It ’s a good bet that other government and business entities lost money on Earth Hour , too .
Cox Communications , for example , which participated by turning off some lights at 17 of its buildings , claims it incurred no expense for the event .
However , the electrical contractor hired by the company donated the labor equivalent of 35 man-hours to make darkness happen , a Cox spokeswoman says .
The World Wildlife Fund made it clear to me how sensitive the issue of cost really is to the marketing of Earth Hour .
Two spokespeople for the group threw fits when asked about the costs of Earth Hour .
“ I do n’t understand why you ’re trying to dig up dirt , ” says WWF spokesman Dan Forman .
“ This is ridiculous . ”
“ We have a global budget for Earth Hour , but I ’m not going to give it to you , ” says Leslie Aun , vice president of public relations for the WWF .
“ The purpose of the event was not to save money or power .
It ’s a symbolic event . ”
Seems like a flawed symbol , if it costs more money to switch off lights for an hour than it does to keep them on .
In the case of Phoenix , some of the darkened city buildings were false , not just flawed , symbols .
That ’s because city staffers drew the blinds on a number of windows to mask the security lighting that had to remain on .
The idea was to fool people on the ground , who might think the city was n’t fully committed , according to one city employee who ’d rather stay anonymous .
Lots of regular folks and businesses got involved in Earth Hour and felt good about it .
People at restaurants ate by candlelight and students walked through Arizona State University ’s downtown campus with flashlights .
“ For anyone wondering if this was all a waste of energy , ” Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon later pointed out in an Internet article , “ … the message behind Earth Hour was that each of us can do our part – just by taking whatever small , simple steps work for us and our family . ”
Which all sounds very reasonable , not to mention warm and fuzzy .
Except that in Phoenix , it actually was a waste of energy .
Small , simple steps are too small and simple to really work .
That ’s the overall theme of this week ’s special “ Green Fatigue ” edition of New Times .
In the big scheme of things , Earth Hour was a drop in the bucket .
Power companies APS and SRP saw a reduction in power equal to the elimination of about 9,000 homes for that hour , says APS spokesman Dan Wool .
The companies saw a combined drop of about 45 megawatts of power , he says .
By comparison , APS alone delivered about 3,500 of power that fine spring day .
On the hottest summer days , APS pumps out about twice that much power .
Imagine that each of those hypothetical 9,000 homes taken off the grid for Earth Hour had an average monthly bill of $ 300 .
That would be about $ 2.7 million total .
The average month has 730 hours , so that means the money saved by Earth Hour , in terms of retail energy cost , was less than $ 3,700 .
In other words , the $ 3,000 spent by Phoenix alone nearly equals the total energy savings of Earth Hour in Arizona .
Good thing this was n’t about saving money or power .
Other costs would be difficult to measure , especially without the help of event ’s organizer .
The WWF ’s Aun says her group normally does not release internal financial figures , and she could n’t even say whether the WWF itself made or lost money on Earth Hour .
Most of the expenses were paid by corporate sponsors , and much of the labor was donated as well , she says .
That may have saved cities or the WWF some money , but those resources still came from somewhere .
Even volunteers have to eat , drive around and otherwise make use of energy derived from fossil fuels to put on Earth Hour .
If you could total up all the energy it took to put on Earth Hour , it probably exceeded the savings in power , if this area ’s experience is any guide .
Meaning Earth
Hour hurt the Earth , not helped it .
Aun maintains the event was a wild success that raised awareness worldwide about energy conservation .
“ Our corporate sponsors were extremely pleased , ” Aun says .
That statement alone should raise suspicion .
If the corporations did n’t save much money in power costs , what were they so happy about ?
The publicity , that ’s what .
The ability to tell consumers , “ See , we ’re being green ! ”
Newspapers , TV news stations and Internet writers gave Earth Hour uncounted millions of dollars in free publicity .
Aun claims that more than three million people clicked on the WWF ’s website on March 29 .
That ’s a lot of potential donors .
As the Earth Hour Web site states , most sizes of the WWF ’s $ 29.95 Earth Hour T - shirt are sold out .
Some businesses or government entities will save money in the long haul because Earth Hour , because they learned how to better save electricity , Aun says .
Maybe , maybe not .
Wasting energy is bad habit most Americans ca n’t kick .
Even the power companies struggle with it .
APS , for instance , turned off about 5,200 lights in its downtown Phoenix headquarters for Earth Hour , says spokesman Dan Wool .
The lights were considered non-essential , unrelated to security or the company ’s operations , he says .
Wool is thrown for a loop when asked why APS usually leaves those lights on .
He laughs .
Then there ’s an uncomfortable pause .
“ It ’s a really good question , ” he admits .
“ You stumped me on that one . ”

This is staggering in the last week of a campaign :
A second McCain source tells CNN she appears to now be looking out for herself more than the McCain campaign .
“ She is a diva .
She takes no advice from anyone , ” said this McCain adviser , “ she does not have any relationships of trust with any of us , her family or anyone else .
Also she is playing for her own future and sees herself as the next leader of the party .
Remember : divas trust only unto themselves as they see themselves as the beginning and end of all wisdom . ”
I repeat : " she does not have any relationships of trust with any of us , her family or anyone else . "
If McCain does n't trust her , why should anyone else ?

Almost a billion people go hungry each day after food price rises pushed 40 million more people around the world into the ranks of the undernourished , the UN food agency reported yesterday .
According to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) , food prices have more than halved from their historic peaks a few months ago , but the cost of basic staples measured by an FAO index is still high : 28 % higher on average than two years ago .
That has led to an increase in the number of people unable to afford to eat enough calories to lead a normal , active life .
There are now estimated to be 963 million people , 14 % of the world 's population , going hungry in 2008 , up by 40 million from last year .
The FAO 's hunger report , the State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008 , found that the majority of the hungry live in the developing world , 65 % of them in just seven countries : India , China , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Bangladesh , Indonesia , Pakistan and Ethiopia .
The worst affected are landless families , particularly households headed by women .
" For millions of people in developing countries , eating the minimum amount of food every day to live an active and healthy life is a distant dream , " said the FAO 's assistant director general , Hafez Ghanem .
" The structural problems of hunger , like the lack of access to land , credit and employment , combined with high food prices remain a dire reality . "
Farmers in the developed world have been able to respond to higher prices by raising production , increasing cereal output by 10 % .
But those in poorer countries have not had the access to the fertiliser , seeds , water and markets necessary to capitalise on the price rises .
Hilary Benn , the environment secretary , will warn tonight that the world faces a " perfect storm " of threats to food security unless leaders agree a deal to tackle rising prices and environmental damage .
In what experts are saying is a significant shift in approach by the UK , Benn will say in a speech to the Fabian Society that there are a range of threats to producing enough food to feed an expected global population of 9 billion people by the middle of this century and he will call for an international agreement along the lines of the Kyoto protocol to tackle global warming .
" Global food production will need to double just to meet demand , " Benn is expected to say .
In particular , the UK food system 's " dependence on oil will have to change " to use more renewable energy .

Jay Mohr Takes Wife 's Name After Two Years of Marriage
This is an odd bit of news .
After two years of marriage Gary Unmarried starhad decided to incorporate his wife 's last name to his .
She is Las Vegas celeb Nikki Cox .
Mohr filed a petition with the Los Angeles Superior Court last week in order to change his name to Jay Ferguson Cox Mohr .
His romantic gesture just happens to coincide with their second anniversary which falls on December 29th .
This is the second marriage for both .
We found it odd that Mohr waited two years to switch it up , though he 's certainly not the first .
Another celebrity that changed his name legally was John Lennon who took on Yoko Ono 's name to become legally known as John Ono Lennon .

The icon of modern burlesque and glamour modelling , the Notorious Bettie Page , has died aged 84 .
Tame by modern standards , at the start of the 1960’s , Page ’s innocent looks and niche kinky style of provocative posing , caused a storm of protest from the Christian right — a campaign against the adult entertainment industry which continues to this day .
Played by Gretchen Mol in a 2006 biopic on her life , Bettie was shown to have innocently stumbled into being the second ever Playboy Playmate of the month and a figure who inspired women around the world to embrace their sexuality .
She is sighted as a direct influence on Dita Von Tease , Madonna , Danni Ashe and , as pictured here , with Pamela Anderson .

When an executive of the Italian restaurant chain Buca Di Beppo fired Joe Busone , the longtime manager of the Chandler location , he might as well have fired much of the rest of the staff .
In an act of loyalty , seven servers and the hostess walked off the job late last month at the height of the dinner hour , forcing the restaurant to close for the night .
The dismissal might have chased away for good some loyal customers as well .
Busone , 53 , had been the manager at Buca Di Beppo at Ray and Priest roads for eight years , and he had built a reputation as someone generous to community groups and loved by his staff .
Greg Geryak , who owns an insurance agency in Ahwatukee , had organized an annual dinner for the Ahwatukee Kiwanis Club at the restaurant .
Forty people showed up for the 6 o'clock reservation .
Shortly after , Geryak said , " Joe saw me , gave me a hug and walked out the door .
Five minutes later , I heard he was fired .
Then . . . the three guys that were going to take care of my party walked out . "
The group received their dinner , at a reduced rate , but Geryak said it was n't up to Buca standards .
The salad was soggy , drinks were slow in arriving and Geryak had to get up to refill water glasses himself .
Desserts were so slow that a number of the group had left by the time they arrived .
Geryak was so incensed at Busone 's firing that he wrote an e-mail to Planet Hollywood , which recently bought the Buca chain .
" People do business with people they like and trust , and we have lost that trust in your restaurant after a very rash decision your company made on Sept. 23 , " Geryak wrote .
He went on to praise Busone .
" Joe 's commitment to his community was extraordinary , " he wrote .
" His attitude toward helping others is a sound business decision that benefited everyone involved , including Buca . "
Busone has donated food or gift cards for fundraising drawings to a number of organizations , including VFW , Cub Scouts , Chandler High School , Desert Vista High School , the Corona Del Sol football team , Valley Christian High School , Chances for Children , a number of parochial schools , and Tri-City Jewish Community Center .
Busone also has donated free food to the Festival of Lights Wine Tasting and to Kyrene Sierra Elementary School .
He has helped raise money for breast cancer research .
Last year , Buca was the site of a fundraising dinner for participants in the three - day walk that raises money for breast cancer research .
Busone charged a nominal fee for dinner , which covered only part of his cost .
This spring , he donated six big pans of lasagna to a dinner in Chandler for breast cancer survivors .
" Your organization has lost a great leader in Joe Busone , " Geryak wrote .
" I . . . will inform my entire circle of influence that we will not be dining in Buca or any other restaurant owned by Planet Hollywood again . "
Geryak received no response from Planet Hollywood .
Calls from the Republic to Planet Hollywood , Buca Inc. and Serkan Ozekan , the district vice president who fired Busone , were not returned .
So it 's not clear why Busone was fired .
He wo n't talk about it .
Mitch Gonder , one of the servers who quit , spoke highly of Busone .
" He was understanding and interested in your life , " he said .
Another server , Scott Hernandez , said , " He always took a special interest in everyone .
It was not really working for a boss , it was working with him . "
Hernandez said that many of the employees , mostly college students , do n't have a father in their lives , and they looked to Busone as a father figure .
" He was the guy to turn to , " Hernandez said .
For his part , Busone , who owned restaurants in New York before moving to Arizona , says he is looking for another job .
He is concerned about health insurance .
His wife , Cathy , is a breast cancer survivor , and his mother , who has Alzheimer 's , lives with them .
Joe and Cathy have a son who graduated from Arizona State University and a daughter who is a student at Chandler - Gilbert Community College .
He is touched by the loyalty his staff showed by walking out .
" I never expected them to do that , " he said .
" Even if they had asked me , I would have said no . "
He said he took an interest in his staff .
" All young men and women have goals . . .
I try to find out what it is and help them achieve their goal . "
He figures if he takes care of his staff , " they will take care of the guests because they do n't want to let me down .
" If I take care of my people , my people take care of my goal , which is that my guests left happy . "
Busone said the Buca in Chandler ranked Number One in the division of seven restaurants in customer satisfaction surveys , and it ranked fourth in the entire company .
Geryak said the restaurant chain " was so ignorant of the relationship Joe had with his servers . "
Geryak took clients to the restaurant , and he had his daughter 's christening party there .
" I 've had so many different personal and business events there over the years , all because ( Joe ) is a guy who believes in a relationship of giving back to the community who gives to him . "
Another server , Billy Woodmansee , said the staff went to Ozeka and asked him to call Busone back .
" He did n't say anything .
We just took our aprons off , put them on the ground and walked out , " Woodmanesee said
Emily Smith , who worked for five years as the hostess , walked out with the servers and already has another job as hostess at Z'Tejas in Chandler .
She is a student at Chandler - Gilbert Community College and plans to transfer next semester to Arizona State University .
She said she quit her job out of loyalty to Busone .
" He cares , " Smith said .
" He 's one of those people that makes you realize people can be good . "
I have n’t yet decided whether I should enjoy this as schadenfreude or not .
EntreCard has n’t really ever pissed me off , but then again , I left some months ago ( ( July 18th .
I was n’t mad or upset at EntreCard .
S∂ was switching focus , and I did n’t feel that an EC widget would be a great idea for a while .
And as it turns out , I did n’t really need or want it anymore ( and became much too busy ) . ) ) before the drama and excitement .
For those of you who do n’t know , here ’s a 15 - second summary of EntreCard :
It ’s free social network advertising for blogs .
You can pay other participants in “ credits ” ( ec ) to display your 125×125 ad on their site , in a little yellow widget .
Ad costs are on a sliding scale , with very popular blogs costing the most ( 1012ec per day ) , and newcomers the least .
You earn credits by visiting other participating sites and “ dropping ” your card on their widget .
You can also trade services for credits ( example : someone offered to create 125×125 ads in exchange for 50ec .
Or someone offers their recipe for molasses cookies in exchange for 10ec ) .
In other words , EntreCard was social networking with its own economic system that was n’t based on real money .
Ah yes .
Economy .
A lot of EntreCard ’s current problems go back to that aspect , which is , of course , tied into EntreCard ’s very workings .
Note : Not a real EntreCard widget .
EntreCard ’s economy never “ cratered ” , like our current economy is threatening to , but nevertheless some interesting stimulus and other regulation plans were implemented .
I have no problems with such things , especially since the little economic system was having growing pains , but people get grumbly .
This is expected , because while there are EntreCard benefits beyond ads , people ultimately , at some point , want to put their ads on other blogs .
And that means ec .
Since EntreCard was also a social network , complete with forums and everything , a community formed — it was interesting , because interactions were based on both the forum and from blog to blog , since everyone visits everyone else in large part .
( ( I ’m leaving out folks who run spam blogs , since they usually just want the advertising and nothing of the social networking .
Which is what was so interesting about EntreCard : the blend of social networking and advertising . ) )
Some community members stand out — and among them happens to be a guy named Turnip , who runs TurnipOfPower.com , a social marketing blog .
Now , there are some inflammatory folks , as there always are , but Turnip is n’t one of them .
He both praises and criticizes everything , and EntreCard is no exception .
For instance , he discussed EntreCard ’s changes on September 29th , later hashed out possible solutions , and analyzed EntreCard ’s state on its 1st anniversary .
Turnip talked a lot about EntreCard , and in the end , he supported the system .
He ’s a guy you probably want around : honest , thinking , investigates all those strange rumors with an open mind , does n’t actually want your system to die , and in fact , wants to warn you of danger ahead .
That all changed , however , with one tweet .
Turnip has the full tale here , but it can pretty much be summed up as :
Graham , EntreCard CEO
( ( Never mind that I have enough experience to know that he should n’t tout that title around as if it makes him equivalent to all the rest .
For instance , the CEOs of Google , Yahoo , Amazon , even eBay . ) ) :
We ’re autoposting all Twitter posts that mention EntreCard on our blog !
Turnip :
But what happens if a spamming or , nay , dissident tweet shows up ?
Do you have extra filtering ?
* posts dissident tweet joking , “ Is that asshat from Entrecard still wearing his asshat ? ” *
Graham : * zaps tweet *
All you EntreCarders on Twitter , I expect you to have only civilized Twitter conversations , without profanity or attacks , about EntreCard .
Turnip : Wait .
How can you tell everyone on Twitter to only Tweet nice EntreCard tweets ?
Twitter is an entirely separate social networking system !
How are you going to enforce this ?
Graham : * deletes Turnip ’s blog comments *
* deletes Turnip ’s EntreCard account *
EntreCard audience : ….
At this point , if you know anything of the Internet at all , you can guess what happened .
Photography : Focal intent
This entire incident brings about other questions , such as that on Twitter it ’s really easy to spoof somebody else ( it ’s happened to Seth Godin ) and , well , apparently get your victim ’s EntreCard account deleted .
The really strange thing is that Turnip has been a pretty civil guy on the forums , from what I recall .
As someone who used to be a moderator , I have some over - sensitive alarms in my head , but Turnip did n’t ring any of them , up until this tweet , which — in context and with hindsight — is obviously a joke meant to pointedly point something out .
This is a guy whose first reaction to a popular , long - time member getting suspended was n’t “ EntreCard YOU’RE EVIL CENSORING PEOPLE ” but “ are the allegations of stealing content against our member true ?
* searches on Google for a while *
Yeah , they ’re true .
Oh well . ”
Thing is , though , Graham is a bit detached from the social equation of Twitter .
He ’s rarely on the forums .
He gets too much email to read / reply to .
He does n’t really know the EntreCarders from each other , not even Turnip , so it was easy for him to mistake Turnip for just another idiot .
And making jokes online sometimes just does n’t go well .
And out of either his or Turnip ’s control , EntreCard haters immediately jumped down EntreCard ’s throat , on Twitter and elsewhere .
Social media : it is not a beast under rein and harness , yo .
Oh Internets , do n’t you ever change .

The South Financial Group , South Carolina 's largest bank , announced earlier this week that it had been approved to receive $ 347 million from the U.S. government .
But the bank 's founder and longtime CEO Mack Whittle wo n't be sticking around .
He retired with an $ 18 million severance package in late October , two months earlier than had been expected .
Because of the timing , he 's free from golden parachute limits ( PDF ) that come with accepting bailout money .
" It smells like he moved the retirement date up to avoid [ those limits ] , " said Paul Hodgson of the Corporate Library , a corporate - governance research firm .
And the government 's millions " make it a lot easier for the company to pay it out . "
The move has proven controversial .
After South Carolina's
The State reported on suspicions of the deal 's timing , Gov. Mark Sanford ( R ) called for the Treasury Department to investigate and said Whittle seemed to be " gaming the system . "
A spokesman for the governor said he had yet to receive a response from Treasury .
" The whole idea was to avoid these types of arrangements , " Laurence Wagman of compensation consulting firm James F. Reda & Associates told us .
The Treasury " does n't want the companies receiving taxpayer funds , terminating executives and having them walk away with excessive golden parachutes . "
Whittle 's plans to retire had been announced Sept. 5 -- before the worst of the credit crisis and a month before Congress passed the $ 700 billion bailout .
The company said then that Whittle would retire by year 's end .
But on Oct. 24 , shortly after the bank announced that it would be applying for bailout money , the bank decided that Whittle would be retiring early the next week .
Whittle 's successor had yet to be named , and no reason was given for the earlier date .
The $ 18 million package " reflected [ Whittle 's ] 20 year career with [ South Financial Group ] as its founder and only CEO , " the bank said in a statement .
( We called the bank and they referred us to the statement . )
In addition to a $ 4 million cash severance payment and $ 9 million pension benefit , the plan came with a number of side perks like a $ 133,920 auto allowance and $ 75,000 for " financial planning . "
Under Whittle , the bank grew to be the largest based in South Carolina , with $ 13.7 billion in total assets and 180 branch offices in Florida , North Carolina and South Carolina .
But the bursting of the housing bubble has hit the South Financial Group hard .
Since the beginning of 2007 , the bank 's stock has fallen sharply from above $ 26 to about $ 3.50 today .
The bank booked a $ 25 million net loss in its third quarter .
Under the Treasury 's program to buy equity stakes ( which has so far approved investing $ 177.6 billion in 76 banks ) , the banks are restricted in the amount they can pay to departing top executives .
The amount is capped at three times the exec 's average annual compensation .
That can still add up to quite a hefty sum for a CEO who makes millions every year .
South Financial has said that " less than 15 % " ( or about $ 2.7 million ) of Whittle 's package would have been over that limit .
Pensions , for example , can still be unlimited .
So Whittle would still have gotten his $ 9 million pension benefit .
In fact , the widespread ingenuity of executive compensation packages means that an executive at a bank that 's taken federal money could walk away with tens of millions even while abiding by the limits .
The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the country 's biggest banks owe their executives billions in deferred pay and special executive pensions .
Democratic congressional leaders urged the Treasury last month to prohibit golden parachutes altogether .
Treasury officials have said that the executive pay limits are designed to curb excesses while encouraging widespread participation in the program .
Meanwhile , corporate governance analyst Hodgson said that Whittle 's deal -- nominally a retirement , but treated as a severance -- is all too typical of golden parachutes : " If you and I decided to retire , we might get what 's left of our 401 ( k ) .
But for some reason the rules seem to be different for executives .
They get severance even though they 're retiring .
There 's no logic to it at all . "
By watching the motions of 28 stars orbiting the Milky Way 's most central region with admirable patience and amazing precision , astronomers have been able to study the supermassive black hole lurking there .
It is known as Sagittarius A* ( pronounced " Sagittarius A star " ) .
The new research marks the first time that the orbits of so many of these central stars have been calculated precisely and reveals information about the enigmatic formation of these stars — and about the black hole to which they are bound .
"
The centre of the Galaxy is a unique laboratory where we can study the fundamental processes of strong gravity , stellar dynamics and star formation that are of great relevance to all other galactic nuclei , with a level of detail that will never be possible beyond our Galaxy , " explains Reinhard Genzel , leader of the team from the Max - Planck - Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching near Munich .
The interstellar dust that fills the Galaxy blocks our direct view of the Milky Way 's central region in visible light .
So astronomers used infrared wavelengths that can penetrate the dust to probe the region .
While this is a technological challenge , it is well worth the effort .
" The Galactic Centre harbours the closest supermassive black hole known .
Hence , it is the best place to study black holes in detail , " argues the study 's first author , Stefan Gillessen .
The central parts of our Galaxy , the Milky Way , as observed in the near - infrared with the NACO instrument on ESO 's Very Large Telescope .
By following the motions of the most central stars over more than 16 years , astronomers were able to determine the mass of the supermassive black hole that lurks there .
Credit : ESO / S. Gillessen et al .
The team used the central stars as " test particles " by watching how they move around Sagittarius A*.
Just as leaves caught in a wintry gust reveal a complex web of air currents , so does tracking the central stars show the nexus of forces at work at the Galactic Centre .
These observations can then be used to infer important properties of the black hole itself , such as its mass and distance .
The new study also showed that at least 95 % of the mass sensed by the stars has to be in the black hole .
There is thus little room left for other dark matter .
" Undoubtedly the most spectacular aspect of our long term study is that it has delivered what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that supermassive black holes do really exist .
The stellar orbits in the Galactic Centre show that the central mass concentration of four million solar masses must be a black hole , beyond any reasonable doubt , " says Genzel .
The observations also allow astronomers to pinpoint our distance to the centre of the Galaxy with great precision , which is now measured to be 27 000 light - years .
To build this unparalleled picture of the Milky Way 's heart and calculate the orbits of the individual stars the team had to study the stars there for many years .
These latest groundbreaking results therefore represent 16 years of dedicated work , which started with observations made in 1992 with the SHARP camera attached to ESO 's 3.5 - metre New Technology Telescope located at the La Silla observatory in Chile .
More observations have subsequently been made since 2002 using two instruments mounted on ESO 's 8.2 m Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) .
A total of roughly 50 nights of observing time with ESO telescopes , over the 16 years , has been used to complete this incredible set of observations .
The new work improved the accuracy by which the astronomers can measure the positions of the stars by a factor of six compared to previous studies .
The final precision is 300 microarcseconds , equivalent at seeing a one euro coin from a distance of roughly 10 000 km .
For the first time the number of known stellar orbits is now large enough to look for common properties among them .
" The stars in the innermost region are in random orbits , like a swarm of bees , " says Gillessen .
" However , further out , six of the 28 stars orbit the black hole in a disc .
In this respect the new study has also confirmed explicitly earlier work in which the disc had been found , but only in a statistical sense .
Ordered motion outside the central light - month , randomly oriented orbits inside – that 's how the dynamics of the young stars in the Galactic Centre are best described .
" One particular star , known as S2 , orbits the Milky Way 's centre so fast that it completed one full revolution within the 16 - year period of the study .
Observing one complete orbit of S2 has been a crucial contribution to the high accuracy reached and to understanding this region .
Yet the mystery still remains as to how these young stars came to be in the orbits they are observed to be in today .
They are much too young to have migrated far , but it seems even more improbable that they formed in their current orbits where the tidal forces of the black hole act .
Excitingly , future observations are already being planned to test several theoretical models that try to solve this riddle .
" ESO still has much to look forward to , " says Genzel .
" For future studies in the immediate vicinity of the black hole , we need higher angular resolution than is presently possible . "
According to Frank Eisenhauer , principal investigator of the next generation instrument GRAVITY , ESO will soon be able to obtain that much needed resolution .
" The next major advance will be to combine the light from the four 8.2 - metre VLT unit telescopes – a technique known as interferometry .
This will improve the accuracy of the observations by a factor 10 to 100 over what is currently possible .
This combination has the potential to directly test Einstein 's general relativity in the presently unexplored region close to a black hole . "
The global financial and economic crisis resulted in many nations cutting back on all sorts of public spending , and yet military spending continued to increase .
Only in 2012 was a fall in world military expenditure noted — and it was a small fall .
How would continued spending be justified in such an era ?
Before the crisis hit , many nations were enjoying either high economic growth or far easier access to credit without any knowledge of what was to come .
A combination of factors explained increased military spending in recent years before the economic crisis as earlier SIPRI reports had also noted , for example :
Foreign policy objectives
Real or perceived threats
Armed conflict and policies to contribute to multilateral peacekeeping operations
Availability of economic resources
The last point refers to rapidly developing nations like China and India that have seen their economies boom in recent years .
In addition , high and rising world market prices for minerals and fossil fuels ( at least until recently ) have also enabled some nations to spend more on their militaries .
China , for the first time , ranked number 2 in spending in 2008 .
But even in the aftermath of the financial crisis amidst cries for government cut backs , military spending appeared to have been spared .
For example ,
The USA led the rise [ in military spending ] , but it was not alone .
Of those countries for which data was available , 65 % increased their military spending in real terms in 2009 .
The increase was particularly pronounced among larger economies , both developing and developed : 16 of the 19 states in the G20 saw real - terms increases in military spending in 2009 .
Sam Perlo - Freeman , Olawale Ismail and Carina Solmirano , Military Expenditure , Chapter 5 , SPIRI Yearbook , June 2010 , p.1
For many in Western Europe or USA at the height of the financial crisis , it may have been easy to forget the global financial crisis , was primarily a Western financial crisis ( albeit with global reverberations ) .
So this helps explains partly why military spending did not fall as immediately as one might otherwise think .
As SIPRI explains :
Some nations like China and India have not experienced a downturn , but instead enjoyed economic growth
Most developed ( and some larger developing ) countries have boosted public spending to tackle the recession using large economic stimulus packages .
Military spending , though not a large part of it , has been part of that general public expenditure attention ( some also call this Military Keynesianism
Geopolitics and strategic interests are still factors to project or maintain power : rising military spending for the USA , as the only superpower , and for other major or intermediate powers , such as Brazil , China , Russia and India , appears to represent a strategic choice in their long - term quest for global and regional influence ; one that they may be loath to go without , even in hard economic times , SIPRI adds .
For USA ’s 2012 military expenditure , for example , although there is fall , it is primarily related to war - spending ( Iraq and Afghanistan operations primarily ) .
But the baseline defense budget , by comparison , is largely similar to other years ( marking a reduction in the rate of increased spending ) .
By contrast , when it comes to smaller countries — with no such power ambitions and , more importantly , lacking the resources and credit - worthiness to sustain such large budget deficits — many have cut back their military spending in 2009 , especially in Central and Eastern Europe .
( Perlo - Freeman , Ismail and Solmirano , pp.1 – 2 )
Natural resources have also driven military spending and arms imports in the developing world .
The increase in oil prices means more for oil exporting nations .
The natural resource curse has long been recognized as a phenomenon whereby nations , despite abundant rich resources , find themselves in conflict and tension due to the power struggles that those resources bring ( internal and external influences are all part of this ) .
In their earlier 2006 report SIPRI noted that , Algeria , Azerbaijan , Russia and Saudi Arabia have been able to increase spending because of increased oil and gas revenues , while Chile and Peru ’s increases are resource - driven , because their military spending is linked by law to profits from the exploitation of key natural resources .
Also , China and India , the world ’s two emerging economic powers , are demonstrating a sustained increase in their military expenditure and contribute to the growth in world military spending .
In absolute terms their current spending is only a fraction of the USA’s .
Their increases are largely commensurate with their economic growth .
The military expenditure database from SIPRI also shows that while percentage increases over the previous decade may be large for some nations , their overall spending amounts may be varied .
( See also this summary of recent trends , also from SIPRI .
The latest figures SIPRI uses are from 2012 , and where necessary ( e.g. China and Russia ) , include estimates . )

When I finally did get a job , with The Economist , it paid about a third of what I 'd been expecting as a consultant .
I had about a thousand dollars in loan payments , and of course , I had to live in New York , where my job was .
For the first time in my life , I understood what Victorian novelists meant when they described someone as " shabby " .
Over the years since I 'd had a steady income , my clothes had stretched out of shape , ripped , become stained , gone out of style .
I could n't afford new ones .
And I was n't one of those whizzy heroines who can make over her own clothes .
Instead , I frumped around in clothes that never looked quite right , and felt the way my clothes looked .
It took me a long , long time to crawl out of that hole .
I 'll never make what I expected to make as a consultant .
I 'll never have the job security that I had learned to expect in the pre-9/11 world .
The universe will always seem a potentially malevolent place to me , ready to unleash some unknown disaster at any moment .
I was in a better position than auto workers in many ways ; I did n't own a home in a dying area , or have children who needed to be educated .
I 'm not trying to claim that I managed to overcome with hard work and pluck , so why can't they ?
What to do with a fifty year old who pegged his future to a failing industry is a real question .
Nor do I think it 's funny to see autoworkers who lived quite a bit better than most of America get their comeuppance .
It really does n't matter what you make ; losing everything , most especially your dreams and your sense of security , is one of the worst things that can happen to a person .
Laid - off consultants do n't starve , of course , but neither will laid - off auto workers .
They 'll just be forced several rungs down the economic ladder .
It will be humiliating , difficult , and it will sour a number of them permanently on life , and their country .
If I could stop that from happening to people , without making some other aspect of life much worse , I would .
But whatever your feeling about government intervention in the economy , or the correct level of income inequality , I think there 's one thing we can all agree on : for the world to get better , things that do n't work have to fail .
We cannot keep alive every company , every car and every job that someone once liked , because that way lies stagnation and death .
Places where production decisions are made based on how much labor they can consume , rather than how much value they can produce , make everyone in society worse off in the long run .
So while I fully understand the human cost ( I think ) , it has to be borne , for the same reason we could n't save all the folks who loved their gentle home - weaving traditions , or their jobs making buggy whips .
This is , of course , easy to say , when I am not bearing it .
But I 'm not against helping the auto workers transition to doing something else ; I think unemployment assistance is a good idea , and should be extended during this crisis to at least 52 weeks .
I would be fine with a job training program , if we could find one that works ( so far , government training programs seem to run from useless to actively harmful ) .
I 'd be happy to take some of the money we are n't using bailing out auto companies , and offer relocation assistance to people who are trapped in factory towns .
I understand that this is not what the auto workers want ; they want their jobs .
But while I am happy to help the auto workers , I am not happy to help them manufacture undesireable cars at massive social cost .
I too , would have liked to keep my job as a management consultant .
But I did n't have a right to have the job I wanted merely because I liked it .
And it would n't have been good for America if I had .
Legal advocates have petitioned an Indian court to ban Google Earth following intelligence indicating the satellite imaging site was used to plan last month 's terrorist attacks in Mumbai that killed 170 people .
Advocate Amit Karkhanis told India 's High Court the free service " aids terrorists in plotting attacks " by providing detailed images used to acquaint radical militants with their targets .
He asked that Google blur images of sensitive areas in the country while the case proceeds .
It 's by no means the first time government authorities with a world power have taken aim at the popular satellite imaging service .
Earlier this year , the US Department of Defense banned Google from capturing Streetview images of military facilities after discovering 360 - degree views inside a base located in Texas .
Not to be outdone , the British military jumped on the anti Google Earth bandwagon , forcing the site to remove images of military bases in Basra , Iraq .
Australia and South Korea , among others , have also gotten in on the action .
But in those cases , the calls were mostly to blur or censor specific images of sensitive areas .
If articles penned by The Times ( of London ) , UPI , and others are accurate , India 's request goes much further by requesting Google Earth be banned outright .
As The Times points out , investigators believe the gunmen who stormed Mumbai in late November used a wide array of high - tech gizmos to carry out their assault , including GPS systems to navigate by sea , mobile phones with multiple SIM cards , and possibly Blackberry web browsers to monitor events as they unfolded .
No word yet if the government will call for a ban of those services , too . ®

My concern is some of the people around Harper reinforce his worst instincts whereas I 'd like to see him get some calming influence , " said one top Conservative insider who spoke to Hill Climbers on condition of anonymity .
" Caucus and the Cabinet want to see changes , not the leadership changes , they 're firmly behind Harper but they want to see changes around him , people who are giving him advice .
He has to get better advisers , " said the source .
Declared another Conservative insider : " I agree totally with that .
While the Prime Minister does have good people with him , one of his challenges is to expand the circle so that there can be a variety of views that are reflected to him and variety is helpful in these circumstances . "
I suppose that it is a good sign that some Conservative Members of Parliament are now feeling secure enough to speak anonymously on their authoritarian Leader .
Harper should quietly take their advice and remove some of the rabid characters that surround him ... both staff and strategic mouthpieces .
He may want to start by pushing Pierre Poilievre and John Baird back into the ranks of the far back bench .
These two goons do more to turn normal average Canadians off than any other voices in the government .
Harper should take note !

While passing by the Nanhu police station on Nanhu Road today , I saw an interesting scene , a gentleman kneeling down in front of the police station door holding up a sign “ begging for report receipt ” [ evidence of a person reporting a crime to be investigated by the police ] .
Incredibly curious , I went over to figure out what was going on :
This dear friend ’s passport had been detained / witheld by some travel agency , and at 10:30 in the morning he called 110 to request the police to help recover his passport .
The police station had a police officer with the surname Luo who had an extremely bad attitude say that this matter is a dispute , so they cannot handle it , and then stormed out .
This dear friend requested the police station provde a report receipt so he could get his passport , but Mr. Luo police office again said : we cannot give you this receipt , and even if you kneel down and beg me , it will be no use …
All the way until 2:00 in the afternoon , everyone from the police station ignored this dear friend .
Later , what happened was what you see in the pictures below … this gentleman is too creative , even making a sign , and directly kneeling down to beg …
Only until this dear friend raised his sign and got on his knees in front of the police station , did the police station staff come out to inquire .
Then a police officer ( shown in the photo ) came over looking extremely angry : “ Do you want to handle it or not ?
Do you really want to handle it it ?
If you do , then come in ! ! ”
In front of the surrounding crowd , he indicated with his thumb for the man to go inside in a casual way like how friends tell each other to leave !!!
In the end , I do not know if this gentleman accomplished his goal , but I feel he was really creative for doing something this , so comical …

Harmonious society …
Our society is very powerful .
Raising a bunch of pigs is better than raising a bunch of bastards [ the police ] .
China , these dog shits .
This bunch of JC still have not absorbed Yang Jia ‘s lesson .
I want to know …after that person went in , did he come back out ???
“ POLICE ” are not gods , taking care of everything , even dealing with travel agencies withholding passports .
The inside story is that the police officer took one look at the passport and realized he was a “ bangzi ! ”
So this story happened .
At this very moment , I deeply yearn for comrade Yang Jia .
If you do not understand , do not speak blindly , I do not know what your profession is !!!
You can get rid of the pol.ice and then what it is like , you guys will probably have to sleep with a machine gun !
Police have to work day and night , so why are there always people pointing and criticizing them because of a few things .
Who can use a bit of fairness to go evaluate your guys ’ professions ?
That was the Dalai [ Lama ] in disguise , here to disrupt our “ river crab ” society .
[ The Chinese commenter wrote “ 河蟹 ” which is “ river crab . ”
It sounds similar to “ 和谐 ” which is “ harmonious . ” ]
Not towards all “ pol.ice , ” I believe many “ pol.ice ” are still good , but right now there are more and more “ pol.ice ” in the process of becoming trash , or are already trash .

You went in ???
If you went in , do not bother thinking about coming back out normally ; you will be lucky just to crawl back out , pig [ idiot ] …
You think this is America ; where you are allowed to randomly YY ?
How can it be like this ?
Are they not supposed to serve the people ?
Having trouble finding police , dial 110 ???
This sentence has become empty words .
It appears this kind of thing happens a lot .
It happened by my home before .
There was an armored truck company boss whose wife was about to give birth but he did not have enough money on himself .
He said to the doctor , I will go home and get money , please help my wife .
He then went home to get money but came back to find his own wife dead under the “ save the dying and nurse the wounded ” banner .
In his anger , he went home , and brought a gun to the hospital , knelt down and , after killing 4 people and injuring 8 people in one sweep , he gave himself up .
This is the reality of life , just deal with it .
Not comical !
But pretty creative !!!
You can only blame this person for forgetting to give a “ red envelope ” [ bribe ] .
This is the style / practice of Chinese government employees .
When the public security [ police ] beats people , the news will not report it … but when the public security grabs a chicken egg [ do something small and unimportant ] , the news reports on it daily .
I am already speechless .
Anything that happens in China is not one bit weird !
is difficult to find police !!!
My younger brother [ or younger male cousin ] is a small business owner in Nanshan district .
One day , one of his contract workers ran away with the cash , digital camera , DVD player , and other stuff with a total value of tens of thousands of RMB from his apartment .
So my younger brother went to the Nanshan district Daxin police station to report it , and they simply would not issue a receipt , telling you to go home and wait .

When Boris Johnson opens its doors on Thursday next week , Westfield London will be Britain 's largest urban shopping centre .
Sprawling across 43 acres just north of Shepherd 's Bush Green , it will house 265 shops , with Tiffany & Co , Louis Vuitton , Gucci , Prada and De Beers offering glitz alongside Waitrose , Russell & Bromley , Marks & Spencer and other familiar high - street names .
There will be dozens of restaurants , a library , and two new London Underground stations to bring in the masses .
Those who drive will have the option of employing the services of a 70 - strong team of valets .
Needless to say , this is no ordinary shopping centre .
Its makers are marketing it as the cutting edge of " retail experiences " .
Costing £ 1.7bn , it is also the biggest venture – in monetary terms – that the development company , Westfield , has ever undertaken .
Back in 2004 , when Westfield bought the site , it must have seemed an irresistible way to ride the consumer boom .
Given the current economic climate , it feels like an even more audacious move than the company may have intended .
Household budgets are under pressure ; consumer confidence is far from buoyant .
Earlier this week , The Ernst & Young Item Club , an influential forecasting agency , predicted that consumer expenditure on everything from food , clothes , holidays , household bills , home improvements and entertainment will fall by 1.2 per cent in 2009 .
This compares with an average annual growth of 3.5 per cent over the past decade .

One would think such statistics would send a shiver down the spine of even the most hardened of businessmen .
But Westfield 's chairman Frank Lowy , who turned 78 yesterday , is no ordinary corporate suit .
According to Australian media reports , he boasts a fortune of £ 2.4bn , making him the richest man in Australia .
Born in Slovakia , he arrived in Australia in 1953 after spending a period shortly after the Second World War in a refugee camp in Cyprus .
After founding Westfield in 1959 with business partner John Saunders ( who died in 1997 aged 75 ) , Lowy has grown his company into the biggest publically listed retail property group in the world .
It is valued at more than £ 26bn , and leases 10 million square metres of retail space to 23,000 retailers in 119 centres around the world .
In the company 's homeland , as many people speak of " going to Westfield " as they do of " going shopping " .
But pulling off this audacious development is more than just a question of battling economic forces .
Local residents are far from pleased about the effects of bus routes imposed by Hammersmith and Fulham council to serve the new centre .
Writing in the London Evening Standard this week , the novelist Sebastian Faulks slammed the new routes planned for areas close to the development for running through some of the capital 's historic conservation areas .
He also described how the council 's consultation over the new routes was radically under - resourced , and how new buses will add unnecessary pollution and congestion to already busy and dirty streets .
In addition , the scheme – located just three miles from London 's West End – will draw customers away from already cash - strapped Oxford Street shops .
For years , Westfield London has been spoken of as the nail in the coffin of Oxford Street .
Meanwhile , tax authorities in Australia are investigating Lowy amid claims by the US Senate that he hid £ 42 m from the Australian Taxation Office .
But this is all in a day's work for a man who obtained a shrapnel scar on his forehead when fighting for the Israeli army .
Westfield London , experts say , will still manage to bring a smile to his lips .
Lowy was born into a Jewish family in 1930 in Fil'akovo , a rural town in what was then Czechoslovakia .
According to the official biography on the Westfield website , at an early age he helped his mother to run the family grocery shop .
When the Second World War broke out , his family sold their shop and fled to Budapest .
Here , Lowy helped his older brother , John , run a metalware business , but the family was soon hit by tragedy .
When the Nazis invaded Hungary in March 1944 , Lowy 's father was captured and sent to Auschwitz , where he eventually died .
Without the family 's main breadwinner , Lowy supported his mother by foraging for food .
When the war ended , Lowy left Europe for Israel .
On his way , he was picked up by the British Army and spent several months in a refugee camp in Cyprus .
After his release , he reached Israel , aged 17 , to join the nation 's Golani Brigade , an army unit fighting in the 1948 Arab - Israeli war .
When the war finished the same year , Lowy spent a brief time working in a bank , and studying to become an accountant at night school .
Eventually , he decided to go to Australia , to where many members of his family had already moved .
He arrived there on 26 January 1952 , carrying a small suitcase , and possessing only a basic knowledge of English .
" All those events shaped my life , " Lowy said in an interview earlier this month .
" It 's a requirement to have some sort of paranoia .
You have to think of what can go wrong even when times are good .
So you can never enjoy your success fully . "
In Sydney , the man who would become a property magnate managed to scrape together enough cash to buy a van .
He began work as a deliveryman , and it was then that he met Saunders , another Holocaust survivor , who had set up a small shop in the outskirts of Sydney .
The pair 's first business venture together was running a delicatessen .
They soon realised that along with salami and rye bread , newcomers from Europe needed a wider array of goods .
They borrowed from a local bank manager and used profits from the deli to buy farmland out of town .
The pair read about the popularity of American shopping malls , and in 1959 built their first shopping centre on that land .
Westfield Investments was listed on the Australian stock exchange in 1960 .
Over the next two decades , the pair built up their company to become one of the best - known shopping centre providers in Australia , where Lowy now owns 44 malls .

In 1977 , the company bought its first US shopping centre , in Connecticut , but it was not until 2000 that the company gained its first foothold in the UK market .
In March of that year it bought the Broadmarsh centre in Nottingham , in partnership with the investment house Hermes .
The same year it also acquired shopping centres in Tunbridge Wells , Guildford , Derby and Northern Ireland .
Now , Lowy runs his worldwide empire – across Australia , New Zealand , the United States and Britain – with his two sons , group managing directors Steven and Peter .
Frank Lowy is based on the top floor of the 24 - storey Westfield Towers in Sydney , which his company built in 1974 .
The company founder 's own floor has uninterrupted views of Sydney 's Opera House and Harbour Bridge , near to which Lowy 's 74 - metre yacht , named Ilona IV after his mother , is berthed .
It was here that the Australian executive worked on his plan to enter the UK market – a plan that took his three decades to perfect .
The company developed its first UK shopping centre , after demolishing an existing mall in Derby .
The £ 340 m Westfield Derby project opened in October of last year .
It was the biggest shopping centre to open in Britain that year .
Now , Westfield hopes its west London development – located in an area known as White City – will move shopping centre development in the UK to the " next level " .
" All our projects are about evolution , " says Westfield UK and Europe managing director Michael Gutman .
" In the White City project we are trying to bring together all the knowledge we have gathered from our 118 centres in four countries around the world .
This will be our 119th .
It is a unique trading area and demographic in terms of the power and disposable income of the people who live nearby .
It is unparalleled in terms of connectivity .
It contains some phenomenal public spaces both inside and out . "
The story of how Westfield created Westfield London goes back four years .
It involves a complicated series of acquisitions and joint ventures , but essentially involved Westfield taking control of an existing scheme being developed by fellow property firm Chelsfield in 2004 .
Westfield bought out its partners in that acquisition , the Reuben brothers , billionaire private investors , and Multiplex , the Australian construction firm .
In 2006 Westfield also took control of the project 's construction from the Australian construction firm Multiplex , which at the time was dealing with negative press surrounding the late delivery of Wembley Stadium , which it was also contracted to build .
Westfield currently owns a half stake in Westfield London , with the other half being owned by the property arm of the German financier Commerzbank .
Before Westfield 's acquisition of the development , the acclaimed British architect Ian Ritchie had designed a concept for the shopping centre .
He had suggested a number of features , which included the interior of the centre being covered by a fabric roof .
When Westfield took control , it decided not to continue its relationship with Ritchie and brought its own in - house designers on board , who collaborated with out - of - house architects on specific elements of the scheme .
These external designers included a young firm of London architects , Softroom , who designed a futuristic - looking café court called " The Balcony " .
Acclaimed New York designer Michael Gabellini took charge of blueprints for " The Village " – the separate area of the centre where the luxury brands such as Tiffany & Co are housed .
Westfield 's own architects scrapped the fabric roof in favour of a glass version that would allow more light to enter the centre 's interior .
They also introduced a street of bars and restaurants that will be open around the clock – the " Southern Terrace " – at the centre 's south - east corner , at the suggestion of superstar architect Richard Rogers , who at that point was acting as an adviser to former London mayor Ken Livingstone .
Rogers felt the street would improve the area 's public space .
" Normally we design all of our own buildings .
But when we acquired the property , its design had already won planning permission from the council and it was under construction , " says Gutman .
" On a major retail development , the planning and circulation requires knowledge and experience .
So we needed to bring on board some specialists , which we got through Softroom and Michael Gabellini . "
On a private tour with the developer late last week , two weeks before the completion of construction , things appeared to be in impressive shape .
Approaching Westfield London from the south - east , where a new bus terminal and specially designed , sleek - looking Shepherd 's Bush Tube station sit , shoppers ascend the shallow granite ramp or " shopping street " of " Southern Terrace " .
This street is already lined with finished restaurants , outside which diners will sit on terraces overlooking the thoroughfare .
The façades of the restaurant are of various sizes and designs to give each its own character .
Overhead , various canopies , each again of unique size and material , offer protection from the elements .
The red Westfield logo is affixed at key points to the street 's façade .
Entering through a huge glass entrance , customers encounter a massive central space .
Above this , one gets a look at the distinctive , undulating glass roof , through which daylight streams to cast triangular patterns on perfectly white walls .
This central space contains a large central " well " surrounded by the centre 's three floors .
On the uppermost of these , a 14 - screen cinema , due to open next autumn , will allow film - goers to take a beer , wine or cocktail to the newest film releases as well as to reserve special " VIP " areas .
On the floor beneath this , the clothing store Timberland has turned the front of its shop into what appears to be a large wooden box , in line with the company 's " rugged and outdoor " branding .
A short distance away , Apple has finished its unit with typical white minimalism .
To one side , Softroom 's " Balcony " stretches for some 50 metres .
Its futuristic , capsule - like appearance is contained within a façade that appears to be divided into a series of wooden slats .
Here , an array of dedicated restaurants such Crocque Gascon – who will serve modern French cuisine like " duck burger classique " – and Vietnamese street food restaurant Pho , will serve to customers who will then sit at a shared seating area .
On the lowest floor , DKNY and Russell & Bromley have leased units .
Gabellini's " Village " lies to the north - east of this central space .
Here , the ceiling is shaped into soft ovals of plastic from which chandeliers hang .
Such features seem to have gone down well with retailers .
At the time of opening , Westfield says the centre will be more than 96 per cent leased .
Around 90 per cent of the tenants locked into 10 to 15 - year contracts before the full extent of the current economic crisis was known .
Unless the shops go out of business , Westfield will get their money .
It may sound worrying for the retailers concerned , but signing on Lowy 's dotted line may well prove to suit them as much as Westfield .
It 's impossible to know the details of each deal , but industry experts believe that they may not have to part with any cash for the first year or two .
So they can take their places in this glittering cathedral to the future of shopping , and pay for it when ( they hope ) the economy , and consumer confidence , is in an altogether better place .
And many believe that Lowy will prosper despite the current economic gloom .
" Rather than being troubled by the financial crisis , Westfield has almost landed on its feet , " says Retail Week editor Tim Danaher .
" In fact , far from being unenthusiastic about the development , retailers do n't want to be left out .
While the details of the deals they have struck are mired in secrecy , Westfield , like all developers of new shopping centres , will have made concessions – such as rent - free periods and contributions to the shops ' fit-outs , which have helped to persuade people to come on board .
While some of the smaller retailers might go bust , the big guys wo n't come unstuck .
Westfield has got the stomach to cope . "
It has not all been plain sailing for Lowy and his empire , however .
The business news agency Bloomberg reports that the billionaire is embroiled in a bout with tax authorities .
The Australian Taxation Office is investigating claims that he hid £ 42 m from tax officials .
A US Senate panel had alleged in July that the Lowy family and LGT Group , a bank owned by Liechtenstein 's royal family , had used a foundation and companies registered in Delaware and the British Virgin Islands to conceal the fact that the Lowys owned the money in question .
This is something Frank Lowy has vehemently denied .
On a more local level , the White City scheme has encountered a degree of opposition .
Nigel Kersey , director of the London branch of the Campaign to Protect Rural England , tried unsuccessfully to take the local council to court in 2000 for failing to ask for an environmental damage assessment over the initial Chelsfield scheme .
" Had the planning authority played by the rules , it would have shown that the impact would be substantial , " he said at the time .
Since then , Westfield says it has conducted broad consultations and that local groups now welcome the project .
Indeed , the company is so confident that it is pressing on with plans to build a £ 1.45 bn , 175,000sq m centre in Stratford , east London , to be completed in time for the 2012 Olympics .
" The current slowdown is only likely to be relatively short - term compared with the planning process and the active life of a shopping centre , " says Richard Dodd , a spokesperson for the British Retail Consortium , which represents British shopping centres .
" Now , when retailers are competing more fiercely for customers ' every pound , investing in your premises can be a good thing to do .
Shopping centres offer great access and investment in retail . "
Certainly , Michael Gutman feels the company has done enough to make sure that it is not hit by any forthcoming economic crash .
" Most definitely we are in this for the long haul , " he concludes .
" We have a history of being long - term owners .
We are beginning our relationship with Londoners and we hope to be embraced as a new icon on the landscape , like Covent Garden or the O2 .
" We have opened projects in recessions before and in booms before .
These buildings are built for long - term and they take several years to settle .
The retailers who have taken stores are our customers and we are in a partnership with them to maximise their performance .
The ability to effectively come in the morning to do grocery shopping and have a coffee and maybe go to the gym and go back home as well as doing fashion shopping surpasses anything you currently see in the high street . "
In an interview last month , Frank Lowy , Gutman 's ultimate boss , divulged that a few times a month , he plays poker .
The billionaire says he gambles for stakes high enough to be painful if he does n't win .
" It has to hurt you a little bit when you lose , " he said , declining to say how much someone with his finances might actually bet .
" And I do n't like to lose , period . "
This time , with the ante at £ 1.7bn , you can bet that losing would cause Lowy considerable pain .
The animals were discovered by London - based designer , Paul Middlewick in 1988 .
They ’re created using only the lines , stations and junctions of underground railway maps .
Paul first spotted the elephant while he was staring at the world famous London Underground map during his daily journey home from work .
The more he looked , the more animals he found and the elephant was quickly joined by many other cute animals including a bat , a cat , a polar bear , several dogs and even a bottlenose whale .
The original animals have now been joined by their international friends from metro and transit maps from cities around the world including the Paris Metro , Moscow Metro and the New York Subway .

Smile When You Say These – And Reach For The “ Dotted Line ”
“ This will shorten your cleaning time by hours . ”
“ You have only one back – one life to live . ”
“ If men did the cleaning , we could n’t make these cleaners fast enough . ”
When Nellie Says , “ I ’ll Think It Over , ” . . .
Wag These Words At Her :
“ Think also of the DIRT that is ruining your rugs . ”
“ Think also of the MANY BACKACHES still in store for you . ”
When Nellie Says , “ I ’ll Buy Later , ” Telegraph These Messages :
“ Would you continue to use a toaster which did n’t work ? ”
“ Would you use a washing machine which left clothing dirty ? ”
“ What will you SAVE yourself by buying later – not your rugs or back – just two dimes a day ! ”
Summary Of Wheelerpoint 5
Have the “ voice with the smile ” – however the smile which has n’t the insincerity of being automatically “ turned on ” for the immediate benefit of the prospect .
Do n’t ever smile insincerely , like the wolf at Red Riding Hood ’s door !
If you fail to smile , if you stick your chin out , or if you look grim , down and out , tired , bewildered , scared , or overly confident , you are SIGNALING to your prospect to BEWARE !
The last principle , therefore , to make your sales talk “ stick ” is to watch HOW you say it .
So apply Wheelerpoint 5 , “ Watch Your Bark , ” and then watch your sales go merrily down the road to SUCCESS !
Dedicated to kicking your ass until you succeed .

Despite Overnight Detention in County Jail for ' Disorderly Conduct ' , as Orchestrated by Broward 's Election Chief , a Candidate for That Same Office , Ellen Brodsky , Remains Uncharged a Month Later and Still Seeking Discovery Documents ...
Counter Charges for ' False Arrest ' Still to Come ...
Brad Friedman Byon
12/17/2008 , 1:11 pm PT
It 's been more than a full month since the November 13th arrest of Broward County , FL 's election integrity advocate Ellen Brodsky and the state has still failed to file formal charges or supply her with discovery documents .
As The BRAD BLOG reported in detail following the arrest , Brodsky was taken into custody , seemingly at the behest of her opponent in the election , after attempting to oversee the public counting of ballots for the election in which she ran as a candidate for Supervisor of Elections .
The arrest for " disorderly conduct " ( according to police records ) was caught on tape and posted here last week .
The tape shows fairly clearly that there was no such disorderly conduct by Brodsky , despite the order for the arrest having apparently been issued by the office of the current Broward Supervisor of Elections , Dr. Brenda Snipes .
Today 's South Florida Sun-Sentinel picks up the story with an update noting that Brodsky , a month since her arrest , has been forced to seek a judge 's order demanding that prosecutors explain why she was arrested in the first place .
The BRAD BLOG has also obtained a copy of a motion to compel discovery exhibits , which have similarly not been given to her , as filed by Brodksy 's attorney earlier this month .
According to the Sun-Sentinel :
...
The case is open but no charges have been filed , State Attorney 's Office spokesman Ron Ishoy said Tuesday .
...
Her lawyer , Tanner Andrews , denies wrongdoing .
He wants to know what exactly his client is accused of doing and who made the accusation on Nov. 13 .
Ellen Brodsky has asked a judge to order prosecutors to explain why she was arrested at the election office warehouse ....
The case is open but no charges have been filed , State Attorney 's Office spokesman Ron Ishoy said Tuesday ....
Her lawyer , Tanner Andrews , denies wrongdoing .
He wants to know what exactly his client is accused of doing and who made the accusation on Nov. 13 .
" Why they arrested her would be a really good start , " he said .
The short Sun-Sentinel piece also gets a key point of the story absolutely wrong , noting that Brodsky was " taken into police custody and jailed overnight until she could make bail . "
In fact , her bail --- a grand total of $ 25 --- was posted for Brodsky by her son at 8:30 pm on the night she was arrested , yet she was not released until 5:45 am the next morning , according to a summary of the arrest reviewed by The BRAD BLOG .
And while Brodsky waits for charges to be filed , her attorney Tanner Andrews , was forced to file a motion with the court to compel discovery in the case earlier this month .
No such discovery has yet been given to the plaintiffs .
The brief motion to compel , filed by Andrews on December 9th , can be downloaded here [ PDF ] .
The motion is also accompanied by a December 4th letter from Andrews to Joshua Widlansky , counsel for the State of Florida , asking --- a full two weeks ago --- why his client had yet to be served with the state 's discovery exhibit , given her arrest more than three weeks before that , on November 13th .
" It may surprise you that I have not yet received your discovery exhibit , " writes Andrews in the letter to Widlansky .
" If , for some reason , you do not intend to furnish the exhibit , please let me know promptly .
If there is a good reason for the failure to comply , then I would prefer to avoid making a motion to compel and using up the court 's time . "
By the time of the filing of the motion to compel on December 9th , the state had " neither responded to discovery request nor objected " , nor had they returned a phone call left with his office , according to Andrews .
Today Brodsky told us via email that she 's unable to move forward with her own charges against Snipes and the county until she is able to learn the official case against her .
" Until we get a determination by the State Attorney to the merits of the charges against me , " she said , " we cannot proceed with a countersuit for false arrest , which we will most certainly do . "
Her attorney Andrews added , via email later this afternoon , that he also anticipates " civil remedies in tort and otherwise following the successful conclusion of the criminal matter . "
" A good citizen , such as my client , cannot sit idly by and permit government misconduct such as we have seen here , " he wrote .
" If citizens permit such things , then the citizens effectively condone the misconduct which will become tomorrow 's obnoxious custom .
If my client permits this abuse today , what becomes of the less prominent citizen tomorrow ? "
Our original coverage of the arrest , on the afternoon that Brodsky was released , and noting outrage from colleagues and election officials alike , is posted here .
The video tape of the arrest outside of Broward County 's election headquarters , following a call to authorities from Snipes ' deputy Fred Bellis , as also seen on the tape , is reposted below ...
UPDATE 3/11/09 : All charges are dropped against Brodsky .
Details now here ...
- By Jake T. Snake
I have had a ringside seat to the economic downturn this year .
It is not an abstraction to me .
The folks at the bottom are always the first to feel the pinch , when it comes .
Clients of the agency I work at come through our doors every day requesting assistance with basic necessities like food , clothing , shelter and medications .
As the year has progressed and New York State has chosen to repeatedly victimize its most vulnerable citizens , it has become more difficult to help people meet these needs .
I have visited food banks with empty shelves , been told clients were ineligible for help when I knew they were and had to challenge these decisions .
I have sat with clients while their applications for public assistance were reviewed by fraud investigators at social services .
Our local social services department actually hired fraud investigators at the same time that it was laying off child protective workers demonstrating conclusively where our values lie and how genuinely mean spirited we are as a people .
At the federal level Social Security routinely denies people eligible for benefits in the hopes that they will not reapply .
Many people who receive benefits must hire a lawyer before social security will concede that they are indeed eligible .
As the resources have become more limited , the level of scrutiny and inhumanity has risen accordingly .
I have , of course read about the rising unemployment numbers and the ensuing uptick in applicants for public assistance and food stamps nationwide like everyone else .
It seems the chickens of Bill Clinton 's ( Best moderate Republican president ever ) welfare reform are finally coming home to roost .
We always knew that the flaw of his plan was an economy without jobs and here we are .
The reform has no provision for an unemployment rate like we are experiencing now .
Once again , our policy in practice serves to punish most harshly children and the elderly .
Perhaps , it is time to repeal the child labor laws and begin allowing them to work 12 hour days again .
For nearly 30 years we have done our best to dismantle the safety net for the poor and struggling among us .
I keep praying that we have reached the end of this folly .
At 42 , these policies are what I have known my entire work life .
I dream about social service programs and rules that would treat people like human beings , rather than as an undesirable applicant to be culled out .
I want so badly for us as a nation to stop punishing people for being poor , or elderly or a child of poor people .
This holiday season was hellish as I watched scores of our clients navigate the realities of a holiday with nothing but further grinding poverty .
Some days I am just weary from the strain of witnessing the suffering that goes on around me .
It takes a toll that is more than physical , it eats away at the soul to see people ask for so little and receive far less .
As I contemplate how to pry a few dollars from these systems designed to humiliate and degrade my clients , already struggling with being social outcasts , chronic illness , drug addiction and mental illness I sigh audibly .
I read of billion dollar bailouts and disappearing pallettes of cash as I ponder how to help a family with $ 400.00 so they will not be homeless in three days .
I am so very tired .
Asthma Inhalers Scheduled to Go Green , Become More Expensive
December 1st , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Come December 31 , all albuterol inhalers in the U.S. will be a little bit greener — and a lot more expensive .
The inhalers will stop using chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) that damage the ozone layer , and will be powered by hydroflueroalkane ( HFC ) instead .
While the new inhalers will benefit the environment , they will also cost $ 30 to $ 60 .
CFC inhalers cost only $ 5 to $ 10 .
The HFC inhalers will be strange to albuterol veterans — the medicine tastes and feels different , and the inhaler ’s hole needs to be cleaned weekly to prevent clogging .
For asthma sufferers that are averse to change , non-prescription epinephrine inhalers will contain CFCs until the government cracks down in December 2011 .
But replacing albuterol with epinephrine is dangerous , as the non-prescription drug is less effective .
The change may not be palatable to everyone , but asthmatics should take comfort in the fact that their medicine is no longer destroying the ozone layer .

1 . Let ’s call i-thread the thread that first enter the synchronized block .
This thread will eventually change the value of bInited variable , even if initially only in its local memory 2 . Though compiler has ability to transform getInstance ( ) code , and then runtime has ability change the execution order of operations , no such optimization is allowed to break the minimum ITS for the i-thread executed in isolation 3 .
The result of the call hash = instance .
hashCode ( ) is unpredictable before the constructing of the instance object .
NOTE 1 : According to the java API , the default hashCode ( ) is typically implemented by converting the internal address of the object into an integer .
But if that is not good enough for unpredictability , we can consider implementing hashCode ( ) for Singleton as Random rand = new Random ( Date.getTime ( ) ) ; int hash = rand.nextInt ( ) ; and then let compiler or runtime try to predict inside or before the constructor the value of Date.getTime ( ) placed in the original code order after the constructor !
4 . The call bInited = oracle ( hash ) uses the results of the call instance .
hashCode ( ) and unpredictable , as we assumed 5 .
Therefore the compiler or runtime optimization can’t assign the value ( true ) of the bInited variable before the complete constructing the Singleton object and assigning to the instance variable in the local memory of the i-thread 6 .
After the i–thread exits the synchronized block and before any other thread enter that block , the values of the instance and bInited variables in the main memory will be set to the value from i-thread local memory .
Both set operations are atomic .
7 . Now consider the behavior of any other thread , let ’s call it a w - thread , in minimum ITS semantics .
That means , we can assume the order of executions for the w - thread as it specified in the Singleton code , but the shared variables can have “ unexpected ” values .
That is what we will look at now .
Let ’s use the following notations : M( bInited ) is the copy of the bInited variable in the main memory
is the copy of the variable in the main memory I ( b Inited ) is the copy of the bInited variable in the local i-thread memory
is the copy of the variable in the local i-thread memory W( bInited ) is the copy of the bInited variable in the local w - thread memory M( instance ) is the copy of the instance variable in the main memory
is the copy of the variable in the main memory I ( instance ) is the copy of the instance variable in the local i-thread memory
is the copy of the variable in the local i-thread memory W( instance ) is the copy of the instance variable in the local w - thread memory 8 .
Let ’s consider in turn following interesting cases for w - thread .
8.a .
The w - thread waits on the synchronized block for i-thread to leave the block – piece of cake .
First i-thread leaves the synchronized block , then java synchronizes i-thread local variables to the main memory , I ( b Inited ) => M( bInited ) I ( instance ) => M( instance ) then on w - thread entry to the synchronized block java synchronizes the w - thread local variables from the main memory , M( bInited ) => W( bInited ) M( instance ) => W( instance ) and now the w - thread has a correct view of shared variables , same view as the i-thread has .
8.b. The w - thread is inside or before the FIRST CHECK operation when i-thread leaves the synchronized block .
Note , that W( bInited ) and W ( instance ) are initialized from the main memory ether before or after the I( b Inited ) and I ( instance ) were synchronized to M( bInited ) and M( instance ) , which happens after t- thread left the synchronized block .
So each of W( bInited ) and W ( instance ) can only have either initial value ( as defined in the class Singleton ) or the value produced by the i-thread , in any possible combination .
Then w - thread first checks the value of the variable W( bInited ) .
It value is false w - thread jumps to the synchronized block , essentially as in the case 7.a .
If W( bInited ) ==true , then i-thread already has assigned I ( bInited ) =true and java already synchronized along the chain I ( b Inited ) => M( bInited ) => W( bInited )
Therefore the i-thread already has initialized the Singleton object and at the very least the I ( instance ) is references that object .
Now next the w - thread checks the value of the W ( instance ) variable .
If W( instance ) ==null then java not yet synchronizes along the chain I ( instance ) => M( instance ) => W( instance ) but no worry , w - thread than only jumps on the entry of the synchronized block and discover the new value of the instance variable there , as in the 7.a case .
But if W ( instance ) =!null , then the only value that the W ( instance ) can only have is the value of the I ( instance ) .
Therefore the w - thread will return the fully constructed instance of the Singleton .
9 . So for any thread which obtains the instance variable through the getInstance ( ) method it is guaranteed that the Singleton object has already been created and fully initialized by i-thread .

It must be the worst nightmare of every CIA director — the agency ignores its own rules and regulations and kills innocent Americans , and then the people in charge of the operation lie to Congress and cover up what happened .
The nightmare has apparently come to life and it became public today when Rep. Pete Hoekstra ( R - Mich . ) announced that a report by the CIA ’s own inspector general found that agency officers apparently ignored standing rules and regulations governing when they could shoot at aircraft in the drug war in Latin America .
The lapses led to the death of at least 10 innocent civilians , Hoekstra said , including two Americans , Veronica “ Roni ” Bowers and her daughter , Charity , in April 2001 .
They were missionaries in Peru heading home when the CIA ordered a Peruvian Air Force jet to shoot down their plane .
The shoot down was part of a joint U.S. - Peruvian anti-drug program that began in the mid-1990s .
CIA officers worked with Peruvian pilots to spot planes believed to be carrying illegal drugs .
“ It is a blot , a dark stain , a sad day for CIA , ” Hoekstra told reporters this morning .
“ The CIA knew about repeated serious issues with this program , but took no corrective actions , which could have prevented this needless tragedy .
Making matters worse , the inspector general found continuous efforts to cover the matter up and potentially block criminal investigation . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
While Hoekstra has taken a keen interest in the case from the beginning , since both victims were from Michigan , he clearly sees the case as having much wider significance than a single tragic event .
“ This issue goes to the heart of the American people ’s ability to trust the CIA , ” said Hoekstra , the senior Republican on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence .
“ Americans deserve to know that agencies given the power to operate on their behalf are n’t abusing that power or their trust . ”
Hoekstra based his harsh criticisms on findings in a voluminous and classified report by the agency ’s inspector general : “ Procedures Used in the Narcotics Airbridge Denial Program in Peru , 1995 - 2001 . ”
The report was completed late this summer and Hoekstra ’s committee received its copy around the time that Congress recessed for the elections , the first week of October , he said .
In an Oct. 6 letter to CIA Director Mike Hayden , Hoekstra cited “ repeated failures to follow procedures that resulted in loss of life ; false or misleading statements to Congress by CIA officials , up to and including former Director George Tenet ; and potential obstruction of justice by CIA officials with respect to a Department of Justice criminal investigation . ”
A former senior CIA officer familiar with the anti-drug program was skeptical of Hoekstra ’s conclusions .
“ The Airbridge Denial Program was ruthlessly successful for years , stopping Peruvian cocaine base from the Upper Huallaga Valley up into Colombia from being refined .
When the two Americans were shot down in their private plane , my understanding was it was a clear error , committed by the Peruvian pilots .
They did not follow all the procedures , ” the retired official said .
“ To say the agency was ‘ responsible ’ is a stretch .
The procedures were written by us and overseen by us , so I guess to that extent the agency was responsible . ”
Hoekstra told reporters he will press for extended hearings by the intelligence committee , headed by Rep. Silvestre Reyes ( D - Texas ) .
The Republican lawmaker also wants the Justice Department to take a close look at whether it needs to reopen the criminal investigation into the case .
No one was charged as a result of an earlier investigation and Hoekstra made it clear he thinks the Justice Department may not have had access to all the relevant facts when it first investigated the case .
I asked Hoekstra if he believed there are still fundamental problems with the CIA ’s culture today and if he believed the Director of National Intelligence — which did not exist at the time of the shootdown — had made improvements to CIA and the intelligence community ’s culture .
“ I think the DNI is doing everything he can to strengthen his relationship with Congress , ” he said .
In addition to his press conference , Hoekstra wrote a letter today to the CIA Inspector General , John Helgerson , asking him to declassify as much of his report as possible .
In a clear shot across the CIA ’s bow , Hoekstra reminded Helgerson that information must not be classified to “ conceal violations of law , inefficiency , or administrative error ” or to “ prevent embarrassment to a person , organization or agency … ”
Hoekstra ended his letter to Hayden with a clear warning , and a promise : “ I will not let this matter rest . ”

( CNN ) --
The FBI on Monday arrested the mayor of Birmingham , Alabama , on federal charges including conspiracy , bribery , fraud , money laundering and filing false income tax returns .
Mayor Larry Langford , right , appears at a news conference Monday in Birmingham , Alabama .
Larry Langford , 62 , is named in an indictment that alleges criminal activity while he was a county commissioner , said U.S. Attorney Alice Martin .
As president of the Jefferson County Commission and head of its department of finance and general services from November 2002 until about November 2006 , Langford put his personal affairs ahead of those of the county , Martin said .
" Our investigation has revealed , and the indictment alleges , that Langford sold his public office to his friends and political supporters , " Martin said .
Also named in the 101 - count indictment are William Blount , 55 , a Montgomery , Alabama , investment banker , and Albert LaPierre , 58 , a Birmingham lobbyist , neither of whom returned calls from CNN .
" Langford steered lucrative business to William Blount and his company and he , in turn , earned in excess of $ 7.1 million and , with the help of lobbyist Albert LaPierre , they ensured that Larry Langford 's crushing personal debts were paid off through payoffs of loans , store charge accounts , purchases of clothing and jewelry and other items of value that exceeded $ 230,000 over a period from 2002 to 2006 , " Martin said .
The allegations go back to a 1996 consent decree entered into by the commission to bring Jefferson County into compliance with the Clean Water Act , which required authorizing billions of dollars in transactions .
After making his first appearance in U.S. District Court on Monday , Langford appeared outside the courthouse with his lawyer , who said he had told his client not to talk to reporters .
" He 's got a city to run and right now , or very shortly , he 's headed back to City Hall , " the lawyer said .
An indictment on some counts was returned in June to ensure they were not rendered moot by a five - year statute of limitations , Martin said .
Do n't Miss WVTM : Birmingham mayor arrested
The superseding indictment returned last Tuesday by a federal grand jury was unsealed Monday after Langford 's arrest .
The other two men named in the indictment agreed to turn themselves in , she said .
Langford conspired with Blount and LaPierre " to solicit and to accept bribes , to use influence and position to ensure that Blount and his company , Blount Parrish Inc. , was involved in Jefferson County 's bonds and swap transactions related to multibillion - dollar sewer debt , " Martin said .
Though the financing was set up by then - big financial institutions -- including J.P. Morgan , Goldman Sachs , Lehman Brothers and Bank of America -- " Langford used his position to make it a condition that those financial institutions include Blount Parrish in the financing deals and paid Blount Parrish a fee in order to get the county financing business , " Martin said .
She cited an October 2003 financial transaction that included Bank of America and Lehman Special Financing Corp. that required Lehman to pay an " arrangement fee " of $ 35,000 to Blount 's company .
In all , she said , Blount and his company received $ 7.1 million in fees related to Jefferson County 's financial transactions .
In turn , Blount paid lobbyist LaPierre approximately $ 219,000 for " consulting fees , " Martin said .
She added , " Through a web of financing agreements , Langford required many institutions to use Blount as a consultant so Blount would make fees and in turn pay off Langford .
It was a classic pay - to - play scheme . "
Martin said Blount and Langford traveled together to New York , where Blount bought Langford clothing and jewelry from high - end stores that included Tourneau , Zegna , Ferragamo and Turnbull & Asser .
In addition , Blount bought Rolex watches and other jewelry for Langford from a Birmingham store , Martin said .
Federal authorities are seeking criminal forfeiture of about $ 7.6 million from each of the men .
Langford is named in 60 counts of the superseding indictment ; Blount in 43 counts ; and LaPierre in 22 counts .
In addition to the fines , each defendant would face a maximum of 10 years for each bribery and money - laundering count , 20 years for each fraud count , five years for the conspiracy count and three years for each tax count .
In a written statement , the mayor 's office said city business will continue as usual .
" We are glad the mayor will finally have his day in court , " said Langford 's chief of staff , Deborah Vance - Bowie .
" As members of his team , we stand behind him and look forward to the day when we can return the focus to the important issues before the city . "
A public information officer said the president of the current five - member Jefferson County Commission , Bettye Collins , would have no comment

Tara Reid Checks into Promises Treatment Center
" We appreciate your respect to her and her family 's privacy at this time .
Her friends and family are supportive of her decision .
She checked in herself - it was her decision . "
entered the Malibu Promises Treatment Center on Tuesday according to her rep .
He released the following statement :
The 33 year old told People magazine in an October interview that she had turned a corner from being a hard hitting drinker and was now a " social drinker " .
When asked about the temptation to fall back into old habits , she replied : " No , I 've done it .
Trust me .
I 've done enough for a lifetime of everything .
I 've had a great time .
I partied .
I had fun .
I ate and drank whatever .
I dated a million guys , but I 'm so happy with where I 'm at right now .
I do n't need to do anything anymore . "
No word on what Reid is being treated for or the length of her stay .
Typically the minimum stay is 28 days , which would mean that the American Pie actress would be in treatment through the holiday 's , often a difficult time for those who are challenged by addiction issues .
We applaud her decision and wish her well .

Does this NASA photo from the rover Opportunity show a wooden log on Mars ?
Hard to tell ?
Then look at the zoomed - in image , and ask again : is this a log ( petrified or otherwise ) on the surface of the Red Planet ?
Duh .
No .
But if you read some websites , you might think it is .
So what 's going on here ?
The quick answer is : this is another in a long line of examples of pareidolia ; people seeing familiar things in random or semi-random patterns .
In other words , this looks like a log , but it ai n't .
Remember the Martian Bigfoot ?
Yeah , this is the same kind of thing .
How do I know ?
Well , lots of reasons .
For one thing , this photo is from 2005 .
Had any scientist studying Mars seen this and thought it was actually wood , I think they would have said something by now .
Second , there 's no evidence at all of any macroscopic plant life on Mars .
The vista shown here is a vast range of desert .
What are the odds there would be a log smack dab in the way of the the rover as it moves across Mars ?
Note too that the tracks go right over the object ; Opportunity literally ran it over .
That means lots of people in the control room on Earth saw this object , yet no one said anything about it being a log .
And if you think they 're covering it up ,
then why did they publish the image in a press release ?
Third , look to the right of the " log " .
There are two rocks that look a lot like it :
That image is slightly different from the one I displayed above , with better contrast .
See how the rocks are the same color as the " log " ?
And look at the patterns on the rocks ; they 're the same too .
The linear patterns even line up with those of the longer object !
This indicates we 're looking at a rock here .
And finally , fourth : I mean , c'mon .
A log ?
On Mars ?
Sheesh .
Clearly what we 're seeing here is another rock , probably different than the flat rocks that are paler , but very similar to the darker ones .
It looks like a petrified log , but then we know that many things look like other things .
Wasp nests look like Buddha ( or the StayPuft Marshmallow Man ) , and rocks look like Bigfoot ( which is like a case of meta - nonsense , given we 're talking Bigfoot ) .
It 's certainly an interesting object , since it 's long , and all the other rocks are not .
I imagine that geologically there 's some story behind it .
But I really really do n't think it involves wood .
But that wo n't stop the goofballs out there , breathlessly playing this silliness up .
One site said this photo was leaked .
Yeah , leaked , as a frackin ' press release on the NASA site !
Cripes .
Another site goes on about how maybe it's a log and maybe it's not , but who can trust NASA ?
After all , it 's so easy to fake pictures .
But they do n't make the logical connection that if NASA faked the image , then ( again ) why did they publish it in a press release but make no mention of the object itself ?
It 's frustrating that unthinking nonsense like this gets spread so quickly through the web .
It 's the Ebola of science , and far too may people are far too willing to pass the virus on .
It relies heavily on people not understanding science ( and skepticism ) all that well , and them also not understanding that seeing is not necessarily believing .
So if you see something like this , think about it before sending it on to the next victim .
Does the claim really make sense ?
Is it supported by the data you have , and is there evidence against it ?
And you can always look to my blog here for more , or to other places like the BAUT forum , where lots of smart and knowledgeable people look into claims just like this one .
It 's amazing how much bad thinking is out there in cyberspace .
But do n't worry .
Its bark is a lot worse than its byte .
Founded in 1982 and at times so rich with ads its issues reached as many as 600 pages , Ziff Davis 's PC Magazine will issue its last print edition this January , thereafter becoming an online - only publication .
Ziff Davis , which recently exited bankruptcy will lay off seven print production employees .
Gadget and PC shoppers stay online now , preferring sites such as AOL's Engadget , Gawker Media 's Gizmodo or CNET to print .
Ziff Davis will follow that model and PC Magazine will become PCMag , part of a network of sites called the PCMag Digital Network .
The Network will also include ExtremeTech , Gearlog , Appscout , Smart Device Central , GoodCleanTech , DL.TV , Cranky Geeks , and PCMagCast .
Ziff Davis CEO Jason
Young shared some numbers with PaidContent 's Rafat Ali :
PCMag revenues are " in the tens and tens of millions of dollars "
Online reveneues grew an average of 42 % since 2001 .
Digital already accounts for 70 % of the PC Mag brand 's revenues .
The network is profitable .
PCMag brand revenues grew 18 % in Q3 .

As it happens Mayan motives were popular in Soviet times in Russia .
The only vendor for playing cards ( as for many other stuff in Soviet Russia ) was the Soviet State , so there were only a few type of the cards – just maybe ten at most , not hundreds or thousands as in free market societies , and one of the types of the playing cards were devoted to the Mayan culture for some reason .

When people think about web scraping in Python , they usually think BeautifulSoup .
That ’s okay , but I would encourage you to also consider lxml .
First , people think BeautifulSoup is better at parsing broken HTML .
This is not correct .
lxml parses broken HTML quite nicely .
I have n’t done any thorough testing , but at least the BeautifulSoup broken HTML example is parsed better by lxml ( which knows that < td > elements should go inside < table > elements ) .
Second , people feel lxml is harder to install .
This is correct .
BUT , lxml 2.2 alpha1 includes an option to compile static versions of the underlying C libraries , which should improve the installation experience , especially on Macs .
To install this new way , try :
$ STATIC_DEPS = true easy_install ' lxml>=2.2alpha1 '
One you have lxml installed , you have a great parser ( which happens to be super - fast and that is not a tradeoff ) .
You get a fairly familiar API based on ElementTree , which though a little strange feeling at first , offers a compact and canonical representation of a document tree , compared to more traditional representations .
But there ’s more …
One of the features that should be appealing to many people doing screen scraping is that you get CSS selectors .
You can use XPath as well , but usually that ’s more complicated ( for example ) .
Here ’s an example I found getting links from a menu in a page in BeautifulSoup :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup import urllib2 soup = BeautifulSoup ( urllib2 .
urlopen ( ' http://java.sun.com' ) . read ( ) ) menu = soup .
findAll ( ' div ' , attrs = { ' class ' : ' pad ' } ) for subMenu in menu : links = subMenu .
findAll ( ' a ' ) for link in links : print " %s : %s " % ( link .
string , link [ ' href ' ])
Here ’s the same example in lxml :
from lxml.html import parse doc = parse ( ' http://java.sun.com' ) . getroot ( ) for link in doc .
cssselect ( ' div.pad a ' ) : print ' %s : %s ' % ( link . text_content ( ) , link .
get ( ' href ' ) )
lxml generally knows more about HTML than BeautifulSoup .
Also I think it does well with the small details ; for instance , the lxml example will match elements in < div class= " pad menu " > ( space - separated classes ) , which the BeautifulSoup example does not do ( obviously there are other ways to search , but the obvious and documented technique does n’t pay attention to HTML semantics ) .
One feature that I think is really useful is .make_links_absolute ( ) .
This takes the base URL of the page ( doc.base ) and uses it to make all the links absolute .
This makes it possible to relocate snippets of HTML or whole sets of documents ( as with this program ) .
This is n’t just < a href > links , but stylesheets , inline CSS with @import statements , background attributes , etc .
It does n’t see quite all links ( for instance , links in Javascript ) but it sees most of them , and works well for most sites .
So if you want to make a local copy of a site :
from lxml.html import parse , open_in_browser doc = parse ( ' http://wiki.python.org/moin/' ) . getroot ( ) doc . make_links_absolute ( ) open_in_browser ( doc )
open_in_browser serializes the document to a temporary file and then opens a web browser ( using webbrowser ) .
Here ’s an example that compares two pages using lxml.html.diff :
from lxml.html.diff import htmldiff from lxml.html import parse , tostring , open_in_browser , fromstring def get_page ( url ) : doc = parse ( url ) . getroot ( ) doc . make_links_absolute ( ) return tostring ( doc ) def compare_pages ( url1 , url2 , selector = ' body div ' ) : basis = parse ( url1 ) . getroot ( ) basis . make_links_absolute ( ) other = parse ( url2 ) . getroot ( ) other .
make_links_absolute ( ) el1 = basis .
cssselect ( selector ) [ 0 ] el2 = other .
cssselect ( selector ) [ 0 ] diff_content = htmldiff ( tostring ( el1 ) , tostring ( el2 ) ) diff_el = fromstring ( diff_content ) el1 . getparent ( ) . insert ( el1 . getparent ( ) . index ( el1 ) , diff_el ) el1 . getparent ( ) . remove ( el1 ) return basis if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : import sys doc = compare_pages ( sys . argv [ 1 ] , sys . argv [ 2 ] , sys . argv [ 3 ] ) open_in_browser ( doc )
You can use it like :
$ python lxmldiff.py \ ' http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide?action=recall&rev=70' \ ' http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide?action=recall&rev=81' \ ' div#content '
Another feature lxml has is form handling .
All the cool sexy new sites use minimal forms , but searching for “ registration forms ” I get this nice complex form .
Let ’s look at it :
>>> from lxml.html import parse , tostring >>> doc = parse ( ' http://www.actuaryjobs.com/cform.html' ) . getroot ( ) >>> doc . forms [ < Element form at - 48232164 > ] >>> form = doc .
forms [ 0 ] >>> form .
inputs . keys ( ) [ ' thank_you_title ' , ' City ' , ' Zip ' , ... ]
Now we have a form object .
There ’s two ways to get to the fields : form.inputs , which gives us a dictionary of all the actual < input > elements ( and textarea and select ) .
There ’s also form.
fields , which is a dictionary - like object .
The dictionary - like object is convenient , for instance :
>>> form .
fields [ ' cEmail ' ] = 'me@example.com '
This actually updates the input element itself :
>>> tostring ( form . inputs [ ' cEmail ' ] ) ' < input type =" input " name = " cEmail " size = " 30 " value = " test2 " >'
I think it ’s actually a nicer API than htmlfill and can serve the same purpose on the server side .
But then you can also use the same interface for scraping , by filling fields and getting the submission .
That looks like :
>>> import urllib >>> action = form .
action >>> data = urllib .
urlencode ( form . form_values ( ) ) >>> if form .
method == ' GET ' : ... if '? ' in action : ... action += ' &' + data ... else : ... action += '?' + data ... data = None >>> resp = urllib .
urlopen ( action , data ) >>> resp_doc = parse ( resp ) . getroot ()
Lastly , there ’s HTML cleaning .
I think all these features work together well , do useful things , and it ’s based on an actual understanding HTML instead of just treating tags and attributes as arbitrary .
( Also if you really like jQuery , you might want to look at pyquery , which is a jQuery - like API on top of lxml ) .
Apple 's new MacBook and MacBook Pro models present a variety of changes in the way audio and video are handled , including support for iPhone - style integrated mic headphones and the new Display Port standard .
Here 's what 's new in audio and video .
Audio Inputs
The entire new MacBook line retains audio input and output with both regular electrical analog and optical digital ( S / PDIF ) connections .
However , the new models also adopt the four conductor headphone jack introduced with the original iPhone , which enables the use of headphones with an integrated mic and remote playback controls .
Last month , the new iPod touch , nano and classic were also updated to support iPhone - style headphones to handle new audio recording features , and potentially VoIP features on the iPod touch .
Apple has announced new sets of headphones due out later this month that provide an integrated mic and playback controls .
The MacBooks also have an omnidirectional mic integrated into the left side speaker grill ( as earlier models did ) , but capturing audio conversations for podcasting and VoIP will greatly benefit from the new capacity for using mic-integrated headphones .
The new MacBooks also continue to supply 2.1 audio , with two directional speakers for stereo imaging and a subwoofer for better bass response built into the center of the right side of the unit .
When an iPhone - style set of headphones with an integrated mic are plugged in , the Sound panel in System Preferences automatically switches audio input from the internal microphone ( below top ) to the external mic available in the headphones ( below bottom ) .
PlainTalk to the iPhone mic
Apple has n't supported a basic microphone input on the Mac since 1991 , when it replaced the Mac 's unpowered mic input with the PlainTalk line level input .
Prior to that , Macs shipped with the " Apple Omni- directional Mic , " an unpowered or " mic level , " monophonic device .
Throughout the 90s , Apple shipped new Macs with its PlainTalk microphone , which used an extra long jack to supply power to the mic from the computer .
By tapping power from the Mac , the PlainTalk mic could boost its output from mic level to " line level . "
The line level mic inputs that have been on all Macs since ( apart from a few models with no mic input at all ) have therefore required a line level microphone .
Most cheap mics designed for use with generic PCs are unpowered and therefore do not deliver a strong enough signal to be used with the Mac 's line level audio input .
In order to use an unpowered mic , Mac users have previously needed to either attach a preamp between the unpowered mic and the line level input to boost the mic's output to line level , or alternatively use a digital USB mic , such as the Snowball from Blue , or some other USB or Firewire driven audio input device such as the Griffin iMic .
For a period of time around the delivery of the PowerMac G4 Cube , Mac desktops and notebooks dropped PlainTalk analog mic inputs entirely as Apple expected everyone to use a USB mic .
Line level mic inputs later returned , and since the MacBook arrived in 2006 , most Mac models have sported a line level input that can input 24 - bit stereo at a 44.1 - 192k
Hz sampling rate and also accommodate an optical digital mini-toslink S/ PDIF input at the same audio resolution .
With the latest MacBooks , the headphone jack can also now support audio input using a fairly standard four conductor jack .
Video and Display
Physically , the glass panel covering the screen on both new MacBook models is listed by Apple as " not a serviceable part , " according to sources familiar with its design .
The company 's policy on servicing a broken glass panel notes that " any attempt to remove the panel can shatter the glass , which could lead to other damaged parts .
Broken or scratch glass panels will instead be addressed by replacing the entire display module . "
The new Mini DisplayPort contributes toward a much more compact array of expansion ports on the left side of the machine .
Looking at the logic board ( below ) , it 's obvious why such a difference in physical port size matters .
The MacBook 's motherboard is only a bit larger than a quarter of the surface area inside the machine , and its left edge offers no vacancies for additional ports or a full sized DVI connector .
Unlike VGA , DVI , and HDMI , DisplayPort is more than just a way to deliver a video signal between devices ; it is also designed to replace the LVDS cabling used internally in notebooks and inside displays .
The more sophisticated signaling of DisplayPort , and the subsequent need for fewer wires to deliver the signal , will not only allow manufacturers to make slimmer display case designs , but also affords Apple the ability to add support for multiple internal displays on its notebooks in the future , such as an LCD panel built into the trackpad .
DisplayPort is also designed with the potential to allow a single cable to drive multiple monitors .
Despite using the new Mini DisplayPort for external video displays , the new MacBooks continue to use LVDS cabling internally to drive the built in display .
This results in needing to route a delicate bundle of a large number of wires from the logic board through the hinge and to the display panel .
Future models may likely take advantage of the DisplayPort standard internally to replace this thick display cable with a simpler , thinner signal cable once LCD panel makers start adopting DisplayPort themselves .
The mini DisplayPort catch - 22
Mini DisplayPort also allows even the entry level MacBook to support the 2560x1600 resolution of Apple 's most expensive 30 " Cinema Display without needing the large , 24 - pin connector demanded by dual - link DVI on the relatively small notebook .
The muscle to drive that resolution is provided by NVIDIA 's 9400 M controller chip ; the previous MacBook , using integrated Intel graphics , lacked the capacity to drive a 30 " resolution display despite having a DVI connector with the pins available .
Resolutions lower than 30 " only require single - link DVI , which uses 6 fewer pins on the DVI port , although the connector itself is the same size .
The new MacBooks now have the best of both worlds : a small connector and the capacity to handle very high resolution .
Somewhat ironically , the converter for adapting the MacBook 's Mini DisplayPort for use with the dual - link DVI signal required by the 30 " Cinema Display not only costs $ 99 , but it 's not even available for purchase yet .
Dell makes a 30 " monitor of its own that uses DisplayPort , although the " Mini DisplayPort " used by Apple is n't common ( it appears Apple invented it ) and therefore cables are n't yet readily available to connect the new MacBooks to a third party , full size Display Port - equipped screen either .
Apple 's new 24 " LED Cinema Display uses Mini DisplayPort exclusively , so it can only be used by the new MacBook and MacBook Pro .
There are no converter boxes for turning DVI signals from a Mac mini or Mac Pro into DisplayPort , which uses not just different physical wiring but an entirely different signaling protocol .
In other words , during the transition from DVI - based Macs to DisplayPort , there are a number of things that wo n't work together .
From this point forward , all new Macs will have DisplayPort ( likely Apple 's Mini variant , as there is no obvious advantage to using the larger version ) , and new Cinema Displays will also eventually gain the new connector .
Existing 30 " displays will require a somewhat expensive box ( although if you can afford a 30 " screen , you 're probably not sweating over a $ 99 converter ) , but other displays only need the $ 30 VGA or single - link DVI dongle to work with a new mini DisplayPort Mac .
The Apple TV will likely retain HDMI rather than mini DisplayPort , as it does n't need to drive display resolutions higher than HDTV 's 1920x1080 , which HDMI has no problem doing .
DisplayPort is only required for driving higher resolution monitors with 30 " 2560x1600 resolutions or greater .
A federal judge delivered a potentially fatal blow to the popular Bratz dolls and their manufacturer , MGA Entertainment Inc. , ruling late Wednesday that archrival Mattel Inc. is the legal owner of the edgy toy line and has the right to recall all unsold Bratz .
The court order , which represents a major victory for toy giant Mattel , says MGA may no longer manufacture , sell , advertise or license its core lineup of Bratz dolls or any other product with the Bratz name .
Preteen girls , who took to the pouty - lipped Bratz almost from the time they debuted in 2001 , will still be able to put them on their gift lists for this holiday season , however .
The order by Judge Stephen Larson will not take effect until the warring toy companies meet in court Feb. 11 , at the earliest .
Mattel Chief Executive Robert Eckert issued a statement Wednesday saying the company was pleased that the court “ ordered MGA to stop selling Bratz products . ”
The brief statement also said the ruling “ underscores what Mattel has said all along -- that MGA should not be allowed to profit from its wrongdoing . ”

Issac Larian , chief executive and majority owner of MGA , said the company would appeal .
“ I was just shocked ” by the decision , Larian said .
“ It was unbelievable , but we will come out on top in the end . ”
Asked whether the decision , if upheld , could mark the end of his company , Larian said , “ I do n’t want to even think about that right now . ”
The decision covered nearly all MGA products issued under the Bratz name .
But MGA would have to use another moniker if it were to keep making them .

Van Nuys - based MGA employs more than 1,500 people .
Other than Bratz , the company ’s products include a line of dolls called Rescue Pets .
If the order puts MGA out of business , Mattel would be rid of its primary fashion doll rival .
The Bratz were seen as grabbing more and more sales from Mattel ’s signature Barbie line .
The court order stemmed from a July decision by a jury that found the Bratz creator was working at Mattel under an exclusive contract when he came up with the idea for the doll line .
The federal jury in Larson ’s Riverside courtroom awarded Mattel as much as $ 100 million for copyright infringement and breach of contract .
It also granted Mattel the rights to key early drawings and a mock - up that designer Carter Bryant produced at Mattel before he went over to MGA .

The family - owned company based its toy empire on Bratz .
Larson said in the decision that he took this into consideration .
“ Factually , the hardship on MGA weighs very heavily upon the court , ” Larson wrote .
But he said that the court , “ in the final analysis , must afford this very little , if any , weight . ”
And although Larson wrote further that there was “ a strong economic interest ” in keeping a profitable company healthy during difficult economic times , “ there is also a strong public interest in enforcing copyright laws . ”
The legal battle over the Bratz has raged for more than four years .
Larian said last month that MGA spent about $ 80 million in legal fees trying to protect his product .

He blamed the heavy legal expenses for his laying off 70 workers , about 4 % of the workforce , in October .
Mattel has never said how much the entire legal battle has cost , but the company disclosed that in the first nine months of this year it spent nearly $ 30 million in lawyer fees and other costs .
Mattel , which is the world ’s largest toy company , has had its own economic troubles of late .
In November it eliminated 1,000 jobs , or about 3 % of its worldwide workforce .
About 170 of those cut jobs were at headquarters in El Segundo .
Barbie , created in 1959 , reigned as the fashion doll queen for decades .
But the Bratz , which have large , heavily made - up eyes and a far more sassy expression than sedate Barbie , were loved by preteen girls nearly from the moment they were introduced .

Creator Bryant , who reached a sealed agreement with Mattel before the trial began , said he got the idea for the look of the doll from observing teenagers near a high school .
Some parents object to the look of the Bratz , which wear hip - hugging clothes , often with bare midriffs .
On the Web , the dolls were nicknamed Slutz .
Mattel did not say in the wake of the ruling whether it planned to take over the manufacture and sale of Bratz now that it has the name .
In court filings , company executives asked for permission to destroy the dolls but could always change their minds .
Even though it currently does not make anything as racy as the Bratz , Mattel could use a hit in the fashion doll line .

In the third quarter this year , Barbie sales slipped 1 % worldwide compared with the same period in 2007 .
But that was good news compared with the previous quarter , which saw a 21 % drop .

Charles Bremner reports on an exchange between Sarkozy and Putin :
With Russian tanks only 30 miles from Tbilisi on August 12 , Mr Sarkozy told Mr Putin that the world would not accept the overthrow of Georgia , Mr Levitte said .
" I am going to hang Saakashvili by the balls , " Mr Putin replied .
Mr Sarkozy responded : " Hang him ? "
" Why not ?
The Americans hanged Saddam Hussein , " said Mr Putin .
Mr Sarkozy replied , using the familiar " tu " : " Yes but do you want to end up like ( President ) Bush ? "
Mr Putin was briefly lost for words , then said : " Ah , you have scored a point there . "
The median home price in California dived 38 % in November from a year earlier as foreclosures propped up sales but eroded prices , a real estate tracking firm said Thursday .
The median home price dropped to $ 258,000 last month from $ 414,000 in November 2007 , San Diego - based MDA DataQuick said .
A total of 32,163 houses and condominiums were sold statewide , up 26 % from a year earlier .
“ Indicators of market distress continue to move in different directions , ” DataQuick said .
“ Foreclosure activity is at or near record levels , financing with adjustable - rate mortgages is near the all - time low . ”
DataQuick said the median home price in the nine - county San Francisco Bay Area plummeted a record 44 % in November to the lowest level since September 2000 .

The median price for houses and condos there dropped to $ 350,000 last month from $ 629,000 in November 2007 .
The peak median price -- $ 665,000 -- was reached in the summer of 2007 .
A total of 5,756 houses and condos were sold in the region last month , up 12 % from the year - earlier period .
Foreclosures accounted for about 47 % of all sales of existing homes last month in Northern California , up from 10 % in November 2007 .
Solano County led the way , with 63.6 % of sales last month involving foreclosed properties .

DataQuick said this week that the median home price in a six - county region of Southern California plunged 35 % in November from a year earlier , dropping to the lowest mark since April 2003 .
DIGG THIS
If you write and follow politics enough , you eventually realize that most evil in this world is brought about by those seeking a lesser of two evils .
And those who assist in this very much resent it when you point out that they are promoting evil .
My inbox has been inundated in recent days with people who think along these lines .
Consider the Detroit bailout for example .
Now , this idea is preposterous on the face of it .
One of the glorious aspects of this recession is that it will finally deal the crippling blow to this industry that has been a decades - long drag on American productivity .
Wicked unions have thoroughly looted the capital stock of these companies , and the workers themselves are wholly focused on their own well - being rather than that of the company and the consumer .
The management is deeply embedded in the regulatory structure of the state , working to effectively turn the American car industry into a public - private partnership of the sort Mussolini would applaud .
You do n’t have to be a technician to know that foreign makers — whether building abroad or residing in the United States — make a superior car at a better price , no matter how much the “ Big 3 ” waste on hopped - up advertising campaigns .
In fact , we should welcome their complete bankruptcy .
Maybe they can regroup or maybe they can’t .
That ’s for the market to decide .
In the meantime , not cranking out these endless cars would be a welcome relief , freeing up labor and capital for more economically useful purposes .
To bail them out with tax dollars is an amazing insult to American consumers .
What Americans have chosen not to buy , the government is now effectively forcing them to buy .
You want a Toyota and paid for it with your money but your government is now saying that you should have bought a Pontiac , so it is tapping into your bank account to make it happen — and then not even giving you a car for your money !
But let ’s return to the problem of those who have caved in .
I ’m getting messages from people who believe in free markets saying that we have to do this bailout anyway , otherwise we will face worse consequences .
The unions will strike back .
There will be massive protectionism to prop up the industry .
Free market people will get a bad name for not supporting the little guy .
Our industrial base will further erode .
Unemployment will soar and then the masses will riot and we ’ll get Bolshevism .
And so on .
Dick Cheney himself is reported to have gone around to Republican senators to tell them to pass the bailout , even if they disagree .
Otherwise , they would be like Hoover , not having done anything about the depression .
Leaving aside his stupid historical point ( Hoover did plenty , all of it wrong ) , it is never right to do evil that good may come of it .
I grant that all the predicted results of failing to pass it would be bad .
They might even be worse than a bailout , who is to say ?
But these are speculations about the future .
What we face right now is a terrible evil of a bailout , and great good comes from its failure to pass .
What ’s more , if free market people can’t bring themselves to oppose that , what good are they anyway ?
People who think along these lines imagine that they personally can control the political process in clever ways , giving a bit here to get more later on .
I actually heard these same arguments about the first round of bailouts back in September : we ’d better support this now or else it will be worse later .
What is striking about these arguments is how tyrants always use them .
Hillary Clinton used to claim that we either pay for her health care program now or pay more later .
FDR said we need to support the New Deal now , or else face full - scale socialism later .
Actually Hitler was the same way .
He justified his entire program on the idea that only National Socialism could stop Bolshevism .
If a dystopian nightmare of the totalitarian state finally arrives in the United States , it will be a result of a compromise , and there will be people around until the very end who will insist that we should be grateful because it could be much worse .
This kind of strategizing also works as a cover for selling your soul .
The temptation to do this is very great indeed .
The state loves nothing more than a seeming libertarian who weighs in from time to time with a pro-state position .
This allows the state and its minions to justify their oppression even from the standpoint of libertarian intellectuals .
When you sell out , this is the role you are playing ( and this is the role that some D.C. organizations have been appointed to play ) .
There is only one sure way that you can know that you are on the right side of history , and that is by saying what is true and defending what is right , without exception .
It is not left to intellectuals to play political games .
Intellectuals are supposed to tell the truth , regardless of the moment .
That means , in these days , completely opposing all increases in state power under the cover of “ countercyclical policy . ”
Let evil people take responsibility for their evil policies .
Those who know better should stick to the right and true .

We 're right , the sceptics are wrong
Dr David Viner
It is the second warmest globally since the 1860s , when reliable records began , they add .
Ocean temperatures recorded in the Northern Hemisphere Atlantic Ocean have also been the hottest on record .
The researchers , from the UK Met Office and the University of East Anglia , say this is more evidence for the reality of human - induced global warming .
Their data show that the average temperature during 2005 in the Northern Hemisphere is 0.65C above the average for 1961 - 1990 , a conventional baseline against which scientists compare temperatures .
The global increase is 0.48C , making 2005 the second warmest year on record behind 1998 , though the 1998 figure was inflated by strong El Nino conditions .
The Northern Hemisphere is warming faster than the south , scientists believe , because a greater proportion of it is land , which responds faster to atmospheric conditions than the ocean .
Northern Hemisphere temperatures are now about 0.4C higher than a decade ago .
" The data also show that the sea surface temperature in the northern hemisphere Atlantic is the highest since 1880 , " said Dr David Viner , from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) .
Error bar
No measurements of average temperature can be completely accurate , and Dr Viner believes the team 's calculations are subject to an error of about plus or minus 0.1C .
However , he says , the long - term trend is clearly upwards - rapidly over the last decade - indicating the reality of human - induced global warming .
" We 're right , the sceptics are wrong , " he told the BBC News website .
" It 's simple physics ; more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , emissions growing on a global basis , and consequently increasing temperatures . "
However , Fred Singer from the Science & Environmental Policy Project in Washington DC , a centre of the " climate sceptics " community , disputed this interpretation .
" If indeed 2005 is the warmest northern hemisphere year since 1860 , all this proves is that 2005 is the warmest northern hemisphere year since 1860 , " he told the BBC News website .
" It does n't prove anything else , and certainly cannot be used by itself to prove that the cause of warming is the emission of greenhouse gases .
" It requires a more subtle examination to know how much of warming is due to man-made causes - there must be some - and how much is down to natural causes . "
Eight of the 10 warmest years since 1860 have occurred within the last decade .
