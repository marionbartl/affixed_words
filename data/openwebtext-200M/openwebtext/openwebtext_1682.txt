Three women in Namibia are suing the state for allegedly being sterilised without their informed consent after being diagnosed as HIV positive .
The women say the doctors and nurses should have informed them properly about what was happening .
The rights group representing them , the Legal Assistance Centre , says it has documented 15 cases of alleged HIV sterilisation in hospitals since 2008 .
A march in their support is taking place in Windhoek as the case begins .
The BBC's Frauke Jensen in the capital , Windhoek , says there are around 300 people on the march .
Most of them are women , and they have been chanting slogans such as : " My body , my womb , my right " , and holding placards reading : " Why did you sterilise me ? "
They are also planning a sit -in protest on Wednesday at two of the hospitals where the alleged sterilisations took place , our reporter says .
' Equality for all '
The women taking their case to court want 1 m Namibian dollars ( $ 130,000 , £ 90,000 ) in compensation from the health ministry .
Gladys Kamboo , a spokesperson for the ministry , said she could not comment on the case while it was being heard in court , but insisted that the ministry had not done the women any intentional harm .
The Legal Assistance Centre ( LAC ) says the High Court has granted that the women 's identities should not be revealed to prevent " further discrimination and stigmatisation because of their HIV status " .
" We want a health system based on human rights which promotes equality for all , " the LAC's Amon Ngavetene told the BBC News website .
He explained that when HIV - positive women go to hospital they are sometimes , at the discretion of the doctors , advised to undergo a sterilisation operation .
Mr Ngavetene said these women are not always given a clear idea of what the procedure involves and dangerous pre-existing conditions are not always taken into account .
There may also be a language barrier in a country where there are 11 indigenous languages , he said .
As well as the march in Windhoek , other solidarity marches are planned on Tuesday in South Africa , Zambia , the UK and the US .
YOUR FOOD & THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE CLAUSE By Derry Brownfield
May 23 , 2010 NewsWithViews.com
The United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) says it plans to drop the program called the National Animal Identification System ( NAIS ) .
I ’ve been studying the antics of Washington bureaucrats for 50 years and I know this is just another ploy to give farmers and ranchers a feeling of security , when all the while they are in the process of coming back with a much more draconian plan .
The name has been changed and descriptive words have been eliminated and replaced with other objectives , but government continues to push towards turning the control of our livestock industry over to the multinational meat packers .
The coyotes howl along the trail but the wagons keep rolling along .
The USDA has only put a new saddle on the same old horse .
The program is no longer called NAIS , the new name is “ ANIMAL DISEASE TRACEABILITY FRAMEWORK . ”
The original document explaining NAIS consisted of 1200 pages , while this new version on traceability is only 7 pages of questions and answers .
Our government is doing everything within its power to force this plan upon us in order to be in compliance with the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ) .
We are being told this new plan will be a kinder , gentler state - run program ; however we will still have premise registration , although the word PREMISE has been changed to “ UNIQUE LOCATION IDENTIFIER . ”
The government is also trying to force sale - barns to tag all cows with the “ 840 ” tags .
“ 840 ” indicates the animal originated in the United States .
This is to keep us in compliance with the OIE .
The United States is no longer in charge of its own policies , rather we are obliged to follow directives of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , the Food & Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , including the Codex Alimentarius and the International Plant Protection Convention .
These are all agencies of the United Nations .
I have not researched other states , but in Missouri the State Veterinarian ’s office began coercing sale - barn owners to attach “ 840 ” tags in all cows going through their facilities .
Russell Wood states : “ This is nothing but a back door approach to NAIS PREMISE registration .
This sale - barn approach was an obvious attempt to assign PREMISE numbers to unsuspecting sellers and buyers whether they wanted to join the “ VOLUNTARY ” program or not .
Missouri has a law stating : “ The State Department of Agriculture is prohibited from mandating NAIS PREMISE registration on Missouri livestock producers . ”
By changing the name of the program from NAIS to “ ANIMAL DISEASE TRACEABILITY FRAMEWORK ” and changing “ PREMISES ” to “ UNIQUE LOCATION IDENTIFIER ” the law apparently becomes void . ”
Advertisement In December , some Missouri sale - barns began using the NAIS tags .
The barn owners said they had been instructed by the Missouri Department of Agriculture to apply these “ 840 ” tags to every cow unloaded at the sale barn .
After showing them the law prohibiting the state from doing what they had enticed the barn owners to do , a hearing was held in the State Capital to see if the State Veterinarian was abiding by Missouri law .
The Missouri State Veterinarian , Taylor Woods , testified that they had no official written policy on the use of the “ 840 ” tags .
The state officials had no jurisdiction over the barn owners and was pushing the United Nation ’s agenda through intimidation .
We have been told by government officials that this new approach is going to eliminate any producer that does not have livestock going into interstate commerce .
Except for Kansas , Nebraska , and perhaps Colorado , practically all cattle born in the state move across state lines .
Missouri for example has one of the largest mother cow herds in the nation – but has no feedlot or slaughter facilities , so about 100 % of the calves born in Missouri eventually cross state lines .
To understand why the USDA is pushing the “ Interstate Commerce Clause ” let ’s understand the 1942 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Wickard vs Filburn .
Claude Wickard was the Secretary of Agriculture at that time and Roscoe Filburn was a wheat grower .
Under FDR ’s NEW DEAL farmers were allowed to sell a certain amount of wheat .
Filburn grew more wheat than he was allowed to market in Interstate Commerce , so the wheat produced in excess of his quota he fed to his livestock .
Filburn was found guilty of violating the Interstate Commerce Clause because he fed the wheat to his own livestock ; wheat that he had produced on his own land .
Wickard assessed a penalty against him but Filburn refused to pay .
The Supreme Court ruled against Filburn saying : “ If he had not fed the wheat to his livestock he would have been forced to purchase wheat for livestock feed , and that wheat would have crossed state lines , therefore he was involved in Interstate Commerce . ”
Based upon these facts , if this new “ DISEASE TRACEABILITY ” plan goes into effect and a farmer butchers his own calf , he is in violation of the Interstate Commerce Clause .
Had he not butchered his own calf , he would have been forced to go to the market and buy beef which has crossed state lines .

Do you see the restraints big government is trying to place on animal agriculture ?
Even a local organic farmer , selling produce at a local Farmer ’s Market , would be in violation of the Interstate Commerce Clause .
Big Agribusiness has taken control of the poultry and egg industry , the pork and milk industries ; and if this new and improved DISEASE TRACEABILITY plan becomes law , everything a consumer purchases at the meat and dairy counter will be controlled by no more than a half - dozen large Agribusiness corporations .
Our food supply , as we know it , will be a thing of the past .

This is my second magnesium blog this week but I just could n’t help myself .
The arrhythmia post , Real Rhythm and Blues Without The Magnesium on Friday May 28 , 2010 prompted a number of email responses .
One doctor wanted to make sure that my open - mindedness did n’t mean that my brains were falling out .
He was reassured and wanted to share his magnesium story .
He said :
“ You must have a million magnesium stories by now , but I cannot miss responding to your report about the meeting on Arrhythmia Disorders .
I am an 82 year old retired M.D. ( psychiatry ) .
Several years ago I had a bout of atrial fibrillation , which fortunately resolved , but I remained subject to constant extreme arrhythmia for a couple of years .
My internist diagnosed premature ventricular contractions and said they were a nuisance but harmless .
A cardiologist confirmed my condition with 24 - hour monitoring and wanted to put me on Encainide , Flecainade or Amiodarone .
After reading about these drugs I said I was not ready to take them , at which point he left the room .
Never a word from him or my internist about magnesium .
I vaguely remembered about electrolytes and arrhythmia and told my internist I would like to try magnesium .
His entire response was “ it will just give you diarrhea . ”
But I put myself on magnesium oxide ( 250 mg at first , then more ) and after a short while –this was well over a year ago – the arrhythmia disappeared completely and has not returned .
I have not had diarrhea .
Both doctors are respected and experienced practitioners in a large city .
So carry on ! ”
If my heart is palpitating ( which it does if I do n’t take enough magnesium ) how can three or four medications possibly help ?
And , by the way , I do n’t have 100 years to wait until enough studies prove to allopathic medicine ’s satisfaction that magnesium is safe to take for heart palpitations !
The moral of this blog is for you to do your own research and take some responsibility for your own health and try to convince your doctor to work with you .
And I hope you do n’t run into one particular doctor who equated my promotion of magnesium with “ snake venom , poison ivy , beef , ozone and radon . ”
He definitely needs to read my magnesium book and realize that nutrients like magnesium are deficient in the diet and are never going to be found in prescription medication .
Watch for a future post on The Death of Hope , which is what drug companies seem to be teaching medical students and doctors these days !

Google Inc. is preparing to roll out a music download service tied to its search engine later this year , followed by an online subscription service in 2011 , according to people familiar with the Internet giant 's discussions with the music industry .
Google 's proposals are still vague , say these people , and it 's unclear whether it has struck any deals with record labels so far .
But Google has been stepping up conversations about offering new music services tied to phones running its Android operating system along with the broader Web , said people who have been briefed on the talks .
The launch of Google 's download music store is still months away , these people said .
The discussions come as Google has been pushing deeper into music .
Last year , as a first step , the company began linking to partner websites like iLike and Pandora through its search engine , allowing people to stream songs with one click from its search page .
Now , the company is looking to tie its own service to its search engine , too .
The discussions come as the Mountain View , Calif . - based search company has been ramping up on entertainment content .
Google is also moving to add professional content on its YouTube video site , and is planning to roll out a digital bookstore this year .
The launch of a Google music store would heighten tensions with Apple Inc. , whose iTunes store is the leading U.S. digital music seller .
Apple also recently began selling digital books .
The two Silicon Valley giants have been at odds since Google launched its Android mobile phone software , a direct challenge to Apple 's popular iPhone .
Apple recently hit back with an advertising platform for its iPhone and iPad tablet that has terms Google says could limit competition .
The last ( and only ) defense against the ongoing Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is tiny — billions of hydrocarbon - chewing microbes , such as Alcanivorax borkumensis .
In fact , the primary motive for using the more than 830,000 gallons of chemical dispersants on the oil slick both above and below the surface of the sea is to break the oil into smaller droplets that bacteria can more easily consume .
" If the oil is in very small droplets , microbial degradation is much quicker , " says microbial ecologist Kenneth Lee , director of the Center for Offshore Oil , Gas and Energy Research with Fisheries and Oceans Canada , who has been measuring the oil droplets in the Gulf of Mexico to determine the effectiveness of the dispersant use .
" The dispersants can also stimulate microbial growth .
Bacteria will chew on the dispersants as well as the oil . "
For decades scientists have pursued genetic modifications that might enhance these microbes ' ability to chew up oil spills , whether on land or sea .
Even geneticist Craig Venter forecast such an application last week during the unveiling of the world 's first synthetic cell , and one of the first patents on a genetically engineered organism was a hydrocarbon - eating microbe , notes microbiologist Ronald Atlas of the University of Louisville .
But there are no signs of such organisms put to work outside the lab .
" Microbes are available now but they are not effective for the most part , " says marine microbiologist Jay Grimes of the University of Southern Mississippi .
At this point , there are no man-made microbes that are more effective than naturally occurring ones at utilizing hydrocarbons .
The natural world is replete with a host of organisms that combine as a community to decompose oil — and no single microbe , no matter how genetically enhanced , has proved better than this natural defense .
" Every ocean we look at , from the Antarctic to the Arctic , there are oil - degrading bacteria , " says Atlas , who evaluated genetically engineered microbes and other cleanup ideas in the wake of the Exxon - Valdez oil spill in Alaska .
" Petroleum has thousands of compounds .
It 's complex and the communities that feed on it are complex .
A superbug fails because it competes with this community that is adapted to the environment . "
Nor is it easy to help the existing communities of thousands of microbes , such as various species of Vibrio and Pseudomonads , to eat the oil faster — seeding experiments have generally failed .
" Microbes are a lot like teenagers , they are hard to control , " says marine chemist Chris Reddy of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution .
" The concept that nature will eat it all up is not accurate , at least not on the time scale we 're worried about . "
Just like your automobile , these marine - dwelling bacteria and fungi use the hydrocarbons as fuel — and emit the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) as a result .
In essence , the microbes break down the ring structures of the hydrocarbons in seaborne oil using enzymes and oxygen in the seawater .
The end result is ancient oil turned into modern - day bacterial biomass — populations can grow exponentially in days .
" Down in the Gulf of Mexico there is an indigenous population [ of microbes ] adapted to oil from so much marine traffic and daily spills .
Oil is not new , " says Lee , who has also been monitoring the plumes of oil beneath the surface .
" There are so many natural seeps around the world that if it was n't for microbes we would have a lot of oil in the oceans . "
Already , measurements of oxygen depletion of as much as 30 percent in the Gulf of Mexico seawater suggest that the microbes are hard at work eating oil .
" I take the 30 percent depletion of oxygen in water near the oil as indicating bacterial degradation , " Atlas says .
That happens best near the surface , whether at land or sea , where warm - water bacteria such as Thalassolituus oleivorans can thrive ; colder , deeper waters inhibit microbial growth .
" Metabolism slows by about a factor of two or three for every 10 degree [s ]
Celsius you drop in temperature , " notes biogeochemist David Valentine of the University of California , Santa Barbara , who just received funding from the National Science Foundation to characterize the microbial response to the ongoing oil spill .
" The deeper stuff , that 's going to happen very slowly because the temperature is so low . "
Unfortunately , that 's exactly where some of the Deepwater Horizon oil seems to be ending up .
" They saw the oil at 800 to 1,400 meters depth , " says microbial ecologist Andreas Teske of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , whose graduate student Luke McKay was on the research vessel Pelican that first reported such subsurface plumes — as predicted by small - scale experiments , such as the U.S. Minerals Management Services Project " Deep Spill " .
" It is either at the surface or hanging in the water column and possibly sinking down to the sediment . "
Yet , microbes are the only process to break down the oil deeper in the water , far away from physical processes on the surface such as evaporation or waves .
" The deep waters are dominantly microbial " when it comes to oil degradation , although these communities are not as well studied as those at the surface , notes microbial geochemist Samantha Joye of the University of Georgia .
" As long as there is oxygen around , it will get chewed up . "
To understand how the microbes will work and how quickly , however , will require a better understanding of exactly how much oil is out there .
" It 's a function of size , and we do n't know size , " Joye says .
" We need to know how much oil is leaking out .
Without that information we can't begin to make any kind of calculation of potential oxygen demand or anything else . "
BP now admits that its original estimate of roughly 200,000 gallons per day was far too low without providing an alternative ; independent experts have offered estimates as high as four million gallons per day .
It is possible to add fertilizers , such as iron , nitrogen and phosphorus , to stimulate the growth of such bacteria , an approach used to speed up microbial activity in the sediment along the Alaska coast after the Exxon - Valdez spill .
" We saw a three to five times increase in rate of biodegradation , " Atlas says , suggesting the technique might prove effective along the oil - inundated Louisiana coast as well .
" It was hundreds of miles of shoreline , the largest bioremediation project ever . "
But that 's strictly onshore .
" In the ocean , how do you keep the nutrients with the oil ? "
Lee asks .
" It 's much easier to add to soil .
That 's why you do n't see bioremediation in the open ocean . "
And aerating soils in wetlands can have its own problems ;
Lee tried tilling oil - soaked wetlands in Nova Scotia where there was limited oxygen to increase microbial activity .
" That did n't work .
We had large erosion as a result , " he says .
" If the oil reaches shore , our recommendation was to leave the oil alone and let nature do it . "
But sediment , whether the muck of Louisiana marshland or the deep ocean seafloor , suffers from a dearth of oxygen .
That means it 's up to anaerobic microbes — ancient organisms that live via sulfate rather than oxygen — to do the dirty work of consuming the spill .
" What occurred in 10 days aerobically , took 365 days to occur anaerobically , " says Atlas of the breakdown of oil in the wake of the Amoco Cadiz spill off the coast of France in 1978 .
Adds Teske : " The heavy components are sinking to the sediment and forming an oily or tarry carpet or getting buried .
Then they are much harder to degrade . "
Such anaerobic environments can develop locally in the seawater itself , thanks to a ready supply of oil and blooming microbes eager to devour it .
In deepwater , where there 's less mixing with the surface waters to provide fresh supplies of oxygen , a dead zone may result .
" It 's not exchanging with the atmosphere , " Joye notes .
" Once the oxygen is gone , how are you going to replace it ?
It 's not going to get mixed up by winter storms . "
That 's bad news for the speedy breakdown of oil as well as for the Lophelia coral and other sessile deepwater life .
At the same time , the addition of 130,000 gallons of dispersants deep beneath the surface is having uncertain effects ; it may even end up killing the microbes it is meant to help thanks to the fact that Corexit 9527A contains the solvent 2 - butoxyethanol , which is a known human carcinogen and toxic to animals and other life .
But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and others are monitoring whether adding such dispersants ends up boosting microbe - growth and hence dangerously depletes oxygen levels , among other potential environmental ill effects .
Nor is it clear how fast the microbial community will respond .
" Which microbial communities are the fastest responders ? "
Teske asks .
" That would be interesting to know " and this oil spill may provide the real - world answer .
Some research suggests that oil spills may actually feed themselves nitrogen by stimulating the growth of various bacteria that fix the vital nutrient , Joye notes .
At the same time , microbial predators such as protozoa tend to dampen the efficiency of would - be oil - eating microbes .
Scientists are still working to deploy known oil - eaters , such as Alcanivorax , in the form of booms laced with slow - release fertilizer and the microbes .
In experiments such microbial booms ate heavy fuel oil in two months and " the experimental waste water was clean enough to be released back to the sea , " says environmental geneticist Peter Golyshin of Bangor University in Wales .
But " in the Gulf of Mexico , the amount of oil is simply too big .
The oil gets dispersed but there is not enough [ nitrogen ] and [ phosphorus ] to feed bacterial growth . "
Ultimately , it is only microbes that can remove the oil from the ocean .
" In the long run , it 's biodegradation that removes most of the oil from the environment in these situations , " Lee says .
Or , as Joye puts it , " They 're clever , they 're tough , they can basically eat nails … .
The microbes have to save us again . "
Regardless , the oil will linger in the environment for a long time .
The microbes break down hydrocarbons in " weeks to months to years , depending on the compounds and concentrations — not hours or days , " Atlas notes .
" Much of the real tar or asphalt compounds are not readily subject to microbial attack … .
Tar tends to persist .
Asphalt tends to persist . "
Adds Valentine : " We would n't make roads out of them if the bacteria ate them . "
Light passes through the crystal in the quantum memory experiment .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
An Australian National University - led team has developed the most efficient quantum memory for light in the world , taking us closer to a future of super - fast computers and communication secured by the laws of physics .
The team at the ANU Research School of Physics and Engineering used a technique they pioneered to stop and control light from a laser , manipulating electrons in a crystal cooled to a chilly - 270 degrees Celcius .
The unprecedented efficiency and accuracy of the system allows the delicate quantum nature of the light to be stored , manipulated , and recalled .
“ Light entering the crystal is slowed all the way to a stop , where it remains until we let it go again , ” explains lead researcher Morgan Hedges .
“ When we do let it go , we get out essentially everything that went in as a three - dimensional hologram , accurate right down to the last photon .
“ Because of the inherent uncertainty in quantum mechanics , some of the information in this light will be lost the moment it is measured , making it a read - once hologram .
Quantum mechanics guarantees this information can only be read once , making it perfect for secure communication . ”
The same efficient and accurate qualities make the memory a leading prospect for quantum computing , which has the potential to be many times faster and more powerful than contemporary computing .
In addition , the researchers say the light storage will allow tests of fundamental physics , such as how the bizarre phenomenon of quantum entanglement interacts with of the theory of relativity .
“ We could entangle the quantum state of two memories , that is , two crystals , ” says team leader Dr Matthew Sellars .
“ According to quantum mechanics , reading out one memory will instantly alter what is stored in the other , no matter how large the distance between them .
According to relativity , the way time passes for one memory is affected by how it moves .
With a good quantum memory , an experiment to measure how these fundamental effects interact could be as simple as putting one crystal in the back of my car and going for a drive . ”
Dr Sellars ’ team has previously performed an experiment that ‘ stopped ’ light in a crystal for over a second , more than 1,000 times longer than was previously possible .
He said that the team is now bringing together systems that combine the high efficiency with storage times of hours .
The research team includes Dr Jevon Longdell from the University of Otago and Dr Yongmin Li from Shanxi University .
The findings are published in Nature this week .

He seems like a nice reasonable guy .
I would have really liked to take a picture of these exchanges , but I respect his not wanting to get photographed at this point , that and I fear it might absolutely ignite a powder keg .
I choose a different tactic ... ]
MT : You know ... you 're really quite photogenic ... you should n't be ashamed of having your picture taken .
Officer Dan :
Shut the fuck up .
MT : Seriously ... I was just complimenting ... Officer Dan : I said shut the fuck up .

Does this mean I 'm going to be on some watch list now ?
Officer Don : Hah ... No .MT : Oh ... then why are you writing down my personal information ?
Officer Don : I like to keep tabs on the people I meet down here .
MT : Oh ... like a list ?
It 's nice to meet you too Officer Don.
Officer Don :
Do you want your business card back ?
MT : Sure , as I 'm guessing you guys wo n't be contacting me for a print .
Officer Don : Word of advice ... be careful who you take pictures of ... some new yorkers might get pretty offended .
[ It took me 5 years of taking photos of new yorkers without incident to find out this out today from the cops ... but so I just did ... we parted ways ]
Dude :
Hey man , what were they hassling you for ?
MT : I took a picture of a cop .
I guess the ones that hug tourists work above ground .
Hey , I see you do photography too .
Cool .
Dude : Yes ..I 'm doing a project about the police objecting to legal photograhy in public spaces like the subway .
MT : Wow , what fantastic luck .
So did you get some good shots of me with the cops ?... I could really use them for this site noshiz.com .

MT : Bummer .
Twitter hints that you 'll be able to embed a Tweet the same way you can embed a YouTube video , starting tomorrow .
In a blog post called " Tweets are the new quotes , " Twitter acknowledges that news organizations are increasingly using Tweets as part of their coverage .
We , too , often use screenshots or pasted text of tweets in posts , either to complement other writing , or sometimes as the basis of complete posts .
This process is n't perfect , especially if you want to do more than just copy and paste the text of a Tweet .
And it looks like Twitter is going to release an " embed this tweet " tool tomorrow to help solve this problem .
" But the truth , of course , is that a pasted - in image of a tweet is a bit of a hack .
We have an alternative to propose ; it ’s coming tomorrow , " Twitter says .
Update : Twitter 's Robin Sloan explains to RWW how it'll work :

Joint News Release
July 18 , 2017
The libel suit filed by Doctor ’s Data ( DDI ) against Dr. Stephen Barrett , Quackwatch , Inc. , and the National Council against Health Fraud , Inc. , has been settled amicably .
The suit , filed in 2010 , charged that Dr. Barrett had improperly criticized DDI on Quackwatch.org and other sites that he controls .
DDI is a CLIA - and OSHA - certified laboratory that provides specialty testing to health care practitioners .
One of its tests measures the levels of lead and other toxic metals in the urine .
The lawsuit centered around an article by Dr. Barrett about how doctors were using test reports on urine specimens that had been obtained after administering a chelating drug to the patient .
This test process — called “ provoked ” or “ challenge ” testing — has been criticized by the American College of Medical Toxicologists and other mainstream medical organizations .
In 2009 , Dr. Barrett posted an article describing how doctors who submitted provoked specimens to DDI were improperly telling patients they had heavy metal poisoning for which chelation is needed .
DDI ’s lawsuit charged that the article falsely implied that DDI was responsible for how doctors interpret the test reports .
In settling the suit , DDI and Dr. Barrett acknowledged that :
It is not appropriate for a doctor to use a provoked test to tell people they have heavy metal poisoning .
Provoked testing should not be the sole basis for recommending chelation therapy .
Blood testing is the most appropriate test for lead poisoning .
DDI is federally and state certified to offer blood and urine metal testing in accordance with CLIA , OSHA , and state regulations .
The settlement agreement has other terms that will remain confidential .

Zombies are truly unique .
They rip pieces of flesh off themselves and throw them at you for their attack .
To kill them , you must gib them .
If you do not , they will simply fall over and get up later .
To gib them you will need to bring their health to - 40 , meaning you need to 120 damage in a single instance , this is most easily done with explosives as demonstrated in demo1.dem but can also be achieved via Quad Damage attacks with other weapons , or a Thunderbolt discharge of at least 3 cells .

A few months ago , I was looking for something to tag my images .
I have a huge collection of images and I was getting sick and tired looking for the ones I wanted .
First , I tagged them with IrfanView .
This was extremely cumbersome .
To tag an image , you have to do the following :
Press I to open the Image Properties window
Press I to open the IPTC Information window
Click Keywords to enter keywords
Repeat this process for every image for every folder spread out over God knows what drives .
It became impossible to keep track of commonly used tags , because you have to remember them , even if you use a Word document to keep track .
Next , I tried XnView .
This basically had the same problems .
Yes , it ’s an image manager , but tagging is still hard .
It has a commonly used tag list , which is great .
Buuut I have a lot of tags , and it becomes impossible to categorize them .
Worse still , not all images can be tagged !
XnView can only save tags in IPTC or EXIF ( JPG tags ) , it ca n’t tag PNG or GIF .
And then there was Picasa .
An image manager made by Google , who wants to make everything searchable ?
Yes please !
But oh no , this had problems of its own .
Search sucks
For a Google product , this is extremely surprising .
As an example , these are the tags ( “ labels ” in the Dutch version ) for my wallpaper folder :
This is a work in progress , I have n’t even tagged 1 % yet .
What I do is tag everything with “ later ” and “ wallpaper ” ( select everything , add tag ) .
Then I went through it and tagged them either as “ widescreen ” or “ normal ” .
When I ’m done tagging an image , I remove “ later ” .
And now the problem : the folder contains 538 images .
538 of those are tagged as “ wallpaper ” .
342 are tagged as “ widescreen ” .
193 are tagged as “ normal ” .
342 + 193 = 535 .
Uh - oh , I missed three !
Luckily I can search for images that are tagged with “ wallpaper ” but NOT “ widescreen ” or “ normal ” .
Oh wait , no I can ’t .
I can search for “ wallpaper widescreen ” , which will give me all widescreen wallpapers and I can search for “ wallpaper normal ” , which will give me all normal wallpapers .
That ’s not helpful at all !
What I would like is more logical operations in the search function :
NOT : the image does n’t contain “ this ”
OR : the image contains “ this ” or “ that ”
AND : the image contains “ this ” and “ that ”
XOR : the image contains “ this ” or “ that ” but not both
This is especially infuriating when I ’ve added a bunch of new images to the folder .
Now I have to go through all of them to see which ones are n’t tagged yet !
The tagging buttons
In theory , this is a very useful feature :
These are called “ quick tags ” , you have ten of them .
Instead of typing something in , you can just click on one of these .
You can also have the bottom three represent your three most commonly used tags .
I have over 50 commonly used tags , spread out over multiple topics .
There are no hotkeys for these buttons , it ’s mouse only .
There is no option to change the amount of buttons .
Even if you like the commonly used tags thing , there are only three of them .
What I would like to see instead :
A hierarchical tree of tags , separated by category : wallpapers , photographs , funny , etc .
Keep the commonly used tags , but assign them to all 10 buttons
Assign hotkeys for select tags ; how about Ctrl + < numberkey >?
Misspellings are saved
Say you misspelled wallpaper as “ wallpapur ” .
Now when you type in “ wal ” you get “ wallpapur ” as well .
Whoopsie - daisy !
I guess I ’ll search for it , remove it and everything will be fine ?
Nope , it ’s still in there .
Only when you restart the program is the tag database updated .
The database is stored on the C drive
And it can only be changed using a hack !
My C drive is almost filled , so I wanted to move the database to the F drive .
You can ’t !
You have to move the files to a different location and make a symbolic link to it .
This suggests the location of the database is hardcoded !
Conlcusion
Picasa is a great program , but its tagging capabilities seem tacked on .
Maybe I ’m just using it wrong . ;)
This game is very unique and fun .
It had great controls and the visuals looked just about as good as they needed to be .
The biggest of the games problems for me personally was the sound effects : they were just bad ; no - one likes hearing their main character loudly and obnoxiously grunt every time they press the jump button .
Besides the obnoxiously sound effects , the only other problem I had with the game was the game 's bipolar difficulty .
Some levels were very lenient while other required very carful platforming where one mis-step would require you to reset 2 or 3 previously dead bodies .
Patricia Brennan from Yale University is trying to encourage male Muscovy ducks to launch their ballistic penises into test tubes .
Normally , the duck keeps its penis inside - out within a sac in its body .
When the time for mating arrives , the penis explodes outwards to a fully - erect 20 cm , around a quarter of the animal ’s total body length .
The whole process takes just a third of a second and Brennan captures it all on high - speed camera .
This is n’t just bizarre voyeurism .
Duck penises are a wonderful example of the strange things that happen when sexual conflict shapes the evolution of animal bodies .
Many ducks form bonds between males and females that last for a whole mating season .
But rival males often violently force themselves onto females .
To gain the edge in these conflicts , drakes have evolved large corkscrew phalluses , lined with ridges and backward - pointing spines , which allow them to deposit their sperm further into a female than their rivals .
These extreme penises are even more unusual when you consider that 97 % of bird species lack any penises whatsoever .
But female ducks have developed countermeasures .
Their vaginas are equally long and twisting , lined with dead - end pockets and spirals that curve in the opposite direction .
They are organic chastity belts , evolved to limit the effectiveness of the males ’ lengthy genitals .
Two years ago , Brennan showed that duck species whose males have the longest penises tend to have females with the most elaborate vaginas .
Now , she has found further evidence that these complex genitals are the result of a long - lasting war of the sexes .
Duck penises ( and those other birds ) work in a different way to human ones .
For a start , they are flexible when erect .
Human penises stiffen thanks to an onrush of blood ; for ducks , it ’s lymph that does the job .
Finally , human males get erections before having sex but drakes evert their penis directly into the female ’s vagina .
That presents a problem .
To really study the mechanics of a duck penis , you ca n’t just fluff the animal .
You need to give it something to have sex with .
That ’s where the glass tubes come in .
Brennan used four different shapes : a straight tube ; a counterclockwise helix that matches the spiral of the male ’s penis ; a clockwise spiral going in the opposite direction ; and a tube with a sharp 135 degree kink , that mimics the position of the first cul - de-sac pouch in the female ’s vagina .
Brennan took these tubes to a commercial duck farm in California , where Muscovy drakes provide semen for artificial insemination .
She watched as the handlers placed a female in the same cage as a randy drake , and waited until the male mounted her .
Just as he was getting ready to mate , Brennan intercepted him with one of the four oiled tubes , touching it to a pair of sensitive spots that immediately trigger the explosive erection and ejaculation .
Her videos revealed the process of duck erection in painstaking detail , including how long it takes to evert the different parts of the penis , how fast the ejaculate is and how long it takes to retract the appendage ( around 2 minutes ) .
They showed that the drakes easily launched their penises into the straight tubes and the ones that matched the direction of their spiral .
The tubes that spiralled in the wrong direction or bent at a sharp angle proved to be more challenging , and mostly stopped the males from achieving a full erection .
So the shape of the female duck ’s vagina is a physical barrier that prevents the male from launching forth his ballistic penis to its fullest extent .
It wo n’t stop a drake from ejaculating ( and those in Brennan ’s trials always did ) , but it does limit how far the semen is deposited along the vaginal tract .
Not all males are hit equally hard by these defenses .
Those that the female actually wants to mate with have an easier time .
If she ’s into a male , she strikes a pose that signals her receptiveness , keeping her body level and lifting her tail feathers high .
She repeatedly contracts the walls of her genital tract , relaxing them for long enough for favored suitors to achieve full penetration .
Males who try to force themselves upon her receive no such help and have to cope with vigorous struggling .
The female may not be able to resist such advances , but her convoluted vagina gives her ultimate control over where the sperm of her current partner ends up .
The fact that only 3 % of duck offspring are born of forced matings suggests that females are indeed winning this battle of the sexes .
Clearly , it ’s not size that matters , but what she lets you do with it that counts .

A few days ago , Google acquired a company named BumpTop .
The company basically created a 3D user interface for a computer desktop - in fact , some TV stations use it to be cute .
Here is a video demo of what it does :
Why would Google buy them ?
Well , maybe to be used for their Chrome OS project ?
Maybe to be used on Android mobile devices ?
Maybe to be used to acquire desktop and mobile user interface patents so they have more of a case against Apple 's iPhone and multi - touch interfaces ?
This is however an interesting development that may creep into the search realm down the road .
Maybe 6 months , maybe 6 years but I can definitely see this creeping into search , some how .

Image caption Chris Sievey had a tumour on his chest , his agent said
The man who played comedian , musician and North West showbiz legend Frank Sidebottom has died .
It is understood entertainer Chris Sievey collapsed at his home in Hale , Greater Manchester , in the early hours .
The 54 - year - old was pronounced dead at Wythenshawe Hospital , a spokeswoman confirmed .
Known for his over - sized , papier - mache head , he found fame through a series of TV appearances in the 1980s and remained a popular cult comedy figure .
He had been recovering from treatment to a tumour on his chest , his agent Nigel Round said .
After having limited success with punk band The Freshies , Sievey created the role for which he will be best remembered .
Frank Sidebottom styled himself as an aspiring singer - songwriter from Timperley , south Manchester .
' One of a kind '
Often accompanied by his sidekick Little Frank - a glove puppet made in his own image - Frank became a regular face on TV in the 1980s and 1990s .
His TV fame peaked in the early 1990s with his own series Frank Sidebottom 's Fantastic Shed Show .
David Behrens , who produced the series , said : " Chris was a genuinely funny and creative comic talent , and he had a huge and loyal base of fans .
" He had been ill recently but his death is terribly sudden and sad . "
Mr Behrens added : " He came from a great comedy tradition in refusing to acknowledge his real identity when he was in character .
He never spoke about Chris Sievey , it was all about the character Nigel Round , Chris Sievey 's agent
" As soon as the prop head went on , he 'd answer to Frank , never Chris .
A real one of a kind . "
The comic creation 's songwriting skills led to singles and EPs including Christmas Is Really Fantastic , and the Timperley EP .
Despite fading from TV in recent years , Frank continued to perform at gigs .
He appeared on stage only last week , his agent said .
Mr Round said the comedian downplayed the cancer he had been fighting in recent months .
" He always said it was no problem , he was going through treatment but it was being sorted out . "
Mr Round added : " He was just a nice bloke .
He was quite a private person .
He never spoke about Chris Sievey , it was all about the character . "
He said Sievey was planning to come out from under the papier - mache mask in the coming years .
" Everyone kept it really quiet .
We were probably only 12 months from him uncovering himself , " Mr Round said .

Once upon a time in America , there was a left and a right and a center , and within these clearly discernible segments of the ideological spectrum there were distinctly calibrated gradations .
Everyone could find an ideological niche without much trouble , and knew pretty well where everyone else stood too .
Everyone knew who were the good guys and bad guys , and the varying degrees of rectitude of the guys in between .
By now it is almost a cliché that the old ideological points of reference are no more ; that left , right , and center cannot be identified even with a scorecard .
One way of describing these changes is to say that left and right have been collapsing toward the center , that is , toward the locus of power .
Interests of state have increasingly taken over , leading the “ responsible ” elements within each ideological group more and more to resemble one another .
We have reached the final pages of Orwell ’s Animal Farm , in which the pigs , who had previously been the vanguard of the successful animal revolution against man , now walk erect and even live in the farmhouse , and “ the creatures outside looked from pig to man , and from man to pig , and from Pig to man again ; but already it was impossible to say which was which . ”
Specifically , it has become almost impossible to distinguish “ responsible ” National Review conservatism from right - wing social democracy or from neoconservatism , and even , in some respects , from left - liberalism or the democratic socialism of the Robert Heilbroner variety .
How much difference is there , after all , among William F. Buckley , Sidney Hook , Daniel Patrick Moynihan , Nathan Glazer , Norman Podhoretz , and Irving Kristol — or even between them and Heilbroner and John Kenneth Galbraith ?
Admittedly there are differences of style , of traditional rhetoric , of ethnic roots , and especially , different persons and institutions each of these thinkers will salute on days of ritualistic obeisance .
But the substance is all too similar .
While Galbraith , for example , may twit and needle the Pentagon about this overseas adventure or that bloated budget , he did agree with Moynihan that on Vietnam liberals had to remain in the loyal opposition .
When it comes to Buckley , Moynihan , and Galbraith , even the differences of style and rhetoric begin to disappear .
Each is the alleged wit , the aging Peck ’s Bad Boy , of his respective ideological camp .
Each titillates his audience with a seeming audacity and irreverence that serve only as a cloak for the prejudices both of the establishment and of the constituencies for whose benefit these gentlemen go into their respective acts .

While Galbraith is the WASP ironist , the tall , distinguished chap whom Mary McGrory , in her repellently gushing way , has called “ the Rex Harrison ” of American politics , Buckley and Moynihan are two peas in a pod .
Each is an Irishman - turned - aristocrat , the sort of man whom Irish - Americans used to call “ castle Irish . ”
Each uses his wit and learning as a cover for the verbal mugging of anyone who gets in his way .
Each is a supreme exhibitionist , always center stage , always filled with fustian and bravado , playing to the peanut gallery as well as to his peers , and trumpeting his own righteousness and moral heroism .
To each man , the principles he champions pale before the aggrandizement of self that makes by far the more lasting impression .
In short , two politicians perfectly suited to the age of television .
In Daniel Patrick Moynihan , however , the folding of the ideological spectrum into the center of power , the subordination of principle to self , has reached its apogee .
Whoever the President , whatever the party in power , Moynihan always manages to land on his feet , and on top .
A Dangerous Place is Moynihan trumpeting Moynihan ’s exploits at the United Nations , and it is unquestionably the first shot in his own eventual campaign for the presidency .
The reviewer of this book in Business Week likened Moynihan to Talleyrand , and Moynihan does seem to have a similar talent for political survival .
Two men , Moynihan and Ralph de Toledano , instructed Richard Nixon in his early days as President that he was destined to be the “ American Disraeli . ”
De Toledano got short shrift and is now forgotten ; Moynihan became a high aide to Nixon , ambassador to India under Nixon and Ford , ambassador to the United Nations under Ford , and now the Democratic senator from New York , and , indirectly , a considerable power in the Carter administration .
The book bolsters our view of the new grand alliance of the center .
It is full of praise for what those stuck in the old categories might think an unlikely collection : Galbraith , Kristol , Buckley , Podhoretz and Commentary , Daniel Bell and the Public Interest , Bayard Rustin of Social Democrats USA and the New Leader , the social democrats ’ house organ .
And it is not lost on the reader that all these personages and institutions have nothing but praise for Moynihan .
The spirit of the encomiums may be gauged from Galbraith ’s characteristically clubby and “ wonderfully warm ” tribute sent to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the occasion of Moynihan ’s nomination as ambassador to the United Nations : “ my fellow Ambassador to India ; my fellow faculty member [ Harvard , of course ] ; my next - door neighbor ; and though I have no wish to damage him in the eyes of any of the Republican members of the Committee , my fellow Democrat . ”
But through all the treacly , above - the - battle in - groupiness and the opportunistic tergiversations , certain consistent tenets come through , not only within Moynihan ’s career , but also linking Moynihan and his buddies of left , right , and center .
There is , first and foremost , virtually unconditional support for the American state , at home and abroad .
In military and foreign affairs , this means a highly militaristic and aggressively jingoistic foreign policy , a policy well served by Moynihan ’s anti-Soviet and antiThird World bluster at the United Nations .
Moynihan ’s recent attacks on the “ defeatism ” of the Carter administration in its response to Soviet efforts in Africa and strategic arms negotiations were heralded by conservative columnist George Will , who concluded , “ What is at issue is fundamental .
It is the adequacy of the administration ’s policy affecting the safety of the state . ”
In his book Moynihan enthusiastically quotes Buckley ’s call , in his United Nations Journal , to “ concern ourselves with … the order of moral reality . ”
To which Buckley — with Moynihan approving — adds :
This “ is a point that should not separate American conservatives from American liberals , or British and French conservatives from their domestic socialists . ”
The second tenet that guides all of these worthies , whatever their rhetoric or alleged ideology , is all - out , down - the - line support for the state of Israel , regardless of circumstances , and regardless of the politicians or parties in charge there .
Indeed , most of this book is devoted to Moynihan - as - heroic - partisan for Israel , any opposition to which he automatically equates with anti-Semitism .
To make sure no one misses the point , one of the blurbs on the cover is by Chaim Herzog , Israel ’s former ambassador to the United Nations .
It would be no coincidence if Moynihan ’s center - right Democratic constituency were in turn to respond to these themes with an outpouring of political and financial support in his forthcoming senatorial presidential campaigns .
On the domestic front , the state is to be lean and mean , an efficient backstop to the foreign policy of war and global intervention .
Moynihan tells the story of how he first made his mark on the ideological and political scene and , simultaneously , kicked off our current neoconservative mood .
It was in the fall of 1967 , at a meeting of — as luck would have it — the national board of Americans for Democratic Action ( ADA ) .
Moynihan , a member of the board , spoke on " The Politics of Stability . "
An Enemy of the State : ... Justin Raimondo Best Price : $ 68.59 Buy New $ 92.50 ( as of 09:10 EST - Details )
As he tells it : “ I proposed first of all that liberals u2018 see more clearly that their essential interest is in the stability of the social order ' and argued that we needed to make effective alliances with informed conservatives who shared that interest .
We had to learn the limits of the huge hierarchical structures of central government . ”
His speech was hailed at the time by the same seemingly motley crew that has collaborated ever since : John Kenneth Galbraith ( then head of the ADA ) , William F. Buckley , Bayard Rustin , and the New Leader , which printed the full text .
As Moynihan comments : “ Conservatives and social democrats scarcely knew each other at this time .
Yet their concerns were powerfully symmetric and they were looking , I think , for persons of the center who understood them . ”
They did n’t have to look very far .
From then on , Daniel Patrick Moynihan continued to follow his star .
The creed that indissolubly links Moynihan and all of his cohorts , left , right , and center , was well summed up in a scroll presented to Moynihan in June 1975 , on his nomination as ambassador to the United Nations , by the Coalition for a Democratic Majority , the self - appointed voice of the right and center of the Democratic party .
The scroll hailed Moynihan for his devotion to " a strong America in national defense , economic life . ”
In short , for devotion to big American government , at home and abroad .
Symbolism was rife that day in Washington :
The scroll was presented by Bayard Rustin , and the ceremony was presided over by Senator Henry “ Scoop ” Jackson , while the doyen of ADA liberalism , Hubert Humphrey , “ cheered from somewhere , across Washington . ”
The collapse of ideological groups toward the center and toward the American state has even been going on at the farther extremes of the spectrum .
In foreign policy , at least , the Maoists are now ultrahawks , thirsting for war with the Soviet Union , making the Reagans and the Buckleys seem like devoted pacifists .
Much of the former New Left , once so scornful of social democracy a capitulation to corporate liberalism and the New Deal , has either gone back frankly and openly to the Democratic party , or has joined such former enemies as Michael Harrington and Irving Howe in the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee , designed as a left - wing ginger group within the Democratic party .
And now Dale Vree , in the National Review ( Dec. 8 , 1978 ) , writes an astonishingly candid article tracing a possible alliance of “ traditionalist ” conservatives with such socialists as Robert Heilbroner .
Why such an alliance ?
Because Heilbroner , in a symposium on socialism in Howe ’s Dissent magazine , let the cat out of the bag and acknowledged that socialist central planning must include the coercive imposition of a collective moral conformity .
Vree is “ fascinated ” by Heibroner ’s emphasis on “ virtue ” and by his point that “ socialist culture must focus on [ the individual ’s ] … moral or spiritual achievement , ” in contrast to “ bourgeois culture ” which “ is focused on the material achievement of the individual . ”
In the future , the ideals of the collective must override the rights of the individual to pursue his own cultural achievements and lifestyle .
Vree is intrigued by the “ traditionalist ring ” to all this , and he sees in the situation the makings of a new ideological " fusionism , " a fusion of economic and cultural collectivism , of those socialists and traditionalists who are authoritarian in both of these areas ; a fusion , in short , of all those , left , right , or center , who wish to exalt the power of the American state in all aspects of life , personal and economic .
As Vree puts it , “ If the writings of such different socialists as Robert Heilbroner , Christopher Lasch , Morris Janowitz , Midge Decter , and Daniel Bell are indicative of a tendency , we may see the rise of a socialist - traditionalist fusionism . "
And then Vree concludes wistfully : " One wonders if America contains any Tory Socialists ’ on the right side of its aisle who will go out to embrace them . "
Well of course it does : the man who once called Richard Nixon the American Disraeli .
Something happened to Richard Nixon on the way to his canonization .
But we still have Daniel Patrick Moynihan  bully , buffoon , mountebank , Zionist , castle Irishman , left - wing conservative , right - wing social democrat , and fugleman for the American state .

The people -- excuse me , scientists -- from the German drug giant Boehringer - Ingelheim will soon be presenting their new panty - dropping pill to the FDA .
The pill is called flibanserin .
America 's media remains clueless , as they keep referring to it as the " pink Viagra . "
Viagra works below the belt to help the penis have more of the chemicals it needs to get hard .
It does n't concern itself with whether a man wants to have or not .
The German panty - dropping pill works very differently .
It assumes the woman 's pelvic plumbing is just fine .
Its job is to turn her feeling of " ho - hum " into " I 've gotta have it , " although its effects are much more subtle and it's not going to dramatically change anyone 's sex life .
Unlike Viagra , the women needs to take it every day of every month , and unlike Viagra , flibanserin operates on the woman 's brain and could potentially impact her thought processes .
As for the hurdles Boehringer - Ingelheim has to clear with their new panty - dropping pill , I will focus on two areas : Placebo Effects and College Coeds .
PLACEBO EFFECTS .
It 's the darndest thing about sex , but sugar pills tend to be incredibly effective in curing what ails you .
If you tell someone with sexual issues that the you are about to give them might actually be the drug of their , the chances are good they will report that the pill increased their sexual satisfaction , at least while the study is still going on .
This will be one of the first things that the German giant 's marketing people - - uh , scientists -- will need to convince the FDA of : that their new pill will cause more panties to drop than sugar pills .
Naturally , they wo n't ask the obvious questions that you or I might , such as : how does it compare to a vacation when you are working a fulltime job and raising kids , or to having friendly conversations and fun when that 's been missing from your relationship , or to having a new lover when your partner feels like an old friend or roommate .
How does it compare to a few sessions of ?
And if only 1 % or 2 % of women with low desire actually need to take a pill for it , how do you know which ones ?
I could go on and on about the scientific rigor needed to prove whether flibanserin actually works and for whom .
Mercifully , I 'll just say that the FDA is no stranger to companies using creative methodologies in an attempt to prove that their product achieves statistical significance .
COLLEGE COEDS : Equally as important as the placebo issue -- and this is one where I feel that Boehringer - Ingelheim should have their genitals held to the fire -- is in proving that flibanserin is safe when surreptitiously dropped into a young woman 's beer or soda at a college fraternity party .
This was never a concern about Viagra , given that most young men have boners that work better than their brains .
However , I believe that regardless of whether flibanserin actually works or not , it will likely share the date - rape - drug throne with Ambien .
As a result , it better be safe when given to a woman who already has high levels of in her system , or when it 's slipped into the beverage of a woman who is diabetic , stoned or is taking prescription medications .
Perhaps providing flibanserin in patches rather than pills would be wise , given how patches probably float in beer better than pills .
( This would assume flibanserin can be delivered transdermally . )
Either way , it would be pure insanity to not assume that spiking drinks or nachos at college parties will be an anticipated abuse of this prescription drug , regardless of how slow - acting it might be .
As for my own history with Boehringer - Ingelheim , in late 2008 I was contacted by their manager of regional medicine " to talk about potential areas of educational and scientific . "
This went nowhere fast .
The Boehringer - Ingelheim manager said she wanted " to exchange scientific and disease - specific , ( rather than product - focused ) information . "
If applied to flibanserin , this kind of approach would pose another hurdle for Boehringer - Ingelheim , as it begs the question of whether Boehringer - Ingelheim believes that female sexual desire should be regarded as a disease .
If so , a woman who wants sex with her partner is disease free , but if she 's lost her desire for him , she needs to take a pill .
So the question would be , how often is loss of desire like a disease which has a physiological cause , and how often is it situational , where it might be due to , overwork , boredom , money issues , or a lack of communication and romance in the relationship ?
You can be sure Boehringer - Ingelheim or their drug reps will market flibanserin in such a way that every woman who has stopped feeling sexually attracted to her partner will feel she needs a prescription for it , so it better make sense for every woman whether the cause of her low desire is physiological or situational .
On the brighter side , I do have my own marketing plan for flibanserin .
I think Boehringer - Ingelheim should make flibanserin in three different strengths : Flibanserin - Light , Flibanserin - Regular and Flibanserin - Super :
" FLIBANSERIN -LIGHT will increase your chances of getting a hand job by 7 % more than placebo , and 3 % more than a fun evening together that includes a nice dinner and lots of conversation . "
" FLIBANSERIN -REGULAR will increase your chances of getting a blow job by 3 % more than placebo , and 1 % more than a fun evening together that includes a nice dinner and lots of conversation . "
" FLIBANSERIN - SUPER will increase your chances of getting vaginal intercourse by 8 % more than placebo , and 2 % more than a fun evening together that includes a nice dinner and lots of conversation . "
I 'd also make sure that every ad for flibanserin would include a pair of panties that appeared as though they had been tossed there by a woman in the throes of sexual passion .
NOTE : A colleague just let me know that she would want evidence showing that this particular class of drugs does not increase including compulsive shopping or gambling , although the enconomy could certainly use a bit of the former .
She would also want to know about the addictive potential of this class of drugs , as it may have a high potential for that .
The illustration of the kissing couple is by Daerick Gross Sr .
Ever wonder why you see this look again and again on celebs , in ads , in magazines ?
Because , done right , it makes every woman look longer and leaner .
Most flattering : straight - leg or boot - cut jeans that sit on your hips ( as opposed to at your waist or below your hipbone ) and cover your instep when you 're in heels .

The Motorola Droid continues to be the king of Android devices that include a hardware keyboard , and the smartphone which bore the Android flagship crown for some time before the Nexus One .
Meanwhile , the Nokia N900 runs Maemo linux 5 - the operating system which - with polish and joint collaboration with intel - will soon emerge as MeeGo and power a host of Moorestown - packing devices .
We 're doing something a bit irregular by reviewing both phones in one article , but that 's again because they 're both running on the same Texas Instruments OMAP3 SoC .
Let ’s dive into both phones and see how they fare .
Motorola Droid - Still Does
As you probably already know , the Motorola Droid marked a turning point for Motorola , for Verizon ’s smartphone lineup , and quite possibly a coming of age for Android as the first shipping smartphone with a mature 2.0 release .
It wowed the market when it debuted Google Navigation , but puzzled everyone with its initial lack of multitouch support inside all official Google apps - despite packing a full multitouch digitizer .
Since launch , the Moto Droid has and will continue to see continual incremental updates .
First , the Android 2.1 update added multitouch to the browser , gallery , and google maps , along with a number of other improvements brought alongside the entire platform update .
At Google I/ O 2010 , we ’ve now learned that the Moto Droid will see another update to Android 2.2 before year ’s end - bringing a promised 2 - 5 x speed boost to Android ’s Dalvik virtual machine with a new JIT compiler , full in - browser Flash 10.1 in addition to Adobe Air support , cloud - to - device push APIs , OS - level WiFi tethering , and browser speed increases among other features .
It ’s obvious that despite the recent release of the HTC Incredible , the Moto Droid will continue to hold a place in Verizon ’s growing lineup of Android smartphones - and likely at a lower price point than HTC ’s new flagship .
Currently , Verizon is offering a buy one get one free Motorola Droid promption with purchase and a 2 - year contract .
The Droid ’s chief differentiating factor ( other than likely continued lower price point ) is the hardware keyboard .
For so many , having a hardware keyboard is still a fundamentally important feature , though virtual keyboards are n’t as bad as they used to be - and they ’re getting better .
As an aside , it ’s amazing how quickly ‘ Big Red ’ Verizon turned its lineup around and became host to so much Android hardware .
Nokia N900 - a ‘ mobile computer ’
There ’s no doubt about it - the Nokia N900 is a unique beast .
In fact , it ’s that uniqueness which makes it a difficult sell for all but the most hardcore smartphone consumers , but also potentially the most powerful .
The N900 is a landscape QWERTY slider with a 3.5 ” resistive LCD , front and back facing cameras , 3G HSPA for T - Mobile bands , and runs the debian derivative Maemo 5 OS .
I think it ’s a fair argument to make that the N900 has n’t received as much love state - side as it has abroad , or rightfully deserves .
That ’s probably due in part to only being sold unlocked with no subsidy , by no specific carrier ( though it is targeted at T - Mobile for 3G support , and will work with 2.5G EDGE on AT&T ) , for $ 499 at retailers like Amazon .
But it is n’t just Nokia grappling with that issue - Google recently learned how hard of a sell unsubsidized , bring your own plan schemes are with its Nexus One .
In general , it ’s hard to sell people on a $ 500 + smartphone if they can’t try the device beforehand , or get carrier support .
That aside , the N900 is likely the final evolution in a long chain of internet tablets designed by Nokia - starting with the N770 in 2005 .
Maemo linux has been as open as open source can be since the very beginning ; its application manager started as little more than an APT frontend .
If you prefer , it can even still be used that way from the XTerm terminal with an apt - get install .
It ’s a platform that ’s been adorned and worshiped as the ultimate linux smartphone platform by hardcore * nix nerds ever since , and I intend to do it justice .
Illinois 's pension fund is deep in the hole and getting deeper every year .
The state 's reaction never changes : borrow money and hope the returns beat the cost of borrowing .
Former governor Rod Blagojevich tried that to the tune of $ 10 billion and it worked out less than spectacularly to say the least .
Nonetheless Illinois is back at it for 2010 .
Please consider Emperor has no clothes : Pensions are short cash
Illinois politicians are at it again .
They 're borrowing from the future to make state pension contributions today .
In early January , while everyone was busy watching the nasty campaign commercials , the State of Illinois pulled an end -run on the budget process .
On Jan. 7 the state sold $ 3.5 billion of " pension obligation notes . "
In simple English , the state borrowed money to finance the state 's contribution to its five retirement systems .
The money raised will go to shore up the Teachers Retirement System , which is scheduled to receive $ 2.08 billion of the proceeds , and the Illinois State Universities Retirement System , which will get $ 702.5 million from the bond offering .
The Illinois State Board of Investment gets nearly $ 813 million for funds , including the Illinois State Employees ' Retirement System , and the Judges Retirement System , and -- big surprise -- the Illinois General Assembly Retirement System .
In November 2009 , the state 's Pension Modernization Task Force sent its recommendations to Gov. Quinn .
The Task Force concluded that Illinois ' unfunded pension liability exceeds $ 61 billion !
And that number is growing exponentially .
[ Note : Projections have it at $ 89 billion by the end of the fiscal year - See below Mish ]
The report lays out the problem clearly :
" Not wanting to implement dramatic cuts in spending on essential services , the legislature and various governors elected to instead divert revenue from making the required employer pension contribution to maintaining services like education , health care , public safety and caring for disadvantaged populations .
Effectively , the state used the pension systems as a credit card to fund ongoing service operations . "
Illinois now has public debt of more than $ 130 BILLION .
Unlike the federal government , our state cannot simply create new money to pay its bills .
At some point -- and that point is very near -- investors will no longer be willing to lend money that can not be repaid .
Perversely , the problem is so huge that our politicians wo n't acknowledge this true " elephant in the room . "
So let me say it loud and clear : The Emperor Has No Clothes .
Illinois is Broke .
And there 's no way public pensions will be paid -- unless huge changes are made .
And that 's The Savage Truth .
Illinois Is Broke
By July , Illinois will be $ 130,000,000,000 in debt .
This crushing load hampers the state ’s ability to fund public schools and universities , health care , and other essential public services .
Most of that money is owed to the state ’s pension funds and retiree health care plans .
And YOUR SHARE of that debt is $ 25,000 per household .
How did this happen ?
Basically , Illinois spends $ 3 for every $ 2 it takes in .
Only in Springfield is this kind of math possible .
The state accomplishes this by borrowing or by simply ignoring its unpaid bills .
And it has been doing so for years .
Pension Underfunding
Illinois Budget Gap
California Here We Come Right Back Where We Started From
Last year , California furloughed state workers , froze spending on public works projects and issued IOUs to state contractors , becoming the poster child for fiscal disasters undercutting state budgets across the country .
This year 's forecast : more of the same_ unless Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and state lawmakers learn to get along .
" Here we go again , " said state Controller John Chiang , warning lawmakers that the state will run low on cash this spring unless they make adjustments in the weeks ahead .
California is falling $ 6 billion short of the revenue it needs to fund basic programs in the current fiscal year and is projected to be short by another $ 14 billion in the fiscal year that starts July 1 .
The emergency budget session , called by Schwarzenegger , will not tackle the entire $ 20 billion deficit that is projected over the next year and a half .
It will target the $ 6 billion shortfall in the current year , leaving longer - term funding for core services such as public schools , colleges and health services in a state of uncertainty .
Democrats are searching for ways to sidestep the rule that requires a two - thirds vote of the Legislature for tax increases and to pass state budgets .
The state 's largest teachers union is backing an initiative to close business tax loopholes .

Designing a RESTful Web Application
This blog entry is my attempt to get all the concepts of RESTful web service design straight .
By Ryan McGreal
I 'm working on a couple of projects that involve building a web service , and I decided early on that because of our business constraints - having to communicate with a variety of different systems of varying levels of sophistication - it made sense to keep the web service as simple and accessible as possible .
That pointed me toward designing a RESTful web service that transmits data in a simple format over straight HTTP .
After all , just about any programming language imaginable can make an HTTP request .
I also decided to go with JSON for the data format , in part because I 've been experimenting lately with CouchDB and appreciate both the simplicity and flexibility of JSON and the fact that you can find a JSON parser for any language .
This blog entry is my attempt to get all the concepts of RESTful web service design straight .
There 's a good chance that some of this information is wrong ; and if you notice something , please let me know about it .
I 'll investigate your argument and update the essay as applicable .
With that in mind , here we go .
2 Representational State Transfer ↑
Representational State Transfer , or REST , is a model for designing networked software systems based around clients and servers .
In a RESTful system , a client makes a request for a resource on a server , and the server issues a response that includes a representation of the resource .
The concept was formalized in 2000 by Roy Fielding , one of the architects of Hypertext Transfer Protocol ( HTTP ) , about more which below , in his doctoral dissertation .
It is not surprising , then , that REST and HTTP mesh very smoothly .
A RESTful client - server system is stateless , meaning each request against the server contains all the information the server needs to process it ; and cacheable , in that the server can specify whether and for how long resource representations can be cached either locally on the client or on intermediate servers between the client and the server .
3 Hypertext Transfer Protocol ↑
Hypertext Transfer Protocol ( HTTP ) is a stateless protocol based on a client requesting a resource across a network and the server providing a response .
As such , an HTTP transaction entails a request and a response .
The request goes from the client to the server , and the response goes from the server back to the client .
An HTTP request has three parts :
The request line , which includes the HTTP method ( or " verb " ) , the uniform resource identifier ( URI ) , and the HTTP version .
E.g. GET / articles /1/ HTTP/1.1
One or more optional HTTP headers , which are key / value pairs that characterize the data being requested and / or provided .
An optional message body , which is data being sent from the client to the server as part of the request .
An HTTP response also has three parts :
The HTTP status code , indicating the status of the requested URI , e.g. HTTP/1.1 200 OK
One or more optional HTTP headers , which are key / value pairs that characterize the data being provided .
An optional message body , which is the data being returned to the client in response to the request .
HTTP deals in resources .
Each URI points to a resource on the server .
Think of URIs as nouns , not verbs , with one URI for each resource .
For example , if you want to add the ability to create an article , it might be tempting to create a URI called / create_article .
This is wrong , because it conflates the object ( the resource ) and the action ( creation ) .
Instead , it makes more sense to have a resource called / articles and a method that lets you create articles .
HTTP defines several methods , or " verbs " , to execute on a resource : HEAD , GET , POST , PUT , DELETE , TRACE , OPTIONS , CONNECT , and PATCH .
However , the following four are most commonly used in web services :
To retrieve a resource , issue an HTTP GET request .
GET requests are idempotent ( see below ) , which means making a GET request multiple times does not cause any change in the resource that is requested .
GET requests do not include a message body , but GET responses usually do .
To submit data to be processed , issue an HTTP POST request .
POST requests require a message body , i.e. the data to be processed .
For example , if there is a resource called / articles and you want to add a new article , issue a POST request to /articles with the content .
The server will create a new subsidiary URI under / articles - for example , / articles / 9001 - and assign that URI to the content you sent with your POST request .
Important note : POST requests are not idempotent ( see below ) , meaning multiple POST requests will create multiple resources with unique identifiers .
To place content at an existing resource , issue an HTTP PUT request .
For example , if there is a URI / articles / 9001 and you want to replace the content served at that URI , issue a PUT request to that URI with the new content .
Important note : PUT requests are idempotent , i.e. issuing 1 or 5 or 50 identical PUT requests will have the same effect on the resource .
PUT requests must include a message body ( the resource to be placed at the URL ) .
To remove a resource ( and remove its accompanying URI ) , issue an HTTP DELETE request .
DELETE requests should be idempotent , i.e. issuing 1 or 5 or 50 identical DELETE requests will delete exactly one resource .
DELETE requests do not require a message body .
This funny - looking word is crucial to designing an effective web service .
A request is idempotent if issuing it more than once does not change the resource state beyond issuing it just once .
Read that again if you have to .
For example , a DELETE request is idempotent if the first request deletes a resource at a URI , and the second request does nothing because the resource at that URI is already deleted .
For another example , a PUT request is idempotent if the first request updates a resource at a URI , and the second request updates the same resource in the same way at the same URI .
A request is not idempotent if issuing it more than once does change the resource .
For example , a POST request to add a comment to a document is not idempotent , if issuing the POST request twice adds the comment twice ( so that the document contains two identical comments with separate URLs ) .
My original understanding of HTTP methods was that you would use PUT to create a resource and POST to update it .
This seems in keeping with common sense , but it breaks down when you apply the all - important filter of idempotence .
An interesting discussion on Stack Overflow tackles this issue , but what convinced me to change my mental model was this observation :
POST creates a child resource , so POST to /items creates a resources that lives under the /items resource .
Eg. / items/1 .
PUT is for creating or updating something with a known URL .
This collision between the inclination to regard PUT as creating and POST as updating is a significant source of confusion about how to well - design a RESTful system , and deserves more attention .
Furthermore , it 's tempting to assume that the HTTP verbs line up precisely with the SQL CRUD verbs , but while they 're superficially similar , they 're not identical .
Treating them as such leads to this kind of gotcha .
It 's important to keep the logic of HTTP methods separate from the logic of SQL queries , and to develop specialized appropriate logic between the two domains that ensures the data processing on the server produces responses that satisfy the requirements of the HTTP methods ( particularly in respect to idempotence ) .
6 Conceiving the Web Service : A Resource / Method Table ↑
At a conceptual level , a RESTful web service API is a matrix of resources and methods that exposes the functionality of the service to third party applications .
Below is an example of what that matrix might look like .
Again , note well that actions are not mapped to URIs .
A resource is an object , a noun , and the action inheres to the HTTP Verb , not to the URI .
As a result , the same resource URI can serve different responses ( corresponding with different actions ) depending on the HTTP Verb .
REST Resource / Action Matrix Request Server Action Response Idempotent Resource Parameters Method Data / articles GET makes a list of articles returns a list of articles Yes / articles POST article details creates a new article returns confirmation and id No / articles / id GET gets article details returns article details
Yes / articles / id PUT new article details updates article details returns confirmation and updated article details
Yes / articles / id DELETE deletes an article returns confirmation of deleted article Yes
This is the RESTful way to organize a web service : URIs are objects and HTTP Verbs are actions performed on those objects .
7 HTTP Response Data Formats ↑
Every web server is also a RESTful web service , accepting GET and POST requests to particular resources , and then performing actions and serving data in response .
A conventional web server delivers its data in HTML format ( text / html ) , with related Javascript ( text / javascript ) , CSS ( text / css ) and image files .
HTML is an excellent format for marking up textual data for human use , but it has very limited expressive power for structuring data beyond simple documents .
The most common formats used to transmit structured data across HTTP are XML and JSON , with an honourable mention for YAML .
XML , or eXtensible Markup Language , is a markup ( i.e. tag ) based syntax based on SGML for formatting structured , text - based data .
XML is a format in which to create domain specific markup languages that define particular data structures .
For example , RSS and Atom are XML language standards defined to structure documents published to websites so that the documents can be ' syndicated ' to feed readers and third party sites for display .
Likewise , the default underlying structure of Microsoft Office documents since Office 2007 is an XML language called OOXML .
XML structures data by defining elements , properties , data types and allowable nesting rules in an XML schema called a Document Type Definition , or DTD .
A given XML document specifies which DTD schema should define its structure with a Document Type Declaration , or DOCTYPE .
A given XML document can reference multiple DTDs by using namespaces .
Here is a sample XML file containing contact information about a person , taken from Wikipedia .
John Smith 25 21 2nd Street New York NY 10021 212 555-1234 646 555-4567
XML must be :
Well - formed - elements are properly nested , tags are properly closed and match case , special characters are escaped , and Unicode characters are encoded ; and
Valid - its elements and attributes match the rules defined in the DTD .
An XML Language called XSLT can be used to map XML documents into other markup languages , e.g. HTML .
XML is in wide use in applications that transfer structured data over the internet .
JSON , or " JavaScript Object Notation " , is a lightweight data format introduced in 2001 by Douglas Crockford .
Pronounced " Jason " , JSON is based on JavaScript object literal notation , a syntax for creating objects in JavaScript by literally describing their properties and methods .
Here is the JSON equivalent to the XML code in the previous section .
{ " firstName " : " John " , " lastName " : " Smith " , " age " : 25 , " address " : { " streetAddress " : " 21 2nd Street " , " city " : " New York " , " state " : " NY " , " postalCode " : " 10021 " } , " phoneNumber " : [ { " type " : " home " , " number " : " 212 555-1234 " } , { " type " : " fax " , " number " : " 646 555-4567 " } ] }
While the XML above contained 367 characters ( not including indentation ) , the equivalent JSON contains only 272 characters - only three - quarters as large .
JSON supports lists ( ordered sets of values ) and dictionaries ( unordered collections of key / value pairs ) with arbitrary nesting and various data types : number , string , boolean , list , * object and null .
Like XML , JSON is also in wide use in applications that transfer structured data over the internet .
A major advantage over XML is that the syntax is much simpler and less verbose , which makes it lighter across networks as well as more human - readable .
Mature JSON parsers are available for a wide range of programming languages in addition to JavaScript .
Python , for example , includes a json parser as part of its standard library ( as of version 2.6 ; earlier versions can use the third - party simplejson library ) .
A decent JSON parser converts an object back and forth between the programming language 's native data types and their JSON equivalents .
That way , an application can receive a JSON object , convert it into a native object , process it natively , and then convert the final result back to JSON to be dispatched elsewhere .
YAML , pronounced to rhyme with " camel " , is a recursive acronym meaning " YAML Ain't Markup Language " .
Whereas JSON is a more minimal data format than XML , YAML takes minimalism to an extreme , eschewing quotation marks , brackets and curly braces altogether in favour of significant indentation and line breaks .
The YAML equivalent to the XML and JSON contact examples above would be :
firstName : John lastName : Smith age : 25 address : streetAddress : 21 2nd Street city : New York state : NY postalCode : 10021 phoneNumber : - type : home number : 212 555-1234 - type : fax number : 646 555-4567
That works out to just 239 characters - including the significant white space .
8 REST Best Practices ↑
A RESTful web API ought to be discoverable by its users .
One crucial way to do that is by making sure that each resource in your API includes URLs to subsidiary URLs .

EUROZONE DEFICIT : FULL DATA DownloadDeficit and surplus figures for the eurozone and the UK [ 25 kb ]
EU rules say that countries using the euro are not allowed to have an annual deficit of more than 3 % of GDP , but several countries have failed to keep to that rule in recent years .
Note that Germany , Italy and France were all among the first countries to break the Maastricht rule during the last decade , while Spain and the Republic of Ireland ran surpluses before the 2008 crisis .
Since 2008 , peripheral economies such as Spain , Greece and Portugal have run big deficits , because their economies have slumped , generating less tax revenues and requiring more unemployment benefit payments .
Ireland experienced an exceptionally enormous deficit of 31 % of its GDP in 2010 , largely due to the cost of rescuing its banks .
Italy , however , has faired surprisingly well .
In fact , if you exclude the cost of interest payments on its enormous debts ( which the graph does not ) , the Italian government has consistently run budget surpluses .

Anchorman : The Legend of Ron Burgundy ( 2004 ) 69 of 88
The Metropolitan Transit Authority boasts that it moves over 5 million people a day , but how many people does it really move ?
Last week it served that purpose for Young Min , 24 , who packed up stuff from a Korean homestead in Flushing , Queens , and moved it all to a one - bedroom on the Upper West Side — using only the subway .
While easy on his wallet , the move turned out to be hard on his friendships :
To help him get all of his belongings from one place to the other , Min enlisted two friends from his language school .
Together they moved his air conditioner , collapsible double - rod closet , dishes ( including serving platters and utensils ) , laptop , linen , quilts , books , clothes , and assorted framed pictures , a soup cauldron , Korean medicine , condiments , and a 40 - pound bag of rice onto the 7 train , then to Times Square , through the Times Square Station to the 1 train , and finally to the new place on West 64th .
( Mid-trip , the air conditioner broke through the trunk holding it . )
The next day , when he called for help moving his bed , again on the subway , his friends did n’t return his calls and one even skipped their Kaplan class in order to avoid getting roped into another move .
Min says he left assorted items at the homestead including a TV and a wooden dresser .
“ I do want my TV but it ’s too hard , ” he told Intel .
“ I do n’t want to go back .
I ca n’t ask anyone else to help .
They told everyone how hard it was and so there ’s no one else to ask . ”
When JG Ballard was pressed in 1982 on whether he would donate his manuscripts , letters and notebooks to a national collection for posterity his answer was clear .
" There are no Ballard archives , " he said .
Yesterday , a little over a year after the author 's death from prostate cancer , the British Library revealed a treasure - trove of an archive that had been carefully – and secretly – preserved by Ballard .
The collection of manuscripts , notes , rough drafts – often repeatedly amended – as well as school reports , and material from the Shanghai camp in which he was interned by the Japanese with his parents during the Second World War – may come as as shock to scholars who had taken him at his word , and will doubtless shed new light on one of the most visionary British writers of the 20th century .
In its present state – as it sits uncatalogued in 15 bulky boxes of manuscripts , notebooks filled with hastily jotted ideas for future novels , science fiction magazines in which his first short stories were printed , including one in which the germ of the idea for his novel , Empire of the Sun , appeared – its secrets have yet to be revealed .
The archive , given as a gift by Ballard 's daughters , Fay and Bea , in lieu of £ 350,000 inheritance tax , has already provided a glimpse into the creative processes of the author , whose manuscripts show how fervently he re-drafted , time and time again , until he was happy with the final outcome .
Ballard told his daughters where they could find his manuscripts at his home in Shepperton , Middlesex , before he died last April .
Intensely modest by nature , Fay recalled that he was surprised by the idea that the British Library may want his archive .
" He was very modest .
We had several conversations about the material and he said , ' do you think they would be interested , darling ? ' " she said .
Jamie Andrews , head of modern literary manuscripts at the British Library , said there was an extraordinary wealth of material in Ballard 's collection including , most amusingly , a school report from when he was a 16 - year - old student which noted the usual complaint that " he could do better " but also acknowledged his rich imagination and the fact that he was at the top of the class in English .
There were also notebooks in which he jotted down thoughts and ideas .
Video : JG Ballard archive
One of the most remarkable things about the manuscripts for his novels , added Mr Andrews , was the level of revision to his writing .
" There was very full evidence that he did a lot of reworking and Tippexing .
The first draft was predominantly handwritten and then he would type up these pages , which have been thoroughly revised .
Some of these individual pages are works of art in themselves ; you see a determination and a violence in the way things have been accrued ....
The cutting down and corrections , it was furious .
Everything had to be hacked off , everything had to be worked out , " he said .
Ballard lost his wife in 1964 after she caught pneumonia on a family holiday in Spain and died within a few days .
At the time , he was a writer in his 30s , alone with three small children – Jim , nine , Fay , seven , and Bea , five .
But he took single parenthood in his stride while continuing with his writing , and his children remember him as a kind and dedicated father .
His children played in the nursery while he wrote in his study , but he still found time to iron their school uniforms and cook meals .
" We had a pact and would leave him alone for a few hours , but we could not resist slipping through his door to ask questions .
He would be in the middle of composing a sentence , mouthing out the words as he wrote , " said Bea Ballard .
Ballard had lived through a great deal in his life ; he had been interned by the Japanese in a prisoner - of - war camp between the ages of 12 and 14 , an experience that inspired Empire of the Sun , decades later .
For two decades after his internment , he sought to forget the traumatic experience but then found himself drawn back .
He began writing to others connected to the camp , asking for items that could help with background research for Empire of the Sun .
He had kept some material from his boyhood , including a detailed map of the camp , and as an adult , he amassed minutes from the meetings that took place there , a register of those who had been interned there , which included the names of his parents , and a graph which illustrated the paltry intake of calories that prisoners were given each day .
An extraordinary life
Ballard 's 1947 spring term school report
After the turmoil and danger of wartime in Shanghai , Ballard returned to England to complete his education at The Leys School in Cambridge .
The 16 - year - old Ballard 's prowess in English was spotted by his fifth - form teacher who wrote : " He has remarkable ability and general knowledge . "
However , the teacher added : " With greater concentration , his work could be even better . "
Lunghua internment camp blueprint , September 1943
From 1943 , Ballard and his family were interned in Lunghua camp , outside Shanghai .
Later in his life , he was sent original documentation relating to life in the camp that had been collected and saved by the wife of the English chairman of the internees ' committee .
This plan of the camp shows Block G where the Ballard family were allocated one small room .
Heavily revised typescript of ' Crash '
The dark tone of the 1973 novel appears to be matched by the heavy , almost violent layers of corrections and revisions evident in this draft of the controversial novel , writes Jamie Andrews , from The British Library .
Ballard would habitually begin a complete draft by hand , before moving to a second , typewritten version which would be further revised by hand .
Handwritten manuscript of ' Empire of the Sun '
Well I can see why the tag " #neocolonialism " might be applied here .
I guess it would stop being neocolonialism if it was African firms building these things primarily for Africa 's use and then selling the excess energy to Europe for a profit .
Sigh .
I hope that day comes soon .
Experts are turning up some eye - opening trend lines in Alvin Greene 's ( left ) victory over Vic Rawl .
| Composite image by POLITICO Experts review S.C. Senate ballots
The campaign of defeated Democratic Senate candidate Vic Rawl has assembled a team of national academic experts to review Tuesday ’s perplexing South Carolina primary results that propelled a virtually unknown , underfunded and unemployed candidate to the party ’s nomination over a veteran officeholder and public official .
Rawl campaign manager Walter Ludwig tells POLITICO three different teams of experts in election data analysis are combing through the results in the state ’s 46 counties and already turning up some eye - opening trend lines .
Advertisement
The review is in response to the shocking victory by 32 - year - old Alvin Greene , who , despite never giving a campaign speech or running any television or radio ads , managed to handily defeat Rawl 59 percent to 41 percent .
The state party chairwoman has already asked Greene to step aside , and Rep. Jim Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) has speculated that he might be a Republican plant .
Greene has pledged to remain in the race and said he has “ always been a Democrat . ”
While Ludwig cautioned that the campaign is not jumping to any conclusions , he said the experts , who volunteered their services , have already uncovered some “ curious ” findings in the election data .
One potential red flag : A significant difference between the results of absentee and election day ballots .
According to Ludwig , of the state ’s 46 counties , half have a disparity of greater than 10 percentage points between the absentee and election day ballots .
“ The election day ballots all favor Mr. Greene .
We do n’t know what it means , ” Ludwig said in an interview .
“ We did significantly better on absentees than Election Day , which is according to the mathematicians , quite significant .
The other reason is , it did n’t happen in any other races on the ballot . ”
In Lancaster County , Rawl won absentee ballots over Greene by a staggering 84 percent to 16 percent margin ; but Greene easily led among Election Day voters by 17 percentage points .
In Spartanburg County , Ludwig said there are 25 precincts in which Greene received more votes than were actually cast and 50 other precincts where votes appeared to be missing from the final count .
“ In only two of 88 precincts , do the number of votes Greene got plus the number we got equal the total cast , ” Ludwig said .
Greene also racked up a 75 percent or greater margin in one - seventh of all precincts statewide , a mark that Ludwig notes is even difficult for an incumbent to reach .
“ This may add up to nothing .
This all could be a clerical error .
We do n’t know , but [ we ] thought it was worth looking into , ” said Ludwig , who added that the experts doing the unpaid research asked that their names not be revealed until they disclose their conclusions .
Ludwig said the experts could be prepared to offer their findings by late Friday but cautioned that it ’s likely not to be definitive .
“ These are not detectives , they look at huge amounts of election data that say this does n’t look like it should , or it does , ” he said .
Asked what else could explain Greene ’s unlikely rise , Ludwig appeared at a loss .
He said the Rawl campaign sent 300,000 e-mails , conducted a quarter million robocalls and logged nearly 17,000 miles to Democratic events around the state .
“ I was tracking the guy everywhere and there was nothing to track .
Am I kicking myself in the ass ?
Sure .
I ’m just not sure what we would ’ve done different , ” he said .
There 's to be a major reshaping and expansion of high performance sport in New Zealand with an $ 80 million funding boost by 2013 .
Total funding in three years will be more than $ 60 million a year , compared with the current annual allocation of $ 42 million .
There 'll be $ 10 million in new budget funding rising to $ 15 million by 2012 and $ 20 million a year after that .
The government 's also announced its sporting funding body SPARC will have a new high performance institute with a $ 40 million expansion of the Millennium institute on the North Shore , with the government contributing $ 15 million .
A new series of satellite facilities at QE2 Park in Christchurch , Lake Karapiro and Takapuna will also be established , as well as a second cycling velodrome at a venue that 's yet to be decided .
The outgoing New Zealand Olympic committee secretary general Barry Maister says for a change there 's funding certainty .
They call it the dead - man feature .
In the spartan , phone - booth - size motorman ’s cab in a subway train , there is a metal arm a few inches long called the controller .
To set the train in motion , the operator presses down on the controller arm with several pounds of pressure , swivels it and holds on .
If he lets go , for whatever reason , the emergency brakes are applied .
This is the dead - man feature .
It has been part of every New York City subway train for as long as there have been New York City subway trains , according to New York City Transit .
On Wednesday , it worked .
At 8:08 a.m. , at the Long Island City - Court Square Station in Queens , the northern terminus of the G line , Domenick Occhiogrosso turned a lever on the ancient - looking black console , depressed the controller and eased the crowded train out of the station .
His first stop was to be 21st Street , barely a quarter - mile away .
The train was not even completely out of the station when it ground to a halt .
The conductor walked to the front car and found Mr. Occhiogrosso — who had spent the past 23 years of his working life in a train cab — unconscious .
LONDON / VENICE , Louisiana ( Reuters ) - Britain stuck up for beleaguered BP Plc on Friday against American criticism over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , while the company ramped up efforts to siphon more crude from its gushing well .
British Prime Minister David Cameron and his finance minister George Osborne stressed the London - based company was economically important to both Britain and the United States .
The British government ’s backing helped boost BP shares , which have been battered this week as the Obama administration ratcheted up criticism of the company over the 53 - day - old spill , the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history .
Millions of gallons of oil have poured into the Gulf since an April 20 explosion on an offshore rig killed 11 workers and ruptured BP ’s deep - sea well .
U.S. scientists on Thursday doubled their estimate of the amount of oil flowing from the well .
BP has been capturing oil from the leaking well since installing a containment system , or cap , last week .
It is moving a second ship to the spill site to enable it to increase the amount of oil it is siphoning from the well “ toward the end of June , ” the Obama administration ’s point man for the disaster , Admiral Thad Allen , said .
Under U.S. government direction , BP also plans to nearly double its oil - collecting capacity by mid-July .
The upgraded oil collection system could potentially siphon up to 50,000 barrels a day , Allen said .
The well will not be sealed until August , when two relief wells now being drilled are due to be completed .
In the meantime , an unknown amount of oil still gushes forth .
Energy Secretary Steven Chu told Reuters that BP ’s latest effort to capture the leaking oil had not made the spill dramatically worse , dispelling fears of government scientists that it could increase the flow of crude by up to 20 percent .
“ The estimates of 20 percent or more are incorrect , ” Chu said .
Obama administration officials have threatened to increase BP ’s liabilities for the spill , which is causing an ecological and economic disaster along the U.S. Gulf Coast .
U.S. lawmakers are also pressuring the company to suspend its dividend to ensure it has enough cash to pay for cleaning up the mess .
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday BP should be subjected to unlimited liability costs and should pay all damage claims before issuing the dividend .
BP is considering putting money for the dividend in an escrow account until the full scale of the company ’s liabilities can be determined , the Times of London reported , quoting people familiar with the situation .
It said BP board members were discussing a plan to defer the second quarter dividend , due to be announced on July 27 .
A BP spokesman told Reuters the company was considering all options but no decision had been made .
Meanwhile , oil drilling firm Transocean Ltd. resolved its spat with the Obama administration over its bid to limit its liability in the sinking of its rig , which triggered the spill , according to court papers filed on Friday .
HIGH -LEVEL DIPLOMACY
British Prime Minister Cameron spoke to BP Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg and expressed frustration about the damage caused by the spill , a spokesman for Cameron said .

“ He ( the prime minister ) said that it is in everyone ’s interests that BP continues to be a financially strong and stable company , ” the spokesman said .
Osborne , Britain ’s chancellor of the exchequer , said after speaking to BP CEO Tony Hayward , “ The prime minister is also clear that we need constructive solutions and that we remember the economic value BP brings to people in Britain and America . ”
Forty percent of BP ’s shareholders are in the United States , with the same percentage based in Britain .
Business leaders , politicians and newspapers have pressed Cameron to defend BP against the Obama administration , whose criticism of the British company has been portrayed in British media as Britain - bashing .
Slideshow ( 36 images )
Cameron , who took office in May , is due to discuss the Gulf of Mexico crisis with Obama in a telephone call at 11 a.m. EDT on Saturday .
The call will be a tricky test for the two leaders .
Both are under pressure to appear tough to voters at home .
Obama , criticized by some in the United States over his handling of the crisis , has been seeking to direct public anger and frustration over the spill toward BP .
For his part , Cameron must show Britons that he is not caving in to pressure from his country ’s most powerful ally .
A spokeswoman for Cameron said the prime minister ’s telephone call with Obama would be “ statesmanlike and workmanlike . ”
A White House official played down the BP focus , saying it would be just one of a number of issues raised .
BP STOCK
Shares in BP , which have lost tens of billions of dollars in value since the crisis began on April 20 , closed up 7.2 percent in London trading , rebounding from Thursday ’s 13 - year low and extending a rally that began in New York on Thursday .
BP ’s American depositary shares finished up 3.63 percent in New York on Friday .
“ Possibly people have taken heart from the fact that the political rhetoric is not just one side of the Atlantic , ” said Barclays Capital analyst Lucy Haskins .
Investors appeared unfazed by the news from U.S. scientists that the well ’s flow rate may be as high 40,000 barrels ( 1.68 million gallons / 6.36 million liters ) per day .
The new estimates could have huge financial implications because under the U.S. Clean Water Act , BP and others could face fines up to $ 4,300 for every barrel leaked .
With more than 2 million barrels of oil already in the ocean , that could mean fines of $ 8.6 billion at least .
BP expects the total bill for the clean - up of the spill , which has affected 120 miles of U.S. coastline and closed down rich fishing grounds , will be $ 3 - $ 6 billion , an analyst briefed by BP said in a research note on Friday .
The slick has already fouled wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama .
Tar balls have also washed up on Florida ’s famous white beaches .
One third of the Gulf ’s federal waters remain closed for fishing .
“ BP and all involved have downplayed this from day one .
Everyone knew it was more than they reported and now basically it ’s been proven , ” said Kindra Arnesen , a restaurant owner in Venice , Louisiana , whose husband makes his living fishing .
Mission One Motors have announced that they will not be racing in 2010 due to the ongoing work on getting the Mission One electric motorcycle to market by mid-2011 , although they have alluded to the new racing bike that they ’re working on ;
We look forward to getting back to the track soon .
It is our goal to unveil our second generation race bike late this season .
In the meantime , we wish all the TTXGP teams and series the very best of luck .
This is perfect timing to get the new racing bike on the track for the 2011 TTXGP season , which of course would help a great deal with promoting sales for the Mission One superbike .
They ’re taking orders for the bike now , the deposit amount is $ 5000 , and the sales price is $ 68,995 USD .
That sounds like a lot however it is important to remember that this is the fastest electric motorcycle in the world , Mission
One set the land speed record in September last year at the Bonneville Sale Flats with a 150 mph run ( the rest of the bikes did n’t even come close ) .
The bike looks like something that Christian Bale would ride around on in his favourite black halloween costume and with an initial production run of only 50 we will probably see these bikes changing hands for more than the sticker price after deliveries begin .
I know for a fact that if money was no object , my name would be very near the top of the order list .

Full Mission One Statement
Many news reports about the Gulf oil catastrophe refer to it as a " spill . "
Wrong .
A spill is a minor " oops " — one accidentally spills milks , for example , and from childhood , we 're taught the old aphorism : " Do n't cry over spilt milk . "
What 's in the Gulf is n't milk and it was n't spilt .
The explosion of BP's Deepwater Horizon well was the inevitable result of deliberate decisions made by avaricious corporate executives , laissez faire politicians and obsequious regulators .
As the ruinous gulf oil blowout spreads onto land , over wildlife , across the ocean floor and into people 's lives , it raises a fundamental question for all of us Americans :
Who the hell 's in charge here ?
What we 're witnessing is not merely a human and environmental horror , but also an appalling deterioration in our nation 's governance .
Just as we saw in Wall Street 's devastating economic disaster and in Massey Energy 's murderous explosion inside its Upper Big Branch coal mine , the nastiness in the gulf is baring an ugly truth that We the People must finally face :
We are living under de facto corporate rule that has rendered our government impotent .
Thirty years of laissez - faire , ideological nonsense ( pushed upon us with a vengeance in the past decade ) has transformed government into a subsidiary of corporate power .
Wall Street , Massey , BP and its partners — all were allowed to become their own " regulators " and officially encouraged to put their short - term profit interests over the public interest .
Let 's not forget that on April 2 , barely two weeks before Deepwater Horizon blew and 11 people perished on the spot , the public 's No. 1 official , Barack Obama , trumpeted his support for more deepwater oil drilling , blithely regurgitating Big Oil 's big lie : " Oil rigs today generally do n't cause spills . "
He and his advisors had not bothered to check the truth of that — they simply took the industry 's word .
That 's not governing , it 's aiding and abetting profiteers , and it's a pathetic performance .
But that was only the start of Washington 's oily confession that it has surrendered control to corporate arrogance and avarice .
With an unprecedented volume of crude gushing from the well and the magnitude of the disaster multiplying geometrically by the day , who was in charge of coping with that ?
Not the White House , not the interior secretary , not the EPA .
As we saw when Wall Street 's greed exploded our economy , the polluting scoundrels were left in charge !
While BP 's dapper CEO issued patently ridiculous statements ( such as , " Everything we can see at the moment suggests that the overall environmental impact of this will be very , very modest . " ) , our government blindly went along with BP 's false assertion that only some 5,000 barrels a day were pouring from the well , when independent experts were shouting at the White House that the correct volume was up to 19 times that much .
Finally , almost a month after the blowout , Obama ordered a moratorium on drilling new offshore wells and on granting environmental waivers to the oil giants .
Bravo , Mr. President !
But ... his moratorium was simply ignored .
Days after his order , oil companies were handed at least seven more drilling permits and five waivers .
Last week , with 63 percent of the public disapproving of his meek deference to BP , the president of the United States of America was reduced to convening a press conference to insist that he was " engaged " and , behind the scenes , was " monitoring " BP 's efforts .
Wow , monitoring !
Excuse me , but who 's the president here ?
Obama should personally take charge — - cancel all of his social and political events , convene an emergency response team of the best scientific minds in the world , announce a clear plan of clean - up actions , install all relevant Cabinet officials in a Gulf Coast command center to direct the actions , make daily reports on progress to the public , fire a mess of failed regulators and go to Congress with sweeping legislation to replace America 's oil dependency with a crash program of conservation and renewable energy sources .
Oh , he should also wring a few corporate necks .
Instead of monitoring these criminals , prosecute them — and put the public back in charge of our government .

O'Keefe 's latest adventure in psuedo - journalism was revealed today on Breitbart 's BigGovernment , as well as ABC's Good Morning America with George Stephanopoulos .
The new effort was aimed at alleged waste and / or corruption at the Census Bureau .
O'Keefe , armed with a camera , and a smug disregard for ethics , set off to embark on a career in the federal bureaucracy where he says that ...
" What I found were census supervisors systematically encouraging employees to falsify information on their time sheets . "
First of all , it 's kind of funny that O'Keefe has been reduced to investigating incorrect time cards ( his own ) .
It 's not as if there are n't other scandals percolating ( I heard something about some oil in the gulf ) .
At least he is n't railing about Census Bureau concentration camps in Idaho .
O'Keefe only worked for the census for two days of training .
He never actually performed any census field work .
In the new video he says that a census crew leader told him to use a false time sheet as a template for filling out future time sheets .
However , it was not a " false " time sheet .
It was a practice time sheet used for training .
But O'Keefe characterized the crew leader 's instructions during a training session as a directive to falsify the later forms .
Never mind that the crew leader in the video said explicitly to use the practice form as a template .
So when the crew leader said to fill the form out the same way every day , he simply meant to follow the instructions , not to input the same hours and other data .
That would be obvious to most people , but O'Keefe has a blind determination to mislead , which he continues to do as the video proceeds .
In the portion where O'Keefe " confronts " the crew leader at a Dunkin 's Donuts , he asks whether it will be a problem that he quit working at 3:30 or 4:00 .
The implication is that his time sheet reflected something different .
But we can't see the time sheet that the crew leader is reviewing , so for all we know it said 3:45 .
A bigger problem is that if you watch the time code on the video , almost a full minute was edited out between the time O'Keefe asked his question ( 3:59:04 ) and the time the crew leader responded ( 4:00:00 ) .
So when the crew leader responded saying " No , that 's not a problem , " he could have been responding to a different question entirely .
And given O'Keefe 's history of deceptive editing , the last thing he should be given now is the benefit of a doubt .
But there 's another revelation in this video that ought to attract the attention of the authorities .
O'Keefe noted that the time sheets contain a warning at the bottom just above where they are signed that says :
Employee 's Certification - Under penalty of fine and / or imprisonment , I certify that the information on this form is true and correct to the best of my knowledge .
In the video , O'Keefe sought to portray that as applying to his supervisor .
But the actual time sheet shows that this is only applicable to the employee .
The supervisor has a somewhat lower standard of certification that relies on representations made by the employee :
Supervisor 's Certification - I certify that I have reviewed the entries made and they appear to be reasonable and accurate .
So what we have here is O'Keefe confessing again to a crime .
He knowingly signed the time sheet despite his having lied on it about the hours he worked .
He knew that it was unlawful to do so , yet he did it anyway .
This could n't be a more clear cut case .
What 's more , there are laws against interfering with the conduct of the census .
Since O'Keefe never intended to provide the services to which he agreed upon on employment , he could be liable for additional charges in that regard .
And that 's not all .
The Washington Post reports that O'Keefe may also have broken laws relating to surreptitiously recording Commerce Department conversations .
Stephen Buckner , a Bureau spokesman told the Post that ...
" In his video , Mr. O'Keefe , an admitted criminal , does not disclose that he previously worked for the Census Bureau for nearly two months in 2009 without incident , allegation or complaint .
" That employment with us was well before his indictment and prior to his conviction of a federal crime last week .
The Census Bureau obviously does not condone any falsifying of or tampering with time sheets by its employees . "
In his appearance on Good Morning America , Stephanopoulos asked O'Keefe if he regretted having broken the law in the affair at the senator 's office in Louisiana .
While fudging on the matter of regret , he did concede that he would be more " careful " in the future .
But his actions in this new episode show that he is an incorrigible criminal with no intention of respecting either the law or the standards of ethical journalism .
And on top of all of that , he is an arrogant SOB who considers himself a victim .
In his article at BigGovernment he whines that ...
" The government took our camera , so I bought another .
The government put us in jail and deleted our tapes , but we got out and we 'll just make more . "
It 's pathetic that O'Keefe needs to be reminded that the government did n't put him jail .
He put himself there by breaking the law .
I 'm sure Charles Manson has the same position on his incarceration as O'Keefe does , but it does n't make sense for either one of them .
O'Keefe belongs in jail for his unrepentant criminal behavior .
And the terminally choleric Andrew Breitbart ought to have a nearby cell for his role in facilitating O'Keefe 's crimes .
And remember , this latest crime was committed while O'Keefe was on probation .
So he is not only liable for the new violations of the law , but he could have violated his probation as well .
Finally , it would be huge mistake for other media outlets to give these charlatans any additional exposure .
Breitbart is already bragging about having been on GMA and is touting that appearance as opening the door to more press .
The media was fooled before by these phonies .
They were duped into thinking that they had " missed " the ACORN story , but when the whole story was revealed , it was clear that Breitbart 's crew had deceptively altered their video , and the only crimes were those committed by O'Keefe and company .
These people are confessed criminals , exposed liars , and they do not deserve to be treated as legitimate producers of news .
Which is why they will probably be all over Fox News for the next couple of weeks .
O'Keefe and Breitbart are already promising more videos , and O'Keefe says that he is assembling an " army " of citizen journalists .
I guess we 'll have to assemble an army of debunkers .
And Jon Stewart 's writing staff is going to have their hands full .

Hundreds of demonstrators , condemning Israel 's blockade of the Gaza Strip , picketed at the Port of Oakland on Sunday and may have prevented an Israeli cargo ship from unloading for the day .
Two shifts of longshoremen agreed not to cross the picket line , leaving nobody to unload the vessel .
" Our objective was to boycott this ship for 24 hours , and we succeeded in doing that , " said Richard Becker , with the ANSWER Coalition , one of the groups that organized the protest .
The demonstrators first gathered before dawn at Berth 58 , where a ship from Israel 's Zim shipping line was scheduled to dock Sunday , first in the morning then in the afternoon , protesters said .
It eventually arrived around 6 p.m. , Becker said , but by that time the dockworkers had agreed not to show up to unload the vessel .
An Israeli Consulate representative disputed that account , saying the ship was always scheduled to arrive about 6 p.m .
International pressure to end the Gaza closure has increased since Israeli commandos stormed a flotilla of ships attempting to run the blockade on May 31 , killing nine people .
Israel formally announced on Sunday it would ease its blockade of Gaza , allowing more goods to enter the impoverished area .
Israel said it would expand operations at the land crossings already operating to enable processing of " a significantly greater volume of goods " and " the expansion of economic activity . "
More than 500 people showed up about 5:30 a.m. Sunday to begin the protest , according to police estimates .
By around 10 a.m. the crowd dispersed , but about 200 protesters returned in the afternoon when the second shift of dockworkers were scheduled to work .
Becker said some workers showed up for the morning shift , but virtually none did for the second .
All agreed not to unload the ship or cross the picket lines , citing concern for their personal safety .
" I want the Palestinian people to have peace and land .
They have been suffering for 60 years , and it's time for them to have justice , " said Marina Gutierrez of Kensington , a demonstrator who showed up both in the morning and the afternoon .
In the afternoon , two Israel supporters stood across the street from the pro-Palestinian demonstrators waving Israeli and American flags .
" Israel is a democracy , just like America , and Israel is faced with a fight for its life , " said Faith Metzer of El Cerrito .
EXCLUSIVE : Men in Black 3 is officially a go , and Columbia Pictures will set a May 25 , 2012 , release date for a sequel that director Barry Sonnenfeld will shoot in 3D .
Will Smith has signed his deal to reunite with director Barry Sonnenfeld , and deals are now being negotiated with Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin .
An announcement is imminent .
The project has been in the prep stage for some time , but did n’t become real until Smith chose it over several “ next film ” candidates .
His decision to put on the sunglasses and dark suit gives Sony a killer 2012 : the studio previously set a July 3 , 2012 release date for its Spider - Man relaunch , which also will be shot in 3D .
Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald return as MIB3 producers , and Steven Spielberg will be executive producer .
It has long been expected MIB3 would be next for Smith , who last starred in 2008 ’s Seven Pounds and then took the time to be a very hands on producer in the China - shot Karate Kid remake that stars his son , Jaden ( which Columbia releases June 11 ) .
Smith then mulled several star vehicles that included City That Sailed , and I hear that he also contemplated Colossus , the scifi remake that Ron Howard wants to direct for Universal and Imagine .
While Smith pondered his choices , Columbia , Sonnenfeld and MIB3 producers Parkes and MacDonald positioned themselves to be ready .
I ’m told that Rick Baker has been designing and building the creatures , Bo Welch has been designing the sets , and David Koepp had been polishing a script by Etan Cohen that got this whole thing started .
Cohen is back and polishing the shooting draft .
The film will use a time travel element that moves the action from contemporary back to 1969 .
Brolin will play the younger version of Jones ’s Agent Kay character .
Sony had every reason to be stoked about more MIB , the franchise based on the comic book by Lowell Cunningham .
The 1997 original grossed $ 589 million worldwide , and the 2002 sequel did $ 442 million in global ticket sales .
Those films rank high on Columbia ’s all - time gross chart , and the prospect of making an installment that captures the otherworldly creatures in 3D is enticing .
Still , many felt another film would be impossible because the gross deals were so prohibitive .
I ’m told that the principal players showed flexibility .
It ’s still a big - ticket film , and there is plenty of gross out the door .
But the deals have built - in hiatus periods that allow the studio to recoup and make money .
That hurdle was overcome some time ago , and it came down to Smith committing .
He showed some flexibility by agreeing to a Memorial Day weekend opening .
Since Independence Day , Smith has considered July 4 weekend to be his preferred domain for commercial vehicles , but that slot was already occupied by Spider - Man .
Then again , Smith has always been shrewd about choosing projects , and he has positioned himself to keep intact his title as world ’s biggest box office star .
“ The rig ’s on fire !
I told you this was gonna happen ”
Paul Joseph Watson

Wednesday , June 9 , 2010
Top Houston attorney Tony Buzbee says he has new evidence which indicates that Deepwater Horizon ’s managers knew that the BP oil rig had major problems before its explosion on April 20 , citing the eyewitness account of a crew member who rescued burning workers on the rig of a conversation between Deepwater Horizon installation manager Jimmy Harrell and someone in Houston .
According to the witness , Harrell was screaming , “ Are you fucking happy ?
Are you fucking happy ?
The rig ’s on fire !
I told you this was gonna happen . ”
Harrell was talking via satellite phone and whoever was on the other end of the line was apparently trying to calm him down as the rig burned .
“ I am fucking calm , ” said Harrell , according to Buzbee .
“ You realize the rig is burning ? ”
A boat captain then asked Harrell to leave the bridge .
Transocean have refused to confirm or deny that the conversation took place .
Buzbee is a respected lawyer with a successful history of winning cases brought against oil companies .
He represents 15 rig workers along with dozens of shrimpers , seafood restaurants , and dock workers .
The witness to the conversation signed a 3 page statement attesting to the fact that it took place , but refuses to be identified for fear of reprisals .
Though Harrell himself has denied allegations of a feud with BP or Transocean in public hearings , the Atlantic ’s Josh Harkinson points out that there were two other witnesses who personally experienced Harrell ’s problems with their safety procedures .
“ Testifying before the Coast Guard and MMS panel last month , Douglas Brown , the chief mechanic on the Deepwater Horizon , said that on the morning of the day that the rig exploded Harrell had a “ skirmish ” over drilling procedures during a meeting with BP ’s “ company man , ” well site leader Robert Kaluza .
“ I remember the company man saying this is how it ’s going to be , ” Brown told the panel .
As Harrell was leaving the meeting , according to Brown , “ He pretty much grumbled , ‘ I guess that ’s what we have those pincers for , ' ” referring to the blowout preventer on the sea floor that is supposed to be the last resort to prevent a leak in the event of an emergency .
The blowout preventer failed following the explosion on the rig , causing the massive spill .
( Transocean ’s chief electronics technician , Mike Williams , also recalled the argument but named a different BP “ company man , ” BP ’s top official on the rig , Donald Vidrine ) , ” writes Harkinson .
“ Other rig workers have also claimed that they were pressured by BP and their supervisors to cut corners , ” adds Harkinson .
“ Transocean roustabout Truitt Crawford told the Coast Guard that he overheard senior management saying that BP was “ taking shortcuts ” by replacing drilling mud in the well with saltwater , which would have provided less weight to contain the well ’s surging pressure .
Transocean ’s Williams told 60 Minutes that a supervisor had dismissed evidence that the well ’s blowout preventer had been damaged .
And workers with Halliburton , the well ’s cementing contractor , had complained that BP ’s use of cement “ was against our best practices ” and told the oil company that it would likely have “ a SEVERE gas flow problem ” unless the well ’s casings were centered more carefully . ”

A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The details of this story would appear to point to mere negligence on behalf of Transocean and BP were it not for the plethora of other evidence indicating foreknowledge of the event and even possible deliberate sabotage of the oil well .
As we highlighted yesterday , on page 37 of British Petroleum ’s own investigative report into the oil spill , it is stated that the Hydraulic Control System on equipment designed to automatically seal the well in an emergency was modified without BP ’s knowledge sometime before the explosion .
Highly suspicious stock and share trades by people connected to BP before the explosion indicate some extent of foreknowledge .
Goldman Sachs dumped 44 % of its shares in BP
Oil during the first quarter of 2010 – shares that subsequently lost 36 percent of their value , equating to $ 96 million .
The current chairman of Goldman Sachs is Bilderberg luminary Peter Sutherland , who is also the former chairman of British Petroleum .
Furthermore , as reported by the London Telegraph on June 5th , Tony Hayward , the current BP CEO sold £ 1.4 million of his shares in the fuel giant weeks before the spill .
On April 12th , just over one week before the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded , Halliburton , the world ’s second largest oilfield services corporation , surprised some by acquiring Boots & Coots , a relatively small but vastly experienced oil well control company .
Halliburton is named in the majority of some two dozen lawsuits filed since the explosion by Gulf Coast people and businesses who claim that the company is to blame for the disaster .
Halliburton was forced to admit in testimony at a congressional hearing last month that it carried out a cementing operation 20 hours before the Gulf of Mexico rig went up in flames .
The lawsuits claim that four Halliburton workers stationed on the rig improperly capped the well .
Alex Jones discusses more of the evidence which indicates a cover - up and the potential motivations behind it in the clips below .

Comment on this article
Discovered in 1948 , Casimir forces are complicated quantum forces that affect only objects that are very , very close together .
They ’re so subtle that for most of the 60 - odd years since their discovery , engineers have safely ignored them .
But in the age of tiny electromechanical devices like the accelerometers in the iPhone or the micromirrors in digital projectors , Casimir forces have emerged as troublemakers , since they can cause micromachines ’ tiny moving parts to stick together .
MIT researchers have developed a powerful new tool for calculating the effects of Casimir forces , with ramifications for both basic physics and the design of microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS ) .
One of the researchers ’ most recent discoveries using the new tool was a way to arrange tiny objects so that the ordinarily attractive Casimir forces become repulsive .
If engineers can design MEMS so that the Casimir forces actually prevent their moving parts from sticking together — rather than causing them to stick — it could cut down substantially on the failure rate of existing MEMS .
It could also help enable new , affordable MEMS devices , like tiny medical or scientific sensors , or microfluidics devices that enable hundreds of chemical or biological experiments to be performed in parallel .
Quantum mechanics has bequeathed a very weird picture of the universe to modern physicists .
One of its features is a cadre of new subatomic particles that are constantly flashing in and out of existence in an almost undetectably short span of time .
( The Higgs boson , a theoretically predicted particle that the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland is trying to detect for the first time , is expected to appear for only a few sextillionths of a second . )
There are so many of these transient particles in space — even in a vacuum — moving in so many different directions that the forces they exert generally balance each other out .
For most purposes , the particles can be ignored .
But when objects get very close together , there ’s little room for particles to flash into existence between them .
Consequently , there are fewer transient particles in between the objects to offset the forces exerted by the transient particles around them , and the difference in pressure ends up pushing the objects toward each other .
In the 1960s , physicists developed a mathematical formula that , in principle , describes the effects of Casimir forces on any number of tiny objects , with any shape .
But in the vast majority of cases , that formula remained impossibly hard to solve .
“ People think that if you have a formula , then you can evaluate it .
That ’s not true at all , ” says Steven Johnson , an associate professor of applied mathematics , who helped develop the new tools .
“ There was a formula that was written down by Einstein that describes gravity .
They still do n’t know what all the consequences of this formula are . ”
For decades , the formula for Casimir forces was in the same boat .
Physicists could solve it for only a small number of cases , such as that of two parallel plates .
In recent years , researchers around the world attacked the problem of finding Casimir forces between more general shapes and materials .
For instance , in 2006 , MIT physics professors Robert Jaffe and Mehran Kardar — with whom Johnson continues to collaborate — and Thorsten Emig of the University of Köln in Germany showed how to calculate the forces acting between a plate and a cylinder ; the next year , they demonstrated solutions for multiple spheres .
Meanwhile , Johnson and his collaborators explored various numerical methods that can be applied to a wide variety of geometries .
However , the full power of existing tools for classical electromagnetic calculations had not yet been brought to bear on the Casimir problem .
In a paper appearing this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Johnson , physics PhD students Alexander McCauley and Alejandro Rodriguez ( the paper ’s lead author ) , and John Joannopoulos , the Francis Wright Davis Professor of Physics , describe a way to solve Casimir - force equations for any number of objects , with any conceivable shape .
The researchers ’ insight is that the effects of Casimir forces on objects 100 nanometers apart can be precisely modeled using objects 100,000 times as big , 100,000 times as far apart , immersed in a fluid that conducts electricity .
Instead of calculating the forces exerted by tiny particles flashing into existence around the tiny objects , the researchers calculate the strength of an electromagnetic field at various points around the much larger ones .
In their paper , they prove that these computations are mathematically equivalent .
For objects with odd shapes , calculating electromagnetic - field strength in a conducting fluid is still fairly complicated .
But it ’s eminently feasible using off - the - shelf engineering software .
“ Analytically , ” says Diego Dalvit , a specialist in Casimir forces at the Los Alamos National Laboratory , “ it ’s almost impossible to do exact calculations of the Casimir force , unless you have some very special geometries . ”
With the MIT researchers ’ technique , however , “ in principle , you can tackle any geometry .
And this is useful .
Very useful .
” Since Casimir forces can cause the moving parts of MEMS to stick together , Dalvit says , “ One of the holy grails in Casimir physics is to find geometries where you can get repulsion ” rather than attraction .
And that ’s exactly what the new techniques allowed the MIT researchers to do .
In a separate paper published in March , physicist Michael Levin of Harvard University ’s Society of Fellows , together with the MIT researchers , described the first arrangement of materials that enable Casimir forces to cause repulsion in a vacuum .
Dalvit points out , however , that physicists using the new technique must still rely on intuition when devising systems of tiny objects with useful properties .
“ Once you have an intuition of what geometries will cause repulsion , then the [ technique ] can tell you whether there is repulsion or not , ” Dalvit says .
But by themselves , the tools cannot identify geometries that cause repulsion .
Au lendemain de l'assaut meurtrier de l'armée israélienne sur la flottille humanitaire qui se dirigeait vers Gaza , les critiques continuent de pleuvoir sur l'État hébreu .
Des dizaines de pays , dont la France , ont réclamé le retour de leurs ressortissants retenus en Israël .
Retour sur les événements de ce mardi 1er juin .
20 heures - Une partie de l'aide humanitaire transportée à Gaza
Une partie du chargement d'aide transporté par la flottille humanitaire internationale , interceptée lundi en haute mer par la marine israélienne , a été transférée par voie terrestre vers la bande de Gaza , indique un porte - parole militaire israélien .
" La cargaison d'un des six bateaux a été entièrement déchargée et transférée mardi vers la bande de Gaza avec un convoi de huit camions , via le terminal routier de Kerem Shalom " , a indiqué à l'AFP le major Guy Inbar .
" Ce chargement était essentiellement composé de matériel médical , de fauteuils roulants et de produits alimentaires " , a - t - il précisé .
" Une dizaine d'autres camions doivent franchir mardi le terminal de Kerem Shalom , également avec du matériel médical et des produits alimentaires " , a - t - il encore dit .

" La France exige , avec l'Union européenne et avec l'Organisation des Nations unies , l'ouverture immédiate d'une enquête internationale , indépendante et impartiale parce qu'il faut faire la lumière sur ce qui s'est produit hier " , a aussi rappelé le chef du gouvernement , applaudi par de nombreux députés .
" C'est un acte qui n'est pas justifié , c'est un acte qui est contraire au droit international et c'est surtout un acte qui fait reculer l'espoir si ténu de la reprise à laquelle nous travaillons d'un dialogue direct entre les Israéliens et les Palestiniens " , a - t - il encore dit .
15 heures - Au moins quatre Turcs tués
Un diplomate turc annonce qu'au moins quatre Turcs figurent parmi les tués du raid israélien de lundi matin .
" Les autorités israéliennes ont évoqué un bilan de 9 morts , parmi eux il y a pour l'instant quatre citoyens turcs , selon notre enquête " , souligne ce responsable sous couvert d'anonymat , précisant que le nombre de Turcs tués dans l'abordage pouvait augmenter , le processus d'identification des victimes n'étant pas encore terminé .

We already know that Microsoft ’s motion sensing device Natal will now be known as “ Kinect ” , and the device was shown at an event , ahead of Microsoft ’s E3 press conference .
The first footage from the event has now gone live , showing off the mysterious untitled Star Wars game .
You can see the game in - action below , but it all seems a bit fishy to us .
If you look carefully , instead of the Jedi in the game responding to the player ’s arm movements it looks like the other way around .

Mini Bio ( 1 )
Steven Paul Jobs was born on 24 February 1955 in San Francisco , California , to students Abdul Fattah Jandali and Joanne Carole Schieble who were unmarried at the time and gave him up for adoption .
He was taken in by a working class couple , Paul and Clara Jobs , and grew up with them in Mountain View , California .
He attended Homestead High School in Cupertino California and went to Reed College in Portland Oregon in 1972 but dropped out after only one semester , staying on to " drop in " on courses that interested him .
He took a job with video game manufacturer Atari to raise enough money for a trip to India and returned from there a Buddhist .
Back in Cupertino he returned to Atari where his old friend Steve Wozniak was still working .
Wozniak was building his own computer and in 1976 Jobs pre-sold 50 of the as - yet unmade computers to a local store and managed to buy the components on credit solely on the strength of the order , enabling them to build the Apple I without any funding at all .
The Apple II followed in 1977 and the company Apple Computer was formed shortly afterwards .
The Apple II was credited with starting the personal computer boom , its popularity prompting IBM to hurriedly develop their own PC .
By the time production of the Apple II ended in 1993 it had sold over 6 million units .
Inspired by a trip to Xerox 's Palo Alto Research Center ( PARC ) , engineers from Apple began working on a commercial application for the graphical interface ideas they had seen there .
The resulting machine , Lisa , was expensive and never achieved any level of commercial success , but in 1984 another Apple computer , using the same WIMP ( Windows , Icons , Menus , Pointer ) interface concept , was launched .
An advert during the 1984 Super Bowl , directed by Ridley Scott introduced the Macintosh computer to the world ( in fact , the advert had been shown on a local TV channel in Idaho on 31 December 1983 and in movie theaters during January 1984 before its famous " premiere " on 22 January during the Super Bowl ) .
In 1985 Jobs was fired from Apple and immediately founded another computer company , NeXT .
Its machines were not a commercial success but some of the technology was later used by Apple when Jobs eventually returned there .
In the meantime , in 1986 , Jobs bought The Computer Graphics Group from Lucasfilm .
The group was responsible for making high - end computer graphics hardware but under its new name , Pixar , it began to produce innovative computer animations .
Their first title under the Pixar name , Die kleine Lampe ( 1986 ) won critical and popular acclaim and in 1991 Pixar signed an agreement with Disney , with whom it already had a relationship , to produce a series of feature films , beginning with Toy Story ( 1995 ) .
In 1996 Apple bought NeXT and Jobs returned to Apple , becoming its CEO .
With the help of British - born industrial designer Jonathan Ive , Jobs brought his own aesthetic philosophy back to the ailing company and began to turn its fortunes around with the release of the iMac in 1998 .
The company 's MP3 player , the iPod , followed in 2001 , with the iPhone launching in 2007 and the iPad in 2010 .
The company 's software music player , iTunes , evolved into an online music ( and eventually also movie and software application ) store , helping to popularize the idea of " legally " downloading entertainment content .
In 2003 , Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and underwent surgery in 2004 .
Despite the success of this operation he became increasingly ill and received a liver transplant in 2009 .
He returned to work after a six month break but eventually resigned his position in August 2011 after another period of medical leave which began in January 2011 .
He died on 5 October 2011 .

Trivia ( 41 )
Co-founded Apple Computer Inc. in 1977 with Steve Wozniak .
Was later ousted and then brought back as interim CEO in 1997 .
His new reign has been controversial : bringing Apple back to profitability ( and visibility ) , yet disappointing many for discontinuing the Newton Message Pad hand - held device .
Officially dropped the word " interim " from his title at Apple Computer sometime in the autumn of 1999 .
When Apple Computer appointed its first Board of Directors , the Board insisted that all employees wear name badges with a number indicating the order in which they were hired .
They assigned Steve Wozniak , who did all the engineering of the highly successful Apple II computer , the title Employee No. 1 . Steve Jobs was officially Employee No. 2 .
Jobs protested but the Board refused to change the badge assignments .
Jobs offered a compromise :
He would be Employee No. 0 , since 0 comes before 1 on the mathematical model known as a number line .

Personal Quotes ( 19 )
[ February 1985 , interview in " Playboy " magazine ]
I do n't think I 've ever worked so hard on something , but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life .
Almost everyone who worked on it will say that .
None of us wanted to release it at the end .
It was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands , it would n't be ours anymore .
When we finally presented it at the shareholders ' meeting , everyone in the auditorium gave it a five - minute ovation .
What was incredible to me was that I could see the Mac team in the first few rows .
It was as though none of us could believe we 'd actually finished it .
Everyone started crying .
[ 1985 ] I 'll always stay connected with Apple .
I hope that throughout my life I 'll sort of have the thread of my life and then the thread of Apple weave in and out , like a tapestry .
There may be a few years when I 'm not there , but I 'll always come back .
[ 2003 ]
There are downsides to everything ; there are unintended consequences to everything .
The most corrosive piece of technology that I 've ever seen is called television -- but then , again , television , at its best , is magnificent .
[ 1998 ]
A lot of times , people do n't know what they want until you show it to them .
Creativity is just connecting things .
When you ask creative people how they did something , they feel a little guilty because they did n't really do it , they just saw something .
It seemed obvious to them after a while .
[ 1993 ]
I 'm sorry , it 's true .
Having children really changes your view on these things .
We 're born , we live for a brief instant , and we die .
It 's been happening for a long time .
[ May 1998 , interview in " Business Week " magazine ]
That 's been one of my mantras -- focus and simplicity .
Simple can be harder than complex :
You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple .
But it 's worth it in the end because once you get there , you can move mountains .
Simple can be harder than complex .
You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple .
But it 's worth it in the end because once you get there , you can move mountains .
My model for business is The Beatles .
They were four guys who kept each other 's kind of negative tendencies in check .
They balanced each other and the total was greater than the sum of the parts .
Remembering that I 'll be dead soon is the most important tool I 've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life .
Because almost everything -- all external expectations , all pride , all fear of embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of death , leaving only what is truly important .
In most people 's vocabularies , design means veneer .
It 's interior decorating .
It 's the fabric of the curtains and the sofa .
But to me , nothing could be further from the meaning of design .
Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service .
I did n't see it then , but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me .
The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again .
The unions are the worst thing that happened to education because it 's not a meritocracy .
It turns into a bureaucracy , which is exactly what happened .
The teachers can't teach , and administrators run the place , and nobody can be fired .
It 's terrible .
You know , everybody has a cell phone , but I do n't know one person who likes their cell phone .
I want to make a phone that people love .
I 'm going to destroy Android because it 's a stolen product .
I 'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this .
All the work I have done in my life will be obsolete by the time I'm 50 .
It 's more fun to be a pirate than to join the navy .
[ about how he and partner Steve Wozniak tried to get major computer companies interested in their personal computer , which turned out to be the Apple ]
So we went to Atari and said , " Hey , we 've got this amazing thing , even built with some of your parts , and what do you think about funding us ?
Or we 'll give it to you .
We just want to do it .
Pay our salary , we 'll come work for you " .
And they said , " No " .
So then we went to Hewlett - Packard , and they said , " Hey , we do n't need you .
You have n't got through college yet " .
[ on the difference between billionaires and regular people ]
Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it , you can influence it , you can build your own things that other people can use .

In March , a Canadian principal is caught on video in what appears to be the assault of a student .
The principal is black , and when the Board was considering firing the man , the Black Educators Association said that action would be racist .
While Olsen went public with the revelation her husband of 39 years had leaked the disturbing video footage , the Nova Scotia Teachers Union issued a brief " With regards to the security breach of the video of principal Ken Fells , the Nova Scotia Teachers Union welcomes the information that the Halifax Regional School Board is taking steps to protect the privacy of our members .
The Nova Scotia Teachers Union deeply regrets any damage done to Mr. Fells ' reputation by the release of this video .
At this point in time the Union is not at liberty to discuss anything further .
Alexis Allen , President , Nova Scotia Teachers Union " Sometimes called " blueberry muffin , " Ken Fells , the then - Principal of Graham Creighton Jr. High School is seen in " I know I did wrong , but he did n't have to beat the crap out of me .
I do n't ever want to see him again .
He should n't teach . "
Boutilier 's family were aware of the video documentation , and have requested it from the Board , and have asked to see the original footage , but say the Board has refused .
Boutilier 's parents first saw their son being assaulted on CBC News .
Fells was initially suspended , and has since been removed as principal of the school after the incident , but is still teaching reported the " If students can go and defy two teachers and defy a principal in front of other students , that 's the wrong message that you send to the general public or to the schools . "
There is a movement to have Fells reinstated as principal at Graham Creighton Jr. High School , which includes at least one school board trustee , reported After the RCMP investigation revealed Carole Olsen 's husband leaked the footage from a school computer using his wife 's email password , no charges were laid .
The Halifax Regional School Board voted to keep Carole Olson on the Board in her current position .
The Chronicle Herald reported Christopher Olsen felt compelled to release the video footage after the Board decided not to fire Fells .
Christopher Olsen had reportedly apologized to his wife and the Board , while Carole Olsen apologized to the Board and the public .
The School Board is hoping a law suit does not result from the video footage .
The RCMP decided not to lay charges against either Fells or Boutilier over the alleged assault .
The Boutilier family is still attempting to get the original video footage , and has hired a lawyer .
The incident has highlighted Nova Scotia 's
The principal of Graham Creighton Junior High School was not fired in the end , although he was removed from the school .
The incident had occurred in March and was quietly investigated by the RCMP .
The school board intended to fire the principal , but after pressure from the Black Educators Association , the school did not sack the man .
After that decision , video footage showing the violent encounter between the principal and student was leaked to Frank Magazine in late May .
The footage went viral , with the school board calling in police to investigate the breach .
On Friday the Chronicle Herald reported head of the Halifax Regional School Board , Carole Olsen came forward to proclaim her husband , Christopher Olsen , had leaked the video .
While Olsen went public with the revelation her husband of 39 years had leaked the disturbing video footage , the Nova Scotia Teachers Union issued a brief press release that statesSometimes called " blueberry muffin , " Ken Fells , the then - Principal of Graham Creighton Jr. High School is seen in video footage tackling a student who identified as 14 year old Josh Boutilier .
It appears Fells is at strangling Boutellier , whom Fells had quickly wrestled to the floor after a very brief to and fro .
Another student tentatively intervenes and Fells ceases his strangle - hold and instead gets Boutilier to his feet , holding him in a chokehold , then proceeds to wrestle - walk the boy to what is presumably the office .
The descriptive note posted with the video says Boutiiier refused to hand over his cell phone to Fells after having recorded a fight between students .
CBC
News reported Boutilier is now at a new school , but had suffered a concussion as well as bruises as a result of the alleged assault .
Boutilier 's family claim the violence did not end with the end of the leaked video , but continued in the principal 's office .
In a CBC News interview , young Boutilier claimed he had been grabbed by the throat .
The boy admitted should have complied with the request to hand over his cell phone , telling CBC NewsBoutilier 's family were aware of the video documentation , and have requested it from the Board , and have asked to see the original footage , but say the Board has refused .

Fells was initially suspended , and has since been removed as principal of the school after the incident , but is still teaching reported the Halegonia .
The Halegonia said the scuffle was prompted after Boutilier refused to hand over his cell phone , with an allegation the boy had taken " inappropriate photos of a girl with his cell phone . "
News 95.7 reported the Black Educators Association was firmly supporting Fells .
Spokesperson Brad Barton saidThere is a movement to have Fells reinstated as principal at Graham Creighton Jr. High School , which includes at least one school board trustee , reported CBC News .

Every day hundreds of people fly into El Alto , Bolivia .
Circling to land , the passengers stare down on a vast , windblown city of unpainted brick houses and tin roofs , sitting on narrow streets and squares .
The most arresting aspect of El Alto is its churches , placed with precision like chess pieces on a grid .
Dozens of them , each bright white or blue , punctuate the drab landscape .
The man behind these churches is a missionary priest from Germany named Sebastián Obermaier .
But it turns out they are just the most visible part of his network of social projects .
Thirty - two years ago when Father Obermaier arrived in El Alto it was a town of 80,000 people growing on the high plains next to La Paz , Bolivia 's de facto capital .
Today El Alto has surpassed La Paz and is the second - largest city in Bolivia , a boiling pot of 1 million people .
" No one could imagine this , " Obermaier says .
" The city of La Paz is now a little thing compared with El Alto . "
In Obermaier 's early days there were precious few services for Bolivia 's indigenous rural population – no health centers , little electricity or running water , few schools .
When these people , mainly Aymara Indian subsistence farmers , migrated to El Alto , they lived the same way .
Few formally trained doctors or dentists lived in the city .
Residents were cut off from the traditional healers in their villages .
Infant and maternal mortality were high , and emergency medical care nearly nonexistent .
" For the first eight years I acted as a doctor , taking out teeth , delivering babies .
Not because I knew how , but because I had to , " he says .
Today , instead of pulling teeth himself , Obermaier has built a health center attached to his home church .
For little or no cost , doctors provide basic medical and dental care .
Other projects in the works include a hospice ; a shelter for victims of rape and sexual abuse ; low - cost senior housing ; and a center for treating patients with HIV , only the second such center in Bolivia .
Obermaier has organized teams to go into El Alto 's schools to teach about the disease .
" We 're struggling so this does n't become a city with AIDS , " he says .
His approach to AIDS prevention flies straight as an arrow .
His health center 's walls display large posters encouraging condom use and detailing how HIV transmission can be prevented .
" They 're small things he 's doing , " says Dr. Silvia Villarroel , health director for CARE , the nongovernmental aid agency , " but he 's covering needs of the people that the health system can't cover . "
Obermaier has also built schools and churches – by a conservative estimate , 30 of each .
But trying to pry the exact number of projects out of him is impossible .
" I 've never counted them and I never will , " he declares .
Dr. Villarroel from CARE laughs when asked to estimate how many churches he has built .
" He 's the only one who knows , " she says .
" When I came here I had a clear vision – I 'm never going to build a church , " Obermaier says .
" We celebrated mass in my living room , in the open air .
But the population grew , and I did what I never wanted to do : I built a church . "
Once he started building , a new idea grabbed hold : Since El Alto would continue growing , churches should be built while there is still space to put one in every neighborhood .
Within 15 years El Alto will double in size to 2 million people , and 1.6 million of them will be Roman Catholics , mainly recent immigrants from the countryside , he says .
" They 've lost their roots , " Obermaier says of these new arrivals .
" In the church , they find a spiritual home in a new culture , a mix between the country and the city . "
That loss of roots can mean a slide into crime , alcoholism , or poverty .
Indeed , some describe El Alto as Bolivia 's biggest slum .
But Obermaier sees something else .
Gazing at a courtyard where people are loading building supplies onto trucks , he says , " From the outside , you see nothing , you think it 's total poverty .
But inside , they 're working .
El Alto is rich in work . "
The city has also developed into a flash point where the politics of the poor manifests itself .
In 2003 President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada sent the Army to break up protests against his gas export policy .
Violence exploded .
" It was war , three days of war , " Obermaier recalls .
" I had an ambulance , and all day and night we drove people to the hospitals . "
At least 30 people in El Alto and 80 in the region died in that conflict .
The president left office and fled to the United States soon after .
Obermaier 's energy knows no end .
He often sprints across his churchyard or tears around the city in a 1980s four - wheel - drive vehicle to say five masses a day , beeping and waving at everyone he passes .
Most people smile and wave back .
But his work is n't always met with enthusiasm .
He has clashed with Bolivian President Evo Morales over religious education in schools , and his energetic approach has caused conflicts .
Antonia Castro owns a small store in Obermaier 's parish .
As a longtime resident , she 's been treated at the parish health center over the years .
" He 's helped us a lot , with schools , with churches , " she says of Obermaier .
" When he goes , we 're going to miss him a lot . "
To Obermaier the growing number of evangelical Protestants , which now make up about 20 percent of the population here , is not a threat .
Nor is belief in Pachamama , the Earth Mother of Bolivia 's indigenous Andean religion , which many of his parishioners mix with their Catholicism .
" We 're Bolivian Catholics , not Italian Catholics , not French Catholics , " he says .
" This is our way to feel the same thing . "
Encouraging people to attend church is the reason behind building the churches .
" If you have a church far away , three people come , " he says .
" If it 's close , 300 people come . "
Looking at El Alto 's skyline , punctuated by spires , or driving past schools and health centers he 's helped build , it 's hard to believe how much one man has done .
Yet Obermaier says that he wants nothing more than to be left in peace , anonymous , to continue his work for the rest of his life .
" You should n't be interested in me , because I do the same as everyone else , " he says .
" I do what I can . "

Posted by Alex McLean : I wrote a paper with Dave Griffiths and Nick Collins on the visualisation of live code , exploring ideas around live coding interfaces , accepted for the EVA London 2010 conference in July .
A HTML version is below , or see the PDF Preprint .
Visualisation of Live Code by Alex McLean ( Goldsmiths ) , Dave Griffiths ( FoAM ) , Nick Collins ( University of Sussex ) and Geraint Wiggins ( Goldsmiths ) — Abstract :
In this paper we outline the issues surrounding live coding which is projected for an audience , and in this context , approaches to code visualisation .
This includes natural language parsing techniques , using geometrical properties of space in language semantics , representation of execution flow in live coding environments , code as visual data and computer games as live coding environments .
We will also touch on the unifying perceptual basis behind symbols , graphics , movement and sound .
1. Introduction
Live coding , the improvisation of video and / or music using computer language , has developed into an active field of research and arts practice over the last decade ( Wang and Cook ; 2004 ; Ward et al. ; 2004 ; Collins et al. ; 2003 ) .
Live coding is made possible by dynamic language interpreters , which allow algorithms to run while they are being modified , taking on changes without any break in the audio or visual output generated by the code .
The development of software becomes part of the art in a very real sense ; at the beginning of a typical live coded performance there is no code and no audiovisual output , but the output grows in complexity with the code .
A frequent criticism of computer music is the lack of performance , where an artist hides behind their laptop screen , and the audience is unable to see any activity that might ground their experience of the music ( Cascone ; 2003 ) .
Solutions continue to be explored , with many researchers focussing on developing tangible interfaces which bring the computer closer to a traditional instrument .
However , a live coding tradition has developed taking the straightforward approach of projecting whatever is on the artist ’s screen : the code , moving cursors , the debugging output …
The audience is then able to see the human movements and code structures behind an improvisation .
This tradition of projecting screens is itself open to criticism ; the audience members may feel distracted , or perhaps even excluded by the projection of code written in language they do not necessarily understand .
The alternative of showing nothing , hiding behind a laptop screen , is felt to be untenable , but perhaps more should be understood about the practice of projecting code .
Watching the articulations of a live guitarist may enhance the experience of a listener who does not play a musical instrument themselves .
Can a live coder elucidate the more abstract thinking gestures of their practice ?
The search is on for ways of visualising code development that allows non-programmers to enhance their enjoyment and understanding of a live coded piece .
2. Perceiving code
Generally , a programmer cannot work with their eyes closed ; a programmer ’s text editor is a visual interface1 .
Text editors have gained many features over the last few decades , to the point where we no longer call them text editors but Interactive Development Environments ( IDEs ) .
The visual presentation of code has developed its own aesthetic ; colour is used to highlight syntax , fonts have been designed for code ( e.g. ProFont , proggy ) , and visual tools for navigating around tree - like code structures .
Nonetheless computation is fundamentally about symbol manipulation , and the composition of symbols lies at the heart of every IDE .
When our eyes saccade across code , the shapes on the screen are categorised into these symbols , and we perceive them as the tokens ( words ) and statements ( sentences ) making up our program .
The computer interprets code as a one dimensional string of discrete symbols , but humans perceive it as symbols within a spatial scene .
Expert programmers may be able to chunk larger blocks of code as meaningful entities ; less experienced live code audiences may become stuck on small details , but an elaborate dance of spatial change to code is evident over time .
Our perception of source code is aided not only by spatial organisation , but also by colour highlighting , in - line documentation and the well chosen names given to abstractions and data structures .
These features are collectively known as secondary syntax2 , being that ignored by the interpreter but of benefit to programmers in understanding and organising their code .
A challenge to those pushing the boundaries of programming language design is to find ways of taking what is normally secondary syntax as primary .
For example the ColorForth language uses colour as primary syntax , replacing the need for punctuation .
Even more radically , the instruction set of the Piet language illustrated in Figure 2 is formed by first order colour relationships within a two dimensional grid ; instructions include directional modifiers so that control flow travels in two dimensions .
Piet , among many other esoteric languages , is inspired by the two dimensional syntax of Befunge shown in Fig. 1 , a textual language where arrow - like characters change the direction of control flow .
Some languages bordering on mainstream , such as Haskell and to a lesser extent Python have a syntax that takes two dimensional arrangement into account when grouping statements , although this is otherwise unusual .
Secondary syntax is of great importance to human understanding , despite being ignored by the computer interpreter .
Without spatial layout and elements of natural language a program would be next to unreadable by humans .
Humans live an embodied existence in a spatial environment , and while we are perfectly able to perform computation , our spatial ability still supports such thought processes ( Gärdenfors ; 2000 ) .
As a result source code , as Human Computer Interface , is a half - way mixture of geometrical relations and symbolic structures .
This is true even of the ‘ patcher ’ dataflow languages in common use in the digital arts ( Puckette ; 1988 ) , such as Max and PureData .
Patcher languages are often described as ‘ visual ’ , but in fact all the functions are defined textually , and the visual arrangement is purely secondary syntax 3 .
Visualisation of code may either act as secondary syntax in order to enhance code comprehension for human viewers , or go further as primary syntax to enhance meaning for both humans and computers .
The latter is of particular interest , as to some extent it requires making models of human perception the basis of computer language .
2.1 . Morphology of Sound , Shape and Symbols
TurTan is a geometric visual live coding language introduced by Gallardo et al. ( 2008 ) , using the technology of the Reactable ( Jordà et al. ; 2007 ) .
The functions of the language are manipulated as physical blocks that are placed on a tabletop interface , with nearest neighbours forming a sequence , and relative angle mapping to the function ’s parameter .
The functions describe turtle graphics operations , and the resulting recursive forms are continuously updated on the table surface display .
TurTan inspired a system by Alex McLean and introduced here , with the working title of Acid Sketching .
In Acid Sketching , a sound is specified simply by drawing a shape , where morphological measurements are mapped to parameters of an acid bassline synthesiser .
The area of a shape is mapped to pitch , its regularity ( perimeter length vs area ) mapped to envelope modulation , and relative angle of central axis mapped to resonance .
Several such shapes are drawn in an arrangement , where a minimum spanning tree of their centroids is taken as a polyphonic sequence , where distance equals relative time .
Feedback may be projected back on to the drawing surface , so shapes flash red as they are triggered .
A static figure would not make this clearer , however illustrative video is available online at http://yaxu.org/acid-sketching/.
While Acid Sketching and TurTan are far from what is typically understood as live coding , both lead us to challenge understanding of the role of symbols , shape and geometry in computation .
Investigating how such concrete forms of interaction could be married with the abstractions of general , Turing complete programming languages could be an interesting research topic itself .
Critically connected to live coding engagement with time - based media , is the time - based revelation of code itself .
For electroacoustic music , Pierre Schaeffer ’s theories of sound timbre have been further dynamised into the time - variant sonic gestures of Denis Smalley ’s spectromorphology ( Landy ; 2007 ) .
For live coding , we might analogously dub ’ codeomorphology ’ as the changing shape of code over time .
Examples include the accumulating code revisions referenced on the edge of ChucK language Audicle documents , or SuperCollider ’s ‘ History ’ class to document a live code performance .
More visual representations of change over time would include accessible visualisations of programmer activity .
Metrics might be displayed to characterise changes per second , from coarse keystroke counts to the depth of parse tree disruption ; this brings us to self - evaluating performances , and coder re-coding of their very visualisations …
3. Visual experiments in live code
This section serves to introduce four novel visual / geometric live coding systems by Dave Griffiths , namely Scheme Bricks , Betablocker , Al - Jazari and Daisy Chain , along with some of the systems which inspired them .
All of these languages were constructed within Fluxus , a game engine designed for live coding performances and experiments and available under a free ( GPL ) license from http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/.

Figure 7 : A section of a Daisy Chain program .
Computation is a metaphorical movement , where algorithmic processes operate on data ( which can include the algorithms themselves ) in memory in the discrete time steps of the CPU .
Ways of visualising memory as it is changed have been developed for conventional debuggers , particularly in microcontroller applications where memory is small enough to be viewed in its entirety .
More novel visualisations also exist , such as Tierra , an artificial life simulation where code evolves in a Darwinian competition which can only be appreciated when viewed as such , or Core War ( Fig. 3 ) , a game where player / programmers write code which fight over memory address space .
Live coding has the unique opportunity to visualise the movement of an underlying process while it is being formed .
This helps an audience appreciate a live coding performance in a more meaningful way – as it bridges the gap between an abstract description of a process ( the code ) and process itself ( the generated pattern of movement through memory ) .
Betablocker ( Fig. 4 ) is a raw visualisation of an imaginary 8 - bit processor operating in 256 bytes of memory .
This brightly coloured live coding environment is operated by writing assembly code with a gamepad .
The processes are visualised while they operate on the memory addresses and trigger sound events .
Processes are able to modify themselves and each other , resulting in highly dynamic relationships which are challenging to control .
A more traditional method of programming is employed in Scheme Bricks ( Fig. 6 ) , a geometric interface for constructing Scheme programs .
Scheme Bricks takes advantage of the isomorphism of code and data in the Scheme programming language , and is inspired by the Scratch language designed for use by children ( Resnick et al. ; 2009 ) .
Scheme Bricks allows you to drag , drop and plug together programs rather than typing .
This has some potential side effects ; in a performance situation , it is impossible to have a mismatched parenthesis error , as is common in other lisp - like languages .
It is quicker to change the overall structure of the program as sections can be removed and reinserted easily by drag / drop actions .
Unwanted sections are pulled out of the program and set aside rather than being deleted , and accumulate around the program as ‘ spare parts ’ which are often later ‘ recycled ’ by being pulled back into another section .
Scheme Bricks uses visual feedback to relate sound events to the code ; the instruction which triggered a sound event flashes as the sound is played .
This minimal approach to process visualisation makes the relationship between sound and code structure clearer than Betablocker ’s more complete visualisation , and is useful for the performer to immediately locate the code generating a particular sound event .
Daisy Chain ( Fig. 7 ) is an attempt to embrace less rigid structures while maintaining enough of a computational basis to qualify as a live coding performance .
It follows a processing system based on Petri nets ( Petri ; 1966 ) , where executable instruction tokens move around a directed graph .
Daisy Chain programs create and modify the graph topologies that they inhabit , producing sounds as a side effect of the computation .
The look of the performance was designed to be as far from conventional programming as possible , hand animated flowers and drawn instruction symbols moving around graphs constrained by spring models .
The nodes of a Daisy Chain graph have a fixed lifetime , which was introduced in order to counter a common problem with live coding where the audience watching and performer concentrating on programming tend to perceive time differently .
Daisy Chain prevents musical structures from persisting too long , keeping the performance moving forward at a rate the performer can control beforehand .
3.2 . Computation in game worlds
Code has a long tradition of use in games as a gameplay mechanic , an early example being Core War developed in the mid 1980s and discussed above in § 3.1 .
More recent games such as Carnage Heart and Marionette Handler are mainstream games for the Playstation which employ programming environments using icons .
These programs are used to control robots which battle it out in large virtual arenas .
Popular game titles such as Little Big Planet allow the player to construct machines as part of game worlds , complex enough to support Turing complete computation .
Kodu , a research project at Microsoft goes even further , as an end - user games programming environment on the XBox .
Al - Jazari is a deliberate attempt to fuse games and live coding performances .
It was designed to use a similar visual process to BetaBlocker , but this time mediated through the actions of robotic agents moving around a 3D world , triggering sounds as they do so ( Fig. 5 ) .
The use of visual agents following commands rather than abstract processes is intended to make the performance more immediately understandable for the audience .
Al Jazari has been expanded as an art installation , audience participatory performance and recently as a facebook game – with the aim to increase the accessibility of live coding to the point where anyone can become a live coder .
4. Conclusion
Visualisation is central to live coding .
In this article , we have confronted how code is perceived by performers and audiences , and in what ways visual elements contribute to the primary syntax and semantics of a programming language meant for live coding .
Consideration of visual elements of code have also become essential as live coding has formed the basis of virtual game worlds .
We have introduced a number of novel systems , presented here as explorations of these themes .
Visualisation of live code however remains under - investigated in terms of the psychology of programming ; while Blackwell and Collins ( 2005 ) lead the way into HCI , evaluation protocols are yet to be adapted and applied to experience of live coded performances .
This is however fertile ground for practice based research , and we anticipate the changing shapes of code over time , a codeomorphology at timescales from individual performances to lifetimes of artistic and technological development .

1 . A counter - example would be programming interfaces for the blind , which employ speech synthesis .
2 . The term ‘ secondary syntax ’ is problematic .
Firstly , secondary syntax is only secondary relative to the computer interpreter , and not the human .
Secondly , secondary syntax is not syntax in any clear sense ; indeed spatial relationships are the basis of semantic meaning as understood in the field of cognitive linguistics .
However as secondary syntax is the standard term used in the field of Human Computer Interaction ( HCI ) we persist with using it here .

NEW YORK / SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Electric carmaker Tesla Motors
Corp ’s initial public offering zoomed ahead on Tuesday with shares rallying more than 40 percent as investors bet that electric cars would define the future of transportation .
Tesla ’s shining debut came despite weakness in the broad market and as other auto stocks were hit by concerns of a global slowdown .
Tesla was the top gainer on the Nasdaq on Tuesday , offering hope to other companies mulling initial public offerings but which may have shied away given recent volatility .
Tesla ’s closing share price of $ 23.89 boosted its market capitalization to $ 2.22 billion , compared with $ 1.6 billion on Monday night .
It is the first initial public offering by an American automaker since Ford ’s debut in 1956 .
The debut comes amid heightened interest in electric cars and as major automakers gear up to launch various types of battery - powered vehicles , including plug - in hybrids .
“ They ’re competing against both internal combustion engines and alternative fuels like fuel cells , compressed natural gas and things like that , ” said Matt Therian , an analyst with Connecticut - based IPO research house Renaissance Capital .
“ It ’s probably too early to say that electric vehicles are definitely going to be the next thing in cars , but if they are I think the potential is huge . ”
Analysts say that the cars may be sleek , but the shares will be volatile in the near term .
The Palo Alto , California - based company is losing money and does not expect to be profitable for at least two years .
“ A lot of people were puzzled about why we were going public without profits , ” CEO Elon Musk , dressed in jeans and wearing a plaid blazer and a shepherd ’s checked shirt , told reporters outside the Nasdaq building in Times Square .
“ The reason we are not profitable today is because we are in the midst of expanding with the Model S ( sedan ) , ” said Musk .
The IPO is also the first for the eccentric and charismatic Musk , who is the inspiration for Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark character in “ Iron Man ” and also has a cameo role in this summer ’s sequel .
The serial entrepreneur , who turned 39 on Monday , previously sold most of his bigger ventures , including online payment company PayPal to eBay for $ 1.5 billion in 2002 .

The Tesla IPO also provided much - needed liquidity for Musk who had declared in February that he was broke .
The sordid details of his financial status came to light in court papers of an ongoing bitter divorce dispute with his estranged wife Justine Musk , the author of supernatural fantasy novels .
PAPER MILLIONAIRES
The IPO has yielded millions of dollars for some of the early investors in Tesla , which was founded in 2003 .
But major shareholders still have to wait until the 180 - day lock - in period to expire to cash in .
Tesla is strongest first - day performance since Financial Engines Inc ’s March stock debut , when it saw a 44 percent jump .
Musk , Tesla ’s largest shareholder who has poured in more than $ 70 million of his own money , owns 28.4 percent of the company .
His stake is now worth more than $ 650 million .
He made $ 15.45 million by selling part of his shares during the IPO .
German giant Daimler has seen a nice return on its investment in the startup in 2009 .
The 8 percent stake of Blackstar Investco , a 60/40 partnership between Daimler and Abu Dhabi ’s Aabar Investments , is now worth $ 178 million .
The quickest return was on the investment made by Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp , which bought $ 50 million worth of shares in a private placement at the IPO price .
That is now worth about $ 70 million .
The other big winners include Abu Dhabi ’s Al Wahada Capital Investment with a 7.8 percent stake that is now worth about $ 174 million , and Valor Equity Partners with a 5.25 percent stake now worth about $ 117 million .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
Also , VantagePoint Venture Partners ’ 6.6 percent stake is now worth about $ 164 million .
Tesla ’s $ 2.22 billion market cap is higher than the valuation of Swedish brand Volvo , which former owner Ford Motor Co sold for $ 1.8 billion .
General Motors ’ luxury Saab unit fetched only $ 400 million .
Despite the rousing day one , Tesla faces an uphill battle .
The company has delivered slightly more than 1,000 of its Roadsters after early setbacks and a slower - than - expected start of production .
The company is also facing upcoming competition from the $ 32,500 Nissan Leaf that will hit the market this year .
Other electric cars expected to launch this year include Chinese automaker BYD ’s E6 and GM ’s Chevy Volt .
Since its start , the company has burned through $ 230 million of cash while recording revenue of just $ 148 million .
It expects losses to deepen as it devotes the next year to preparing to manufacture Model S , a luxury electric sedan it plans to launch in 2012 and to sell starting from $ 57,400 .
Musk , co-founder of the company , said his company could be profitable if it continued to make pricey sports cars , but is instead forgoing income to build a cheaper car .
The company will go through a fair chunk of 2011 without any products for sale , thanks to tooling changes at a supplier .
Production will resume only in 2012 when the mass - market Model S comes online .
But investors are focusing on the opportunity instead of the risks .
Musk told investors recently that his 7 - year - old startup is closer to a technology company than a stodgy car maker .
He called his car “ a freaking technology velociraptor , ” ready to revolutionize the way Americans buy and drive cars .
Underwriters on the IPO are led by Goldman Sachs & Co , Morgan Stanley , JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank Securities .
Tesla raised $ 226 million in the initial public offering Monday night , selling 3.3 million shares after it increased its IPO share by 20 percent .
The IPO was priced at $ 17 a share .
Tesla ’s stock rise occurred on a day when the Dow Jones industrials average dropped 2.7 percent and Ford Motor Co shares fell 5.3 percent .
The Rockies may have lost to the Red Sox last night , but they won with Sandy Snow .
Earlier this season , Snow had been breastfeeding her daughter , Ashlie , at a game when Coors Field personnel asked her to move out of view , even though only Ashlie 's toes were exposed .
Snow was planning a " nurse - in " protest at the ballpark , but that 's now off , thanks to a heartfelt apology from Rockies guest services director Steve Burke .
Here 's what he had to say .
Sandy ,
I would like to apologize for the situation that arose at the game you attended at Coors Field .
Our goal is that each Guest has a memorable experience when attending a Rockies game , unfortunately we were unable to make this happen for you and your family .
It is regrettable that we were not able to speak that night as I believe we could have explained our actions to your satisfaction .
We have no policy prohibiting breastfeeding in the park , in fact it is something that occurs quite often here .
We work hard to make Coors Field a family ballpark and believe that breastfeeding is something that goes with the family environment .
I have spoken to the staff involved and each of them assure me they were only trying to offer you alternatives to feeding in the seating area .
Normally our interactions with a mother who wishes to breastfeed involves her asking for a more private area away from the crowd .
I believe that the staff assumed they were helping by offering these alternatives , when in fact you just wanted to attend to your child and continue to enjoy the game .
I can understand this was not how you perceived their actions and were offended .
I can only apologize and use this situation to educate my staff to prevent a similar situation in the future .
We have instructed the staff that if a mother who is breastfeeding does not ask for assistance to continue to do their jobs like they normally would and not approach her with suggestions of alternate areas .
If they feel that the mother would benefit from these suggestions ; such as a very hot day or adverse weather , to begin the interaction by informing her that there is no issue with feeding in the seating area but we can provide alternate areas for her and her child if she would like .
I would like to invite you back to a game as our guest to make up for the game you missed because of this issue .
Please look at the schedule and select a date that works for your family and contact me so I can arrange for those tickets .
Again please accept my apology for this unfortunate situation , with the understanding that future outcomes will be understood and handled appropriately from my staff when dealing with breastfeeding families .

Marcus du Sautoy argues that mathematics is the driving force behind modern science : German mathematician , Carl Friedrich Gaus .
This ten part history of mathematics from Newton to the present day , reveals the personalities behind the calculations : the passions and rivalries of mathematicians struggling to get their ideas heard .
Professor Marcus du Sautoy shows how these masters of abstraction find a role in the real world and proves that mathematics is the driving force behind modern science .
It was the German scientist and mathematician , Carl Friedrich Gauss , who said mathematics was the Queen of Science .
One of his many mathematical breakthroughs , the Gaussian or normal distribution , is the lifeblood of statistics .
It underpins modern medicine and is a valuable tool in the fight against prejudice .

From 2010 .
The forces of awesome randomness strike again !
Japanese doom overlords Boris have teamed up with a truly unexpected collaborator : Ian Astbury , the gigantic - voiced yowler from metal mystics the Cult .
Together , they 've recorded an EP called BXI , which Southern Lord will release on CD and 12 " vinyl in September .
Boris and Astbury recorded the EP together in Tokyo , and Sunn o ) ) ) mastermind Stephen O'Malley designed the packaging .
Astbury sang three of the EP 's four songs .
The other is a cover of the Cult's " Rain " , featuring Boris ' Wata on vocals .
We asked Boris drummer / vocalist Atsuo a few questions about the EP over email , through a translator .
Our interview , as well as the EP 's tracklist , is below .
Pitchfork : How did this collaboration happen ?
Did you approach Ian Astbury , or did he approach you ?
Atsuo : From Boris .
We had gotten opening offers from the Cult a few times , but we could n't make it , simply because of schedule conflicts , though we would like to do something with them at some point .
During Boris ' own recording session early this year , we thought it would be cool if we could work with Ian on some songs .
Pitchfork :
Was it a challenge to work with a singer with such a big voice ?
A : It was not an adventure sort of thing .
It was simply a different process of songwriting from what we usually do .
Pitchfork : Did you actually record the songs in the studio together ?
And what was it like working with Astbury ?
A : Ian came over to Tokyo by himself , and we tracked together in the studio .
He is not only a great singer but also a very nice guy on a personal level .
We respect him , and it is always important for Boris to work with such a respectful artist .
Pitchfork : Was Astbury familiar with your music before you recorded this EP together ?
A : He said so .
He actually came to our shows sometimes , bought our records and loved it .
Pitchfork :
What does Astbury think of your " Rain " cover ?
A : He loved it very much , and said it was a big gift for him .
Pitchfork :
If you were to perform live with Astbury , how would it work ?
Would he sing with you for an entire set ?
A : Actually , we did it in Sydney , Australia on May 29 .
For me , it was a new band thing more than collaboration work .
Both of us absolutely enjoyed it .
Pitchfork :
What 's your favorite Cult record ?
A : " Love " and Southern Death Cult [ the goth - rock band that went on to become the Cult ] .
Let me say not a particular record but their whole career , since they always try to do new things on each record .
Pitchfork :
Are there any other singers you 'd like to work with ?
A : Not at this moment .
Collaboration is not a thing that we are always aiming or looking for .
It happens in a very spontaneous and natural way every time .
Same goes for any recording or live performance process of Boris .
Pitchfork : Astbury angered a lot of people a few years ago when he replaced Jim Morrison in the reunited Doors .
Do you have any feelings about that ?
A : He did ?
How come a lot of people got mad with him ?
I do n't even understand .
We did " The End " at the Sydney show together , actually .
Rock history should always be revised .

The way the article describes only three tribes of Native Americans in New Jersey , makes it obvious why the NJ Sand Hill Band of Lenape and Cherokee Indians , headed by Chief Yonaguska Holloway , may not get a fair Federal trial in the State of NJ .
Chief Holloway ’s tribe , the only indigenous tribe in the state , is n’t even mentioned in the Committee report that the article is based on nor the article itself .
Neither is their ally , the Ani Tsalagi Oneselagi Northeastern Band , the Cherokee tribe formed here in the 1830 ’s , headed by Principal Chief Darius TwoBears Ross .
The article quotes the flawed NJ Commission on American Indian Affairs Committee report on Indian tribes in New Jersey :
" It reflects lingering discrimination , ignorance of state history and culture . "
Interesting take , when you consider that our state history includes former Governors honoring the Sand Hill tribe as far back as the 1940 ’s when even the Smithsonian listed the Sand Hill as the only indigenous tribe left that still practiced their traditions and arts .
The new Committee that came up with those words actually does not acknowledge the Sand Hill at all .
The tribe was known and treated as such by NJ State Government UNTIL THE CREATION OF THE NJ COMMISSION that wrote the report that denies they exist .
And
" whose descendants have lived here peacefully and productively for more than 350 years . "
The actual historical record – archeologically goes back 1500 years to at least the age of bones discovered here that are linked by DNA to the current Chief of the Sand Hill tribe .
The tribe that the NJ Indian Commission will not admit is indigenous and appears nowhere in this article .
" Reports estimate approximately 20,000 New Jersey citizens belong to one of the three tribes that are indigenous to the state .
Those tribes include the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape of Cumberland and Salem Counties , the Powhatan Renape of Burlington County , and the Ramapough Lenape of Mahwah and Ringwood . "
The problem is , the Powhatan and Nanticoke only came to NJ in the 1970’s .
These two tribes are NOT indigenous to NJ .
John Norwood – a Tribal Councilman of the Nanticokes states :
" We have never looked like the southwestern stereotype .
That we never lived in teepees in New Jersey ... That Playing Indian by wearing our regalia and misappropriating our cultural and spiritual practices is insulting to many of us . "
Of course they would n’t have lived in teepees in NJ .
The Nanticokes only moved here in the 1970’s .
The 1970’s .
It is ironic that the tribe lamenting the misappropriation of their culture moved here in the 1970 ’s , took the name of Lenape and now appears to be preventing recognition of the Lenape tribe that was already here .
The interesting thing is – the Ramapough , who had been known by the Smithsonian up till the 1970’s as the Jackson Whites , is closer to what the Commission considers " inter - tribal " people - those not in an official tribe .
They are a 501.c3 with a CEO – not a Chief .
They are a mix of Dutch , African , Lenape , Cherokee , AND Tuscarora .
While the Sand Hill are the Lenape – the very folks who were here for not just 350 years – but THOUSANDS of years , who met Henry Hudson in 1609 and then married the Cherokee who migrated here in 1711 after the Cherokee were displaced from the Southern states .
While it may appear heartening on the surface to see a story raising the issue of discrimination against the Native Americans in NJ , it is painfully ironic that this article , in a publication by lawyers , neglects to mention the most egregious case of discrimination against Native Americans in recent history , the alleged attempt to completely erase from NJ history any mention of the two oldest tribes left in NJ .
The Smithsonian in 1948 listed the Sand Hill tribe as the only indigenous tribe left in the state of NJ still practicing their customs , language and arts .
The Ani Tsalagi are descendents of the Cherokee that migrated here in the early 1700 ’s as well as those who came to NJ during the Trail of Tears and formed the Ani Tsalagi Onaselagi Northeastern Band in the 1830’s .
They are not mentioned in the article , while the three " groups " currently represented on the NJ Indian Commission , The Ramapough ( not a tribe ) , Nanticokes ( not indigenous ) , and Powhatan ( also not indigenous ) are mentioned as though all three are NJ indigenous tribes .
This appears to be an epic case of identity theft .
In recent years , the Chief of the Nanticokes - who have attempted to build a casino in Alpine NJ , of all places – accidentally , publicly admitted his tribe only came to NJ only in the 1970’s .
The Nanticokes , in fact , came only at the invitation of Sam Beeler , internationally known and respected former Chief of the NJ Sand Hill Band of Lenape and Cherokee Indians – and the very man the Nanticokes appear now to deny even knowing .
The Powhatan tribe – which every 4th grader knows as Pocohontas ’ tribe - is from Virginia .
But , Pocohontas was not a Jersey girl .
Again , in proof that no good deed goes unpunished , Sam Beeler was the one who extended an invitation to the Powhatans to set up a home here in NJ – in the 1970’s .
They too , now allegedly disavow even knowing the man .
To acknowledge him is to perhaps acknowledge that he is telling the truth and that they are NOT indigenous to NJ .
( Recently it is rumored that the Powhatans are allegedly under investigation by the IRS for disappearing Federal money that should have gone to the indigenous tribes . )
Now , the Ramapough are quite another story , altogether .
The Ramapough were known only as the Jackson Whites until the 1970 ’s , when Sam Beeler tried to help them also .
The Smithsonian in 1948 identified the " Jackson Whites " as a mestizo people , a group who are not a tribe , but a diverse collection of people ( Dutch , African , Lenape , Cherokee , AND Tuscarora ) who make a group by living in the same place and intermarrying .
In the 1970 ’s , Sam Beeler helped them set up a non-profit organization and gave them a new name .
This is when the name Ramapough came to be used to describe the group that had been known as the Jackson Whites even by the Smithsonian , up until the 1970’s .
It appears that the NJ Indian Commission is not concerned about the actual history of the last two real Indian Tribes of NJ , but only the " history " of the 3 " groups " represented on the Commission - groups that are either not indigenous to NJ or not an actual tribe .
Autumn Wind Scott , the current Chair of the NJ Indian Commission , who claims Ramapough descent , is quoted extensively throughout the Bar Association ’s article .
When I spoke to representatives of the Sand Hill , they said to me
" We hope the NJ Indian Commission keeps it up .
They are making our case " .
The Indian Commission appears to be giving actual proof of the pattern of alleged actions by the State of New Jersey designed to rob the NJ Sand Hill Band of Lenape and Cherokee Indians and Ani Tsalagi Onaselagi Northeastern Band of their history , heritage , artifacts , and sovereign rights .
How did this get so out of hand ?
You have to go back at least 10 years .
That was when Chief Lone Bear Revey died .
Lone Bear for many decades had been the well known public face of the Native Americans in NJ and well known to Trenton as well as the force behind getting the Waterloo Village Lenape display up and running .
He was chief of the NJ Sand Hill Band of Lenape and Cherokee Indians until shortly before his death in 1998 when he named Sam Beeler to succeed him as Chief and as head of the NJ Indian Office .
Lone Bear was barely in the ground before Crazy Horse of the Powhatans pushed to create the NJ Indian Commission , even though Lone Bear ’s NJ Indian Office had been serving that role for many , many years – and still is .
In a recent move reminiscent of the battle over schoolbooks in Texas teaching creationism , the NJ Indian Commission appears to be promoting a version of NJ state history to be taught in our schools .
The newsletter with the article in question was found in a pile given out in a school .
" Autumn Wind Scott said that efforts are under way to expand the core curriculum standards in New Jersey to include lessons about the history of New Jersey ’s indigenous people – a content area that she said is sorely lacking " .
The reason it is sorely lacking is because any version of NJ history that omits the Sand Hill while teaching that the Nanticokes and Powhatan are indigenous to NJ is not history , it is fiction .
However , the curriculum Autumn Wind appears to be promoting wipes out the heritage , culture , arts and language of a population of Native American tribal members that still resides in NJ after thousands of years and has never left - the Lenape – as well as our Cherokee tribe whose family members suffered during the Trail of Tears .
Native Americans who , it appears , the Commission does n’t deem fit to even mention , nor give a voice to .
The Committee ’s report also
" called out statements by uninformed or bigoted teachers who claim that there are no American Indian tribal groups in New Jersey . "
An ironic statement considering the Committee refuses to acknowledge the two OLDEST tribes in the state .
Not only is the re-education happening in the school arena .
The State Archives have also been rumored to be sanitized , and artifacts belonging to the NJ Sand Hill tribe have already been removed from museums .
In addition , pressure has been applied - Chief Holloway has been physically threatened , followed , his home broken into , and his brake lines cut .
It is alleged that attorneys who initially agreed to take on this case have been threatened with blacklisting for representing Chief Holloway ’s tribe .
It appears the effort to erase Chief Holloway ’s tribe from history extends to the internet as well .
Wikipedia has been edited to include only the " groups " on the Commission , and I and other bloggers have been threatened with lawsuits for simply blogging about this case .
Other bloggers have also been harassed for being sympathetic to Chief Holloway ’s tribe , allegedly by members of the NJ Indian Commission .
The folks who threatened lawsuits against me had members of the Commission copied on those emails .
I have even found online letters sent to historians around the state that attempt to discredit Chief Holloway ’s side of the story .
It appears to be a concerted and ham - fisted effort to erase Chief Holloway ’s tribe , deliberate and widespread and with a paper trail for these actions going back ten years .
Most recently , I was informed that the Federal Government notified an oil company interested in drilling off the NJ coastline who wanted to speak with Native American tribes , to speak with the only indigenous tribe left – The Sand Hill Band of Lenape and Cherokee .
However , it appears that someone in Trenton allegedly intervened and excluded Chief Holloway and his tribe from that meeting .
( Not surprisingly , a fee of 6 million of dollars was involved . )
According to the article :
" It is believed that changes sought must begin with legislation that officially recognizes the three Native American tribes indigenous to New Jersey .
A bill is now pending in the New Jersey legislature that provides official state recognition of these tribes ‘ for the limited purpose of assisting these tribes in establishing eligibility for federal education , job training , and housing benefits and federal protection for the sale of artwork and of the right to engage in traditional religious practices and ceremonies " .
The bill mentioned sounds suspiciously like Senator Loretta Weinberg ’s bill , which she wrote to give the Sand Hill and the Ani Tsalagi tribes representation on the Commission .
The new bill allegedly states boldly that the Ramapough , Nanticokes and Powhatans are indigenous tribes to NJ .
None of the tribes on the Commission had to prove their background before being appointed to the Commission .
It is rumored that because of the recent Federal investigation into millions of dollars missing that were to go to NJ ’s indigenous tribes , under scrutiny , the Powhatans and Nanticokes have finally admitted to the Federal government that they are not indigenous to NJ and have only been here since the 1970’s .
What the Commission could not do with the truth or evidence , they appear to be attempting with legislation .
The only problem is , when the three " tribes " on the Commission went to the BIA for Federal Recognition ALL THREE TRIBES were turned down because the Powhatans are from Virginia and the Nanticokes from Delaware , and the Ramapough Indians are a non-profit organization , not a tribe .
It also appears that Judge Hayden , the Federal judge who has been allegedly stalling this trial since last year , has taken early retirement , though no one involved in the case has been formally notified .
It would appear that the Federal Government has finally stepped in , but they have not reached out directly to Chief Holloway .
As the Federal government appears to play ostrich and while the NJ Indian Commission appears to be re-writing history , the NJ Sand Hill Band of Lenape and Cherokee Indians are using this time to gather the evidence they need to make their case that much more ironclad .
And as the Federal government appears to drag their feet and avoid the inevitable negotiating table , the stakes get bigger .
As members of the NJ Indian Commission continue what appears to be a crazy version of whack - a- mole to eliminate any mention of the two oldest tribes in the state from history as well as the internet ( good luck with that one ) , AND our schools , the case has gone international .
The ridiculousness of the situation is that a simple sit- down with President Obama could go a long way toward resolving what is turning into an epic saga .
I have met these folks and have been trying to tell their story for 2 years now .
They are patient and reasonable people , but everyone has a limit .
Justice delayed is justice denied , and as their rights have been trampled ever since they reached out a hand to Henry Hudson 400 years ago , patience is wearing thin .
Many Americans today regret the horrific way the First Americans were treated throughout our history .
Here is our Federal government ’s chance to make a difference .
With the very last Native American tribe left who never subjugated themselves to the Federal Government or signed away their land .

about this card
Today is re-hash Wednesday , so I get to post an older card that I happen to like .
This one has a picture of a duck .
It also promotes empathy , which I read is one of the great themes of art and literature .
Empathy , a heightened sensibility to the rich tapestry that is the human experience , and ducks .
It 's all there , see .
Delightful task ! to rear the tender thought ,
To teach the young idea how to shoot , To pour the fresh instruction o'er the mind , To breathe the ' enlivening spirit , and to fix
The generous purpose in the glowing breast .
Here will I hold .
If there 's a power above us —
And that there is , all nature cries aloud Through all her works —
He must delight in virtue ;
And that which He delights in must be happy .

After yesterday 's depressing picture , how about one that will make you smile ?
The ever - amazing Cassini spacecraft sent back this pretty nifty shot of Saturn 's icy moon Rhea playing peekaboo in the rings :
Beautiful , is n't it ?
You can see that Rhea was on the other side of the rings from Cassini when this image was taken , and that the spacecraft was almost , but not quite , in the plane of the rings , too .
But there 's more to this shot ...
Take a closer look .
What 's that , hiding in a gap in the rings , apparently hovering over Rhea 's terminator ( the line dividing day and night ) ?
Surprise !
It 's Prometheus , a tiny potato orbiting the planet much closer in .
It 's far smaller than Rhea , only about 120 km ( 75 miles ) long versus Rhea 's 1530 km ( 950 miles ) diameter .
Rhea is Saturn 's second largest moon -- only Titan is bigger -- and one of the ten biggest moons in the entire solar system .
Prometheus , on the other hand , is so small it was n't even discovered until the Voyager 1 probe spotted it in 1980 .
Nice .
And I 'm sure there 's science galore to be extracted from this image , but sometimes I think pictures like this will have a more lasting impact because they are simply so amazingly cool .

Obsessed sa 7 . Kumusta na kaya si James Yap ?

Sa tingin mo magagawa niya ang mga nagawa mo ?
Kung mamalasin siya , never .
Pero kung mamalasin kayo , and I mean , the Filipino people , he ’ll even exceed it .
Ako na ang nagsasabi : he ’s got a lot of potential .
Matagal ko na siyang inoobserbahan .
Inoobserbahan from where ?
From heaven ?
I doubt .
Gago !
Basta !
He ’s very promising .
At bentang - benta siya sa mga tao .
Ganyang - ganyan ako nagsimula .
Tandang - tanda ko pa. Hinding - hindi ako pwedeng magkamali .
Tuwang - tuwa ang taumbayan sa akin .
Alam na alam ko ‘yan .
At paulit - ulit talaga ang words na gamit n’yo .
Kaloka ka Mr. President .
So you think mas maraming mapapatay sa Duterte regime at mas malaking pera ang mawawala dahil sa corruption ?
Itaga mo sa bato !
Balikan mo ako after three years .
I ’ll remember that , Sir ! Pag - usapan na lang natin ang ultimate lovey dovie mo .
Patay na ako .
Konting respeto .
Why ?
Ano bang sinabi ko Mr. President ?

Matalino ako .
‘ Di mo ako pwedeng gaguhin .
Sasabihin mo na naman , “ No pun intended . ”
Huwag mo akong daanin sa pun-pun na ‘ yan .
PUNyeta ka !
My gosh !
Ang init ng ulo !
I was supposed to ask something about your ultimate love , the former First Lady .
Hayyy .
Nakakaloka .
Masyadong defensive !
Anywy , to be honest , si Mrs Marcos talaga ang ‘ di ko kinakaya .
Eighty - seven na pero bongga pa rin ang aura kahit wala nang gumagalaw sa kanyang mukha !
Well , ‘ yong labi naman , keri pa .
Pero ang mga kilay , pisngi at noo… gosh .
What sorcery is this ?
Are you asking or are you insulting ?
I am describing !
Aha - ha -ha !
In fairness , nasagot kita dun Mr. President !
Going back to the question , lagi pong nagsisimba si Mrs. Marcos sa Baclaran .
Nakasalubong ko pa nga minsan ‘ yon eh. Deadma !
Hindi siya nag - smile , so umirap din ako .
Helllllooooo !
Do you think she prays for you ?
‘ Yun nga sana ang gusto kong iparating sa kanya .
Kasi everytime Meldy prays , ang lagi niyang hiling , “ Lord , please keep Ferdie safe there in heaven . ”
When in fact Sir , nasa impiyerno ka naman talaga , tama ?
Tama !
I mean , pakyu ka .
Wala ako sa hell .
Pagala - gala pa rin ako .
Ay !
Hindi ka tinanggap sa heaven tapos hindi ka rin tinanggap sa hell ?
Walang gustong tumanggap sa ‘ yo , Sir ?
My gosh , I can relate .
Walang network ang gustong tumanggap sa akin .
Sinlamig ng pakikitungo sa akin ng Martial Law victims .
Hugot Sir ?
Once and for all Mr. President , saan mo ba gustong mahimlay ?
Sa Libingan ng mga Bayani o dito sa Ilocos ?
Alam nila ‘ yan .
Buhay pa ako , sinabi ko na : GUSTO KONG ILIBING NILA AKO SA TABI NG AKING MAHAL NA INA DITO SA ILOCOS .
UMOO SILA NOON .
‘ TAPOS NGAYON , GUSTO NILA AKONG ILAYO , AT DALHIN SA TAGUIG !
Kailangang all caps ?
Galit ???
OO , GALIT AKO !
PAGOD NA PAGOD NA AKO UKINAM .
‘ TAPOS MISMONG PAMILYA KO , AYAW AKONG PATAHIMIKIN .
‘ YOT NI INAM !
Kalma lang Sir , lapit na ang 99th birth anniversary mo .
Grabe !
Kung buhay ka pala , bata ka pa sir .
Wala ka pang 100 !
Ang luma ng joke mo .
I know , right ?
Aha - ha -ha !
So , ano na ang iyong birthday wish Mr President ?
Wala na akong mahihiling pa !
Salamat sa social media – mabango na ulit ang pangalan ko .
Ang dami talagang bobo sa Pilipinas .
So , mga apo , share lang nang share ng accomplishments ko .
You ’re doing great .
Hashtag grateful everyday .
Kaya sa kaarawan ko , napakasimple na lang ng aking hiling , Krissy .
This may sound cliché pero ito talaga ang wish ko :
Good health and long life .
Sir ???
Pun intended .
He -he
Agyamanak Mr. President .
Thank you .
Happy birthday and Mabuhay po kayo !
Pun intended , too ?
Ang kulit n’yo !
Ukinam .

Israel recently approached the United States with new requests for security - related purchases , Haaretz has learned .
The requests included Joint Direct Attack Munition ( JDAM ) bombs for the Israel Air Force , as well as a significant expansion of the emergency stores held by the U.S. army in Israel .

The Israeli requests were brought up during recent visits to Washington by Defense Minister Ehud Barak and director - general of the Defense Ministry , Udi Shani , and in conversations with senior administration and Congress officials .
The priority list reflects the security threats the defense establishment believes Israel will face in the next few years , i.e. the eventuality of a prolonged war , which would necessitate using the IAF widely to attack many targets , along with ensuring enough spare parts and supplies .
Israel also requested JDAM bombs , seeking to significantly increase the number of such munitions already in its arsenal .
The JDAM bombs have been used increasingly in recent operations , including in the Second Lebanon War in 2006 and Operation Cast Lead in 2008 .
Israel is also seeking to increase the amount of gear held by the American army in their emergency stores in Israel by 50 % - from $ 800 million to $ 1.2 billion .
The Obama administration placed the stores in Israel in December , as part of a number of steps to improve U.S. assistance to Israeli security .
To date , $ 600 million worth of American emergency equipment has been placed in Israel .
The American stores hold rockets , bombs , aircraft ammunition and armored vehicles , along with other weapons .
The gear fully matches equipment already used by the Israel Defense Forces and is cataloged upon arrival to ensure quick and easy access at a time of need , pending permission from the United States .
The American move has a dual purpose : bringing military equipment closer to areas in which Americans might need to fight , and assisting the U.S. ally should the need arise .
Senior military sources told Haaretz that the IDF attaches great importance to the stores ; in the event of an extensive conflict , considerable time will pass before an airlift of ammunition and spare parts - similar to the one operated during the 1973 Arab - Israeli war - gets under way .
BOLT FROM THE BLUE : Senior Palmerston North firefighter Nick Pine and his family thought an aeroplane had crashed into their home when it was struck by lightning , causing a massive bang and destroying wiring in the home .
It was like a scene from Poltergeist as a deafening crash hit a Palmerston North house , plunging it into darkness , and the door bell started ringing on its own .
As the house quickly filled with a burning smell , senior Palmerston North firefighter Nick Pine snapped out of his fear and into safety mode , realising his house had been struck by lightning , not invaded by ghosts on Sunday night .
His wife Sharon screamed and knocked over her drink as the house shook from the force of the strike .
She called to her two children , Laura , 10 and Amy , 8 .
" I thought the house was going to crumble on top of us , the bang was so loud I thought the world was coming to an end , " she said .
Mr Pine ushered the family to the door before going back in to check the roof was not on fire .
The lightning had struck the television aerial .
His colleagues at the Milson Fire Station quickly arrived and the all - clear was soon given , with no flames , just a strong smell from the smouldered cables .
The house still smelled of burnt wiring yesterday as the family assessed the damage .
The television is still not working at the Tennyson Ave house , the internet has been completely wiped out with no icons appearing on the computer screen , they cannot adjust the hot water in the house , and the electronic garage door is fried and will not open .
Mrs Pine said the sound of the bang was still ringing in her ears .
She and her husband had been on the couch watching a movie when they saw a blue light flash through the partly - opened curtains at about 9.30 pm .
They both leapt off the couch as an almighty bang crashed outside .
Mr Pine said it was so loud he initially thought an aeroplane had hit the house .
" It was the loudest sound I 've ever heard , it sounded like an explosion . "
The car tyres and petrol tanks he had seen explode in his nine years in the Fire Service were nothing compared to the sound , he said .
Adrenalin kept the jumpy household up for the rest of the night , with Mr Pine on alert to make sure the cables did not spark .
Metservice forecaster Heath Gullery said the Pines ' house was the only report of a home being struck by lightning over the turbulent long weekend .
Mr Pine said he thought now was probably a good time to go and buy a Lotto ticket .
" I was saying to the guys at work , I might start going to church now . "

Winnipeg 's first police helicopter wo n't take to the skies before October , police Chief Keith McCaskill said Friday as the city confirmed the awarding of a $ 3.49 - million contract to purchase the aircraft .
KEN GIGLIOTTI / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS Justice Minister Andrew Swan ( from left ) , police Chief Keith McCaskill and Mayor Sam Katz announce the awarding of the helicopter contract Friday to Eurocopter Canada Ltd .
The Winnipeg Police Service hoped to have a Eurocopter Canada E-120B Colibri up in the air in time to patrol the city during the summer , when the most serious street crimes tend to occur .
But it will take six months for the slightly used , French - made aircraft to be outfitted in Fort Erie , Ont. , for police work and then shipped to Winnipeg , McCaskill said .
Three police officers must also be trained to operate on - board equipment such as the aircraft 's spotlight , thermal - imaging camera , police radios , public address system and GPS mapping system .
Two civilian pilots must also be hired , McCaskill said .
" The sooner we can get it in the air , the better , " said the chief , explaining the city has already laid a tremendous amount of groundwork for the aircraft in a short period of time .
" Last year at this time , we had no concept this would occur . "
The City of Winnipeg is covering the cost of acquiring the helicopter and its on - board equipment .
The province has agreed to cover the $ 1.3 - million annual cost of operating the vehicle , which is intended to allow police to more efficiently marshal resources on the ground during incidents such as foot chases .
The helicopter may also be used to apprehend impaired drivers and street racers , search for lost children and Alzheimer 's patients , manage crowds , escort VIPs and serve as a visual deterrent against crime , according to an internal police report obtained by the Free Press under Freedom of Information legislation .
That same report touted Manitoba Public Insurance as a potential sponsor .
But the city is still looking for a corporate sponsor for the aircraft , Mayor Sam Katz said Friday .
Justice Minister Andrew Swan , meanwhile , joked the province is already sponsoring the helicopter to the tune of $ 1.3 million a year .
Earlier this year , Katz and Swan were at loggerheads over operating funding for the chopper .
A handful of city councillors also questioned the need for the aircraft , given the absence of a report justifying the purchase .
That debate has subsided , as even mayoral candidate Judy Wasylycia - Leis said she wo n't second - guess the decision to buy a police helicopter .
But on Friday , she said she 's concerned about the timing of its first flight , which may occur weeks or days before the Oct. 27 civic election .
" It 's interesting timing , " she said at an event to introduce Kevin Chief , the man she wants to be her successor as NDP MP for Winnipeg North .
" There are a lot things the mayor is doing right now that evoke the comment , ' interesting timing . '
" Suddenly , he 's available to go on regular radio shows .
Suddenly , he 's showing up at events and suddenly the helicopter is in the air at around the time of the election .
" It tells me he knows he 's got a real challenge with me and he 's trying to make up for lost ground . "
Wasylycia - Leis said while she has questions about how the decision to purchase a helicopter was made , she believes it 's needed to enhance safety .
" We 're not going to speak against something that has been decided , " Wasylycia - Leis said .
" I think a lot of the public wanted more information than they actually got , but my understanding is the helicopter will provide an important service for Winnipeg .
" I 'm certainly not going to revisit history and question that decision . "

George Herman Ruth , known to the world as " Babe Ruth , " was the first sports superstar .
He might have become baseball 's greatest left - handed pitcher .
Instead , he moved to the outfield and became its greatest hitter .
After leading the Boston Red Sox to two World Series victories , he was traded to the New York Yankees following the 1918 season .
The Yankees , who had never won a pennant before , became perennial American League and World Series champions .
The Red Sox did not win another World Series until 2004 .
Ruth was born on February 6 , 1895 , in Baltimore .
His parents had eight children , but only one other , his sister Mamie , survived infancy .
While his parents worked in the tavern they owned , Ruth spent much of his time on his own and got into trouble frequently .
Unable to control their son's behavior , Ruth 's parents placed him in St. Mary 's Industrial School at the age of seven .
Ruth hated the regimented discipline of the school , but he learned the game of baseball .
By the age of 15 , he was playing both catcher and pitcher for St Mary 's vasity team .
At the age of 19 , Ruth was spotted by Jack Dunn , owner of the Baltimore Orioles of the International League , who signed him to his first professional contract .
Ruth 's parents had given custody of the boy to the Jesuits at the time he enrolled at St. Mary 's , where he was supposed to remain until he turned 21 .
To complete the contract and remove him from the school , Dunn was forced to adopt him .
This led to Ruth 's being described as Dunn 's " baby , " which became " Babe , " the nickname the stayed with him for the rest of his life .
Ruth spent only five months with the Orioles before he was sold to the Boston Red Sox .
During three seasons in Boston , Ruth was primarily a pitcher .
In his first World Series , he pitched 29 2/3rds scoreless innings , breaking Christy Mathewson 's record and setting a mark that would stand for 43 years .
The Red Sox won the World Series that year and again in 1918 .
In three regular seasons , Ruth had compiled a record of 94 wins and 46 losses , but despite his stellar performance as a pitcher , he was already developing a greater reputation as a hitter .
He played some outfield and some first base during the 1918 season .
Playing exclusively outfield for the first time in 1919 , he set the major league record with 29 home runs , but the Red Sox finished far behind in the pennant race .
Following the 1919 season , Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to the New York Yankees to raise money for his Broadway theatrical productions .
The sale price of $ 125,000 was more than double what any team had paid for any baseball player prior to that time , but it would prove to be one of the worst business decisions in history .
Prior to the trade , the Red Sox had won five of the modern , post - 1903 , World Series .
The Yankees had never appeared in one , let alone won one .
It took the Red Sox until 2004 to win their sixth World Series .
With Ruth , the Yankees won their first pennant in 1921 , won another in 1922 , and their first World Series in 1923 .
In 1920 , the Yankees became the first team in baseball history to attract a million paying fans to its stadium , the Polo Grounds , which they shared with the New York Giants .
When Yankee Stadium was opened in 1923 , it became known , with good reason , as " The House that Ruth Built . "
After several spectacular years , Ruth had health problems in 1925 and his home run output declined to 25 .
Some people began to suggest that Babe was past his prime , but Ruth returned to form in 1926 and in 1927 set a single season home run record of 60 that would not be topped until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961 , in a season that was eight games longer .
In 1930 , Ruth was earning a salary of $ 80,000 a year , a spectacular number in that era .
A reporter suggested that perhaps he was overpaid , since Herbert Hoover was only getting $ 75,000 as president of the United States .
Ruth is reported to have replied , " Why not ?
I had a better year than he did . "
There have been several reported variations of the statement .
In game three of the 1932 World Series against the Chicago Cubs , Babe was batting in the fifth inning .
After pitcher Charlie Root took him to a count of two strikes and two balls , he appeared to point to center field and to shout something at Root .
He hit the next pitch about 500 feet into the stands behind center field , the longest home run ever hit at Wrigley Field .
Ruth wanted to manage a major league team following his career , but the opportunity never arrived .
His production began to fall off and he ended his career with the Boston Braves in 1935 .
At the time of his retirement , his regular season record of 714 home runs was hundreds ahead of his closest competitor and would not be exceeded until Hank Aaron hit his 715th in 1974 .
His lifetime slugging average of .690 has never been approached .
When the Baseball Hall of Fame was inaugurated in 1936 , Ruth was one of its first six inductees .
After baseball , Ruth lived a quiet life with his second wife Claire .
He had married his first wife , Helen , in 1914 when she was a 17 - year - old waitress .
The couple had separated by 1926 and the marriage ended tragically when Helen died in an apartment fire in January 1929 .
Ruth married Claire within three months ; they remained together until his death .
During the fall of 1946 , Ruth was diagnosed with a malignant tumor on his neck .
His health began to decline quickly .
Baseball fans honored him on April 27 , 1947 , which was declared Babe Ruth Day for every organized baseball league in the United States .
His jersey number 3 was retired at his last appearance at Yankee Stadium on June 13 , 1948 , which also commemorated the stadium 's 25th anniversary .
Ruth died on August 16 , 1948 .
More than 100,000 people paid their respects at Yankee Stadium and at his funeral at St. Patrick 's Cathedral in New York City .
Rafik Saifi , who came on in the 84th minute — just in time to watch the US win the match — took our his frustrations in the media room by smacking an Algerian journalist right across the mouth .

There was already bad blood between Saifi and Asma Halimi , who writes for Algerian sport newspaper Competition , based on criticisms of him in one of her previous articles .
It 's unclear what started this row ; apparently no words were exchanged before Saifi slapped her .
Do n't worry though ; she gave as good as she got .
I said nothing to him and he reached over and hit me , " Halimi said to Yahoo !

" So I hit him back .
I said nothing to him first . "

Her nail drew blood from his lip , and Halimi was escorted from the interview zone was Saifi fired a water bottle against the wall .

The human knee is beautifully designed for the majority of what man has asked of it in the last 500,000 years .
The simple structure is near ideal for following the perambulations of migrating antelope or fleeing predation from the alpha predators primitive man evolved among .
However , as Jared Hess demonstrated in his bout with Alexander Shlemenko last Thursday at Bellator 20 , the dynamics of an MMA fight can far exceed what nature designed the knee to endure .
The knee joint is composed of the long bone of the femur resting on the relatively flat plateau of the tibia ( the primary bone of the lower leg ) .
The femoral condyles transmit the weight of the body to the smooth , cartilage - covered menisci of the tibia .
The patella , or kneecap , is not truly a component of the joint .
The joint is bound tightly together by four ligaments , which are small bands of dense connective tissue .
Within the deep notch of the femur , “ crossing ” from anterior to posterior , and vice versa , run the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments .
To either side of the joint , providing stability against forces applied to the sides of the knee , are the medial and lateral collateral ligaments .
It was one of these , the LCL , that Hess felt give way in the first takedown of the first round , well before anyone but the fighter and the referee noticed anything amiss .
“ It popped , ” said Hess , who fought on an injured left knee for more than 10 minutes .
“ My knee was done .
It was n’t hurting .
I just had no support .
I could n’t push off on it .
” His corner gave him pragmatic advice : take the fight to the ground and keep it there .
That worked for the better part of two dominant rounds , until early in the third when Shlemenko got to his feet and got separation .
Hess dove for a takedown , trying to protect his knee from a protracted standup battle .
At the same instant , Shlemenko threw a left knee .
Video of the instant of contact shows Hess ’ left leg bearing a portion of his weight , his left hip externally rotated , the left foot planted flat .
As Hess shifts his body to avoid the knee , the flexed left leg takes on additional weight , as well as the force of Shlemenko ’s mass and momentum an instant later .
The long femur acts as a lever , with the medial condyle serving as the fulcrum .
Resisting this force , isolated by the position of the leg and angle of the knee , the already injured LCL exceeds its tolerances .
The knee , already bowed slightly out , buckles and the leg collapses inward and under the falling fighter .
It all occurs in a fraction of a second .
It is probable that this is the exact moment the already injured ligament completely tore .
The fact that Hess was able to continue to fight for an additional 77 seconds is remarkable , but not inconceivable ; with three of its four ligaments intact , the knee maintains basic anatomic stability .
However , as Hess continued to fight , the remaining ligaments -- possibly also injured in the collapse -- were enduring forces for which they were not designed .
When the fight was finally stopped , the first thing the doctor did was bend the knee and pull the tibia forward -- an Anterior Drawer test , checking the competence of the ACL .
The leg moved more than it should .
The fight was over .
Potentially a career as well .
After being evaluated by ER doctors ,
Hess learned that in addition to a ruptured LCL -- which he had known was shot -- he had a meniscus tear and ligamentous laxity .
It could have been worse : Although knee dislocations are rare with isolated LCL tears -- particularly low energy dislocations -- they do occur .
If the tibia is disarticulated and driven back into the popliteal artery , severe vascular compromise and even loss of the limb can occur .
If the tibia moves laterally and tears the nerves that cross the joint , incapacitating foot drop can occur .
Hess ’ work - up showed no sign of such injuries .
Currently
Hess is waiting to meet with his regular orthopedic surgeon to plan a course of treatment .
In this respect he is the beneficiary of the long , broad road paved by football players and their doctors .
When a runner is low - tackled from the side , the disruptive forces blow apart the medical collateral ligament ( MCL ) , and often the ACL and meniscus : the " unhappy triad .
"
The technology developed to repair these injuries is directly applicable to Hess ’ damaged knee .
Surgery , ideally arthroscopic , is needed for total disruption of the ligament .
In the simplest case , the damaged ligament can be sutured back together , or sewn or stapled back into place on the bone from whence it was torn .
In more severe cases , the entire ligament needs to be replaced , either with an autograft , perhaps using a portion of Hess ’ own hamstring tendon , or a cadaver allograft .
Recovery is long but has a high likelihood of being virtually complete .
For many of us , watching and re-watching Hess ’ injury , the most amazing aspect of the entire event is not the failing of the athlete ’s knee but the success of the warrior ’s mind .
Fighting and winning the better part of three rounds on an injured knee , succumbing only when simply walking becomes impossible , is a feat as impressive as any knockout of the night .
It demonstrates -- beyond strength of bone and muscle -- what truly separates elite athletes from all others .

SpaceX completes another Falcon rocket tanking test
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : April 16 , 2010
SpaceX loaded propellants into the Falcon 9 rocket again Friday , one day after President Obama briefly toured the booster 's launch pad during his visit to the Kennedy Space Center .
Officials say the second tanking test , also called a wet dress rehearsal , was planned to verify new cork insulation remains adhered to the 15 - story rocket during tanking .
It also gives the SpaceX launch team more practice before the Falcon 9's first flight , which is scheduled for no earlier than May 8 .
SpaceX rolled the Falcon 9 from an assembly hangar and lifted it vertically at Complex 40 earlier this week .
President Obama received a personal tour of the launch pad Thursday before delivering a speech defending his vision for NASA , which includes more reliance on commercial companies like SpaceX .
The company 's Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft will fly cargo missions to the International Space Stations beginning next year .
SpaceX claims it can design a crewed version of the Dragon within three years , if NASA awards a contract for the work .

Elon Musk , the founder and CEO of SpaceX , hosted Obama on a 15 - minute tour of the complex .
Obama did not visit other launch pads at the Cape during a visit that lasted more than two hours , according to NASA officials .
" The president spent 15 minutes walking around the pad and rocket asking me questions about it , " Musk said .
" For a non-engineer , he displayed an impressive understanding . "
Musk told Spaceflight Now that Obama specifically asked what modifications are required for the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule to be ready for human occupants .
President Obama mentioned the tour at the opening of his remarks to a crowd of NASA and space industry brass later Thursday afternoon .
Friday 's countdown dress rehearsal was the fourth time the 30 - person launch team fueled the two - stage rocket .
During a fueling test in late February , chunks of cork fell from the Falcon 9 after liquid oxygen was removed from the rocket .
Chilled to about - 300 degrees Fahrenheit , liquid oxygen causes the rocket 's structure to contract and expand as it flows in and out of the booster .
The super - cold oxidizer is used by both stages of the Falcon 9 .
The rocket 's Merlin engines consume kerosene as fuel .
The cork is a thermal shield to protect the Falcon 9 first stage during its re-entry into the atmosphere after separating from the second stage three minutes after liftoff .
Once the nine - engine first stage is jettisoned , it is designed to fall more than 50 miles back to Earth , deploy parachutes and splash down in the Atlantic Ocean for recovery .
SpaceX fueled the Falcon 9 twice in early March for a static fire test that checked the rocket 's nine Merlin first stage engines .

Workers added new cork after the engine test , and Musk said managers ordered the new practice countdown to make sure the cork sticks to the rocket .
Engineers also planned electromagnetic compatibility , or EMI , tests with the Air Force Eastern Range while the Falcon 9 is on the pad .
Testing of the rocket 's flight termination system is continuing , according to Musk .
" If we get through the wet dress and EMI tests , we could be ready to launch next week , " Musk said in an interview Thursday .
" The qualification of the FTS is what 's driving us to May . "
The Air Force would use the destruct system to terminate the launch if the Falcon 9 flew off course and threatened the public .
Before the Air Force approves the launch , SpaceX and the supplier of its flight termination system must complete thorough testing of the components and provide the results to the military .
Musk said the schedule looks " promising " for launching in the first half of May .
Over past months , reports have multiplied of Canadian Security Intelligence Service ( CSIS ) visits to the homes and even workplaces of people working for social justice .
In addition to its longstanding and ongoing harassment and intimidation of indigenous peoples , immigrant communities , and others , the spy agency has become much more visible in its surveillance of movements for social justice .
The People 's Commission is aware of dozens of such visits in the Montreal area alone .
People visited range from writers and artists to staff at advocacy organizations and anarchists living in collective houses .
Unannounced , in the morning , the middle of the day or the evening , CSIS agents knock at the door of private homes .
Their interest is far ranging : from the tar sands , to the G8 , to indigenous organizing , Palestine solidarity , Afghanistan ; who you know and what you think .
Their very presence is disruptive , their tone can be intimidating , and their questions intrusive , manipulative and inappropriate .
They guarantee confidentiality -- " just like in security certificate cases " -- and invariably ask people to keep quiet about the visit .
The People 's Commission Network advocates total non-collaboration with CSIS .
That means refusing to answer questions from CSIS agents , refusing to listen to whatever CSIS may want to tell you , and breaking the silence by speaking out whenever CSIS comes knocking .
If you are in immigration proceedings , or in a vulnerable situation , we strongly advise you to insist that any interview with CSIS be conducted in the presence of a lawyer of your own choosing .
Here are 10 good reasons not to talk -- or listen -- to CSIS :
1. Talking with CSIS can be dangerous for your health
Even though CSIS agents do not have powers of arrest and detention , CSIS can and does use information it gathers in seemingly innocuous conversations to write security assessments for immigration applications , detention and deportation under security certificates , various blacklists ( the no-fly list , border watch lists , etc. ) and other purposes .
Innocent comments you make can be taken out of context and misinterpreted , but you will have no opportunity to correct errors , because intelligence information remains secret .
This can have a serious impact on your life .
2. Talking with -- and listening to -- CSIS can be dangerous to others
Just as CSIS can use your words against you , they can use innocuous things you say against others .
In extreme cases , this can lead to situations where people 's lives are at risk .
For example , in the case of Maher Arar , security agencies passed on hearsay information to the Americans that not only proved baseless but led to his rendition to Syria .
CSIS later led efforts aimed at preventing Mr. Arar 's return to Canada .
Hearsay information relied on by CSIS certainly contributed to Adil Charkaoui 's six - and - a- half year struggle against arbitrary detention and deportation to torture under a security certificate .
Moreover , CSIS is known to spread false information about others .
Listening to CSIS creates doubt and can make people afraid to associate with the targets of rumour - mongering , effectively isolating them .
3 . Uphold your privacy and that of those around you
You have the right to privacy , to be free from surveillance , harassment and intimidation .
Refusing to speak with CSIS is one way of asserting those basic rights ; talking with CSIS gives the green light to further intrusion and control .
Moreover , the more you tell them , the greater material they have to justify further surveillance .
4 . The more you talk , the more they come back
Many people are tempted to believe that , if they cooperate with CSIS , they will be left alone because they " have nothing to hide . "
Evidence shows that the contrary is true .
Once you have been identified as a collaborator , CSIS will continue to come back whenever they think you can provide information .
The best way to get CSIS to leave you alone is to refuse to collaborate .
5 . There is nothing to gain from an encounter with CSIS
People are often tempted to sit down with CSIS out of sheer curiosity .
However , CSIS agents are well trained .
What they will let you know is what they want you to know ; it is deliberate .
They may also deliberately spread misinformation either directly or through innuendo and implication .
You have no way of knowing if what they 're telling you or leading you to believe is true .
6. CSIS cannot be trusted
Over the years , CSIS has demonstrated time and again that they lack competence and may act in bad faith .
CSIS played a key role in bungling the Air India investigation ( and , according to the Globe and Mail , a CSIS mole may have actually played a role in the bombing ) ; they destroyed evidence in the Charkaoui security certificate case ; they suppressed the fact that a key informant had failed a lie detector in the Harkat and Almrei security certificate cases ; and they lied to their own oversight body ( the Security Intelligence Review Committee -- SIRC ) in the Bhupinder Liddar case ( also here ) .
CSIS also routinely engages in unethical tactics of intimidation and harassment in their efforts to recruit informers : visiting people at home and at work unannounced , offering money and favours for information , intimidating those with precarious immigration status , intrusive and irrelevant questioning , improper identification , discouraging people from contacting lawyers or suggesting that they contact a lawyer chosen by CSIS .
7. CSIS shares information with untrustworthy and brutal partners
Information provided to CSIS will not stay with CSIS .
The agency admits to having intelligence - sharing agreements with the spy agencies of 147 other countries ; its contemporary colleagues include the CIA , Mossad , the mukhabarats of Syria , Jordan , Morocco , Sudan and Egypt , Turkey 's MIT and many more .
Information sharing continues , despite SIRC 's finding that CSIS " is rarely in a position to determine how information that went to a foreign agency is used , or how information it receives was obtained . "
Anything you tell CSIS could be shared with one of those other agencies , potentially affecting your travels and family abroad .
8. Solidarity against racism and racial profiling
CSIS targets entire communities based on profiling , association and racist conceptualizations of " threat " and " national security . " [ 1 ]
Although indigenous peoples , queer [ 2 ] and racialized communities and immigrants have long been in the sights of colonial Canada 's security agencies , Muslims and Arabs have been the most heavily targetted groups in recent years .
Total non-co-operation with CSIS is the best way to oppose racist " threat assessments " and uphold the freedom , rights and security of communities who are being profiled and targeted .
Collective non-collaboration will decrease the pressure on more vulnerable persons and groups who might otherwise be too afraid to assert their rights to privacy and silence .
9. CSIS is the ‘ political police '
The stated purpose of CSIS is to gather intelligence on any person or group who , in their opinion , might constitute a threat to the security of Canada or to Canadian interests .
The highly political question of how CSIS defines " threat " , " security " and " Canadian interests " is rarely , if ever , subject to public debate .
[ 3 ]
According to SIRC , for example , CSIS has " displayed a ‘ regrettable ' attitude that supporting Arab causes can be suspicious . "
CSIS surveillance is by no means limited to groups and individuals who are thought to pose a risk of violence .
CSIS is explicitly mandated to provide " security assessments " to the government .
Security assessments are " an appraisal of the loyalty to Canada and , so far as it relates thereto , the reliability of an individual . "
This clearly gives CSIS wide ranging authority to collect intelligence and report on anyone whose activities may challenge -- or may be perceived to challenge -- the status quo in Canada or elsewhere .
In practice , we have seen numerous examples of CSIS targeting unions , social justice groups and activists .
In short , collaboration with CSIS means participation in the repression of dissent .
Over the past 10 years , CSIS 's budget has increased by 140 per cent and its number of employees by almost 40 per cent .
Political police have no place in our society , and we should not allow them any further legitimacy or room to grow .
10 .
Talking to CSIS can jeopardize collective social justice work and community organizing
By intimidating and harassing individuals , casting fear , spreading rumours , isolating leaders , using manipulation based on psychological profiling and recruiting informers or even provocateurs , CSIS can create or exploit divisions between activists and community members and disrupt community organizing and social justice work . [ 4 ]
Complete non-co-operation with CSIS is the best way to maintain unity and solidarity and continue our work for social justice and supporting members of our various communities in their struggles for justice and against repression .
The People 's Commission Network is a Montreal network monitoring and opposing the " national security agenda " .
The network is a space for individuals and groups who face oppression in the name of " national security " -- such as indigenous people , immigrants , racialized communities , radical groups , social justice organizations , labour unions -- and their allies , to form alliances , share information , and co-ordinate strategies to defend their full rights and dignity .

There are numerous historical examples of policing and intelligence agencies engaging in such activities .
The RCMP issued a fake communiqué denouncing a high profile member of the organization in 1971 .
The subterfuge was designed to create divisions in the FLQ ( Front de libération du Québec ) .
See Mounties can't recall details of FLQ fakes , Montreal Gazette , February 21 1979 , page 3 .
The FBI in the U.S. famously engaged in such tactics against the Black Panther Party and the American Indian Movement .

The Basic Fuzzing Framework ( BFF ) consists of two main parts :
a Linux virtual machine that has been optimized for fuzzing
a set of scripts and a configuration file that orchestrate the fuzzing run
The virtual machine is a stripped - down Debian installation with the following modifications :
The Fluxbox window manager is used instead of the heavy Gnome or KDE desktop environments .
Fluxbox is configured to not raise or focus new windows .
This can help in situations where you may need to interact with the guest OS while a GUI application is being fuzzed .
Memory randomization is disabled .
VMware Tools is installed , which allows the guest OS to share a directory with the host .
The OS is configured to automatically log in and start X .
sudo is configured to not prompt for a password .
strip is symlinked to / bin / true , which prevents symbols from being removed when an application is built .
The fuzzer used by the BFF is Sam Hocevar ’s zzuf application .
It was chosen for its deterministic behavior , number of features , and lightweight size .

Mobile phone use remains a cause of concern for some
San Francisco is set to be the first city in the US to require mobile phone retailers to post radiation levels next to handsets they sell .
The board of supervisors , or council , voted 10 - 1 to approve the measure , with final approval expected next week .
" This is about helping people make informed choices , " said the law 's chief sponsor , Supervisor Sophie Maxwell .
The mobile phone industry said studies showed cell phone radiation was not harmful to people .
The Federal Communications Commission has adopted limits that set out safe exposure to these kinds of emissions .
The measurement defines the amount of radio waves that people can safely absorb into their bodies when talking on a mobile phone .
Some researchers have claimed such emissions can be linked to cancer and brain tumours but there remains little scientific consensus on the matter .
" This is not about discouraging people from using their cell phones , " said Tony Winnicker , spokesman for San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom , who has said he will sign the legislation into law .
" This is a modest commonsense measure to provide greater transparency and information to consumers . "
The mobile phone industry 's body , the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association ( CTIA ) , disagrees and has warned that posting radiation levels next to handsets could in fact cause more confusion .
" Rather than inform , the ordinance will potentially mislead consumers with point - of - sale requirements suggesting that some phones are ' safer ' than others , based on radio frequency emissions , " said John Walls , vice - president of public affairs for the CTIA .
The legislation would require all retailers to display details of the emissions alongside the phones and point consumers to where they can find out more information about the issue .
Violators would face fines of up to $ 300 ( £ 200 ) .
The San Francisco Chronicle reported that a similar right - to - know measure , proposed by state Senator Mark Leno , failed in the California senate earlier this month following heavy lobbying by the mobile phone industry .
Greens leader Bob Brown has cautiously welcomed today 's Newspoll boost for his party .
The poll , published in The Australian , shows support for the Greens rising four points to a record high of 16 per cent , while support for the two main parties has slumped .
Senator Brown says the large jump could be a polling aberration , but says it is still proof the Greens are gaining ground .
" I think you can easily get carried away by one poll - mind you , I 'd rather have a poll going up than the other way , " he told the ABC's NewsRadio .
" We 're going to continue working to give the Australian people a good alternative to both the major parties who are increasingly frustrating voters .
" We 're not just blockers , we 're creative people in the Senate . "
Today 's Newspoll comes amid an increasing brawl between Labor and the Opposition over the Government 's plans to introduce a 40 per cent tax on mining .
Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott attacked each other in Parliament yesterday for being loose with the truth and lacking credibility , but the Newspoll shows they have both lost voter support .
Only 36 per cent of voters are satisfied with Mr Rudd and 37 per cent with Mr Abbott , giving them both " negative " dissatisfaction ratings .
Labor is ahead on the two - party vote at 51 per cent to the Coalition 's 49 per cent but Newspoll says that would result in a hung parliament .
Treasurer Wayne Swan has told Radio National he is not concerned by the poll result .
" We do n't govern in terms of the fortnightly cycle on terms of Newspoll , " he said .
" I 'm not in any way worried , or whatever , about opinion polls .
What we are doing is in the national interest . "
Coalition frontbencher Eric Abetz has warned voters if they support the the Greens Labor will be returned to government .
" If the Australian people want to change the government they will in fact have to vote for the Coalition , " he said .
" Trying to go for the Greens is simply a half - way house . "
Newspoll chief executive Martin O'Shannessy says the poll shows voters are disappointed in both Mr Rudd and Mr Abbott .
" I think the bigger issue for both parties is the tremendous drop we 've seen in satisfaction in both their leaders , " he told AM .
Bioware just released a bunch of new screenshots for their Inhabitants section .
The first one that caught My Eye was the above screenshot of a Trandoshan .
I personally used to play this race in Star Wars galaxies , so I thought it would be natural for us to cover this Species in this weeks “ Species of Starwars “ .
Trandoshan s ( T’doshok in their language ) were large , bipedal reptilian humanoids from the planet Trandosha ( or Dosha ) .
They had super - sensitive eyes that could see into the infrared range and the ability to regenerate lost limbs , although very slowly , and were anatomically built heavier and stronger than most humanoids , including Humans .
They would also periodically shed their skin .
Unlike some other reptilian humanoids such as the Barabels and the Ssi-ruuk , Trandoshans had no tails .
The Trandoshans were a warlike species who allied early with the Empire , taking Wookiees as slaves .
As a species , they were renowned across the galaxy for great strength .
This is evidenced by several members of other species boasting physical prowess and power by having defeated a Trandoshan , either in battle or in a contest of strength Biology and appearance Trandoshans were a large , bipedal sentient species , with scaly skin — which ranged in color from sandy brown to glossy green , which was shed roughly once every standard year .
Cold - blooded reptiles , Trandoshans had two super - sensitive orange eyes with horizontal black pupils , which could see far into the infrared range .
Trandoshans could regenerate lost limbs and skin until they reached their middle ages — around fifty - four standard years .
Each of their four limbs ended in three razor sharp claws , which although perfect for combat , they did not grant them manual dexterity , making a Trandoshan ’s finger movements somewhat clumsy and awkward .
Though physically powerful , they were outmatched by their rivals , the Wookiees , in unarmed combat .
Trandoshans usually wore dark clothing , although the species ’ attire varied .
The infamous Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk was known to wear a yellow flightsuit , something worn by several other members of the species .
Trandoshan hunters and mercenaries sometimes wore either full body armor or a mixture of armor and cloth garb .
Trandoshans also often wore warm jackets and baggy trousers .
Their large , scaled feet also meant that it was impossible for them to wear any sort of baseline humanoid footgear , which could present impediment to hunting .
Trandoshans had a lifespan slightly longer than that of most sentients in the galaxy .
Considered younglings until they were twelve standard years old , Trandoshans were thought of as young adults until they reached the age of sixteen , when they became full adults .
By fifty - five standard years , Trandoshans were middle - aged , and those living past eighty - five were considered old , not very differently from humans .
Society and culture
Trandoshans worshiped their goddess , the Scorekeeper ( a deity who exists beyond time and space ) , whom they would appease through acts which increased their jagganath points .
This was done by living a lifestyle which was , by non-Trandoshan standards , overtly aggressive , leading many Trandoshans to become bounty hunters , mercenaries , or slavers .
Trandoshans especially prized Wookiee pelts , which consequently played a large part in earning jagganath points — capturing the pelts of rare Wookiee breeds ( such as silverbacks ) or particularly infamous Wookiees would give the hunter a large increse in jagganath points .
To be shamed or captured during a hunt would zero one ’s jagganath points — effectively making their life forfeit in the eyes of the Scorekeeper .
They could , however , win all those points back by killing the one who zeroed there score .
Like their neighbors , the Wookiees , the Trandoshans also honored life debts .
The recipient of a Trandoshan life debt was referred to as a ghrakhowsk .
Trandoshans are known to eat bowls of still live worms as a favorite meal .
A traditional Trandoshan food is a Trandoshani flatcake .
There were rare cases of Trandoshans not adhering to their millennia - old cultural traditions .
One such was the mercenary and assassin Nakaron whose self - confidence caused him to disregard the Trandoshan class system , being rude and disrespectful towards the Elders of the Dosha city of Forak , causing him to be banned from that city , and subsequently more cities until he was virtually exiled from Dosha .
Weaponry
The Trandoshan arsenal was composed of a variety of unique weaponry .
For ranged weaponry , the Trandoshans designed Accelerated Charged Particle Guns which resembled various slugthrowers used throughout the galaxy .
Examples of these were seen during the Clone Wars ; quite common were the Accelerated Charged Particle Array Gun , the Accelerated Charged Particle Repeater Gun , and the LS - 150 Heavy Accelerated Charged Particle Repeater Gun .
When they wished to take their prey alive , Trandoshan Bounty Hunters favored the Slavemaster Stun Carbine .
They also made use of the LJ - 50 Concussion Rifle and Trandoshan Repeater Rifle .
Most cultures long ago abandoned the primitive sword in favor of the more lethal vibroblade .
Trandoshans , however , wielded such archaic weapons as badges of honor .
Both the Trandoshan Sword and the Trandoshan Double - Bladed Sword were traditionally forged using the rare ore Chalon which made them sharper and heavier than Republic blades .
History
The Trandoshans originated on Trandosha , also known as Dosha or Hsskor .
It was in the same star system as Kashyyyk , the homeworld of the Wookiees .
In 7,000 BBY , the Trandoshans joined the Galactic Republic .
During the New Sith Wars Sith troops landed on Trandosha , and the Trandoshans slaughtered many of the troopers .
The Sith retaliated by invading their world and burning the homes of the Trandoshans , leading the surviving Trandoshans to save themselves from death by pledging loyalty to the Brotherhood of Darkness .
Prior to the Clone Wars , Trandoshan bandits invaded and occupied the planet of Jabiim before later moving on .
At this time , Dosha was only indirectly represented in the Galactic Senate by the Wookiee Yarua , much to the Trandoshans ’ dismay .
In response , Trandoshan terrorists attempted to assassinate Yarua in 32 BBY .
In 23 BBY , a Wookiee vessel was attacked over a moon of Trandosha , resulting in a Wookiee blockade of Trandosha .
Peace talks to resolve the issue were conducted 22 BBY and failed when it was revealed that the Trandoshans were pushing for Senatorial representation with Trade Federation backing .
During the Clone Wars , some groups of Trandoshans involved themselves on the side of the Confederacy of Independent Systems in several engagements .
One such example occurred more than one year after the onset of the Clone Wars when the Acclamator - class assault ship Prosecutor was taken over by a joint force of Trandoshan slavers and CIS battle droids .
Later , the Trandoshans , with the help of CIS forces , invaded the planet of Kashyyyk to subsequently enslave the Wookiee natives .
The invasion of Kashyyyk by the CIS led towards an expeditionary team of clone commandos being sent to Kashyyyk by the Galactic Republic , this act ultimately led to the Battle of Kashyyyk itself .
Trandoshans also worked as mercenaries and bounty hunters during that time period .
Bossk was a famous bounty hunter from the time of the Clone Wars and for decades thereafter .
Force Sensitives
It was uncommon but not unheard of , that some Trandoshans were Force - sensitive .
Because of their reputations as bounty hunters they were n’t usually accepted as Jedi or even Sith ;
There were exceptions , however , such as the Jedi Lissarkh , a Padawan of Plo Koon , and the rogue Jedi Kras ’dohk .
Normally they would use their Force Sensitivity to their advantage as bounty hunters .
Saurin Subspecies
At some time in their history , a population of Trandoshans became isolated for unknown reasons , and eventually adapted along a separate lineage and became the subspecies Saurin .
They were notably different in their physiology for featuring translucent eyes , and having adapted five - fingered hands , with shorter fingers than their genetic cousins .
It is unknown if Saurins carried the Trandoshan ability to regenerate lost limbs , or held any of the same basic traditions and beliefs , such as bounty hunting , and scoring kills to appease the deity The Scorekeeper .
Saurins claimed the planet Durkteel as their homeworld .

The Roman Catholic church was once again at the centre of a child abuse scandal today when police raided the headquarters of the church hierarchy in Belgium .
They carried away computers and hundreds of files , amid rumours that church leaders were continuing to cover up abuse cases despite a public plea for forgiveness last month .
Belgian officers today sealed off and searched the headquarters of the church at Mechelen , north of Brussels , where the Belgian bishops ' conference was in session , with the papal nuncio taking part .
They also searched the home of Cardinal Godfried Danneels , until last year Belgium 's most senior prelate , who enjoys a reputation for being a liberal .
In nearby Leuven , east of Brussels , police also searched the premises of the independent church commission investigating hundreds of cases of alleged molestation by clergymen .
They took all 475 files belonging to the commission , prompting bewilderment and panic among investigators and victims of sexual abuse .
" The police have a number of accusations connected with the sexual abuse of children within the church , " said Jean - Marc Meilleur , a Brussels police spokesman .
" The searches are the result of the investigation we started recently .
We are collecting evidence material . "
The raids centred on the palace of Archbishop Andre- Joseph Leonard , head of the Catholic church in Belgium , on the ancient town 's St Rombout 's cathedral , and on the residence of the former head of the church in Belgium , Cardinal Danneels .
The long - running but moribund commission in Leuven was resurrected this year to investigate the torrent of allegations that have surfaced , especially since April when one of the most senior clergymen in Belgium , Archbishop of Bruges , Roger Vangheluwe , resigned after admitting he had been abusing a boy for years .
Police declined to say whether any of the individuals at the centre of today 's raids were direct suspects or whether the searches concerned evidence affecting other cases .
The commission of inquiry is well - respected and is led by Peter Adriaenssens , one of Belgium 's top child abuse experts , whose office has received hundreds of complaints this year and who has threatened to resign should his work be impeded by the church hierarchy .
He emerged as a national figure following the notorious Marc Dutroux paedophilia and murder case in 1996 and runs one of the country 's most respected child abuse centres .
He voiced outrage and shock at the police actions , saying he had been given no warning , and would now struggle to deliver a report on clerical sexual abuse he was preparing for October .
Adriaenssens was in Amsterdam in the Netherlands on Wednesday when his offices were raided .
He said that all files in his investigation , concerning 475 cases , had been taken away by the police .
" All day we 've been getting mails and calls from victims in panic , " he said .
" They agreed that we do a report , but they did not want others to see the material …
No one asked us a single question .
We have no idea why this happened now . "
Adriaenssens suggested that a wave of " paranoia " had developed around the flood of allegations coming to light in recent months in Belgium .
" There were rumours that the commission was having secret talks with the bishops .
Perhaps the investigating magistrate let himself be led by this paranoia . "
He added that the raids had thrown into question whether his commission would be able to continue its work .
It was set up years ago but had vegetated until this year when the sexual abuse allegations and revelations spread rapidly across the world .
The commission 's previous head had complained of a lack of co-operation from the church authorities .
Police sources told the Flemish newspaper De Standaard that the raids were carried out because of suspicions that church leaders were failing to hand over all the necessary materials to the commission of inquiry .
That was not confirmed by Adriaenssens .
Last month the Belgian bishops ' conference issued a pastoral letter pleading for forgiveness both for the sexual abuse by many clergy and for the cover-ups and " silence " that then followed .
" Through the silence priority was given to the reputation of the church institution or the clergyman over the dignity of the child as victim , " said the letter .
TAIPEI , Taiwan —
He spoke into the microphone quickly , in a clipped tone , as spectators in a crowded conference hall hung on his words .
His presence here was akin to that of an Olympian god , deigning to descend from the heavens ( Silicon Valley ) for an inspection tour of Vulcan 's workshop : the Far East , where most of the world 's gee - whiz tech gadgets — handsets , iPads , e-readers , netbooks — are actually made .
He was here in part to preach the latest gospel from America .
He was here to preach The Cloud .
" Cloud computing will drive a massive wave of innovation in personal computing , and Taiwan is going to be at the center of that , " said Google vice president for product management Sundar Pichai , speaking with the doubt - free air of a TV evangelist for the high - tech set .
" That 's why it 's very exciting to be here .
We need partners in the ' ecosystem ' , and the pace of innovation here is incredible . "
He said his firm has made " big bets on cloud computing , " and his tone said he was confident of coming up aces .
" The web is going to get much more powerful , and that 's the heart of cloud computing . "
Yes , a typhoon of " cloud computing " hype has reached Asia .
Never mind that few people here ( or elsewhere ) seem to understand what it means , or that the term is thrown around so carelessly .
Whatever it is , the tech elite here seems to agree it's important — and Taiwanese firms had better get the new religion , fast .
Taiwan 's government recently announced an ambitious plan to promote " cloud computing . "
South Korea 's did the same late last year .
Broadly speaking , cloud computing refers to the trend of delivering software , storage and other services over the internet .
That 's a shift from the old PC - and - local network computing model , where documents , software and operating systems live on each individual machine , and firms maintain their own servers and tech staff .
In tech - speak , it 's called moving stuff " outside the firewall . "
In the brave new cloud computing world of the future , gadgets and devices will increasingly function solely as a connection to the Internet and content delivery platform .
Software , storage , even
operating systems will run remotely from vast data centers , or server farms .
If that future comes to pass , whoever is good at building and operating those data centers , and the customized servers that run them , stands to thrive .
At the revival - meeting - slash - cloud - computing - forum in Taipei earlier this month , Taiwanese fretted about whether they'd be able to adapt .
Western participants tried to reassure them of the Good News : With The Cloud , they'd have more opportunities than ever to make gadgets for the world 's eager consumers .
" You have built the finest electronics manufacturing infrastructure the world has ever known , " said Tudor Brown , President of ARM Holdings , which makes the processors used in mobile gadgets like the iPhone .
" Cloud computing brings opportunities for a much bigger market , as you use that infrastructure to continue to produce these products and ship them around the world . "
" Your competitiveness should be increased , not decreased , by the shift to a more flexible cloud computing world , " he insisted , after a round of teeth - gnashing from Taiwanese panelists over their self - defeating price wars and other shortcomings .
Like most of the fads out of Silicon Valley , " cloud computing " is a catchphrase with an uncertain shelf - life .
But industry observers are surprised at its staying power to date .
" We went through Internet hype and crash a decade ago , " said Frank Gillett , principal analyst at Forrester Research , in a phone interview .
" Then we went through a smaller sort of excitement about
' virtualization . '
And starting about two years ago , we got ' cloud fever ' — and the fever has persisted longer than I thought it would .
The amount of hype is kind of silly . "
One of the fiercest critics of cloud hype has been Oracle 's Larry Ellison , who said in a famous 2008 rant , " the computer industry is the only industry that 's more fashion - driven than women 's fashion ...
I have no idea what anyone 's talking about , I mean it 's really just gibberish ... what the hell is cloud computing ? "
Gillett says cloud computing is a mixed bag .
Part of it is just using a trendy new phrase for old services -- an old - wine - in - new - bottles job that some call " cloud - washing " ( one might also say " bullcloud . " )
Using Gmail qualifies as cloud computing .
So does using Flickr , or any web - based software services .
But part of it is a genuinely new way of thinking about computing that could , over the next decade , change our relations with gadgets and Internet services , he said .
Whereas now people buy a gadget — be it a smart - phone or netbook or tablet computer — and then choose what services to access with that device , in the cloud - computing future it may well be the other way around .
" The level of integration between devices and services will increase , and the decision - making sequence will be flipped on its head , from devices to services , both for individuals and companies , " said Gillett .
For businesses , Gillett says cloud computing is most promising in areas like web conferencing , data warehousing and business intelligence .
Firms are likely to farm out those areas rather than try
to maintain expensive in - house capabilities .
So are the Taiwanese convinced ?
Convinced enough for the government to launch a $ 720 million campaign about it .
Because who knows ?
Those Silicon Valley preachers may turn out to be right .
Helpful Information Prep Time : 30 minutes
Cook Time : 2.5 to 3 hours
Smoker Temp : 225-240°F
Meat Finish Temp : 160°F
Recommended Wood : Mesquite , Pecan or Hickory ( something robust )
What You 'll Need 3 lbs quality , thick sliced bacon
2 lbs ground breakfast sausage ( mild or spicy )
8 oz Pepper Jack cheese slices
2 jalapeno peppers
Jeff 's original rub ( purchase recipes here )
Jeff 's barbecue sauce ( purchase recipes here )
2 gallon - sized ziplock bags
2 pieces of wax paper ( I use parchment paper )
Step 1 : Preparation I like to do all of my preparation before even starting to put the fatties together .
Remove the seeds from the peppers and then dice them up or slice them however you like , make the rub and the sauce , etc .
If you are using onions or other veggies , you can go ahead and slice and dice those as you see fit and set them aside .
The bacon weave will require thirteen pieces of bacon per weave and if you are making two weaves , you will need twenty - six pieces total .
Count out and set aside the bacon you will need for the weaves and fry the rest up real nice and crispy .
Place it on a paper towel to absorb some of the grease and set aside .
Step 2 : Weave the Bacon
This may look difficult but once you do it one time , you will see how easy it really is .
Lay out 7 pieces of bacon horizontally on the wax paper butting them up to each other with no overlapping .
Now remove the 2nd , 4th , and 6th piece and lay them aside .
Lay a piece of bacon vertically all the way to the left and on top of the horizontal pieces .
Replace pieces 2,4 and 6 that you removed earlier to the exact location that you removed them from .
Fold horizontal pieces 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 back to the left over the top of the first vertical piece .
Lay down the 2nd vertical piece just to the right of the 1st vertical piece and lay horizontal pieces 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 back down into their original location .
You get the idea .. continue this alternating pattern until you have 6 - 7 vertical pieces of bacon woven into the 7 horizontal pieces .
This completes the weave that will be wrapped around the roll of stuffed sausage .
Sprinkly a healthy portion of my original rub ( purchase recipes here ) onto the bacon weave(s ) and set aside .
Step 3 : Flatten the Sausage Place the one pound sausage roll into a gallon sized ziploc bag and seal it up .
Then use your hand or a rolling pin to flatten it out to an even square .
To avoid air pockets you can snip off a corner or two of the bag to allow some air to escape .
You can also just flatten the sausage out into a square that is approximately the same size as your bacon weave or slightly smaller without using a bag .
If you used the bag to make the square of sausage , use a very sharp knife to cut the top of the plastic away from the sausage .. down one side , across the bottom and up the other side to where the zipper is located .
You should then be able to lift the sausage square up and flip it over carefully onto the wax paper allowing you to then remove the remaining bottom of the plastic bag from the sausage .
Step 4 : Stuffing
What you put on the sausage is a matter of preference ..
I made one the traditional way with a layer of my original barbecue sauce recipe ( purchase recipes here ) , 5 - 6 slices of pepper jack cheese , 10 pieces of bacon fried crispy and torn into small one inch pieces .
The second one was simply 5 - 6 pieces of pepper jack cheese , spinach greens , chopped red onion , and one seeded , chopped jalapeno .
Note : place all of the stuffing in the bottom two thirds of the sausage square for best results .
Step 5 : Rolling
Up the Sausage Lift up the wax paper and roll the sausage as tightly as possible making sure that the ingredients are rolled up into the sausage .
An assistant is very helpful with this process .
Be sure to remove the wax paper as you go so it does not get rolled into the sausage as well .
When it is completely rolled up , very carefully lift up the roll of sausage and place it on top of the bacon weave at the bottom end .
Step 6 : Wrapping the Bacon Weave Around Sausage
As with the sausage , lift the bottom of the wax paper up to help start the bacon weave around the sausage .
Continue to roll the bacon weave until it is completely around the sausage roll .
Be sure to keep the wax paper pulled back so it does not get rolled up with the bacon weave .
Brush on another coating of the barbecue sauce and you are ready to place on the smoker .
Step 7 : Get the Smoker Ready Prepare your wood , charcoal , electric or gas smoker for about 225 - 240 °F .
I used mesquite for this experiment since I wanted a really nice robust smoke flavor .
Feel free to use your favorite type of wood .
I would imagine that pecan , oak , apple , cherry , etc. would all be wonderful woods to use .
Step 8 : Smoke Time Place the fatties on the grate .
The bacon wrapped stuffed sausage rolls will take about 2 - 3 hours to reach 165 °F in the center .
I recommend that you keep the smoke flowing for at least 2 hours .
Use a digital probe meat thermometer and remove them from the smoker when they reach 165 °F .
I have read that it takes about one hour per inch of thickness .
I am not sure how well that holds true but one of mine got done about 30 minutes before the other one .
The one that got done early was thicker than the one that took the longest so .. go figure .
Let the temperature tell you when it is done no matter how long it takes .
I recommend a digital probe meat thermometer such as the “ Smoke ” by Thermoworks to monitor the temperature of the fatty while it cooks .
Option : Crisping up the Bacon
When you first remove the fatty from the smoker , the bacon on the outside will not be crispy .
If you prefer crispy bacon then pop it into a 500 °F broiler for a couple of minutes but keep a very close eye on it – it will burn if you 're not careful .
I have also wondered if you could place the whole fatty on a griddle once it is done smoking and do a fry on the outside of the bacon weave after it is finished .
I have not tried this but I have a feeling it would work .
If you do the griddle trick , you would probably want to put toothpicks thought the fatty to make sure the bacon does not come unwrapped .
You would also have to turn it a few times to get all sides crisp .
If you happen to try this , let me know how it goes .
Step 9 : Slice and Serve
There are no rules as to how to eat these .
Let them rest for about 10 minutes then slice them into 1 /2 inch pieces to be eaten as is , on a large biscuit or make a sandwich out of it .
Either way , they are simply delicious and you will do these time and time again , I promise !!
After BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward had expressed his contrition to members of Congress for the ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , a long - time friend of the oil industry , Rep. Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) , today issued an apology to Hayward for his harsh treatment at the hands of the White House .
Barton , speaking at a congressional hearing , called the $ 20 billion escrow account set up by BP to pay for claims related to the spill , a “ shakedown ” on the part of the Obama administration .
Individuals and political action committees associated with BP have donated $ 27,350 to Barton ’s political campaigns since the 1990 election cycle — eighth among members of Congress , the Center for Responsive Politics ‘ research indicates .
( Barton might find it ironic that the man he said so mistreated BP , President Barack Obama , received more than $ 77,000 from BP employees during his political career . )
Contributions from PACs made up 94 percent of Barton ’s donations .
Individuals or PACs associated with the oil and gas industry as a whole have been Barton ’s biggest patron since he entered Congress , donating more than $ 1,448,380 since the 1990 election cycle .
The figure puts him at No. 1 among all House members for donations from the industry , fifth among members of Congress and fourth among active members of Congress .
Barton ’s comments today came after Hayward had just taken his licks from several members of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations , including Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) and Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) .
Barton , the ranking Republican on the energy and commerce committee , must have been a welcome sight .
Barton has been a consistent skeptic of global warming and opponent of legislation to address climate change .
In his Oval Office speech Tuesday night , President Obama sought to use the disaster from the spill in the Gulf to argue for action on significant climate legislation .
Barton was also among a group of Republican congressmen from Texas who earlier this week put forth a bill to end the moratorium on deepwater drilling .
When announcing the bill , he questioned whether the temporary moratorium imposed by the Obama administration would become permanent .
( Update 4:08 p.m. :)
Barton ’s biggest single corporate contributor , Anadarko Petroleum , is a 25 percent stakeholder in the Macondo Prospect , site of the Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico .
Individuals and PACs associated with Anadarko have given Barton ’s campaigns $ 146,500 since the 1990 election cycle .
Political blog FiveThirty Eight highlights this fact in this report .
( Update 4:23 p.m. :)
Barton has retracted his apology to BP and issued another apology for using the word “ shakedown ” to describe the $ 20 billion fund set up to cover damage claims on the Gulf Coast , Politico reports .
“ I regret the impact that my statement this morning implied that BP should not pay for the consequences of their decisions and actions in this incident , ” he said in a statement issued by the office of House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) .
( Update 5:37 p.m. :) Additional Center for Responsive Politics analysis shows that Barton ’s candidate committee and leadership PAC combined have received $ 1.67 million from the oil and gas industry since the 1990 election cycle .

" You should know something about me , and the people I work with .
We deal with the left and the right , dictators or liberators .
If the current president had been more agreeable , I would n’t be talking to you .
So if you decide not to sign , you ’ll wake up with your b- lls in your mouth , and your willing replacement standing over you .
If you doubt that , then shoot me , take the money , and have a good night ’s sleep . "
Dominic Greene , political acquisitions specialist for the secretive Quantum criminal oligarchy , explains to Gen. Medrano — the organization ’s new pet Bolivian dictator — how the world really works , as seen in the film Quantum of Solace .
If we were to suture a toupee — preferably in a procedure not involving anesthetic — to the scalp of Lloyd Blankfein , the Goldman Sachs commissar would strongly resemble Dominic Greene , the reptilian villain of the most recent James Bond film , Quantum of Solace .
Blankfein already resembles Greene in ways that transcend physiognomy .
The same can be said regarding the fictional Quantum criminal syndicate and the corrupt real - life oligarchy to which Blankfein belongs .
Although hampered with an undercooked script and an editing style that makes the action sequences all but impossible to follow ( think of what Michael Bay would do to a film after a two - day Red Bull jag ) , Quantum of Solace is the only Bond film to feature an entirely believable villain , and a surprisingly credible Evil Plot .
Quantum of Solace Best Price : $ 0.98 Buy New $ 4.87 ( as of 03:55 EST - Details )
Dominic Greene is a composite of several real - life oligarchs .
In addition to his resemblance to Blankfein , Greene — an ersatz conservationist who plunders countries and overthrows governments behind a facade of environmental philanthropy — also somewhat resembles Maurice Strong and George Soros .
Quantum itself is a Bilderberg - like Power Elite fraternity seeking control over the global economy .
To that end , the group finances terrorism and revolution ( which played a significant role in the previous — and much superior — Bond film , Casino Royale ) with utter indifference to the ideology of its allies .
It is the objective — the consolidation of power — that matters , rather than the doctrine used to recruit and motivate the cannon fodder .
At least one of the four people responsible for the Quantum of Solace screenplay appears to be at least superficially familiar with the writings of Carroll Quigley and C. Wright Mills .
Dominic Greene ’s little lecture to Quantum ’s Bolivian rent - a- thug , General Medrano , brings to mind the following observation by Quigley :
“ There does exist … an international Anglophile network which operates in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act .
In fact , this network has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists and frequently does so . ”
In the film , Greene and Quantum recruited General Medrano to overthrow the leftist government of Bolivia .
All the cabal seeks in return is a large tract of barren desert .
When the CIA starts sniffing around the scheme , thinking it may involve an oil field , Greene buys them off with a side deal :
He promises Washington a petroleum concession if the Company permits the coup to proceed .
Confessions of an Econ ... Perkins , John Best Price : $ 1.50 Buy New $ 19.59 ( as of 03:20 EST - Details )
By infiltrating a Quantum teleconference , Bond learns of a plot to control “ one of the world ’s most precious resources . ”
In Bolivia he discovers that Greene — working under the cover of his “ Greene Planet ” land acquisition corporation — is actually planning to monopolize Bolivia ’s water supply , en route to creation of a global water cartel .
Medrano initially balks when told to sign an agreement giving Quantum control over the country ’s water utility ( which would double the price Bolivians were paying for the service ) , but he grudgingly scribbles his signature when he ’s reminded how easily he could be replaced .
In addition to the writings of Quigley and Mills , John Perkins ‘ 2005 memoir - expos Confessions of an Economic Hitman appears to have inspired at least some aspects of the Quantum of Solace storyline .
Perkins ’ book has been dismissed as spy fiction by some critics , including the U.S. State Department .
However , his " economic hitman theory " has received academic support in a recent study by specialists in the field of " forensic economics . "
According to Perkins , the organs of international finance , such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund , use U.S. covert agencies to carry out what is essentially a global loan - sharking scheme .
As an economic forecaster covertly recruited by U.S. intelligence in the 1960s , Perkins was dispatched to various countries — including Indonesia and Panama — as an “ Economic Hitman , ” or EHM .
His role was to help induce national leaders to take out huge World Bank loans to fund mammoth infrastructure programs .
Perkins claims that he was just one EHM among thousands plying the same trade worldwide .
If an EHM is successful , writes Perkins , “ the [ World Bank ] loans are so large that the debtor is forced to default on its payments after a few years .
When this happens , then like the Mafia we demand our pound of flesh .
This often includes one or more of the following : control over United Nations votes , the installation of military bases , or access to precious resources … .
Of course , the debtor still owes us money — and another country is added to our global empire . ”
Economic Hitmen are n’t the only weapons in the Power Elite ’s arsenal .
Perkins also refers to “ Jackals , ” who are sent to deal with the most refractory foreign leaders by fomenting revolutions , or staging assassinations .
“ When the Jackals fail , ” Perkins continues , “ young Americans are sent in to kill and die . ”

These depredations are n’t confined to the Third World , at least as that designation is conventionally understood .
During the early years of the 21st Century , just before the Federal Reserve ’s most recent debt bubble collapsed , the EHMs preyed on municipal and county governments across the United States .
Among their victims are the residents of Jefferson County , Alabama , which has been bankrupted and ruined as the result of a plot eerily similar in some ways to the one depicted in Quantum of Solace .
In 1996 , Birmingham was forced to sign a federal consent decree requiring it to reconstruct its municipal sewer system .
The initial estimated cost was roughly $ 250 million .
However , that initial cost estimate was like a tiny grain of sand lodged inside the mantle of an oyster .
With the eager help of Wall Street debt - pushers , Jefferson County ’s political establishment quickly turned that grain of sand into an immense pearl of civic corruption , inflating the cost of the project to $ 3 billion .
When the County Commission sought lenders to refinance its sewer bonds , JP Morgan dispatched a low - grade EHM named Charles E. LeCroy .
In 2002 , Larry P. Langford , a man with a troubled financial background and a weakness for expensive clothes , was appointed president of the Jefferson County Commission — and LeCroy had his General Medrano .
LeCroy compromised Langford with the clinical precision of a practiced seducer .
Plying him with expensive clothes , jewelry , and cash payouts , LeCroy induced Langford to sign off on a series of esoteric “ synthetic debt swaps ” that eventually inflated the county ’s debt — for rebuilding a sewer system , remember — to $ 5.4 billion .
The mechanics of these financial instruments are deliberately convoluted ; the agreements were cluttered with recondite language designed to obstruct understanding and conceal trip - wires and trap - doors .
“ I needed somebody to tell me what all that stuff was , ” Langford testified in a June 2008 deposition .
“ And even when they told me , I still do n’t understand 99 percent of it . ”

Seeking an “ independent ” adviser to vet JP Morgan ’s proposals , Langford turned to William Blount , who ran the local investment firm of Blount Parrish & Company .
It ’s entirely possible that Langford honestly did n’t know , at first , that Blount had also been compromised by Quantum — er , make that JP Morgan .
In fact , Blount ’s $ 300,000 side - deal with LeCroy was roughly double the size of Langford ’s price tag .
In Quantum of Solace , Bond discovers that Greene and his cohorts had managed to buy off dozens of officials in both the U.S. and British governments with promises of lucrative oil concessions .
( One refreshing aspect of the film is the fact that every government institution it depicts — from the CIA to the Britain ’s Special Branch , from the White House to 10 Downing Street down to street police in La Paz — is hopelessly , incurably corrupt . )
As Mr. White , a bagman for Quantum who had been introduced in Casino Royale , tells Bond : “ The first thing you need to know about us is that we have people everywhere ” — including supposed allies in key positions within U.S. and British intelligence .
As mentioned earlier , Dominic Greene was able to get the CIA to butt out of Bolivia in exchange for a bogus oil deal .
It cost LeCroy , JP Morgan ’s EHM in Birmingham , $ 3 million to persuade Goldman Sachs to avert its gaze from the opportunities for plunder in Jefferson County .
When queried by a comrade at JP Morgan , LeCroy explained that the money was the price of Goldman “ not messing with us .
It ’s a lot of money , but in the end , it ’s worth it on a billion - dollar deal . ”
As the irreplaceable Matt Taibbi pointed out in his definitive journalistic autopsy of Jefferson County , just about everybody in the Banking Cabal sought a piece of the action :
Four of the nation ’s top investment banks , the very cream of American finance , were involved in one way or another with payoffs to Blunt in their scramble to do business with the county .
" In addition to JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs , Bear Stearns paid Langford ’s bagman $ 2.4 million , while Lehman Brothers got off cheap with a $ 35,000 arranger ’s fee , ’ " Taibbi writes .
" At least a dozen of the county ’s contractors were also cashing in , along with many of the county commissioners . ”
Dozens of local businessmen and political officials — including Langford , who was elected Birmingham Mayor in 2007 , and Blount — have been convicted on charges of bribery and other forms of corruption .
LeCroy was eventually convicted and sent to prison for three months — yes , three months — for his role in a similar criminal enterprise in Philadelphia .
Some of those responsible for pillaging Jefferson County are behind bars , but nothing they will experience will compare to the suffering they have left in their wake .
A chilling scene near the end of Quantum of Solace shows Indian peasants looking on in frustration and alarm as their local water pumps suddenly run dry in ( temporary ) consummation of Greene ’s plan .
More than a few residents of Jefferson County have lived through very similar privations .
County residents now pay an estimated $ 750 a year for municipal services , more than twice the national average .
Sewer costs are now 300 percent higher than they were when the reconstruction project began in 1996 .
These ruinous increases reflect the fact that those sentenced to live in Jefferson County are being taxed to pay the service on the debts created by JP Morgan ’s Economic Hitman and his seraglio of civic servants .
Birmingham resident Dora Bonner , a woman in her 70s who lives on a Social Security check and shares her home with four grandchildren , was among those forced to choose between paying a $ 250 water bill or keeping the furnace running in wintertime .
“ I could n’t afford the water , so they shut it off , ” Bonner told Bloomberg News .
Jefferson County residents draw nearer to bankruptcy every time they shower or flush the toilet .
JP Morgan , the architects of this misery , received $ 25 billion in TARP bailout money and unspecified tens of billions more from indirect subsidies .
Last year it dished out more than $ 11 billion in management bonuses .
After the Economic Hitmen have done their work , John Perkins informs us , those who employ them send in first the jackals , then the troops .
The destruction of Alabama ’s most populous county suggests that , at least where domestic operations are concerned , Quantum ’s real - life counterparts might simply skip the second stage and go directly to martial law .

Last fall , a “ kind of civil legal civil war broke out ” in Jefferson County “ when three county agencies — the sheriff ’s department , an indigent - care hospital and the tax - assessor ’s office — sued the county commission to stop … budget cuts on the grounds that they posed a danger to public safety , ” reported Bloomberg News last October .
Maintaining that budget cuts would make it impossible to provide law enforcement coverage for Jefferson County , Sheriff Mike Hale suggested that it would be necessary to call in the National Guard to serve as a police force .
In fact , as AlterNet ’s Mike Ames observes , martial law is “ a logical progression in the ongoing billionaire plunder of America . ”
In March 2009 , following a shooting rampage in which 27 - year - old Samson , Alabama resident Michael McClendon murdered ten people before killing himself , troops from Fort Rucker “ were brought into Samson and other surrounding areas to patrol the streets , ” reported Ames .
“ This was a clear violation of the Posse Comitatus Act , every freedom - loving American ’s worst nightmare . ”
A subsequent investigation by the Army confirmed that it was illegal to dispatch soldiers to patrol the streets and man roadblocks , but no effort was made to identify , let alone punish , those responsible .
As Ames points out , the damage done in Alabama by Wall Street ’s Economic Hitmen was hardly confined to Jefferson County : Pilgrim ’s Pride , one of the state ’s largest private employers , was seduced into leveraging itself into bankruptcy .
“ Now you can see why Alabamans are loading up on so many weapons , ” concludes Ames .
For the same reason , it ’s not surprising that some statewide political campaigns in Alabama this year have an insurrectionary tone — not that this is necessarily a bad thing , of course .
The problem , predictably enough , is that the understandable rage and frustration are likely to be skillfully misdirected in the service of the same people who have all but reduced the state to Third World status .
Those of us who do n’t live in Alabama need not feel left out , since — as Quantum ’s Mr. White might put it — Wall Street ’s taxpayer - subsidized oligarchy has people everywhere .
Their fingerprints will most likely be found wherever a municipal or county government is suffocating in debt and wringing whatever revenue it can from tax victims who have nothing left to give .
Yes , I know : Quantum of Solace is a silly movie , full of implausible action gags and dodgy dialogue .
And yet ….

Just one year ago , congressional auditors brought the widespread abuse techniques used on special education students to the attention of the general public .
The report , seen here , uncovered abuse of restraining , seclusion , and discipline techniques ….
some of which were even linked to deaths .
Details from incidences such as : children being secluded for hours at a time while being taunted by teachers , children being held face - down on the ground , handcuffed , etc .. were included in the report .
State law , school policy , and regulation of such varies greatly from area to area , providing the perfect breeding ground for abuse of over 6 million special needs children .
At the time of this report , only five states even bothered to keep records of incidents where special needs children were separated or restrained .
Many teachers documented in the report did not have the proper training related to seclusion and restraint .
Experts say that children should only be isolated when they pose an immediate threat to themselves or others .
Still , many of the teachers were using isolation as punishment to “ make ” the children comply with classroom rules .
Yet , with this report giving light to hundreds of special needs children being abused in the school system and the growing incidences actually appearing in national news , still nothing is being done to change a broken system .
Take Port St. Lucie 's school system for example .
This school felt that it would be okay to vote an autistic boy out of his kindergarten class for being “ unruly . ”
Alex Barton was made to stand in front of his classmates , in Survivor style fashion , and listen to why his peers decided to vote him out of “ their ” class .
See Alex Barton ’s story here .
A Parkway Elementary School student was handcuffed by a Sheriffs deputy after a temper tantrum in the middle of class .
A few days later and another temper tantrum , and the girl was transported to the local adult mental institution by the school .
See that story here .
I recently wrote about an autistic boy that is being charged with a felony after drawing a picture of a gun .
See that story here .
These types of incidences occur far too often , and nothing is being done about it .
First , teachers of special needs children need to be better educated .
For example , children with autism move around frequently .
Trying to restrain the child , only worsens this behavior .
Imagine an itch you have and someone holding your hands and not letting you scratch .
The itching does not go away just because you are restrained ; in fact , the itch becomes worse .
It is the same principle for autistic children .
Plain and simple , the teacher has a job to teach .
Some children require extra measures or special plans of action to be taught .
Special Education teachers are supposed to be equipped with this knowledge .
We would n’t tolerate a math teacher that was n’t able to do a fundamental element of her job , like add and subtract .
So , why are we tolerating special education teachers that obviously lack or ignore the fundamental elements required to teach special needs children ?
Second , it is time for some universal laws to protect these children from abusive school environments .
We have tried leaving it up to the states and individual school systems , and they have failed these children .
Contact your state elected officials here and here and The House Education and Labor Committee here to demand action !
Indonesian nationalists deny all ethnic and religious claims for separatism in the vast archipelago that makes up their country .
But in Papua , people feel exploited , and threatened with cultural , and demographic , annihilation
Linus , from Papua , said : “ It does n’t matter who the leader is , the dice are loaded against us . ”
For him , as for many others , the re-election in July 2009 of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono ( known as SBY ) as Indonesian president was no surprise .
Linus and his friend Agus are from Jayapura , the provincial capital of Papua , the western part of the island of New Guinea .
They are studying to be civil servants in the city of Surabaya in eastern Java .
“ Instead of independence we have ‘ special ’ autonomy , ” said Agus .
That status was won in January 2002 .
“ It is so special nobody trusts it .
All I know is I will at last get a job in a new district in the south of Papua .
To separatist Papuans , I am a traitor .
To most of our Javanese teachers , I am a monkey they are trying to lure down from the trees .
I just want to feed my family . ”
There was unrest , and more than 13 arrests , in several cities across West Papua when hundreds of demonstrators raised the Morning Star independence flag in December 2009 .
The Indonesian press condemns the Papuan separatist movement and claims it tried to stop free elections in a democratic country .
“ Free ? ” asked Agus .
“ Democratic ?
So why does Papua keep counting its victims ? ”
There was hope of change when General Suharto resigned in 1998 after 30 years of absolute rule .
His centralist authoritarian dictatorship , backed by the army , had contained the racial , ethnic and religious mix of Indonesia – the largest archipelago in the world with 6,000 inhabited islands and a population of 240 million .
After he left it fell apart .
From Aceh to Papua , separatist forces rose , and many ethnic groups tried to reclaim their independence and identity , long stifled by the dominant Javanese culture .
The people of Papua , who rejected their annexation by Indonesia in 1962 and their official incorporation into the archipelago in 1969 after a sham referendum .
were granted “ special autonomy ” .
Indonesian nationalists think even that is too indulgent .
They say the constitution has been (...)
A new McDonald ’s ad running in France features a young gay man and the tag line “ Come as You Are . ”
But Bill O’Reilly wants to know — will McDonald ’s invite Al Qaeda in next ?
While some have asked why the McDonald ’s created the ad — no one has dug up a reason that a gay person would feel unwelcome in a French McDonald ’s — the most , uh , unusual take comes from pundit Bill O’Reilly .

Perched nervously on the edge of a chair in the principal 's office , a hole visible in one knee of his uniform , Kim Yong - hee visibly relaxes when he talks about his recently discovered talent for table tennis and love of martial arts films .
An interest in sport and movies , however , is perhaps all he has in common with other teenage boys in South Korea .
He is 17 , but looks 12 – a physical toll exacted by years of under - nourishment and hardship that two years ago prompted his escape , alone and under cover of darkness , from the country of his birth : North Korea .
Kim and the 200 other pupils at Hangyeore middle and high school , an imposing $ 7.4 m building in lush forests 80 kilometres south of Seoul , personify the cold war chasm that has consigned the two Koreas to a bitter estrangement that shows no sign of ending .
The pupils arrive traumatised by their flight from the North and , in many cases , separation from their families .
As the Guardian learned during a recent visit , they hope to leave equipped with the academic and social skills they need to prosper in a country dramatically different from the one they left behind .
Today marks the 60th anniversary of the start of what has come to be known as the war that never ended .
After three years of fighting , in which as many as four million people died , the two sides agreed on 27 July 1953 to a shaky truce , though no treaty was ever signed .
It is maintained by forces either side of the demilitarized zone [ DMZ ] , the world 's most heavily fortified border .
In the intervening years they have taken wildly divergent economic and social paths .
The North , the world 's only communist dynasty , remains desperately poor .
Last year its per capita income was 1.2 m won , 5 % of its neighbour 's , as it paid the price for international sanctions , deteriorating trade ties with the South and mismanagement of its command economy .
South Korea , a robust democracy since 1987 , has embraced the free market and grown to become the world 's 15th - largest economy , a leader in consumer electronics and home to the fastest internet connections on the planet .
Occasionally , hopes rise for a breakthrough that will pave the way to friendlier ties and eventual reunification , only to be dashed by isolated skirmishes , the arrival of hardline administrations in Seoul and the perennial unpredictability of a Pyongyang regime , led by Kim Jong - il , determined to turn itself into a nuclear power .
As both sides prepared to mark the day communist forces poured over the border , mounting tensions on the peninsula fuelled talk of a second Korean war .
Bilateral relations are at their lowest point in years following the March sinking of a South Korean warship , in which 46 sailors died , by a torpedo fired , according to international investigators , by a North Korean submarine .
But experts dismiss the fear that the two countries are moving inexorably towards war .
" North Korea 's provocations will continue as long as it continues to resist international pressure to denuclearise , " says Kim Sung - han , a professor of international relations at Korea University in Seoul .
" But there is a very low probability that a full - scale war will break out … due to the superior military capability of South Korea and the US . "
For Kim
Yong - hee , the current crisis is a timely reminder of the country in which he spent his first 15 years , and of why he decided to embark on a journey that so many others have tried and failed .
He says he was taken to the border by a go - between , who bribed a North Korean guard to take the teenager across the Tumen River into northeast China .
" At one point the water came up to my neck , " he said .
Like many North Korean defectors , he took a circuitous route to freedom , a week in China and three months in detention in Thailand , from where he was deported to South Korea .
He is desperate to be reunited with his mother , who escaped to the South a decade ago , but whom he has n't seen since starting at Hangyeore .
Two years after his escape , Kim is enjoying the education and freedoms denied to him in North Korea , where his schooling stopped at age 11 .
" I was never allowed to do any sports there , " he says , " but now I play table tennis and badminton , and practice taekwondo .
" I like living here because it's wealthy and I can do more or less what I like , but I miss my parents . "
The government - funded school opened in 2006 for youths among the 20,000 defectors in South Korea .
Many of Kim 's peers , who are aged 13 - 24 , arrived with just one or no parents and bore scars of a childhood spent in one of the world 's poorest and most repressive countries .
Most had witnessed public executions and seen members of their family die of starvation , and some still require regular counselling .
" There are such big differences that they find it hard to take in at first , " says the school 's principal , Gwak Jong - moon .
" Some had never seen a mobile phone , and they are not accustomed to thinking for themselves and competing academically . "
He smiles when asked to explain the differences in education either side of the DMZ .
" The contrast is huge .
In North Korea students are indoctrinated , taught to worship Kim Jong - il and [ the country 's founder ] Kim Il - sung .
They are disappointed to learn that they had been lied to .
They 're angry , but it helps them let go of old ideas . "
And what of the South Korean version of modern history ?
" They knew about the Korean war , but the North version is very different , " Gwak said .
" They were told the invasion was a pre-emptive strike against US plans to destroy the North .
We teach them that our involvement was an act of defence to contain the spread of Soviet communism . "
Despite government help , defectors of working age earn well below the average wage , and almost a fifth are in debt due to a combination of poor education and discrimination among employers .
But the prospect of struggling to find work pales in comparison to the life Yi Gil - dong believes she could have expected to endure in North Korea .
In the winter of 2007 she crossed a partially frozen Tumen River on the back of a bribed North Korean border guard , having been inspired to flee by a rare glimpse of a South Korean television drama .
" All I could think about was my parents , " says the 21 - year - old .
" I left while they were away on a trip and left I knew that they would be worried sick . "
Yi spent almost two years in China , most of it as a waitress at a Korean restaurant in Chengdu , from where she managed to contact her parents to tell them she was safe .
She has n't spoken to them since .
She says she has few fond memories of her previous life , aside from her mother 's cooking and the fresh air of her rural upbringing .
" I was n't even allowed to wear the shoes I wanted .
I went to school until I was 17 and , like the other students , I pretended to believe the propaganda we were taught at school .
But we knew the difference between being free and not being free .
" It feels natural for me to be here , like this is where I am supposed to be . "
Given her youth ,
Yi may live long enough to realize her dream of counselling North Koreans in a newly united nation .
But older defectors say they have witnessed too many false dawns to believe that unification is a realistic prospect .
" When I see the way Kim Jong - il is behaving , I do n't think unification will come anytime soon , " says Kim Young - chul , a former workers ' party activist who fled North Korea six years ago , aged 82 .
Yet like most of his adopted country 's 49 million people - 10 million of whom were separated from relatives by the war - he refuses to lose hope .
" After unification I will bring my sons , daughters and grandchildren here so they can see for themselves what freedom is really like . "
If that day does ever arrive , Gwak has high hopes for his pupils .
" I want them to become leaders in their field and play an active part in the movement for peace and freedom .
" We are the last truly divided nation in the world and , after unification , it will be up to young people like them to heal the wounds history has inflicted on us . "
The names of the defectors have been changed to protect their families
The Korean war – a people divided
The Korean war broke out at dawn on 25 June 1950 when almost a quarter of a million North Korean soldiers swept across the de facto border with South Korea , five years after the defeat of the peninsula 's former occupier , Japan .
The assault was a bold attempt to reunite the country , which had been spliced in two along the 38th parallel by the US and the Soviet Union at the end of the second world war .
Sixty years later , the peninsula remains divided by a four - kilometre wide , 266 km - long buffer zone – the world 's most heavily fortified border – centred on the village of Panmunjom .
To this day , almost two million troops , including 1.2 million from North Korea and 28,000 from the US , are engaged in a nervous standoff .

ARCHIVES | SEARCH Facebook , Google and Privacy Posted by Sean @ 17:16 GMT
There 's been a great deal of discussion ( controversy ? ) recently regarding personal privacy and the pursuit of profit .
Many pundits are concerned that businesses are putting personal data at risk for financial gains .
And so the question is being asked : Are Facebook and Google contributing to an erosion of personal privacy ?
So let 's take a look at that , shall we ?
If you want to find personal information about somebody , are you really dependent on Google ?
Or Facebook ?
Really ?
No… not really .
In fact , there 's LOTS of personal information that 's been available to academics and demographers for years .
For example , take the State of North Carolina , USA .
The NC State Board of Elections website is a great place to start as it provides a form for checking * my * registration .
And only two bits of data are required — first and last names .
Let 's take a look at a public figure , Richard Burr .
He 's North Carolina 's senior Senator .
Look what 's available : his full name , voter registration number , registration date , address and race .
Let 's see you get that info from Facebook .
Not likely .
Now we know his home address is in Forsyth County , so let 's visit the Forsyth County Tax Administration website and use their Geo-Data Explorer .
It 's super cool .
All you need the street address and presto , you get an aerial view with the property lines , the home value , property value , owners , et cetera .
Historical information is also available .
And check out this street view !
Man , that beats
Google 's street view , hands down .
No comparison at all .
Google 's an amateur .
Next , let 's take a look at an online phone book , White Pages dot com .
Again , using very little information , just first name , last name , city and state , we get these results :
Richard Burr 's work ( local office ) and home numbers .
And what else ?
Twitter ?
Really ?
Yep .
The Burr 's campaign Twitter feed is indexed in the White Pages .
There 's tons of information on this guy , and on non-public figures as well .
Resources such as this can be found all over the Internet .
Companies such as LexisNexis specialize in the collection and sale of data access and they started long before Sergey M. Brin , Lawrence E. Page and Mark Zuckerberg were even born .
So how exactly is Google and Facebook eroding privacy ?
Because they do in the open do what others do behind closed doors ?
Because they are trying to invent something new ?
Guess that depends on what you consider privacy .
Governments have always known your personal details .
Making some information public contributes to an open and healthy democracy .
So many things are n't really private , are they ?
Someone , somewhere already knows plenty of things about you .
At least you get something , services , for using Google and Facebook .
LexisNexis and others are n't going to give you a cent for your information .
And consider this , posting messages in online forums , commenting on blog posts and sharing links with your friends is kind of like having a private conversation in a public shopping mall .
Sure , you can have a personal conversation at your local coffee shop , but do you really expect that conversation to be secure ?
If somebody overhears your conversation , are you going to blame the shop owner for not protecting your personal information ?
No , of course not .
Facebook and Google are INTERNET services .
Internet equals public space .
Or at least , people should consider it to be so .
It 's more accurate to say that information technologies are eroding the length of time that is required to access your data .
Yes , that does have an impact on our online and real - world lives .
But should we panic about it ?
Should we be pointing the finger at Facebook and Google saying that they 're to blame because they are making business decisions ?
Do n't think so , information technologies are going to continue to open up personal information regardless of whether or not Google and Facebook are trying to make a profit .
Do you want data and personal privacy protections ?
Then pass a law protecting personal privacy from being misused by employers .
That 's what people really care about — their jobs and their livelihood — not being marketed to .
Perhaps that 's something Senator Burr will consider during his reelection campaign .
Arm your vuvuzelas : WordPress 3.0 , the thirteenth major release of WordPress and the culmination of half a year of work by 218 contributors , is now available for download ( or upgrade within your dashboard ) .
Major new features in this release include a sexy new default theme called Twenty Ten .
Theme developers have new APIs that allow them to easily implement custom backgrounds , headers , shortlinks , menus ( no more file editing ) , post types , and taxonomies .
( Twenty Ten theme shows all of that off . )
Developers and network admins will appreciate the long - awaited merge of MU and WordPress , creating the new multi-site functionality which makes it possible to run one blog or ten million from the same installation .
As a user , you will love the new lighter interface , the contextual help on every screen , the 1,217 bug fixes and feature enhancements , bulk updates so you can upgrade 15 plugins at once with a single click , and blah blah blah just watch the video .
🙂
( In HD , if you can , so you can catch the Easter eggs . )
If you ’d like to embed the WordPress 3.0 video tour in your blog , copy and paste this code for the high quality version :
For a more comprehensive look at everything that has improved in 3.0 check out 3.0 ’s Codex page or the long list of issues in Trac .
( We ’re trying to keep these announcement posts shorter . )
Whew !
That ’s a lot packed into one release .
I ca n’t think of a better way to kick off the 3.X cycle we ’ll be in for the next two and a half years .
The Future
Normally this is where I ’d say we ’re about to start work on 3.1 , but we ’re actually not .
We ’re going to take a release cycle off to focus on all of the things around WordPress .
The growth of the community has been breathtaking , including over 10.3 million downloads of version 2.9 , but so much of our effort has been focused on the core software it has n’t left much time for anything else .
Over the next three months we ’re going to split into ninja / pirate teams focused on different areas of the around - WordPress experience , including the showcase , Codex , forums , profiles , update and compatibility APIs , theme directory , plugin directory , mailing lists , core plugins , wordcamp.org … the possibilities are endless .
The goal of the teams is n’t going to be to make things perfect all at once , just better than they are today .
We think this investment of time will give us a much stronger infrastructure to grow WordPress.org for the many tens of millions of users that will join us during the 3.X release cycle .
It Takes a Village
I ’m proud to acknowledge the contributions of the following 218 people to the 3.0 release cycle .
These are the folks that make WordPress what it is , whose collaboration and hard work enable us to build something greater than the sum of our parts .
In alphabetical order , of course .

Iceland ’s parliament passed a law today that eliminates the distinction between “ marriage ” for straight couples and “ civil unions ” for gay couples , creating instead one marriage for all Icelanders , regardless of sexual orientation .
The law – approved with 49 yes votes and none against – was submitted by the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights last March .
The law is a correction of a previous law on marriage , where the definition is first and foremost changed from involving “ a man and a woman ” to simply “ two individuals . ”
In essence , whatever rights and privileges marriage granted a man and a woman who got married are now extended to any two human beings who get married , regardless of gender .
The law met with a great deal of resistance from members of the national church and others , but for the most part the proposal had received strong multipartisan support , as was evident when votes were cast .
Many members of parliament rose to make statements as to why they were voting the way they did , but Movement MP Margrét Tryggvadóttir probably summed it up best in saying .
“ I say ‘ yes ’ with a sun in my heart .
I feel that Iceland and the world is better than it was yesterday . ”
White House official : ' Organized labor just flushed $ 10 million down the toilet '
A senior White House official just called me with a very pointed message for the administration 's sometime allies in organized labor , who invested heavily in beating Blanche Lincoln , Obama 's candidate , in Arkansas .
" Organized labor just flushed $ 10 million of their members ' money down the toilet on a pointless exercise , " the official said .
" If even half that total had been well - targeted and applied in key House races across this country , that could have made a real difference in November . "
Lincoln relied heavily both on Obama 's endorsement , which she advertised relentlessly on radio and in the mail , and on the backing of former President Bill Clinton , who backed her to the hilt .
Lincoln foe Bill Halter had the unstinting support of the AFL - CIO , SEIU , AFSCME and other major unions .
And labor officials Tuesday evening were already working to spin the narrow loss of their candidate , Bill Halter , as a moral victory , but the cost in money and in the goodwill of the White House may be a steep price to pay for a near miss .
UPDATE : AFL - CIO spokesman Eddie Vale responds that " labor is n't an arm of the Democratic Party . "
Scientists who drew up the key World Health Organisation guidelines advising governments to stockpile drugs in the event of a flu pandemic had previously been paid by drug companies which stood to profit , according to a report out today .
An investigation by the British Medical Journal and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism , the not - for - profit reporting unit , shows that WHO guidance issued in 2004 was authored by three scientists who had previously received payment for other work from Roche , which makes Tamiflu , and GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) , manufacturer of Relenza .
City analysts say that pharmaceutical companies banked more than $ 7bn ( £ 4.8 bn ) as governments stockpiled drugs .
The issue of transparency has risen to the forefront of public health debate after dramatic predictions last year about a swine flu pandemic did not come true .
Some countries , notably Poland , declined to join the panic - buying of vaccines and antivirals triggered when the WHO declared the swine flu outbreak a pandemic a year ago this week .
The UK , which warned that 65,000 could die as a result of the virus , spent an estimated £ 1bn stockpiling drugs and vaccines ; officials are now attempting to unpick expensive drug contracts .
The cabinet office has launched an inquiry into the cost to the taxpayer of the panic - buying of drugs .
Today , the Council of Europe , produces a damning report into how a lack of openness around " decision making " has bedevilled planning for pandemics .
" The tentacles of drug company influence are in all levels in the decision - making process , " said Paul Flynn , the Labour MP who sits on the council 's health committee .
" It must be right that the WHO is transparent because there has been distortion of priorities of public health services all over Europe , waste of huge sums of public money and provocation of unjustified fear . "
Although the experts consulted made no secret of industry ties in other settings , declaring them in research papers and at universities , the WHO itself did not publicly disclose any of these in its seminal 2004 guidance .
In its note , the WHO advised : " Countries that are considering the use of antivirals as part of their pandemic response will need to stockpile in advance . "
Many nations would adopt this guidance , including Britain .
In 2005 , the government said it had begun bulk - buying the drug Tamiflu , initially ordering 14.6 m doses after bird flu killed 40 in Asia .
The specific guidance on antivirals was written by Professor Fred Hayden .
He has confirmed in an email that he was being paid by Roche for lectures and consultancy work at the time the guidance was produced and published .
He received payments from GSK for consultancy and lecturing until 2002 .
He said " [ declaration of interest ] forms were filled out for the 2002 consultation " .
The previous year Hayden was also one of the main authors of a Roche - sponsored study that asserted what was to become a main Tamiflu selling point – its claim of a 60 % reduction in flu hospitalisations .
Dr Arnold Monto was the author of the WHO annex dealing with vaccine usage in pandemics .
Between 2000 and 2004 , and at the time of writing the annex , Monto had openly declared consultancy fees and research support from Roche and GSK .
No conflict of interest statement was included in the annex published by the WHO .
When asked if he had signed a declaration of interest form for WHO , Dr Monto said " conflict of interest forms are requested before participation in any WHO meeting " .
The third scientist , Professor Karl Nicholson , is credited with the WHO 's influential work Pandemic Influenza .
According to declarations he made in the BMJ and Lancet in 2003 , he had received sponsorship from GSK and Roche .
Even though the previous year these declarations had been openly made , no conflict of interest statement was included in the annex .
Nicholson said he last had " financial relations " with Roche in 2001 .
When asked if he had signed a declaration of interest form for WHO , he replied : " The WHO does require attendees of meetings , such as those held in 2002 and 2004 , to complete declarations of interest . "
A WHO official told the BMJ it had to balance an individual 's privacy with the robustness of guidelines , which were subject to a wide external review process .
If you look beyond the international shouting match that began on Monday after Israel botched its handling of a Turkey - sponsored aid flotilla bound for Gaza , well , things look pretty shocking .
Just because at least nine people are dead —
Western casualties included — does n't mean the boat raid itself is what " has the makings of a huge international fracas . "
And just because the Turkish foreign minister says " this attack is like 9/11 " — which it is n't — does n't mean Tel Aviv will take its eyes off what the Israelis actually perceive to be the larger threat : Iran 's nuclear weapons .
Sure , President Obama probably nudged his ambassador to pull the trigger on the UN 's head - spinning condemnation of Israel this morning .
But in the days just before the attack , the UN was also finally reporting that Iran has sufficient enriched uranium for two nuclear devices , just as Israel was provocatively parking two diesel subs packed with nuclear cruise missiles off Iran 's coast .
If you read between the lines , then , I would say Turkey got itself formally admitted into this matchless rivalry just in time .
Trust me : Ankara has about as much interest in the Palestinians as the rest of the Muslim regimes in the region ; protesting their plight is a means to larger but self - serving ends .
Turkey is pursuing a policy of " zero problems " with its neighbors , all right , but elevating its regional influence requires that Ankara not be trumped by Tehran 's successful nuclear bid .
And that 's why Turkey is now committed to demonizing its old ally across the Mediterranean .
" Declaration of war , " you say ?
Allow me to unspin those heads a bit : Israel 's three - year - old blockade of the Gaza Strip was already preapproved for official UN censure , thanks to last September 's Goldstone Report .
The next logical step for Israel 's critics was to place it on the international front burner , dislodging the UN Security Council 's regional fixation on Tehran 's nuclear enrichment program .
An aid flotilla loaded with one ringer ( i.e. , the sixth and largest ship populated with committed activists spoiling for a violent — and videotaped — showdown ) was a brilliantly timed move of passive - aggression on Turkey 's part .
But no fight equals no media coverage , so the flotilla ignored Tel Aviv 's demands that the relief supplies be off - loaded in an Israeli port for inspection and subsequent shipment to Gaza .
And while the first five ships submitted peacefully to the boarding inspection parties , the sixth exploded in violent resistance — as planned .
Turkey 's deputy prime minister called the raid " a dark stain on the history of humanity . "
So now Ankara has its bloody shirt , which will be used — once Tehran inevitably announces the weaponization of its nukes — to justify Turkey 's rapid reach for the same .
Just like Tehran cannot openly rationalize its bid for regional supremacy vis-à - vis archrival Saudi Arabia , Turkey requires an appropriate villain for its nuclear morality play .
Anybody watching the deterioration of Turkish - Israeli relations over the past year knew that some cause célèbre was in the works .
Suddenly , if perhaps on purpose , Turkey can claim that — despite its efforts to broker a non-nuclear peace in the region ( including a recent enrichment deal engineered with Brazil ) — it needs its own deterrent against Israel 's nuclear arsenal , too .
Checkmate , Turkey .
And as for the Obama administration 's dream of enlisting Turkey 's UN Security Council vote for further sanctions against Iran , the White House is missing the larger point :
Turkey is uninterested in punishing Israel .
Turkey is interested in power .
The White House , in pursuing Obama 's naïve dream of a " world without nuclear weapons , " is chasing pawns around the board .
But , above all , remember this is a three - dimensional , multisided chess match : Iran duping the world with its nuclear threats against Israel ; Turkey now set to justify its own bid against this " rogue " regime ; and the Saudis yet to make any significant moves against their Shiite nemesis .
But you 've gotta watch out for those Saudis — knowing their love for misdirection and duplicitous dealings , I would expect them to simultaneously squeeze the Obama administration for more military sales , continue secretly cooperating with Pakistan on its own nuclear program ( just like Turkey ) , and quietly collaborate with Israel on its planned air strikes against Iran .
Prepared to be shocked — shocked ! — at the " stunning revelations " to come .

AT&T is the carrier with the weakest lineup of Google Android smartphones , but you can't really blame them when they have the Apple iPhone locked down on their network .
A new iPhone launches on AT&T next week which looks to give HTC just a small window to announce the new HTC Aria Google Android device .
I personally am more of a fan of the Google Android operating system and think this looks like a nice device for those on AT&T looking for something other than an iPhone this summer .
THe HTC Aria is powered by Android 2.1 with HTC Sense .
Other key specifications and features include a 5 - megapixel camera , 3.2 inch HVGA display , and price of just $ 129.99 after a $ 100 mail - in rebate and two year agreement .
The HTC Aria will be available on June 20th , the same week as the iPhone 4 .
It is quite a compact device with a length of just over 4 inches and a weight of 4.05 ounces .
Image caption Low - lying Tuvalu is one of many Pacific states worried by climate change
A new geological study has shown that many low - lying Pacific islands are growing , not sinking .
The islands of Tuvalu , Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia are among those which have grown , because of coral debris and sediment .
One of the authors of the study , featured in the magazine the New Scientist , predicts that the islands will still be there in 100 years ' time .
However he says it is not clear whether many of them will be inhabitable .
Prognosis ' incorrect '
In recent times , the inhabitants of many low - lying Pacific islands have come to fear their homelands being wiped off the map because of rising sea levels .
But this study of 27 islands over the last 60 years suggests that most have remained stable , while some have actually grown .
Using historical photographs and satellite imaging , the geologists found that 80 % of the islands had either remained the same or got larger - in some cases , dramatically so .
They say it is due to the build - up of coral debris and sediment , and to land reclamation .
Associate Professor Paul Kench of Auckland University , who took part in the study , published in the journal Global and Planetary Change , says the islands are not in immediate danger of extinction .
" That rather gloomy prognosis for these nations is incorrect , " he said .
" We have now got the evidence to suggest that the physical foundation of these countries will still be there in 100 years , so they perhaps do not need to flee their country . "
But although these islands might not be submerged under the waves in the short - term , it does not mean they will be inhabitable in the long - term , and the scientists believe further rises in sea levels pose a significant danger to the livelihoods of people living in Tuvalu , Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia .
One scientist in Kiribati said that people should not be lulled into thinking that inundation and coastal erosion were not a major threat .
The rebuilding of earthquake - ravaged Haiti has all but ground to a halt , according to a leaked report by Sen. John Kerry .
Poor leadership , disputes among donors , and general disorganization are delaying crucial projects , as millions of Haitians remain sheltered in tents five months after the quake , the report says .
And hurricane season threatens to set things back further .
Former U.S. president Bill Clinton , along with Haitian Prime Minister Jean - Max Bellerive , last week inaugurated the commission overseeing reconstruction spending , promising to speed up the work .
But the leaked report made clear the task is daunting .
( Watch an AFP report about Haiti 's reconstruction . )
Here are some of the numbers surrounding Haiti 's stalled reconstruction :
$ 5.3 billion
" Near - term " humanitarian aid pledged by private donors , charities and countries
$ 106 million
Amount of near - term aid actually delivered , five months after the quake ( 2 percent of the money pledged )
$ 40 million
Amount that came from Brazil , the only country to deliver its entire pledge so far
$ 2 billion
Amount pledged by U.S. , to be debated by Congress later this month
$ 10 billion
Approximate total amount of aid pledged , including long - term donations to be paid out over the next decade
26
Number of people on Bill Clinton 's reconstruction commission .
Kerry 's report says the well - staffed panel could " dramatically slow things down through cumbersome bureaucratic obstacles . "
18 months
Amount of time in which the $ 5.3 billion near - term funds overseen by Clinton 's commission must be allocated
$ 500,000
Maximum donation that does n't fall under the Clinton commission 's control .
Every donation above $ 500,000 must be approved by the commission , with Haitian President Rene Preval wielding veto power
1.5 million
Number of Haitians still living under tents and tarpaulins five months after the quake
700,000
Number of people who left Port - au - Prince after the quake and are currently living elsewhere in the country
105,000
Number of homes destroyed by the earthquake .
1,300 schools and 50 hospitals also need rebuilding
25
Percentage of Haiti's civil servants who died in the January quake .
Having lost so many of its employees , says Haiti expert Robert Maguire , the government " needs very much to become stronger and to reinstitute itself " if rebuilding is going to succeed .

How much bigger could the Fannie Mae money pit get ?
When reporting first - quarter results Monday , the government - controlled mortgage - buyer said it is requesting $ 8.4 billion from the Treasury Department so it can remain solvent .
When that is disbursed , total taxpayer infusions into Fannie would reach an eye - watering $ 84.6 billion .
But new disclosures Monday suggest Fannie 's balance sheet could be even weaker than it appears .
Here 's why : Each quarter , Fannie presents one balance sheet compiled under standard accounting rules and another using estimated market values .
Under the market - value approach , Fannie 's equity — what is left after subtracting liabilities from assets — was minus - $ 145 billion at the end of March , far worse than the minus - $ 98.8 billion at the end of 2009 .
( Under the standard approach , equity was minus - $ 8.4 billion March 31 . )
Fannie used to calculate the estimated market value of the company 's obligation to pay out on its guarantees for defaulting home loans .
As a result of an accounting rule change , Fannie now estimates what it would get if it sold the past - due loans in the market .
This primarily accounted for a $ 52.3 billion hit to the market - value balance sheet , Fannie said .
Before the accounting change , skeptics had wondered whether the guarantee liability was big enough to cover potential losses .
The new accounting approach suggests it was n't .
The U.S. is n't necessarily on the hook for losses implied by the " market value " deficit .
Fannie says the market currently understates the economic value of the nonperforming loans , and it intends to maximize the value of its distressed loans .
That may happen over time .
But in the meantime , the Treasury and the taxpayer have to wonder how big Fannie 's final bill will be .
A 5,500 - year - old leather shoe – complete with laces – has been unearthed in cave in Armenia .
The perfectly preserved shoe – 1,000 years older than the Great Pyramid of Giza and 400 years older than Stonehenge – is the oldest known example of enclosed leather footwear , out - dating the shoes worn by “ Ötzi the Iceman ” by a few hundred years .
The sole - less right shoe is made out of a single piece of cow hide and was found containing grass , which may have served to keep the foot warm or to maintain the shape of the shoe .
It is not known whether the shoe – 24.5 cm long and a European size 37 – belonged to a man or a woman , though it is thought to have been best suited to a male .
It has been dated to the Chalcolithic period , about 3500BC .
The discovery was made in Vayotz Dzor province on Armenia ’s border with Iran and Turkey by Diana Zardaryan , of Armenia ’s Institute of Archaeology .
“ I was amazed to find that even the shoelaces were preserved , ” she said .
The discovery – made in 2008 – has been published in the online scientific journal PloS ONE .
Such a well - preserved artifact from a Middle Eastern archaeological site is unusual because the high content of salts and fungi in the soil , as well as fluctuations in temperature and humidity , usually fast - track the deterioration of organic materials .
However the cave ’s stable , cool conditions – aided by a thick layer of sheep dung on the floor – aided preservation .
Other finds at the site included large containers , many storing well - preserved wheat , barley and apricots , plus a broken pot , fish bones and sheep ’s horns .
“ We could n't believe the discovery , ” said the dig 's co-director Gregory Areshian , part of an international team of archaeologists working at the site .
“ The crusts had sealed the artifacts and archaeological deposits , and artifacts remained fresh dried , just like they were put in a can . ”
The shoe is similar to the ' pampootsies ' worn until the 1950s on Ireland ’s Aran Islands .
“ Enormous similarities exist between manufacturing technique and style of this shoe and those found across Europe at later periods , ” said Dr Ron Pinhasi of Cork University .
“ ( This suggests ) that this type of shoe was worn for thousands of years across a large and environmentally diverse geographic region .
" We do not know yet what the shoe or other objects were doing in the cave or what the purpose of the cave was .
We know that there are children 's graves at the back of the cave but so little is known about this period that we cannot say with any certainty why all these different objects were found together . "
The team will continue to excavate the cave , which has multiple chambers .
While the Armenian discovery may claim the honours as the world ’s oldest leather shoe , the oldest known footwear – a moccasin and a pair of leather sandals discovered in a cave in Missouri – are believed to be some 2,000 years older .
A showdown is looming over whether commitments made to retirees by government pension funds can be scaled back in dire economic times .
Facing shortfalls , some public pension funds are responding by paring back payouts pledged to retired workers .
Earlier this year , pension funds in Colorado and Minnesota curtailed annual cost - of - living increases .
" No matter how draconian you got on the new hires , you ran out of money " if you did n't cut benefits to current retirees , said Meredith Williams , chief executive of the Colorado Public Employees ' Retirement Association , with $ 34.2 billion in assets .
In February , Colorado lawmakers passed a bill that reduced the pension system 's cost - of - living adjustment from a fixed 3.5 % a year to a maximum of 2 % — but possibly less for current and future retirees .
The new law also increased contributions from employees and employers .
For example , retirees who were expecting a 3.5 % increase in cost - of - living adjustments this year will receive no increase .
In response , Colorado and Minnesota have been hit by lawsuits filed by retirees , who claim the changes violate state law .
Those retirees have " lived up to their end of the bargain , and the state is not living up to theirs , " says Stephen Pincus , a Pittsburgh lawyer representing plaintiffs in both states .

BP chief of staff Steve Westwell was delivering the speech in place of the oil giant 's beleaguered chief executive Tony Hayward
Anti-BP protesters from Greenpeace today disrupted a speech by the company 's chief of staff , Steve Westwell , at a major oil conference in London , urging the company to change its ways following the Deepwater Horizon disaster .
Westwell was delivering the speech in place of the oil giant 's beleaguered chief executive , Tony Hayward , who last night cancelled what would have been his first public appearance in the UK since the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico began .
Westwell 's speech , to oil executives and energy ministers at the World National Oil Companies Congress , was interrupted when two female protesters from Greenpeace , Emma Gibson and Katie Swan , approached the stage holding a banner which read " Go Beyond Petroleum " .
" We need to speed up progress and make a push to end the oil age , " Gibson told the audience , before being bundled off by security .
Before the protest , Hayward 's stand - in had apologised for the BP chief executive 's absence , saying : " He is genuinely sorry he could n't be here , especially with so many friends in the conference .
But his schedule is under incredible pressure at the moment . "
Speaking after they had been ejected from the conference , Swan told the Guardian that she and Gibson had gone ahead with the protest despite Hayward 's no -show as it was a chance to address the oil industry .
" We wanted to use the opportunity to speak to BP and push it to change things .
BP should n't be drilling in deep water and it should n't extract oil from the Canadian tar sands . "
Swan studied in Louisiana for four years , and was very concerned about the environmental and economic damage caused by the oil spill .
" It looks like irreparable damage has been done .
People 's lives will have been changed forever , " Swan said .
Gibson said that BP was in " severe trouble " because it had not listened to activists in the past , and had instead pushed on with riskier projects .
" If they had heeded our advice over many years about the need to deliver genuine renewable energy sources , they would not be facing a $ 40 bn ( £ 24 bn ) disaster today , " she said .
Hayward heading to Russia ?
Westwell , who arrived through the back entrance at The Grange St Paul 's hotel to avoid journalists , insisted that BP 's commitment to clean up the oil spill would last longer than the press interest in the story .
" When the media has left the Gulf and the headlines have gone elsewhere we will still be there helping , " he said .
Westwell said the company was now capturing up to 25,000 barrels a day in the Gulf of Mexico and described the financial consequences of the spill as severe , but reiterated BP would come through it .
So far , BP has spent $ 2bn fighting the spill and compensating victims since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion on 20 April .
Hayward 's non-appearance was the talk of the conference this morning .
Paul Gilbertson , one of the organisers , described it as a " disappointment " .
Hayward has also pulled out of an appearance at the National Portrait Gallery in London tonight where he was due to open an awards ceremony .
Hayward is reportedly making a trip to see Russian president Dmitry Medvedev to reassure him that BP remains a robust company .
Its joint venture with TNK is responsible for 25 % of BP 's revenues .
The BP boss was pilloried for attending a yacht race around the Isle of Wight on Sunday , while the company battles to contain the thousands of barrels of oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico every day .
Last night celebrities in New York and Los Angeles came rushing to the rescue as the Larry King Live Show turned itself over to two hours of fundraising to help the affected people and animals of the Gulf region .
The line - up included Sting , who performed his song Fragile , Robert Redford and Cameron Diaz .
The US TV show host explained the purpose of his CNN telethon in characteristically eloquent fashion .
" Remember bureaucracy is slow ; you can hear about billions being donated but it do n't get there tomorrow .
We 're going to do our best to get it there pronto . "
Although a Brit , and a fan of ST : TNG , I hate the " Honours " system with a passion .
It perpetuates a system whereby , by accident of birth , the vast majority of the population are consigned to be second , or lower , class .
It is a hangover from mediaeval times that any rational society would have abandoned , with prejudice , long ago .
Some say that the " honouring " of people like Patrick Stewart demonstates the modern " meritocratic " system .
But when was the last time you heard of a streetsweeper or shop assistant ( who , let 's face it , do not have the financial rewards or lifestyle of the successful actor or sports or business person ) receiving one of the major awards .
To see Patrick Stewart accepting this entitlement does nothing but lower my opinion of him , and frankly of you for lauding it .
The honours system may look pretty from outside but from in here it reeks of class and privilege .
Rant over .
( CNN ) --
The Chattanooga , Tennessee , police department has placed an officer on paid administrative leave after he arrested a man who was speeding and ran three red lights as he tried to rush his wife to a hospital , police said .
The couple believed she was having a stroke , they said .
But in his affidavit , the officer said that the man 's speeding caused him and another vehicle to " slam on the brakes " to avoid collision .
Lt. Kim Noorbergen of the Chattanooga Police Department said Officer James Daves will remain on leave until an internal affairs investigation comes to a conclusion over Wednesday 's incident involving newlyweds Eric " Jessie " Wright and his wife , Aline .
According to Wright , he and his wife were at their home on Wednesday night when she began showing possible signs of a stroke , with symptoms including numbness in her arms and a facial droop .
Wright said that his wife , who lost a leg to cancer , ran the risk of having a stroke because of the chemotherapy used to fight the cancer .
Wright -- a trained emergency medic -- said he took his wife 's vital signs and decided to take her to the emergency room at nearby Erlanger Medical Center , where they both work .
An ambulance would have taken an additional 20 to 30 minutes , he said .
Wright said after carrying his wife to their car , he called the medical center to report that they were on the way , and he drove with his emergency blinkers on , blew his horn and was " cautious " as he crossed the red lights .
Daves fell in behind Wright at an intersection , with his police car lights and siren on .
Wright said he was too close to the hospital to stop , and upon arrival he immediately carried his wife to the emergency room because she did not have her prosthetic leg .
The police officer confronted him , Wright said , and told him that he was " going to send me to jail . "
Wright said Daves also referred to him with an obscenity .
Daves could not be reached for comment Monday .
But in his affidavit , in addition to saying that Wright nearly caused a collision , Daves wrote that " ( the ) defendant stopped in the ER entrance and jumped out and ran .
Police made contact with Defendant at the passenger side of his vehicle and I grabbed the defendant 's arm and he pushed me away scraping my arm with his fingernail .
Defendant yelled and said it was an emergency . "
" Defendant pushed through the crowd and carried a female back into the emergency room and placed her in a room with no permission of the hospital staff , " Daves writes .
He also said Wright 's registration was expired .
Wright said at the hospital , Daves threatened to file felony charges against him .
He said that after spending the night with his wife , he went to the jail to turn himself in .
Jail personnel told him there were no warrants for his arrest , Wright said
But Friday morning , he was taken into custody by the hospital security officers and taken to the Hamilton County jail where he spent the day before he was released on a $ 7,500 bail , charged with seven felonies , Wright said .
Wright said he feels that Daves ' actions at the emergency room endangered his wife 's health " and that he ( Daves ) was trumping up charges to get back at me . "
CNN affiliate WTVC reported that Aline Wright was out of the hospital by Friday morning and , while she had stroke - like symptoms , she was not diagnosed as having had a stroke .
A team at Goldman , decidedly different team from the one which this morning said the EUR could drop to a 1.16 level shortly , looks at recent fund flow data and notes that with the US now perceived as a safe haven to the rest of the world , particularly Europe , a fact which implicitly is a huge benefit to the treasury supply onslaught as buyers for USTs no matter the yield or maturity , are easily found in this environment of insecurity .
No surprise there : it is almost as if Europe 's problems were engineered , courtesy of a EURUSD which was kept too high , for too long , by too many market participants .
Goldman 's conclusion is that the dollar is not the fundamental safe haven it is portrayed to be , but is , once again , merely the best of the worst .
As Goldman 's Robin Brooks highlights : " non-Treasury portfolio inflows are still falling short of covering the monthly trade deficit , in contrast to before the crisis when they were more than enough .
This is consistent with our often repeated view that the BBoP ( broad basic balance ) for the US remains weak and is why – even in the face of strong foreign inflows into Treasuries – we remain cautious about the USD outlook . "
Brooks continues :
Foreign participation – both official and private – was 20.1 % for the data available for May , close to the historical average of around 17 % and down from a peak of 40 % in the immediate wake of the global financial crisis .
Though this is only an incomplete picture – it ignores the secondary market – it does argue against reserve managers piling into USD .
We get the same impression from other data sources we look at , notably Asian reserve accumulation , which also does not point to a sharp shift in favor of USD .
We will continue to monitor foreign participation in Treasury auctions , and the broader portfolio flow picture , with a view to revising our USD outlook as warranted .
The primary reason for the increasingly strong bid for gold is explained by Brooks ' observation : while unwinds in existing FX carry pairs continue to implicitly benefit the dollar , when it comes to allocating capital to a safe haven , the only recourse continue to be gold .
And as FX is fickle , all it takes is one massive short covering spree to invert the balance of power once again in the direction of the EUR : all that would be needed is a wholesale realization that the consolidated US balance sheet is in far worse shape than that of Europe , and for the herd to shift from one side of the boat to the other .
Yet should more volatility come into FX markets , gold would benefit even more .
From Goldman Sachs :
Last week ended with the USD appreciating sharply , on escalating sovereign fears and weaker - than - expected US payrolls .
This strength runs counter to our forecast , which is driven by an underlying picture of still weak portfolio inflows , something we have emphasized repeatedly in our BBoP framework .
But the Euro crisis has the potential to boost foreign inflows , if foreigners – reserve managers among them – decide the US is the “ best looking horse in the glue factory . ”
In light of this , we review US Treasury data on foreign portfolio flows to the US , which in March registered an all time high .
We also survey more timely Treasury auction data for foreign take - up .
We conclude that the fundamental picture – fear aside – is still not USD supportive and will continue to watch closely for any changes
1 . The week ahead
Last week ’s batch of PMI ’s – pointing to still strong industrial activity in May – initially allayed fears that the ongoing crisis in Europe is spilling over into the real economy .
But comments from the new ruling party in Hungary that the country stands on the verge of a sovereign default – unwarranted in our view – and weaker - than - expected US payrolls delivered a one - two punch on Friday that caused the SPX to fall 3.4 % and forced EUR / $ through 1.20 to its lowest level since 2006 .
Over the weekend , a G - 20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors stepped back from a global bank levy , acknowledging differences across countries in how – and whether – such a measure should be adopted .
The focus today and tomorrow is on the Efofin meeting , at which details of the sovereign SPV structure may be unveiled .
Against this unsettled backdrop , the most important hard data this week are out of China and they will inevitably be parsed for signs of weakness , especially following last week ’s – in our view largely seasonal – drop in China ’s PMI .
We expect IP to grow an above - consensus 17.5 % yoy in May , only slightly below the 17.8 % yoy April pace , while year - to - date growth of fixed asset investment through May should slow to 25.6 % yoy , essentially in line with consensus .
Exports should grow an above - consensus 38 % yoy , up from 30.5 % yoy in April , on a low base , while retail sales growth should inch up in May .
CPI inflation should rise in line with consensus to 3 % yoy from 2.8 % in April .
In the US , Friday brings retail sales for May , which we think will grow a stronger - than - consensus 0.5 % mom , but excluding autos we anticipate a slight contraction .
The week has a clutch of central bank meetings .
Following the release of Q1 GDP on Tuesday ( we expect strong , consensus - like growth of 2.5 % qoq ) , we expect Brazil ’s central bank to hike 75 bps .
Governor Meirelles ’ comments at the G - 20 summit this weekend betrayed little concern over ongoing sovereign fears elsewhere .
We also expect the RBNZ to hike 25 bps on Wednesday , though a hike may be accompanied by a dovish statement , following the Bank of Canada ’s recent template .
We expect South Korea ’s central bank to remain on hold , and the Bank of England and ECB to do likewise .
2. USD keeps appreciating …
The DXY index , a widely followed – if in our view outdated – measure of US $ strength , is now around the same level as in November ‘ 08 after the Lehman collapse .
On a broader trade - weighted basis , the US $ has also risen , though – because EUR / $ has a smaller weight – not as much .
We are naturally asking ourselves – as are many others – if this appreciation is simply a repeat of Q4 2008 , when safe - haven buying drove USD sharply higher , or if it reflects more fundamental strength .
To look at this , we look to data on foreign portfolio flows published by the US Treasury , popularly known as the TIC report ( short for Treasury International Capital ) .
The latest release available shows that net long term portfolio flows to the US amounted to $ 140.5 bn in March , a big turn from net outflows of - $ 72.8 bn in August 2007 and - $ 33.1 bn as late as January 2009 .
Indeed , the March release eclipsed the previous high of $ 135.8 bn in May 2007 , just before the start of the global financial crisis .
We next examine in detail whether the TIC data signal rising fortunes for USD , though we caution that the latest available data – for March – predate the serious escalation of the Euro zone crisis from mid-April .
3 . But the rise is driven by fear …
Even if total portfolio inflows are once again looking strong , their composition points to weakness .
Foreign flows into US Treasuries – at 77 % of total net inflows – were dominant in March 2010 , while in May 2007 – the previous high for net long - term inflows – they accounted for only 17 % .
In contrast , net inflows into US corporate debt made up only 11 % of the total in March 2010 , compared to 58 % back in May 2007 .
Flows into US equities were 8 % of the total , far below the 31 % in May 2007 .
Agency debt is the only category where the picture is almost back to pre-crisis levels .
Net agency inflows were 16 % of the total this March , only a trifle below the 20 % recorded in May 2007 .
Overall , this shift is symptomatic of the global “ flight to safety ” that has benefitted US Treasuries , which has come in many ways at the expense of flows into other , more growth - oriented assets .
4. ... Not underlying strength
As strong as foreign flows into Treasuries are , we discount their importance for USD somewhat as they may be substantially currency hedged , reflecting in part the steepness of the US yield curve .
Indeed , their historical correlation with trade - weighted USD is negative , indicating that Treasury inflows are not a reliable driver of USD strength .
Meanwhile , as we have detailed above , other flows to the US are still very weak , notably those with a growth orientation , like flows into corporate debt and equity .
It is these flows that – unlike Treasury flows – have a positive correlation with trade - weighted USD and are thus a more reliable driver of USD strength .
If we total up private ( excluding central bank purchases ) non-Treasury inflows to the US and add them to the monthly trade deficit , this in March 2010 gives us a negative balance of - $ 12.8 bn , far below the positive balance of $ 37.8 bn in May 2007 .
This highlights that private , non-Treasury portfolio inflows are still falling short of covering the monthly trade deficit , in contrast to before the crisis when they were more than enough .
This is consistent with our often repeated view that the BBoP ( broad basic balance ) for the US remains weak and is why – even in the face of strong foreign inflows into Treasuries – we remain cautious about the USD outlook .
5 . No indication that foreign reserve managers are piling into USD
With foreign flows into Treasuries at all time highs – even if we discount their importance for USD – are reserve managers piling into USD at the expense of other currencies , notably the Euro ?
For this , we look to foreign participation in US Treasury auctions of longer term securities , which the US Treasury also publishes .
Foreign participation – both official and private – was 20.1 % for the data available for May , close to the historical average of around 17 % and down from a peak of 40 % in the immediate wake of the global financial crisis .
Though this is only an incomplete picture – it ignores the secondary market – it does argue against reserve managers piling into USD .
We get the same impression from other data sources we look at , notably Asian reserve accumulation , which also does not point to a sharp shift in favor of USD .
We will continue to monitor foreign participation in Treasury auctions , and the broader portfolio flow picture , with a view to revising our USD outlook as warranted .
FREEHOLD --
State officials announced today how they will implement a new law requiring New Jersey drivers under 21 years old with provisional licenses to place red reflective decals on their license plates to identify themselves as new drivers .
The law , named after Morris County teenager Kyleigh D'Alessio , who died in a car accident when 16 years old , is the first of its kind in the country and becomes effective on May 1 , officials said .
The decals , which can be purchased for $ 4 a pair at motor vehicle agencies starting April 12 , are supposed to be affixed to the upper left corner of the front and rear license plates .
They can also be removed when an older driver uses the car , or placed on a different car used by the young driver .
The decals were originally going to be orange , Kyleigh 's favorite color , but authorities determined red would be more visible .
Raymond Martinez , who runs the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission , called the law " one of the most significant steps forward in teen driver safety . "
Attorney General Paula
Dow said the decals will provide police with probable cause to stop people suspected of breaking motor vehicle laws aimed specifically at younger drivers .
For example , Dow said police will pull over cars displaying the new decals on the road between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. or carrying too many passengers , two violations of the state 's graduated drivers license laws .
Ewing Police Chief Robert Coulton , president of the New Jersey Chiefs of Police Association , said cops have previously had trouble identifying drivers who may be breaking laws on probationary licenses .
However , he said young drivers may try to avoid police scrutiny by removing the decals , risking a $ 100 penalty .
" That 's a possibility , " he said .
" With every law , you can get around it . "
The law , signed last year by former Gov. Jon Corzine , has been a source of controversy .
Attorney Gregg Trautmann argued in Superior Court in Morristown that the law is unconstitutional because the decals are a “ scarlet letter ” of age discrimination against teen drivers , making them targets for police and even sexual predators .
Judge Robert Brennan dismissed the lawsuit earlier this month , saying , “ Operating a motor vehicle is not a right , it ’s a privilege subject to state regulations .
Kyleigh ’s Law does not violate the constitutions of the United States or New Jersey . ”

Comfortably settled in ClubAcela , the first - class lounge at New York ’s Penn Station , I considered the folder of Amtrak sleeping car tickets much as I would money in the bank : a promise of good times ahead .
I would travel on the Lake Shore Limited to Chicago , the Empire Builder to Seattle and , finally , the Coast Starlight to Los Angeles .
These trains , two of Amtrak ’s best and one of its most improved , would show me a huge slice of America for the next week .
During my 3,582 - mile journey in March , the scenically mundane mixed in with the magnificent , and that was fine with me .
There were books to read , people to meet , naps to take .
Both urban and small - town America scrolled past my windows , along with less - peopled spaces in between .
The most spectacular — the Hudson River , the Rockies and the Cascades , Puget Sound , the Pacific — proved unforgettable .
Most of Amtrak ’s long - distance trains use double - deck Superliner equipment , but those cars wo n’t fit through the tunnels into New York City , so overnight trains fanning out from there — to Florida , New Orleans and on two routes to Chicago — use single - level equipment .
Sleeping cars are Viewliners , so named because the two levels of windows provide views from upper and lower berths .
Dining cars are in the Heritage Fleet , a creative euphemism for old .
Still , I find them perfectly functional , even attractive , and they are a source of nostalgia for longtime train riders .
I ’ve been a train rider all my life .
Beginning with trips back and forth from New Jersey to Utah in my youth , I ’ve spent hundreds of nights in sleeping cars on six continents , and I ’m certainly a train buff , perhaps even a borderline “ foamer , ” the gently derisive term for enthusiasts so crazy about trains that we foam at the mouth .

At the beginning of this journey , the tracks paralleled the Hudson on the 141 miles to Albany , N.Y. , and I saw familiar sights of which I never tire .
There was a run of beautiful bridges : the George Washington , the Tappan Zee , the Bear Mountain , the Mid-Hudson and , in Poughkeepsie , a leggy railroad bridge , long abandoned but reopened just last year as a pedestrian walkway .
There was West Point , looking formidable , and the 1850s military surplus warehouse Bannerman Castle , crumbling .
Breakneck Mountain .
Lighthouses .
The route guide I ’d found in my roomette ( all the trains I rode had them ) told me about this , plus much more .
My roomette — a small compartment with facing seats that make down into a narrow berth .
— was comfortable for me as a solo traveler .
In Albany , I went to the diner , built in 1957 for the illustrious North Coast Limited ( then a competitor to the Empire Builder , my next train ) .
Recently refurbished , it felt fresh .
My lamb shank dinner was just fine — as was my omelet with bacon and a biscuit the next morning .
West of Chicago , it ’s a bigger and better Amtrak world .
At Union Station , my wife , Laurel ( she made the balance of the trip with me ) , and I walked along an impressive string of tall , gleaming Superliners , searching for our sleeper , No. 731 , the New Hampshire .
( Naming sleeping cars is a long - standing railroad tradition . )
We found it and climbed the stairs to our upper - level bedroom — like “ roomette , ” an official Amtrak designation .
Because it was a two - night journey , we had sprung for this relatively posh accommodation : a chair , table , sofa ( which can be turned into an oversized lower berth ) , an upper berth that folds down , a basin in the room and an annex with a toilet and shower .
( Because showering soaks the annex , we used the commodious private shower on the first level . )

Dorothy , our car attendant , was on the job from the moment we arrived at our sleeper ’s vestibule door shortly before the 2:15 p.m. departure .
She helped with the luggage .
She brought mimosas to our room , and she always struck the right balance between friendliness and professionalism .
Dorothy was new to Amtrak , having been hired in June 2009 , “ the first time Amtrak had hired in years , ” she said .
Among hundreds of applicants , only eight were chosen , and Dorothy , who had been a restaurant manager , was happy to be one of them .
We whiled away the first afternoon watching the Illinois and Wisconsin countryside from our seats in the Sightseer Lounge — a bright , airy car with broad , high windows and skylights in the ceiling shoulders .
About the time we reached the Wisconsin Dells , dusk had darkened into evening and our thoughts had turned to cocktails and dinner .
Amtrak dining - car service has always been an up - and - down proposition .
But the Empire Builder ’s amenities included linen and china in the dining car .
The menu , somewhat train - specific , offered plenty of tasty options for two dinners , and lunch and breakfast as well .
Our dinner favorites were steaks and spare ribs .
For lunch , I chose creamy beef and ale soup , and Laurel ordered a salad with apples , blue cheese and walnuts .
The next morning , we awakened in North Dakota to a whiteout .
At first we thought it was a blizzard , but it turned out to be heavy fog .
Roads were slick with rain .
By lunchtime , patches of blue had appeared , and in midafternoon , the sun reflected off the remaining snow , scribed by zigzags of game tracks .
Backlighted , leafless trees seemed bizarre , capering dancers , arms akimbo .

By then , however , not everything was bright .
All the toilets in the sleeper car — the private ones in the five bedrooms and the three public ones — had failed .
Chagrined but helpless , Dorothy held out little hope of repair , and she was right , but public toilets in the next car were just a few steps away .
( She suggested we complain to Amtrak , which we did , and received a $ 100 voucher for future travel . )
We were cheered by the midafternoon wine tasting in the diner ( complimentary for sleeping - car passengers ) , hosted by Tanner , from the same training class as Dorothy .
There were three wines and three complementary cheeses , and Tanner ran a trivia contest to give away the wine remaining after the tasting .
“ What states have capitals whose names begin with the same letter as the state ? ” he asked .
Dover , Del. , was the toughest answer .
Dorothy once again shone on the last morning of this leg of the journey , when the diner was closed hours before our arrival so the crew could get it packed away , an all too typical practice on Amtrak .
She said she could bring us something from the diner .
We selected biscuits , butter and honey , to which she added orange wedges ( coffee and juice are always available in Amtrak sleepers ) , then set us up in an adjacent bedroom while she made up ours .
The traverse through the Cascades while eating breakfast was a highlight , especially because we had passed Glacier National Park after dark .
Next came the Seattle - L.A. Coast Starlight , arguably Amtrak ’s best train , primarily because of the Pacific Parlour Car , a lounge and dining space provided exclusively for sleeping - car passengers .
No other Amtrak train offers this .
These cars — veterans that ran half a century ago on Santa Fe ’s El Capitan and San Francisco Chief trains but rebuilt and refurbished — have three sections : a parlor space with swivel chairs , a cocktail lounge with banquettes and a dining area with tables that might serve four but are generally assigned to couples .

We were just settling in after leaving Seattle when chef Dion passed through the car and introduced herself .
“ You ’re going to have a beautiful trip , ” she said .
Instead of the dining car , though , we chose to have most of our meals in the quiet and intimate Pacific Parlour Car , though the menu was limited .
It became our home away from home for meals , for sightseeing ( Puget Sound , the mountains of Cuesta Pass into San Luis Obispo , and the grand finale , the Pacific Coast at sunset ) and for a wine tasting ( $ 5 charge , and not quite as much fun as the Empire Builder ’s ) .
As we were packing up our things on the approach to Los Angeles , chef Dion poked her head into our roomette .
“ Thanks for riding with us , ” she said .
“ Come back again . " travel@latimes.com
Over the weekend we got a hold of the commercial slides and scripts for the new batch of Motorola Droid 2 and Droid X commercials that are slated to run as we get closer to launch next month .
After reading the scripts on these slides , you get a great feel for the level of power plus the new user experience you can expect from these 2 devices .
You should really be excited after reading these .
First up is the slide at the top of the post and is the new commercial called “ Digits ” , made specifically for the Droid 2 ( or D2 ) .
The biggest details we get from this appear to be its newly found grasp of Email Exchange , the upgraded keyboard and a 1.0GHz processor .
Yep , the same 1.0GHz processor our initial source mentioned back in April .
Here is the voice over part of the script …
“ ‘ Does ’ used to do a lot .
Now it does even more .
Now it does Email Exchange , so you can be hooked up to everything thing you need to do .
Now it does 1.0GHz speed on a sleeker , more intuitive keyboard .
It does and does and does .
And the only thing it does n’t do is ask for time off . ”
Does 1.0GHz change your mind on the Droid 2 ?
It definitely helps ease mine .
Two more commercial slides for the Droid X after the jump !
The second and third commercials were made to promote the Droid X , its 4.3 ″ display and a new multimedia app which we can assume is a part of the new Moto / Shadow / Ninjablur that has been rumored to be included in all new Motorola Android devices …
First up is the “ Eagle Eye ( NFL App ) ” commercial which talks specifically about the device ’s 4.3 ″ screen and its ability to watch the NFL on the go in unbelievable quality .
And lastly , the “ Media Mogul ” commercial .
In this commercial , a new EyeCon app is highlighted and apparently will come standard with the Droid X and allow you to manage every multimedia device in your entire house .
A mobile media center as your smartphone ?
Sign me up .
Now obviously these could have been commercials that received the axe , but my gut is telling me that these have made the cut and will be hitting the airwaves in no time .
I love the “ Gattaca ” feel that they all seem to be focused on and the features mentioned should help sell a ton of both devices , especially with the “ Droid ” tag slapped on them .
Yay July release !
Can Verizon or Motorola announce these already ?
Like many , I was riveted by the situation in Egypt back in 2011 .
Watching the demonstration unfold in front of the Pyramids of Giza which my friends and I visited less than a year earlier sends chills down my spine .
While most flights to Cairo , Luxor and Alexandria have been cancelled , what do you do if you ’re there ?
Here are some tips if you find yourself as a traveler in Egypt , or any location where an uprising occurs .
One Middle East expert , Matthew Teller suggests large gatherings and demonstrations should be avoided at all cost , and the curfew strictly adhered to .
There is very little police protection so the best place to be is indoors .
Listen to international news organizations like CNN , BBC and Al Jezeera news network for the latest information and for announcements regarding changes to curfew .
Most often there will be no Internet access and mobile phone coverage is intermittent .
Get in touch with your embassy as they may provide announcements and travel information specific to their nationals .
For example , the US , European and Canadian Embassies may be able to provide its nationals evacuation assistance out of Egypt .
While crime rate is generally low in Egypt it is always wise to safeguard your passport , money and any valuables , especially given the situation on hand .
Have cash at the ready for “ tips ” .
While this might sound a little crass , it ’s realistic .
On my recent visit everyone from the guy at airport who screened our luggage to the bathroom attendant handing out toilet paper expected a tip .
Thus I imagine in this current situation even more people will expect tips from the tourists .
Stay calm so that you will be better able to use sound judgment and not make a bad situation worse for you or those who you are travelling with .

And there are those who wonder why the US has spent countless dollars and thousands of dead soldiers protecting a few desolate mountain passes in Afghanistan .
And no , it turns out it is not just the opium trade .
The NYT reports that " The United States has discovered nearly $ 1 trillion in untapped mineral deposits in Afghanistan , far beyond any previously known reserves and enough to fundamentally alter the Afghan economy and perhaps the Afghan war itself , according to senior American government officials . "
The article continues , " The previously unknown deposits — including huge veins of iron , copper , cobalt , gold and critical industrial metals like lithium — are so big and include so many minerals that are essential to modern industry that Afghanistan could eventually be transformed into one of the most important mining centers in the world , the United States officials believe . "
Ah yes - " previously unknown . "
Yet the punchline of the piece : " The vast scale of Afghanistan ’s mineral wealth was discovered by a small team of Pentagon officials and American geologists . "
Because $ 1 trillion worth of minerals just lie there waiting to be discovered almost 10 years after the initial incursion .
Next thing you know FCX already had an entire mining infrastructure in place just in case a contingency like this miraculously occurred .
In the meantime , look for gold prices to plunge as the newly uncovered gold deposits are rumored to be " large " enough to once again refill Fort Knox and to push the supply curve three miles to the right .
More on this truly " stunning " discovery :
The United States has discovered nearly $ 1 trillion in untapped mineral deposits in Afghanistan , far beyond any previously known reserves and enough to fundamentally alter the Afghan economy and perhaps the Afghan war itself , according to senior American government officials .
he previously unknown deposits — including huge veins of iron , copper , cobalt , gold and critical industrial metals like lithium — are so big and include so many minerals that are essential to modern industry that Afghanistan could eventually be transformed into one of the most important mining centers in the world , the United States officials believe .
An internal Pentagon memo , for example , states that Afghanistan could become the “ Saudi Arabia of lithium , ” a key raw material in the manufacture of batteries for laptops and Blackberries .
The vast scale of Afghanistan ’s mineral wealth was discovered by a small team of Pentagon officials and American geologists .
The Afghan government and President Hamid Karzai were recently briefed , American officials said .
While it could take many years to develop a mining industry , the potential is so great that officials and executives in the industry believe it could attract heavy investment even before mines are profitable , providing the possibility of jobs that could distract from generations of war .
The value of the newly discovered mineral deposits dwarfs the size of Afghanistan ’s existing war - bedraggled economy , which is based largely on opium production and narcotics trafficking as well as aid from the United States and other industrialized countries .
Afghanistan ’s gross domestic product is only about $ 12 billion .
“ This will become the backbone of the Afghan economy , ” said Jalil Jumriany , an adviser to the Afghan minister of mines .
Is it time for " Confessions of an Economic Hit Man : Part 2 , the 21st Century paradigm " ?
Yet presumably not all is as expected : " Yet the American officials also recognize that the mineral discoveries will almost certainly have a double - edged impact .
Instead of bringing peace , the newfound mineral wealth could lead the Taliban to battle even more fiercely to regain control of the country . "
Which is why it will be best to have the US military not only stay in Afghanistan indefinitely but to get a million man reinforcement surge .
After all now that it is finally becoming clear that the most recent US state is located somewhere in the middle of Asia , things are about to get a whole lot more interesting .
JOHANNESBURG — Members of the South Africa Vuvuzela Philharmonic Orchestra , widely considered to be among the best large - scale monotonic wind instrument ensembles in the world , told reporters Friday they were furious over the recent outbreaks of international soccer matches during their traditional outdoor concerts .

" I cannot imagine what is getting into these football teams that they would suddenly begin full - scale international competition just when we are beginning our 2010 concert series , " said Dr. Stefan Coetzee , the Philharmonic 's program and concert director .
" It is disrespectful to the performers , it is disrespectful to the music itself , and by extension , it is disrespectful to the great nation of South Africa . "
Spontaneous high - caliber soccer games have thus far plagued every orchestral vuvuzela performance of the season , which opened June 11 at Cape Town Stadium .
As musicians took their places in the stands and began warming up for the evening 's performance of lighter pieces by post - minimalist composers , they noticed the audience was not sitting in its traditional place in the stadium 's central area .

As the Philharmonic learned later , its only spectators were the national football sides of France and Uruguay , who played to a 0 - 0 tie as the frustrated vuvuzela virtuosi played a full program of concerti written for the distinctive straight plastic horn .
" A virtually empty house is highly unusual in a vuvuzela - mad nation such as South Africa , " said first - chair vuvuzela player Moses Mtegume , who is known as the " Father of the Vuvuzela " and considered a national treasure .
" And because concerts are held in the round — the better to appreciate the sonorous tonality of the massed instruments — a performer gets a sense of the crowd early . "

" It does n't even seem like these football players are paying attention to us , " Mtegume added .
" In fact , I would go so far as to say they are trying to ignore us . "
The following days , during which a string of large - scale vuvuzela performances were held , saw the unusual events repeat in Johnnesburg , Durban , Pretoria , and Port Elizabeth as audience after audience was driven away by FIFA national football teams .
As a result , the South Africa Vuvzela Philharmonic , which is supported solely by money from ticket sales , has suffered staggering losses financially .
And the musicians , many of whom trained for years and underwent a harrowing audition process to earn one of the orchestra's 50,000 seats , said the biggest blow was to their professional pride .

" Do you know how difficult it is to get everyone situated , tuned , and focused for a vuvuzela concert ? " said Juilliard - trained vuvuzelist Donald Frederick Gordon , a noted soloist and renowned performer whose boyhood dream of playing vuvuzela in every stadium in South Africa is now at risk .
" These brash , inconsiderate outbursts of impromptu athletics have made us a laughingstock of the international music community .
We have already had cancellations from the Vienna Boy 's Choir and guest director Seiji Ozawa , who no doubt fear for their reputation should the Philharmonic continue to be mocked by these incongruous sportsmen . "
In order to save its concert season , the orchestra has scheduled a special benefit concert for July 11 at Johannesburg 's Soccer City Stadium .
The orchestra will be accompanied by 8,000 special guest vuvuzela players from Ghana and the Ivory Coast , and the concert program will include the debut of new single - tone compositions by Philip Glass , Arvo Pärt , and vuvuzela fan Mark Mothersbaugh .

The musicians said they are thrilled to be performing in the nation 's most prominent stadium , which is capable of holding up to 12,500 standing concertgoers in its grassy central section .
" This will be a vuvuzela tour de force the likes of which the world has never seen , " Dr. Coetzee said .
" We are very close to an agreement with Placido Domingo , who we 're confident will show us how the greatest living tenor sings the B - flat - below - middle - C that makes the vuvuzela so magical .
It will truly be a night for the ages , with , we hope , no sign of football rivals battling it out for global supremacy where the audience should be . "

" We 've already sold a couple dozen tickets to people in Brazil and Argentina , " Dr. Coetzee added .
" Mark my words , on July 11 , the eyes and ears of the world will be on South Africa . "
Step 1 . Give yourself permission .
If you 've been perfecting your napping form for years , you can skip this step .
But if you have n’t napped on a regular basis since preschool , you might have some lingering doubts about whether napping is really a productive use of your grown - up time .
Rest assured :
It is .
In healthy , non-elderly adults , research has shown that naps can :
Reduce drowsiness and fatigue
Restore alertness
Improve cognitive performance
Sharpen motor skills
Decrease errors and accidents
Enhance mood
Ease premenstrual symptoms
Step 3 . Pick your place .
If you can nap down on a couch or bed , that ’s ideal .
Not surprisingly , in a recent study from China , napping in bed was more refreshing than napping in a seat .
But if you ’re stuck at your desk or on a bus , it ’s not a total loss .
Both groups of nappers in the study experienced less sleepiness , decreased fatigue and an improved mood , compared to those who did n’t nap at all .
Step 4 .
Make yourself comfy .
Say sí to siesta with a restful environment .
Make it as quiet and dark as possible by shutting the door , turning off the phone , switching off the lights and closing the blinds .
The room temperature should be comfortable but not too toasty , which might make you oversleep .
Step 5 . Gather your gear .
When napping away from home , a small pillow and light blanket may help you get cozy .
If you ca n’t make the room dark and quiet , use a sleep mask and earplugs instead .
Or put on earphones and tune into relaxing sounds , such as the Pzizz soundtrack for napping , which improved people ’s sense of post - nap well - being in a study from New Zealand .
If you need to be wide awake immediately after napping , drink a cup of coffee or can of caffeinated soda right before dozing off .
The will kick in 20 to 30 minutes later — just in time to wake up .
Step 6 . Grab 20 winks ( not 40 ) .
Think short .
For healthy , young adults , research indicates that the ideal nap length is only 10 to 20 minutes .
Such short naps boost alertness and performance without leaving you groggy afterward or interfering with your sleep that night .
In contrast , naps lasting longer than a half - hour can cause sleep inertia — a sense of grogginess and disorientation that may linger for several minutes after awakening from a deep sleep .
To ensure that you do n’t snooze too long , set an alarm .
P.S. The Zzz-less Nap
Do n’t worry if you ca n’t always fall asleep at naptime .
As long as you do n’t out over it , the rest and relaxation will still do you good .
In fact , a study by British researchers found that just lying down with the intention of napping was enough to cause a drop in blood pressure .

The ultrasound waves stop sperm production in the testes
Scientists are beginning tests to see if ultrasound can be used as a reversible contraceptive for men .
Based on early work , University of North Carolina experts believe a blast of ultrasound to the testes can safely stop sperm production for six months .
With a grant of $ 100,000 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation they will push ahead with more clinical trials .
The researchers ultimately hope it could offer a new birth control option to couples throughout the world .
Lead researcher Dr James Tsuruta said : " We think this could provide men with up to six months of reliable , low - cost , non-hormonal contraception from a single round of treatment .
" Our long - term goal is to use ultrasound from therapeutic instruments that are commonly found in sports medicine or physical therapy clinics as an inexpensive , long - term , reversible male contraceptive suitable for use in developing to first world countries . "
Once the testis has stopped producing sperm and all " sperm reserves " have been depleted , explain the researchers , the man will be temporarily infertile .
Their Grand Challenges Exploration Grant project aims at fine - tuning this technique for maximum effect and safety .
BETWEEN 2000 and 2008 health spending per person increased by 4.2 % a year on average , according to the latest data from the OECD , a rich countries ' club .
Average spending over the same period was 8.4 % of GDP ; last decade the average was 7.3 % .
Technological change , population expectations and ageing populations , say the OECD , will continue to drive costs and spending even higher .
In almost all countries , public expenditure accounts for the majority of health - care spending .
It has increased from an average of 12 % of total government spending in 1990 to a record 16 % in 2008 .
Given the need to reduce budget deficits , governments will be looking to reduce health - care expenditure or increases taxes .

Eias « Hjernevask » frikjent i PFU
( VG Nett ) Harald Eias omstridte program « Hjernevask » ble i dag frikjent i PFU .

Artikkelen er over ti år gammel
Det melder fagbladet Journalisten .
Pressens Faglige Utvalg ( PFU ) behandlet i dag klagen mot det omstridte NRK - programmet etter klage fra kjønnsforsker Jørgen Lorentzen .
Harald Eia sier til VG
Nett at han er lettet over utfallet .
- På den ene siden følte jeg meg trygg på at vi hadde fulgt spillereglene , men man blir jo litt usikker i en sånn situasjon .
Man vet aldri hvordan saken vipper i uformelle fora .
Dette er jo ikke mitt felt .
Heldigvis kom PFU til samme konklusjon som oss som har laget programmet , så jeg innrømmer at jeg føler en viss lettelse , sier Eia .
- Kryssklipping
Lorentzen mente at Eia brøt garantier han ba om å få før programmet ble sendt , og at han var blitt utsatt for kryssklipping slik at meningsinnholdet ble forvrengt .
Garantiene gikk ut på at han skulle bli rettferdig behandlet og ikke dummes ut på luften .
Forskeren begrunnet også sin klage med at TV - programmet må ha hatt en skjult agenda .
NRK svarte med å legge ut intervjuet med Lorentzen i sin helhet .
EIA FØR PFU - BEHANDLINGEN :-
Har ikke gjort noe galt
Utvalget mener på sin side at Eia og NRK ikke har brutt god presseskikk .
Lorentzen har fått rikelig med muligheter til å komme til motmæle , og klippingen kan på ingen måte karakteriseres som kryssklipping , konkluderte utvalget med under sin TV - sendte diskusjon i formiddag .
Leder for utvalget , TV 2 - reporter Odd Isungset , var i sitt innlegg krystallklar på at « Hjernevask » representerer noe nytt og kjærkomment i det norske medielandskapet .
I etterkant av programmet ble temaet programmet tar opp , krysningene mellom arv og miljø , gjenstand for massiv offentlig debatt .
« Hjernevask » har hittil i år blitt omtalt over tusen ganger i norske medier .
- Mye av det vi leser og ser til vanlig i norske medier , er fort glemt .
Hvor mange ganger har noen satt dagsorden i seks måneder ?
Diskusjonen rundt arv og miljø går helt inn i kjernen av det journalistiske samfunnsoppdraget .
Dette er et område som har vært beskyttet mot kritiske spørsmål , men som diskuteres i alle samfunnslag .
Rederligheten i prosessen rundt dette forsterker dette inntrykket , sa Isungset .
LES OGSÅ : Fikk jobb etter « Hjernevask » - deltakelse
- Et godt stykke arbeid
- Dette er et stort prosjekt som har gått til verks mot sentrale premissleverandører for debatten i Norge .
Mitt inntrykk er at dette er et godt stykke arbeid , sa han videre .
Diskusjonen i forkant av konklusjonen gikk i hovedtrekk ut på hvorvidt Eia &
Co hadde klargjort premissene for intervjuet med Lorentzen tydelig nok i forkant .
Dette er et viktig punkt i Vær Varsom - plakaten , journalistenes etiske veileder .
Spørsmålet om målet is åfall helliger middelet var også oppe .
Medlemmene var klar på at man kunne se enkelte svakheter ved programmet , men at de kommer totalt i skyggen av styrken .
- De små svakhetene er ikke tilstrekkelig sett opp i mot programmets styrke , sa Aftenpostens sjefsredaktør Hilde Haugsgjerd .
Generalsekretær i Norsk Presseforund , Per Edgar Kokkvold , tror Lorentzen ville stilt større krav til presentasjonen dersom han hadde visst at intervjuene han ga i forbindelse med « Hjernevask » skulle presenteres for internasjonale forskere .
- Hadde vært kjipt å bli felt
- Men jeg synes heller ikke det er i strid med god presseskikk , sa Kokkvold .
LES OGSÅ :- Nesten som hos rektor
Eia presiserer at klagen gikk på metoden , ikke på resultatet av programserien .
- Selv om vi hadde blitt dømt , så ville jeg følt at det vi har presentert , ville blitt stående .
Det er ikke noe vi har konstruert eller funnet opp .
Men selvsagt hadde det vært kjipt å bli felt , legger programlederen til .
På spørsmål om hva han tenker om at Jørgen Lorentzen før dagens PFU - behandling opplyste til VG papir at han vurderer rettslige skritt , svarer Eia :
- Det kjenner jeg ikke til .
Jeg er ingen jussekspert , men jeg har ikke tro på at vi har brutt norsk lov , sier 44 - åringen .
VG Nett har ikke lykkes i å komme i kontakt med Lorentzen etter PFU - møtet .
Han varslet i dagens VG at han var klar for å gå rettens vei for å vinne frem , men det er uklart hvordan dette stiller seg etter at han tapte saken .
- Jeg har vurdert rettslige skritt i denne saken .
Nå er det PFU i første omgang , så får vi se .
Vi kommer til å lese dokumentene nøye først , sa han .

China ’s Cheonan Dilemma
The biggest loser from the ongoing tensions surrounding the sinking of a South Korean vessel may not be Seoul , or Pyongyang , but Beijing .
By refusing to condemn North Korea for its deliberate attack and sinking of a South Korean Navy corvette in March , China has lost hard - won credibility and reminded countries throughout Asia of the importance of the United States and its dominant presence in the Western Pacific .
The recovery of the vessel , the Cheonan , and dredging the seabed revealed a smoking gun — the remains of a North Korean torpedo .
A South Korean report drawing upon the participation of experts from Australia , Britain , Sweden , and the United States and released in late May laid the blame squarely at the feet of North Korea , thus prompting the real aftershocks of the incident .
In response to the report , Beijing chose not to take a clear stand and simply acknowledged the report , as well as North Korea ’s shrieks of denial .
Rather than condemn North Korea ’s violent act , Beijing ignored the findings of the international investigators after reportedly having been invited to join the team but declining .
In early May , before the report ’s release , both South Korean President Lee Myung - bak and North Korean leader Kim Jong
Il had summits in China with President Hu Jintao to plead their respective cases , but neither came away satisfied .
China ’s decision to protect North Korea reflects not only a careful policy calculation based on parochial self - interest , but also Beijing ’s desire to maintain the regional security balance that , as the country ’s leaders see it , is dependent on a strong China - North Korea relationship .
Failure to support North Korea could lead to its collapse — which could bring far worse consequences for China than most outside observers realize .
China fears the potential for chaos in North Korea for a number of reasons .
For starters , the prospect of starving refugees and the remnants of the Korean People ’s Army so close to its own border is an obvious concern .
The 1,400 kilometers of river that separate the two countries is narrow and shallow in many places , presenting an insignificant barrier to refugees and bandits seeking to cross .
It is no coincidence that of all China ’s 14 borders with neighboring states , the country ’s People ’s Liberation Army is the lead authority only for those frontiers that border North Korea and Myanmar .
Meanwhile , integration of North Korea ’s economy and China ’s northeastern provinces , particularly the provinces of Liaoning and Jilin , ensure that northeast China will pay a significant price should North Korea implode .
Economic stability in these " rust belt " provinces , part of the struggling industrial region known informally in the West as Manchuria , is a key concern for Beijing .
Having banked on trade with North Korea as a central part of their development plan ( about half of the Chinese investors in North Korean joint ventures come from just these two provinces ) , these northern provinces might suffer significant economic impacts from further instability in North Korea .
Not only is all politics local , but sometimes foreign policy is local too .
We take it for granted that North Korea is dependent on China , but key parts of China depend on North Korea as well .
Regional authorities in Jilin have invested billions in infrastructure to create an economic corridor from the Chinese city of Changchun , running across the border , and ultimately linking to China ’s lease on a pier at North Korea ’s port of Rajin .
Jilin ’s plans have been blessed at the highest levels in Beijing .
Should North Korea fail , the catastrophe would hit Beijing in the heart — and the northeast in the wallet .
Another motivating factor for Beijing is the notion held by many Chinese leaders that their relationship with North Korea maintains a fragile balance in Asia , pitting two erstwhile communist countries against the United States and its allies .
Failing to support North Korea , in the minds of some Chinese strategists , even after such an egregious provocation as the Cheonan attack , might ultimately lead to the demise of the People ’s Republic of China .
China ’s unwillingness to allow North Korea to collapse under the weight of its own political and economic mismanagement reflects all these concerns .
While China appears willing to pay the cost of at least maintaining the regime , neither China nor South Korea is willing to pay the price of rebuilding a failed state , resulting in an uneasy status quo .
Not surprisingly , China ’s unwillingness to punish North Korea for its action or deter the regime from taking aggressive action in the first place has laid bare the limits of Chinese influence in the region and has been met with frustration in many parts of Asia .
China ’s handling of the incident has already caused political shock waves in Japan .
Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama ’s resignation and the sudden resolution of the status of the Futenma Air Station on Okinawa have injected tremendous uncertainty in Japanese politics that will undoubtedly affect the Diet ’s upper - house elections in July .
China ’s response has only guaranteed a large U.S. military presence in Japan for the foreseeable future .
Although the Cheonan incident was traumatic for the South Korean people , President Lee has handled it deftly with a cautious , transparent , and measured response that appears to have prevented an escalation of tensions .
However , the Cheonan tragedy will undoubtedly shape South Korean politics and unification policy .
The North Korean torpedo is an exclamation point on the demise of the " Sunshine Policy " — South Korea ’s much - criticized approach to economic engagement with the North .
Any potential that China might have held in South Korean eyes to act as an intermediary or honest broker between North and South has likely evaporated as well .
China ’s strategy to woo neighbors throughout Asia with promises of economic integration and repeately asserting its peaceful intentions has suffered a significant setback , even as China ’s decision to " postpone " U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates ’s visit to Beijing reflects China ’s unease with the current regional security situation .
In the coming weeks and months , it will only become more unmistakable how the sinking of the Cheonan has roiled the region .
Moderate Christians love to talk about how Jesus fixed the Old Testament , or , in other words , obsoleted the horribly offensive parts about slavery , keeping women in their place , killing gays , etc .
In fact , he did no such thing .
I ’ll be doing two things here :
Show you that Jesus fully supported everything in the Old Testament Show you exactly how horrible that is .
So first , here is Jesus speaking specifically on the topic of Old Testament teachings :
The Law Stands
“ For truly , I say to you , till heaven and earth pass away , not an iota , not a dot , will pass the law until all is accomplished .
Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so , shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven ; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven . ” — Matthew 5:18 - 19
“ It is easier for Heaven and Earth to pass away than for the smallest part of the letter of the law to become invalid . ” ( Luke 16:17 )
“ Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets .
I have come not to abolish but to fulfill .
Amen , I say to you , until heaven and earth pass away , not the smallest part or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law , until all things have taken place . ” ( Matthew 5:17 )
“ Did not Moses give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law ” ( John7:19 )
Keep in mind , this is Jesus Christ saying this –in the Bible that all Christians own and cherish .
Do n’t take my word for it ; look it up –it ’s all there .
So now that we understand that he fully supported what ’s in the Old Testament , let ’s take a look at what he actually just commanded us to uphold .
The Law That Stands
Blasphemy is Punishable by Death
One who blasphemes the name of the LORD shall be put to death ; the whole congregation shall stone the blasphemer .
Aliens as well as citizens , when they blaspheme the Name , shall be put to death .
( NRSV ) — Leviticus 24:16
Cheaters Must Die
If a man commits adultery with another man ’s wife — with the wife of his neighbor — both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death .
( NIV ) — Leviticus 20:10
Dishonoring Your Mother or Father is Punishable by Death
Anyone who dishonors father or mother must be put to death .
Such a person is guilty of a capital offense .
( NLT ) — Leviticus 20:9
People Who Work on Sunday Should be Killed
You have six days each week for your ordinary work , but the seventh day must be a Sabbath day of complete rest , a holy day dedicated to the LORD .
Anyone who works on that day must be put to death .
( NLT ) — Exodus 35:2
If a Woman is Not a Virgin When She Gets Married , She Has to Die
“ If any man takes a wife , and goes in to her , and detests her , and charges her with shameful conduct , and brings a bad name on her , and says , ‘ I took this woman , and when I came to her I found she was not a virgin , ’ … and evidences of virginity are not found for the young woman , then they shall bring out the young woman to the door of her father ’s house , and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones … ( NKJV ) — Deuteronomy 22:13-14,20-21
There ’s Nothing Wrong With Slavery
Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you ; from them you may buy slaves .
( NIV ) — Leviticus 25:44
Gays Should be Put to Death
If a man lies with a male as with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination ; they shall be put to death ; their blood is upon them .
( NRSV ) — Leviticus 20:13
Women Should Shut the Hell Up and Do as They ’re Told
A woman should learn in quietness and full submission .
I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man ; she must be silent .
( NIV ) — Timothy 2:11 - 12
Keep in mind , these are n’t suggestions .
They ’re not optional .
Remember what Jesus said , “ Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so , shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven … ”
He also said they ’re not open to any personal interpretation .
It ’s all very clear to anyone willing to actually read their Bible .
But do n’t listen to an atheist , we ’re the last people you should trust .
Read your own Bible .
All the references are there for you .
It is you who must reconcile this evil .
But luckily there ’s an easy solution :
Ask yourself which is more likely :
God and Jesus really are evil ( which the Bible ’s own text proves , if you open yours and look )
or …
It ’s actually all made up , so there ’s nothing to worry about .
The answer is # 2 .
God is not evil , and neither is Jesus .
Man made them up in order to control other men .
Few things offer better proof of this than the actual teachings in the Bible .
You , my kind and thoughtful Christian friends , do not need this .
You are above it .
Notes
Does YOUR Spouse Hate How Solar Looks ?
June 29th , 2010 by Susan Kraemer
If you are a Californian who ’s been wanting to put on solar , but your spouse has objections on aesthetic grounds , you now have an alternative .
There are now more CSI - approved choices for building - integrated solar ( BIPV ) modules in the updated list this month at GosolarCalifornia .
Expected performance of all the new BIPV is listed at the CSI - EPBB site .
[ social_buttons ]
California has just approved the SRS - Energy curved thinfilm tile .
These can be added to your terracotta - colored clay tile roof like this …
… or you could go whole - hog blue , and re-roof entirely in the matching blue ceramic tile made by USTile , for those parts of the roof , like the North gables , that wo n’t be used to make power .
In California , rebate - eligible solar BIPV includes Xunlight ‘s thinfilm flat modules .
I do n’t see an image of their actual BIPV that CSI approves , but if they can make this brown - colored thinfilm then they could make a BIPV that would blend with even the most banal of your neighbors ’ powerless roofs .
The Jimmy Carter - generated ( most ancient , oldie but goodie ) solar company Sharp makes these little regular silicon PV modules that look at least as good as the dumb part of your roof , that only keeps out the rain .
Atlantis Energy ’s Sunslates lovely flat slate PV tiles – they are bonded to standard fiber - cement roofing tiles – can be installed in a charming zigzag pattern , as here , making for a solar installation which almost looks as if it was set in the days of a Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale .
Suntech is also listed for its BIPV module .
In an install I ’ve seen these practically disappear while imparting a subtle classy gleam to a gray slate roof .
Sunpower ’s CSI approved BIPV panels can be set below the roof tile like this for an interesting look or ,
as here in a beautiful design installed by CobaltPower , sit on top .
These are not building integrated in the strict sense of the words , yet look as comfortable and integrate as well , they might as well be .
Sunpower panels always look gorgeous either way .
There ’s no excuses now !

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Welcome to Roger Bleile 's International , Illustrated Glossary of Hand - Engraving Terminology .
In 1980 when I wrote AMERICAN ENGRAVERS for the gun collecting community , I decided to include a glossary of gun engraving terminology .
I thought this would be useful for engravers and their clients alike to improve the way we communicate .
That glossary helped to standardize the vocabulary used by hand engravers but with only a few thousand books in print it was far from universal .
In discussing this with Steve Lindsay we decided to create a glossary web page , which has the potential to reach vast numbers of those , interested in engraving of all types and to further standardize the vocabulary we use .
Since engraving is practiced around the world and an international audience uses the World Wide Web , I have included many non-English terms for decorative styles and tools .
These are words that I have cross - referenced from my extensive library of books related to hand engraving .
The non-English terms that I have included are in French , German , and Italian as those are the languages of some of my books and the languages I am most familiar with .
While this is a reference for hand engraving , I have included some terminology relative to various engraving machines and machine engraving to help define the difference between hand and machine engraving .
There are also trades like die making and jewelry that use both machine and hand work on the same subject .
A significant percentage of occupational hand engravers , who earn their entire living from engraving , in Europe , North America , and the UK work for the sporting gun trade and gun collectors .
As such , many of those interested in hand engraving but unfamiliar with guns may find gun-engraving jargon hard to understand .
For that reason , I have included the definitions of numerous words relative to the parts of guns that get engraved and to the styles of ornamentation traditionally found engraved into guns .
This is not , however a glossary of gun terminology as that is beyond the scope of this writing .
I would also like to add that some engravers might be familiar with terms not included here .
Even though I have included well over 300 definitions and over 300 illustrations , some in the trade may use terms that are unique to a particular employer or master who taught them , or to a to a specific gun maker , die shop , or jewelry manufacturer .
If you know of a word or term related specifically to hand engraving that is in widespread use that is not included here , click on the feedback line at the top of this page to provide your suggestion .
I would like to thank Steve Lindsay of Steve Lindsay Engraving and Tools for providing this web page and for his collaboration in its content .
Though Lindsay tools are an important aspect of today ’s hand engraving field , you will find that a wide variety of tools by other manufacturers are included here as no comprehensive glossary would be complete without them .
I have been a student and practitioner of the hand engraver ’s art and craft for over thirty years and have found it to be a fascinating and historic subject with far greater depth than is readily apparent to most people .
I think if you go through this resource as a learning tool you may be surprised at what you will uncover .
Enjoy your visit here .
Anyone wishing to add to this glossary can contact me by e-mail or send a
PM on www.EngravingForum.com
C. Roger Bleile Select a letter from the menu to go to engraving terms that start with that letter .
A local politician in Prescott , Ariz. , who recently mocked an elementary mural featuring minority students was fired from his radio talk show and now faces a mounting recall campaign due to his remarks that critics say were racist .
A town of 43,000 , Prescott is located two hours north of Phoenix .
The charges of racism come weeks after controversy and anger continues to swell over Arizona ’s recent harsh laws targeting immigrants and Latinos .
The mural was funded by a $ 5,000 state grant through the Prescott Alternative Transportation Center and was selected by students and faculty to reflect the theme “ Go Green . ”
It ’s on two walls outside the Miller Valley Elementary School and depicts four students promoting environmentally friendly transportation .
A Latino student is the mural ’s largest image .
It shows young people with happy faces riding bikes and using other “ green ” sources of transportation .
R.E. Wall , director of Prescott ’s Downtown Mural project told ParentDish , an online news site , that he intended the mural to depict a Mexican American child to best describe the demographics of the school .
Students at Miller Valley are almost 48 percent Latino .
It ’s not right that most images around town are of “ just cowboys , ” said Wall .
Wall has lived in Prescott for years where he is famous for his murals .
He said he and other artists heard a constant barrage of racist remarks against African Americans and Latinos from motorists while working on the project .
To make matters worse Councilman Steve Blair on his radio show ridiculed the mural and spearheaded a public campaign to have it removed .
Blair made the following comments responding to a caller on his show last month :
“ I am not a racist individual , but I will tell you depicting a Black guy in the middle of that mural , based upon who ’s president of the United States today and based upon the history of this community , when I grew up we had four Black families – who I have been very good friends with for years – to depict the biggest picture on that building as a Black person , I would have to ask the question , ‘ Why ? ' ”
Blair added that diversity is a word “ I ca n’t stand . ”
Soon after Blair ’s comments , Miller Valley Principal Jeff Lane and Kevin Kapp , superintendent of the school district , ordered Wall to “ lighten ” the skin color of the students .
They said they wanted “ brighter shades ” on the children ’s faces and were requesting the changes from an artistic point of view , having nothing to do with race .
Yet hundreds of Prescott residents responded and held a rally in support of the original mural as well as to protest against Blair ’s offensive comments .
The pressure from the community forced Lane and Kapp to address the protestors where they both reversed their decision to change the mural .
“ We asked them to lighten the mural .
We made a mistake , ” said Lane to the crowd .
“ The school district made a mistake and shame on us if we ca n’t say shame on us and we ’re sorry , ” said Kapp .
Lou Silverman , owner of KYCA radio , confirmed this week that Blair was fired from his six - year afternoon show because his comments “ could be interpreted as racist . ”
The station is known for airing conservative talk shows hosted by Rush Limbaugh , Laura Ingraham and Michael Savage .
Meanwhile a campaign is being organized to put a recall on the ballot against Blair .
Organizers say they need to collect 2,822 signatures to put it on the ballot and hope that an election can be held in November .
However Blair denies being a racist and has no intention of stepping down .
He says the artists and school officials should have “ educated ” him on the meaning of the “ Go Green ” mural .
But critics say Blair has embarrassed himself and the town .
He needs to go , they charge .
Former Mayor Jack Wilson created a Facebook page calling for Blair ’s resignation .
“ You can call it racial insensitivity or bigotry .
I just call it racism , ” said Wilson to the Arizona Republic .
“ Our reputation was sullied in the entire world … .
There are 43,000 people in Prescott , and most of us do n’t believe what Steve Blair does . ”

A 24 - year - old man died at home and 18 others were transported to emergency rooms after taking Ecstasy at an all - night New Year 's Eve rave held at the Los Angeles Sports Arena , according to a report released Thursday .
The report , by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , comes in the same week that officials in the San Francisco area said a second man had died after taking Ecstasy at a Cow Palace rave held over Memorial Day weekend .
At the Cow Palace rave -- which , like the New Year 's Eve rave in L.A. , was held at a publicly owned venue -- authorities arrested more than 70 people and seized over 800 Ecstasy tablets .
At least nine other partygoers went to hospitals with Ecstasy overdoses .
A 23 - year - old man died the day after the rave , and a second man , 25 , died on Sunday .
The report of the New Year 's Eve overdoses , published Thursday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , detailed a massive party where authorities appeared to anticipate drug use .
The rave attracted 45,000 attendees , according to the CDC .
Los Angeles police were on site with undercover narcotics officers , and 14 ambulances were stationed at the facility .
Emergency rooms were alerted to expect patients from the rave .
The 18 people who were sent to the hospital were between the ages of 16 and 34 .
In addition to using Ecstasy , 10 had drunk alcohol , and five had also used other drugs .
The 24 - year - old man died at home of multiple drug intoxication , the CDC said .
The man had no chronic illnesses .
The man ’s friends informed authorities that he had “ used Ecstasy and cocaine at the rave and injected heroin at home afterward . ”
One emergency - room patient suffered organ failure , requiring a stay in the intensive - care unit after suffering a seizure and liver and kidney failure .
He needed dialysis to detoxify his blood , according to the report , and remained hospitalized for 28 days .
The report said that , after his discharge , the man continued to need dialysis .
Vancouver - and Barcelona - based filmmaker Claudia Medina recently screened the short documentary " Life After Growth " which she co-directed with Leah Temper , at the De- Growth Conference in Vancouver .
Medina spoke to Am Johal over the phone from her hometown of Powell River , B.C .
Am Johal : I was at a conference a while back where a few economists were speaking about the economic collapse .
After they spoke , I could n't believe the anger generated toward them .
A lot of people just said , ‘ why should we listen to you people anymore ? '
There also seems to be a rising chorus of people looking at GDP as an outdated economic indicator in the context of climate change .
What 's your take on that ?
Claudia Medina :
The current economic situation does show the absurdity of it -- the system is being questioned by more and more people .
I would say there is an increasing awareness of it .
The Genuine Progress Indicator is one newer model -- and there are many ecological economists who have been working to understand the field of economics in a more holistic way .
Economics needs to take nature into account , as well as our impact on nature .
Ecological economics does this , whereas classical economics sees pollution as an " externality : Ecological economics goes beyond the definition of environmental economics .
It opens up the door from a social sciences perspective -- about important questions like ‘ quality of life , ' how we deal with problems .
The idea of being in a community , participating in public life , exchanges between people that do n't involve monetary exchange .
And , of course , the fact that we depend on nature for our survival and well being , and this does not always translate to a monetary value .
Feminist economists look at women 's roles that were n't given an economic value for so many decades and centuries , but were vital to a functioning economy .
It 's important that we have a branch of economics that are looking at these things .
The GDP is an extremely inadequate way of evaluating life -- but there are models that look at the social , spiritual value , the time you spend with your family , being in community , systems of trade and survival .
All of those things are being looked at as viable aspects that make up an economy and are redefining ideas about progress .
It 's important to ask questions about who is benefiting , who is being impacted , what gets sacrificed for something else ?
You start to form a very different picture of what economics could be and should be .
It is a much more holistic way of looking at the discipline .
It 's important to ask these questions .
What is the economy for , who is it for , what we value and why ?
For a long time , we actually believed that there is only one system and we do n't need to ask those questions .
All of those illusions are being ripped to shreds right now .
If the old system was working so well , why then do things seem to be getting worse ?
AJ : Here in Vancouver , Vancity has been interested in the Bologna program of social reciprocity , social economy ; there 's even times in the 70's economists from a much wider view of economics than the neo-liberal vision of the past 25 years in Canada .
Free trade agreements , perhaps authoritarian regimes are more efficient than some western models which have resulted in loss of the manufacturing sector , a lot of these things were being talked about in the 60s and 70s .
There 's been no debate on the issue of climate change since the 70s yet it took 30 years to hit a cultural tipping point .
How do we , as activists and cultural workers , have wholesale policy and cultural change ?
CM : You touched on , for me , a real motivator to gather this information and put it out there .
There is a questioning going on above and beyond the regular circles out there .
It has been going on a long time .
The Limits to Growth / Club of Rome analysis was happening in the 70s .
I do think it 's been going beyond those academic circles slowly and steadily seeping out in to the broader context .
One of reasons might be the intensity of the changes in people 's lives .
I have the example of Powell River , this town that I grew up in .
It was a typical resource - extraction economy for many , many years -- then the pulp and paper industry started to severely downsize .
It was the only viable economic reality of this place for a few generations of people .
It was kind of the economic father - figure of this place .
It created this reality of people having life - long employment and prosperity .
For a certain period of time it certainly did that , but at the expense of displacing First Nations communities and having major environmental impacts .
It was the undisputed source of good under the prevailing conditions of the time .
When I was a teenager , to mention conservation , was considered heretical by some and actually felt like a dangerous notion to bring up at times .
Jump forward 20 years .
The effects of global economics , neo-liberal economics , international trade deals , depletion of resources -- put these things together and this monolith is no longer .
Extreme extraction has major problems .
I come back after 20 years , I see all of these grassroots initiatives happening -- these are things that would never been taken seriously 20 years ago .
This is now officially a ‘ transition town ' looking move out of the carbon - based economy .
On the surface , that might not be hugely radical but in this context it is .
It 's become a food sovereignty hub .
These things would not have seemed possible two decades ago -- this is quite amazing .
Other initiatives , small , but involving a cross-section of people who traditionally had opposing viewpoints , who did n't see eye to eye on anything , doing work with each other and are talking to each other .
There is more awareness and interest .
The value now is in the place -- what 's left of the environment .
That 's something really interesting .
I see Powell River as a model or a microcosm of what 's happening in other places around the world that have depended on a way of life , relied on a certain industry , a way of thinking and a worldview -- and are coming to new places of understanding .
It means that people are working together , coming up with survival and thriving options for the future .
It 's often a result of the concern for what 's happening on a big level , these large crises we are facing .
There are important questions -- what does it mean to re-localize ?
I do n't think it 's a passing fad .
It might be opening up the doors .
At the community level , there 's more opportunities to be involved in things and more and more people are getting involved .
And having fun doing it !
It 's always struck me , people are all diverse in their thinking .
I 'm trying not to over idealize it but I think there 's an opening there that could potentially offer an acceleration of examples that work .
When we show a film about solutions it can spark these connections between what is happening .
It reinforces and encourages those who are coming up with new approaches and catalyzes ideas and action .
As culture workers , media makers , you can gather these examples , to show we 're not alone , we 're not the only crazy people out there .
It comes down to a very basic level -- this is where the tide shifts .
What I think is key and fundamental , is to try to maintain and intensify what 's happening at the local level and be aware of what is happening and do whatever possible to impact the global level as well .
To make the connections .
When it comes to voting on all levels , or participation in local community , it 's important that the connection between these things are understood .
AJ : Economists would say we have demographic issues around the economy as well .
Increasingly retiring people , population growth , deficits and debt in the long term .
European economies like Greece , Spain , Portugal , Britain are facing worrying debt levels .
The US , on its current course , is about 10 years from a major financial collapse .
In the 90s we saw in Canada massive cuts that re-organized the social safety net , increased tuition fees , and further neo-liberalized the economy .
How do de - growth supporters plan to maintain support for social programs ?
CM : I would answer it in this way -- have n't we been following the growth mantra all these years ?
Could it that be a great part of the reason why we are where we are ?
Do we take more of the same medicine to solve the problems we keep having ?
The media always makes much of when the GDP is going up .
If it 's ‘ good for the economy , ' we need to be asking , is it good for me ?
I 'm still in debt and I 'm still worried about the future .
If we keep pushing the numbers up on the GDP , will the important things be restored ?
Will we be happier ?
The important things in life have been withering away despite GDP growth over the past few decades .
There 's no easy answer .
De - growth is not a solution -- it's an opportunity to talk about alternative economic models .
The alternatives have to be looked at in the appropriate context .
If you do n't take in to account the realities of the place , then you 're just imposing these ideas .
There is not one model , but many that are playing out .
AJ : Anything else ?
CM : Right now , there is still oil gushing out in the Gulf of Mexico .
You hear these bills that are passing .
Bill C - 9 -- Economic Growth and Employment Act -- the gist of it is supposed to effectively eliminate the environmental assessment process for infrastructure projects like dams and pipelines .
The government is arguing that it 's taking up too much time and money and we should just streamline it because we need to grow the economy faster .
The more people become aware and understand what this actually means , the more there will be growing opposition .
Like the Site C Dam in B.C. to the reclassification of freshwater lakes into tailings ponds for mining projects , these massive industrial projects to grow the economy are undermining quality of life for humans and all species in a big way .
The things that people are fighting for , they are linked no matter where they are .
They are not separate issues .
There are assumptions built in .
They are very much about what this old economic model prioritizes .
You 'll have jobs for 10 years and the lake is gone forever .
The things that people are doing to fight these intrusions , as more people make these connections between the growth mantra and what does n't get counted in the GDP , will be harder to stop .
Also , at the same time , to be able to offer other possibilities of economic independence helps in a lot of ways .
If ‘ this ' wo n't work , then ‘ what ' will ?
I always look at what the financial analysts are thinking -- in the papers a few weeks ago investors were in a panic about the " de- globalizers " or relocalization movements .
There was a kind of panicked tone to the realization that people were n't buying into the neo-liberal growth mantra so easily anymore and looking for alternatives .
It made me laugh , if these people are starting to freak out and retaliate , there is a real of concern going on .
I think in Cambridge recently , George Soros had sponsored a conference , to question the neo-classical economic paradigm to reform capitalism .
Nobel Laureates and high level economists were joining forces to deal with the fact that there 's people not buying the mantra of economic growth .
There 's enough of a concern that there 's serious threats to it .
That 's a really good thing .
I 'm an eternal optimist .
I get angry sometimes that we do n't get things fast enough when we are losing so much , so quickly , but it seems to be getting larger as a conversation -- this sense that economics is something larger and more important than the way it is being discussed right now .
That it is n't about numbers , it 's about real life and values and what living well really means .

This presentation will summarize why studying the dreams of video game players is important for understanding dreams .
Hard core gamers represent the leading edge of immersion in virtual worlds that increasingly has come to define a large part of contemporary entertainment and communication .
Three conceptual points as to why this new element in contemporary society needs to be investigated in terms of its impact on dreams , will be illuminated .
These points are 1 ) dreams as aid to solving the hard problem in consciousness , 2 ) evolutionary function of dreams , and 3 ) gaining lucidity in sleep through imaginal absorption .
First , Revousuo ( 2006 ) argues that dreams are useful for understanding the binding problem in consciousness .
He defines consciousness - related binding as “ the problem of understanding the relationship between the phenomenal unity of consciousness and the immediately underlying mechanisms that could explain phenomenal unity ” ( p. 205 ) .
In tying this to dreams Revousuo goes on to point out that “ a dream object does not transform randomly into another object , but into an object that shares many semantic or associative features with the first .
In the waking state such associations do not intrude into our consciousness , for they are unable to override the externally supplied sensory information ” ( p. 247 ) .
Thus the dream state and its inherent bizarre nature allows an unfettered examination of these networks .
It is the bizarreness in dreams which illuminate semantic networks .
In other words , if the bizarre element happens due to skip in the track of the semantic network , it does not go too far afield .
Thus having a waking situation , video game play , where subjects are exposed for long periods of time to unusual / bizarre experiences can help to further illuminate the nature of bizarreness in dreams and ultimately the hard problem in consciousness .
Such a situation is not easily created in a laboratory with a few hours of media viewing or interacting .
In fact in a study on video game effects on various cognitive and perceptual tasks
Boot et al ( 2008 ) found that nonplayers trained on up to 1000 hours of play , still did not reach the levels on their cognitive / perceptual task performance as expert players who Boot et al estimate came into the laboratory condition with 10’s of thousands of hours of play .
Secondly , one evolutionary function of dreaming has been identified as threat simulation ( Revonsuo & Valli , 2000 ) .
Gaming may reduce this dream function because this need is being addressed in another imaginal realm ( i.e. , during a game ) .
Early support for this thesis was found by Gackenbach and Kuruvilla ( 2008a ) .
Thus gaming offers another realm to investigate this evolutionary function of dreams .
Relatedly , the rehearsal of nightmares while awake as a technique to decrease their intensity and persistence ( Krakow , Kellner , Pathak , & Lambert , 1996 ) , may also be manifest in some video game players .
Specifically , in some studies the Gackenbach group has found gamers reporting fewer nightmares than those that rarely game ( Gackenbach , 2009a ) .
The final reason that studying gaming informs dream studies is the potential of gaming to act as preparation or training for dreaming lucidly ( Gackenbach , 2006 , 2009 b ) .
Again the practice in this technologically generated imaginal realm can result in consciousness emerging in dreams .
Thus such inquiries inform not only the question of how to have a lucid dream but also the broader question of the nature of consciousness when it emerges in sleep .
In a review of lucidity - gamer association Gackenbach , Hunt , and Dopko ( 2009 ) conclude that gaming enhances the experience of lucidity along the same lines as meditators ’ .
These findings can be interpreted equally in terms of a psychology of imaginative absorption .
All of these are potential ways that studying video game effects on dreams illuminate our understanding of dreams .
Conceptually , this is not surprising as the deep absorption into the VR of gaming constitutes another imaginal realm or perhaps altered state of consciousness whose experience impacts and informs “ normal ” consciousness states such as dreams .
While games are escapable and dreams typically less so , sans lucid - control dreams , none - the - less there are many parallels in the sense of games offering an alternative reality accessible by most while other alternative realities such as that created in hypnosis or meditation is less widely accessible .
As Preston ( 1998 ) has pointed out gaming provides experiences in deep absorption not normally available to those without that trait .
And thus informs our understanding of dreams in the context of consciousness .

It is probably the most scary scene in cinematic history .
The shower curtain is drawn back and actress Janet Leigh lets out a spine - chilling scream that warps into a frenzied cacophony of staccato music as she confronts an unseen , dagger - wielding madman .
When Alfred Hitchcock put the soundtrack to his 1960 masterpiece Psycho he was almost certainly unaware that the discordant musical notes he was adding to the disturbing shower scene were in fact based on the sort of non-harmonic sounds used in the distress calls of wild animals .
Scientists have found that many of the emotionally - evocative moments in some of the most popular films are enhanced with a sound score that exploits the human brain 's natural aversion to the " non-linear " sounds widely used in the animal kingdom to express fear and distress .
Sounds are classed as non-linear when they become too loud for the normal musical range of an instrument or an animal 's vocal chords .
Alternatively they can be produced by the sudden frequency changes of acoustic instruments , like those that accompanied Leigh 's primal scream .
Scientists who normally study the non-linear alarm calls of marmots – an American ground squirrel – have found that the use of similar , non-linear sounds in the musical scores of films is widespread as a way of enhancing the most emotionally evocative moments of a cinematic story .
Their study of more than 100 film soundtracks has found that film makers appear to exploit our natural aversion to non-linear sounds in order to get the most out of a moment of drama , whether it is the sad scene in the film Forrest Gump as the eponymous hero sits on a park bench , or the menacing pathos of a Corleone family funeral in Godfather II .
" We all know that things like tempo and volume are used by musicians to create tension and elicit particular emotions .
We know that certain chords also do that , " said Professor Daniel Blumstein , an evolutionary ecologist at the University of California at Los Angeles .
" We looked for things that would have been non-linear had they been naturally produced in film soundtracks .
We call these nonlinear analogues .
" What is novel about this study is that we specifically looked for these non-linear analogues and found that indeed they 're present in evocative scenes and that different sorts of emotions are associated with different types of non-linearities , " Professor Blumstein said .
Sounds become non-linear when the volume increases beyond a certain point , when the sound becomes " raspy " and jumps around , indicating that it is beyond the normal , linear range of the instrument or the vocal chords , Professor Blumstein said .
" Imagine a horn .
You blow it gently and a nice sound comes out .
You blow it a little louder and a nice but louder sound comes out .
At some point , when you blow it too hard , the sound gets unpredictable , distorted and noisy .
" You 've hit the non -linear zone of that horn .
The same thing happens in your vocal tract .
Indeed you can imagine that if you 're really scared , you 'll really yell , and the yell or scream will contain [ non - linear ] noise , " Professor Blumstein explained .
The study , published in the journal Biology Letters , involved a detailed acoustic analysis of 30 - second clips chosen from the most iconographic moments of a film , such as the shower scene in Psycho or the execution scene in The Green Mile .
" Soundtracks contain more than simply music and sound engineers can create sounds that would be impossible for an individual to produce , " the scientists write in their paper .
As well as male and female screams , the scientists analysed the non-linear noises in the sound effects , the ambient background noise and any sudden changes in sound frequency .
They looked at four broad genres of film : adventure , horror , drama and war .
It was only in horror and drama that the scientists found a significant use of non-linear sound to amplify an iconic scene 's emotional content , whether it is a scary moment in a horror film or a tearful moment in a drama .
" Our results suggest that film makers manipulate sounds to create nonlinear analogues in order to manipulate emotional responses , " the scientists conclude .
the sounds of suspense
King Kong , the 1933 classic horror movie , saw the first use of recorded animal sounds that were subsequently manipulated to produce non-linear sounds , the scientists said .
The pitch and timbre of the animal calls were changed by the manipulation of the play back medium .
This idea has been used many times in certain films depicting prehistoric , alien or otherwise monstrous characters .
The natural sounds may be difficult to synthesise , which is why film makers resort to real recordings that they manipulate to make them sound more non-linear .
A notable early exception was in Alfred Hitchcock 's 1963 film The Birds .
Here , the director used an electronic instrument , the trautonium , to create a horrifying avian language rather than use recorded bird calls .

Be Proud : The Moment the Closet Door Finally Opened
“ For all of us , there are genuine needs and wishes , deep longings for human warmth , empathic responsiveness , trust , mutual recognition and creative playfulness .
These are many of the ingredients that we think of when we speak of love , or the loving feelings we have for the cherished other person . ”
Monday , June 28 , is the 41st anniversary of the famous Stonewall riot , an event that changed history .
Gay people battled their way out of the closet with bricks and uprooted parking meters , and with a defiance so shocking it scared the men of the NYPD .
And despite many challenges , they have never gone back in .
The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous , violent demonstrations against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28 , 1969 , at the Stonewall Inn in New York City ’s Greenwich Village .
They are frequently cited as the first instance in American history when people in the gay community fought back against a government - sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities .
The riots have become the defining event that marked the start of the gay rights movement in the United States and around the world .
Christopher Street Liberation Day on June 28 , 1970 marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street and the first Gay Pride March in U.S. History .
The March traveled up 51 blocks to Central Park , beginning with a relatively small group that grew into a massive crowd of 15,000 people as it made its way up from Greenwich Village .
Similar marches were organized in other cities .
Today , Gay Pride events are held annually throughout the world toward the end of June to mark the Stonewall riots .

Dr. Maria
New has a new strategy for treating unborn fetuses : the use of a potentially dangerous steroid aimed at treating the effects of a rare congenital disorder that affects the adrenal gland , potentially consigning the future child to a lifetime regime of drugs .
It also prevents “ some of the symptoms of [ this disorder ] in girls , namely ambiguous genitalia .
Because the condition causes overproduction of male hormones in the womb , girls who are affected tend to have genitals that look more male than female , though internal sex organs are normal . ”
Dr. New offers pregnant women dexamethasone , a risky steroid aimed at female fetuses that may have this disorder .
Many exposed to dexamethasone through this off - label use are not being enrolled in controlled clinical trials .
And yes , it gets worse .
As columnist Dan Savage points out , Dr. New is also exploring the use of dexmethasone ’s effects on future fetuses ’ desires to explore “ male careers ” or have disinterest in becoming mothers .
The majority of researchers and clinicians interested in the use of prenatal Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ dexÃ¢â‚
¬
Â focus on preventing development of ambiguous genitalia in girls with CAH .
CAH results in an excess of androgens prenatally , and this can lead to a Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ masculinizingÃ¢â‚
¬
Â of a female fetusÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s genitals .
One group of researchers , however , seems to be suggesting that prenatal dex also might prevent affected girls from turning out to be homosexual or bisexual .
Pediatric endocrinologist Maria New , of Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Florida International University , and her long - time collaborator , psychologist Heino F. L. Meyer - Bahlburg , of Columbia University , have been tracing evidence for the influence of prenatal androgens in sexual orientation … .
They specifically point to reasons to believe that it is prenatal androgens that have an impact on the development of sexual orientation .
The authors write , “ Most women were heterosexual , but the rates of bisexual and homosexual orientation were increased above controls . . . and correlated with the degree of prenatal androgenization .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â
They go on to suggest that the work might offer some insight into the influence of prenatal hormones on the development of sexual orientation in general .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ That this may apply also to sexual orientation in at least a subgroup of women is suggested by the fact that earlier research has repeatedly shown that about one - third of homosexual women have ( modestly ) increased levels of androgens .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â They Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ conclude that the findings support a sexual - differentiation perspective involving prenatal androgens on the development of sexual orientation .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
And it is nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t just that many women with CAH have a lower interest , compared to other women , in having sex with men .
In another paper entitled Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ What Causes Low Rates of Child - Bearing in Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia ?
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â
Meyer - Bahlburg writes that Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ CAH women as a group have a lower interest than controls in getting married and performing the traditional child - care / housewife role .
As children , they show an unusually low interest in engaging in maternal play with baby dolls , and their interest in caring for infants , the frequency of daydreams or fantasies of pregnancy and motherhood , or the expressed wish of experiencing pregnancy and having children of their own appear to be relatively low in all age groups .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
In the same article , Meyer - Bahlburg suggests that treatments with prenatal dexamethasone might cause these girlsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ behavior to be closer to the expectation of heterosexual norms : Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Long term follow - up studies of the behavioral outcome will show whether dexamethasone treatment also prevents the effects of prenatal androgens on brain and behavior .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
In a paper published just this year in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences , New and her colleague , pediatric endocrinologist Saroj Nimkarn of Weill Cornell Medical College , go further , constructing low interest in babies and menÃ¢â‚¬â€ and even interest in what they consider to be menÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s occupations and gamesÃ¢â‚¬â€ as Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ abnormal , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  and potentially preventable with prenatal dex :
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Gender - related behaviors , namely childhood play , peer association , career and leisure time preferences in adolescence and adulthood , maternalism , aggression , and sexual orientation become masculinized in 46 , XX girls and women with 21OHD deficiency [ CAH ] .
These abnormalities have been attributed to the effects of excessive prenatal androgen levels on the sexual differentiation of the brain and later on behavior .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Nimkarn and New continue : Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We anticipate that prenatal dexamethasone therapy will reduce the well - documented behavioral masculinization … Ã¢â‚¬Â 
It seems more than a little ironic to have New , one of the first women pediatric endocrinologists and a member of the National Academy of Sciences , constructing women who go into Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ menÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ sÃ¢â‚ ¬Â fields as Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ abnormal.Ã¢â‚ ¬Â
And yet it appears that New is suggesting that the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ preventionÃ¢â‚ ¬Â of Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ behavioral masculinizationÃ¢â‚
¬Â is a benefit of treatment to parents with whom she speaks about prenatal dex .
In a 2001 presentation to the CARES Foundation ( a videotape of which we have ) , New seemed to suggest to parents that one of the goals of treatment of girls with CAH is to turn them into wives and mothers .
Showing a slide of the ambiguous genitals of a girl with CAH , New told the assembled parents :
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The challenge here is … to see what could be done to restore this baby to the normal female appearance which would be compatible with her parents presenting her as a girl , with her eventually becoming somebody Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s wife , and having normal sexual development , and becoming a mother .
And she has all the machinery for motherhood , and therefore nothing should stop that , if we can repair her surgically and help her psychologically to continue to grow and develop as a girl .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
In the Q&A period , during a discussion of prenatal dex treatments , an audience member asked New , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ IsnÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t there a benefit to the female babies in terms of reducing the androgen effects on the brain ?
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â New answered , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ You know , when the babies who have been treated with dex prenatally get to an age in which they are sexually active , IÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll be able to answer that question .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â 
At that point , she Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll know if they are interested in taking men and making babies .
In a previous Bioethics Forum post , Alice Dreger noted an instance of a prospective father using knowledge of the fraternal birth order effect to try to avoid having a gay son by a surrogate pregnancy .
There may be other individualized instances of parents trying to ensure heterosexual children before birth .
But the use of prenatal dexamethasone treatments for CAH represents , to our knowledge , the first systematic medical effort attached to a Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ paradigmÃ¢â‚
¬Â of attempting in utero to reduce rates of homosexuality , bisexuality , and Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ low maternal interest .

Juni 2010 Sollte nicht der Dritte Korb der Urheberrechtsreform ein Wissenschaftskorb sein ?
Zusammenfassung Das Aktionsbündnis kann mit der Auftaktrede der Bundesministerin der Justiz Sabine Leutheusser - Schnarrenberger am Abend des 14 .
Juni 2010 in Berlin zum Urheberrecht insgesamt nicht zufrieden sein .
Es wurde nicht deutlich gemacht , dass das geltende Urheberrecht den besonderen Bedürfnissen von Bildung und Wissenschaft nicht gerecht wird .
Das Aktionsbündnis fordert die Politik auf , das Urheberrecht um eine spezielle Wissenschaftsschranke oder - klausel zu ergänzen , auch um Klarheit in die vielen undurchsichtigen Schrankenregelungen zu bringen und um Bildung und Wissenschaft den Spielraum zu geben , den sie im Interesse der gesamten Gesellschaft brauchen .
Das Aktionsbündnis wird dafür zeitnah einen Vorschlag öffentlich einbringen .
Das Aktionsbündnis setzt weiter darauf , dass gerade einer liberalen Ministerin bewusst sein sollte , dass der freie ( das heißt genehmigungsfreie und auch für die direkte Nutzung weitgehend vergütungsfreie ) Umgang mit ( wissenschaftlichem )
Wissen innovationsfördernd für die Wirtschaft ist .
Mit Blick auf die bevorstehenden Anhörungen fordert das Aktionsbündnis das Justizministerium auf , zumindest noch eine weitere Anhörung explizit zum Thema Bildung und Wissenschaft vorzusehen .
Ausführung
Mit einer grundsätzlichen Rede der BM der Justiz Sabine Leutheusser - Schnarrenberger wurde der Dritte Korb der Urheberrechtsanpassung offiziell eröffnet [ Manuskript der Rede ] .
Das Aktionsbündnis begrüßt , dass durchaus eine liberale Offenheit bei den Vorstellungen der Justizministerin zu erkennen ist : Sie betonte , dass die kommerziellen Verwerter ( Verlage ) nicht darauf hoffen können , dass das Urheberrecht ihre obsolet gewordenen Geschäftsmodelle weiter schützt .
Auch den Verwertungsgesellschaften dürften kaum noch eine monopolartige Zuständigkeit für die Vergütungen zugesprochen werden , a uch wenn die Ministerin ansonsten das Kultur - Flatrate - Modell kritisiert .
Französische Modelle der Internetsperren soll es in Deutschland nicht geben .
Teuren Abmahnungen bei Urheberrechtsverletzungen sollen warnende Informations - und Vorbeugemodelle vorgeschaltet werden .
Aber , wie zu erwarten , übte die Ministerin auch Kritik an den digital natives , den  Piraten , die das Urheberrecht nicht zuletzt als sozialschädliches Monopol kritisieren .
Das Aktionsbündnis kann mit dieser Auftaktrede insgesamt nicht zufrieden sein , da nicht erkannt wurde , dass das geltende Urheberrecht den besonderen Bedürfnissen von Bildung und Wissenschaft nicht gerecht wird .
In diesen überwiegend öffentlich finanzierten Bereichen stellen sich Fragen des geistigen Eigentums , der Anreize für kreatives Schaffen , des Anspruchsumfangs auf Schutz , der Rückbindung an die Interessen der Öffentlichkeit in ganz anderer Weise als z.B. in der Unterhaltungsindustrie und den Publikumsmärkten .
Für das Urheberrecht wäre allerdings zu beachten , dass auch diese Bereiche wichtige Gegenstände für wissenschaftliche Forschung und für Aus- und Fortbildung sind .
Das Aktionsbündnis erinnert darin , dass sich der Dritte Korb ursprünglich der in Bundestag und Bundesrat vertretenen Auffassung verdankt , dass die bisherigen Regulierungen des Urheberrechts nicht ausreichend den Bedürfnissen von Bildung und Wissenschaft Rechnung tragen .
Der Dritte Korb sollte daher ein Wissenschaftskorb sein .
Dies erscheint umso dringlicher , als der bisherige für Bildung und Wissenschaft zentrale , wenn auch gänzlich unzureichende Paragraph 52a des Urhebergesetzes bislang immer noch zeitlich befristet ist .
Das Aktionsbündnis fordert die Politik auf , das Urheberrecht um eine spezielle Wissenschaftsschranke oder - klausel zu ergänzen , um Klarheit in die vielen undurchsichtigen Schrankenregelungen zu bringen und Bildung und Wissenschaft den Spielraum zu geben , den sie im Interesse der gesamten Gesellschaft brauchen .
Das Aktionsbündnis wird dafür zeitnah einen Vorschlag öffentlich einbringen .
Das Aktionsbündnis setzt weiter darauf , dass gerade einer liberalen Ministerin bewusst sein sollte , dass der freie ( das heißt genehmigungsfreie und auch für die direkte Nutzung weitgehend vergütungsfreie ) Umgang mit ( wissenschaftlichem )
Wissen innovationsfördernd für die Wirtschaft ist .
Das Aktionsbündnis begrüßt , dass die Ministerin die anstehende Debatte um den Dritten Korb als transparent und offen angekündigt hat .
Allerdings sollten die Themen der vier Anhörungen im Sommer und Frühherbst nicht exklusiv vom Ministerium vorgegeben werden .
Bildung und Wissenschaft stehen bisher — bis auf einen Ausflug in Open - Access - Fragen — bei den Anhörungen nicht im Zentrum .
Das kann und darf systematisch und aufgrund der Geschichte des Dritten Korbs nicht sein .
Wer die Themen bestimmt , entscheidet über das Ergebnis .
Das Aktionsbündnis fordert daher das Justizministerium auf , zumindest noch eine weitere Anhörung zum Thema Bildung und Wissenschaft vorzusehen .

almost
proof
It 's time for the Southern Poverty Law Center to reclassify the Family Research Council as an official hate group , not merely anti-gay as they are now listed .
According to the FRC 's official lobbying report for the first quarter of 2010 , they paid two of their henchmen $ 25,000 to lobby Congress against approving a resolution denouncing Uganda 's plan to execute homosexuals .
The resolution passed in the Senate on April 13th , but remains languishing in the House almost four months after being referred to the Foreign Affairs Committee .
Did the FRC 's lobbying kill it ?
As we learned last week with Malawi , international pressure CAN sway even the most virulently anti-gay government .
Below are three screencaps of the 20 - page Family Research Council lobbying report supplied to me by Duncan Osbourne atAmong the other items they lobbied against are the overturn of DADT and DOMA , which is to be expected .
But it 's almost astounding , , that they would lobby the members of Congress against denouncing the death penalty for LGBT people .
THIS needs to fucking THROWN in Tony Perkins ' and Peter Sprigg 's smirking faces the next time they appear on cable television to speak in soothing voices about the FRC 's godly gentle love for homosexuals .
Theis right below on official United States government stationery .
The Family Research Council wants you DEAD .

Praise His Name !

Busca incentivar el uso de chip eletrónico en tarjetas de crédito
[ email protected ] El Banco de México ( Banxico ) emitirá nuevas disposiciones para tarjetas de crédito .
Las reglas buscan incentivar el uso del chip en los plásticos y delimitar las responsabilidades de los clientes y emisoras en caso de robo o extravío de la tarjeta .
Sin embargo , en el proyecto , el Banxico “ libera ” a los bancos y empresas emisoras de tarjetas de toda culpabilidad ante un fraude o robo , si el plástico cuenta ya con el nuevo chip .
Es decir , si se comete una clonación o compras indebidas con una tarjeta con chip , el cliente asumirá el costo .
“ Si la operación se autorizó mediante procedimientos criptográficos con un microcircuito integrado ( chip ) y con el NIP del cliente en la terminal punto de venta , no habrá responsabilidad alguna por parte de la emisora ” , puntualizaron las reglas cuya copia obtuvo EL UNIVERSAL .
Al respecto , la Comisión Nacional para la Protección y Defensa de los Usuarios de Servicios Financieros ( Condusef ) , consideró que en caso de un fraude con una tarjeta con chip , también se debe deslindar a los clientes , tal y como ocurre en Europa .
La dependencia consideró que ante un cargo indebido o fraude , los comercios deberán asumir los costos de remuneración , “ porque de lo contrario , los tarjetahabientes quedarán desprotegidos ” .
En las disposiciones se precisó que si se trata de transacciones que se realicen durante las 72 horas previas al aviso de robo y el cliente no reconozca como propias “ no estará obligado a cubrir el importe , cuando demuestre de manera fehaciente que no autorizó la operación ” .
Tampoco deberá cubrir el saldo si las transacciones se efectuaron mediante la suscripción de pagarés u otros documentos , así como papeles autorizados a través del uso de dispositivos ópticos que produzcan la imagen digitalizada de la firma .
La emisora deberá asumir el importe cuando se excedan 150 Unidades de Inversión ( UDIS ) .
En la actualidad cada UDI tiene un costo de 4.4289 pesos .
La Condusef puntualizó que otro de los elementos relevantes de las reglas del Banco de México es que si una persona hace una compra por internet , ésta se debe entregar sólo en el domicilio que aparece en la tarjeta .
En caso de robo o pérdida La circular emitida por Banco de México determinó un procedimiento específico para casos de robo o extravío de la tarjeta .
Y una vez que el cliente tenga conocimiento del robo , extravío o uso indebido de la información en los plásticos , deberá dar aviso a la emisora de inmediato .
En todos los casos , la institución deberá proporcionar al usuario el número de referencia del aviso , debiendo conservar constancia de la fecha y hora en que éste se efectuó .
A partir de éste , la institución deberá bloquear la tarjeta , por lo que el titular , sus obligados solidarios y subsidiarios , no serán responsables de los cargos que se efectúen en la cuenta con posterioridad al aviso .
La entidad deberá informar al titular , a través de su página electrónica en internet , del documento que adjunte al contrato o del estado de cuenta , el alcance de su responsabilidad por transacciones registradas antes de la notificación de robo .
A Chrysler vehicle sits for sale on a car lot in Carlsbad , California March 30 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Mike Blake
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Doors that could catch fire , brakes that could fail and accelerators that could stick have caused Chrysler Group LLC to recall nearly 600,000 vehicles involving five models in the United States , U.S. safety regulators said on Monday .
Chrysler informed the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the potential safety issues last week , the NHTSA reports show .
As many as 284,831 Chrysler Town and Country minivans and Dodge Grand Caravan minivans for model years 2008 and 2009 could develop a problem in the electrical system that could cause a short circuit in the latch for the sliding door , which could cause a fire , Chrysler told regulators .
As many as 288,968 Chrysler Jeep Wranglers from model year 2007 to 2010 could experience leaking brake fluid which could cause brake failure .
These two recalls are in addition to one first reported last Friday for as many as 25,336 Dodge Caliber and Jeep Compass vehicles for the 2007 model year involving possible sticky accelerator pedals .
Owners of the models involved in each of the recalls are to be notified by Chrysler this month and Chrysler said it will fix the vehicles without charge .

BP Oil Spill : Against Gov. Jindal 's Wishes , Crude - Sucking Barges Stopped by Coast Guard 60 days into oil crisis , Gulf Coast governors say feds are failing them .
June 18 , 2010  -- Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has spent the past week and half fighting to get working barges to begin vacuuming crude oil out of his state 's oil - soaked waters .
By Thursday morning , against the governor 's wishes , those barges still were sitting idle , even as more oil flowed toward the Louisiana shore .
" It 's the most frustrating thing , " the Republican governor told ABC News while visiting Buras , La . " Literally , [ Wednesday ] morning we found out that they were halting all of these barges . "
Watch " World News " for David Muir 's report from Louisiana tonight .
Sixteen barges sat stationary Thursday , although they had been sucking up thousands of gallons of BP 's oil as recently as Tuesday .
Workers in hazmat suits and gas masks pumped the oil out of the Louisiana waters and into steel tanks .
It was a homegrown idea that seemed to be effective at collecting the thick gunk .
" These barges work .
You 've seen them work .
You 've seen them suck oil out of the water , " said Jindal .
Coast Guard Orders Barges to Stop
So why stop now ?
" The Coast Guard came and shut them down , " Jindal said .
" You got men on the barges in the oil , and they have been told by the Coast Guard , ' Cease and desist .
Stop sucking up that oil . ' "
A Coast Guard representative told ABC
News that it shares the same goal as the governor .
" We are all in this together .
The enemy is the oil , " said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Dan Lauer .
But the Coast Guard ordered the stoppage because of reasons that Jindal found frustrating .
The Coast Guard needed to confirm that there were fire extinguishers and life vests on board , and then it had trouble contacting the people who built the barges .
Louisiana Governor Could n't Overrule Coast Guard
The governor said he did n't have the authority to overrule the Coast Guard 's decision , though he said he tried to reach the White House to raise his concerns .
" They promised us they were going to get it done as quickly as possible , " he said .
But " every time you talk to someone different at the Coast Guard , you get a different answer . "
After Jindal strenuously made his case , the barges finally got the go - ahead Thursday to return to the Gulf and get back to work , after more than 24 hours of sitting idle .
Along Gulf Coast , Governors Ask , ' Who 's In Charge ? '
Sixty days into the crisis , it still can be tough to figure out who is in charge in Louisiana , and the problem appears to be the same in other Gulf Coast states .
In Alabama Thursday , Gov. Bob Riley said that he's had problems with the Coast Guard , too .
Riley , R - Ala. , asked the Coast Guard to find ocean boom tall enough to handle strong waves and protect his shoreline .
The Coast Guard went all the way to Bahrain to find it , but when it came time to deploy it ?
" It was picked up and moved to Louisiana , " Riley said .
The governor said the problem is there 's still no single person giving a " yes " or " no . "
While the Gulf Coast governors have developed plans with the Coast Guard 's command center in the Gulf , things begin to shift when other agencies start weighing in , like the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service .
" It 's like this huge committee down there , " Riley said , " and every decision that we try to implement , any one person on that committee has absolute veto power . "

America 's greatest journalism show Fox & Friends had Newt Gingrich on this morning to discuss , among other things , Obama 's call for " prayer " in last night 's speech .
Was n't it offensive for this notorious God-hating monster to suddenly ask for His help ?
You can tell it 's going to be a great episode of Fox & Friends when a guest like Newt Gingrich — an amoral , lying , duplicitous fearmonger who has no problem telling the masses that Obama is trying to destroy Christianity if doing such a thing could ever - so - modestly improve his position with 2012 primary voters — has to play the judicious Christian " moderate " to balance the hosts ' insanity .
In this clip we have Brian Kilmeade replaying Obama 's terribly controversial God-ish line from last night : " We pray for the people of the Gulf , and we pray that a hand may guide us through the storm towards a greater day . "
Complemented by the amazing headline " PRESIDENT'S RELIGIOUS SPEECH : MAKES MULTIPLE REFERENCES TO CHURCH , GOD , " an important discussion ensues :
KILMEADE : Alright , Mr. Speaker , what do you think of that ?
GINGRICH : Well , I hope he means it . [...]
I 'm sad that it took a crisis of this scale , but I 'm delighted that the president has recognized that we in fact all are subordinate to a larger God and that we need to seek guidance from that God.
[ GRETCHEN ] CARLSON : But Mr. Speaker , did you find it at all disingenuous , because some people are analyzing that this morning as saying it was disingenuous from a president who does not go to Church on a regular basis ?
GINGRICH : [...]
If he 's prepared to publicly recognize God , maybe we should encourage him to do it more often .
Disingenuous !
Was it disingenuous for Obama to say " let 's all pray for the fucked Gulf people who are really fucked " because he does n't go to church every week ?
she asks .
This does not go nearly far enough .
Possible follow - ups for tomorrow :
Is Obama the biggest asshole on Earth since dinosaurs ?
Is Obama disingenuous for breathing oxygen and then exhaling carbon dioxide , so as to " live , " godlessly ?
Has Obama ever walked by a church and not thrown Molotov cocktails through its best stained glass windows ?
Why was Obama smashing pictures and action figures of Jesus Christ with his red Communist hammer throughout the entire speech last night , which he delivered from a radical mosque ?
Etc .

Last week ’s graduate seminar discussions focused on Peng ( Frank )
Fu’s proof of termination for the call - by - value simply - typed - calculus , which Aaron has written about previously .
Frank ’s proof is derived from that given for strong normalization with full - reduction in [ Girard 1989 ] .
( Later in the same book , Girard extends this proof to full System F. )
The difference is that Frank ’s proof is specific to the call - by - value calculus .
This raises an obvious question : what need is there for a CBV - specific proof ?
Clearly , full - reduction subsumes CBV — and since full - reduction is strongly normalizing , why do n’t we just point out that the set of transition sequences allowed under CBV is a subset of those allowed under full - reduction and call it a day ?
The answer is that if a CBV - specific proof for the pure - calculus reveals simplifications that can be made to the proof , these same simplifications might help us in constructing normalization proofs for richer languages under CBV reduction .
I ’ll say more about that below .
Let ’s begin with a brief summary of the proof technique .
Let ’s say we define the set of - terms in the usual way ( with or without constants ) , and define the set of types inductively as ( say ) a set of base types , and the set of function types .
Then with each type we associate a so - called reducibility set , denoted .
The reducibility sets are defined in such a way as to preserve the critical property that all terms in are normalizable .
We then prove that for every type , all terms of type are in ; therefore every well - typed term is in some reducibility set , and since every term in a reducibility set is normalizable , it follows that all well - typed terms terminate .
All this may seem straightforward , but on close inspection there is an interesting wrinkle : to say that has type is not the same thing as saying that !
Indeed , the relationship of a type to its reducibility set is the trickiest part of this proof strategy .
In order for the strategy to work , reducibility sets must be defined carefully in order to preserve the properties we are trying to prove !
[ Pierce 2002 ] explains :
If we want to prove some property of all closed terms of [ base ] type , we proceed by proving , by induction on types , that all terms of type possess property , all terms of type preserve property , all terms of type preserve the property of preserving property , and so on .
We do this by defining a family of predicates indexed by types .
This technique , owing to [ Tait 1967 ] , is known as the logical relations technique .
The “ predicates ” that Pierce refers to correspond to our reducibility sets .
Returning to Frank ’s proof , we ’ll define reducability sets for our purposes as follows :
iff and is closed .
iff for every , .
From these definitions ( and again , assuming a call - by - value evaluation strategy ) , we can prove four critical properties :
( CR 1 ) If , then and is closed .
If , then and is closed .
( CR 2 ) If and , then .
If and , then .
( CR 3 ) If is a closed term , and , then .
If is a closed term , and , then .
( CR 4 ) is a non-empty set .
The final step of the proof shows that every well - typed term is in some reducibility set ( specifically that associated with its type ) .
This is shown by induction on the structure of typing derivations .
From this result , along with CR 1 , it follows that all well - typed terms terminate .
At the beginning of this post , I alluded to the possibility of a CBV - specific proof being simpler than a proof for full - reduction .
First it is worth noting that unlike Girard ’s proof , Frank ’s proof does not require to be of type in order to be in .
Second , let ’s compare CR 3 to its counterpart from Girard ’s proof :
( CR 3 ) [ Fu ]
If is a closed term , and , then .
[ Fu ]
If is a closed term , and , then .
( CR 3 ′ ) [ Girard ]
If is neutral , and whenever we convert a redex of we obtain a term , then .
Wait… “ neutral ” ?
What does that mean ?
Well , as it turns out , it means that the term is not an abstraction , i.e. it is of either of the forms or .
It turns out that this stipulation is needed because under full - reduction , we can perform - reduction inside an abstraction ; CBV does not allow this .
So we have to reason with extra care about abstraction terms — they simply are not “ covered ” by CR 3 ′ .
( In Girard ’s proof , this extra step takes the form of a lemma stating that if for all reducible of type , is reducible , then so is . )
In Frank ’s proof , by contrast , this extra step is not required ( though the inductive step for proving CR 1 on function types is somewhat similar ) , as CR 3 applies to all closed terms .
A final ( and perhaps slightly tangential ) point , courtesy of Chris Casinghino in a comment on Frank ’s original writeup : [ Pierce 2002 ] also gives a proof of normalization for CBV .
However , Pierce ’s definition of the reducibility set takes a different form .
Paraphrasing to keep things in line with our notation :
iff halts .
iff halts and for every , .
In other words , the inductive step for application insists that the function term be terminating .
Frank ’s proof does not contain this side condition .
This may not seem like a big deal , but Chris points out that the addition of the side condition makes it trickier to use in a framework of logical relations like that given in [ Mitchell 1996 ] .
Chris is working on a formalization of just such a framework that disallows such side conditions , so the absence of the side condition may be very helpful .
In a future post , and as an exercise for my own amusement / education , I hope to adapt Frank ’s proof to call - by - name evaluation .
It ’ll be interesting to see how much this change complicates things , if at all .
My hunch is that the CBN proof should be similar in structure , since CBN evaluation is deterministic ( like CBV but unlike full - reduction ) .
Stay tuned !

Good news for those of you that were hoping to root your EVO the minute you tear it free from the box : the instructions and files needed in order to root the device have been officially released online .
User ‘ toastcfh ’ over at XDA - Developers , who ’s been providing us with teaser images and video of his rooted EVO for the last couple of weeks , has come clean with detailed instructions on how you can get sweet , sweet root access on your EVO .
You can find his original thread here , and I ’ll paste our tweaked and detailed version of his tutorial below as well .
Note that all credit goes to ‘ toastcfh ’ for this incredible feat .
It ’s interesting to note that they have n’t been able to find a way to write to the system or recovery partitions while booted into the Android operating system .
I know for a fact this can be done on the Nexus One and T - Mobile G1 / HTC Dream , but am not sure about other phones .
Following these instructions will require you to wipe your EVO .
Other bad things may ( but probably wo n’t ) happen as well .
Proceed with caution Following these instructions will require you to wipe your EVO .
Other bad things may ( but probably wo n’t ) happen as well .
Proceed with caution
Grab The Files Here
Should anything happen to the above links , I ’m mirroring them here :
Get To Flashing Here
Luckily this seems like it ’s pretty easy to accomplish .
Hopefully we ’ll be able to get some hands on information from our resident EVO 4G owner Artem , when he returns from his vacation in Europe .
How To Flash The Rom :
Place the previously linked PC36IMG.zip in the root of your SD card
Turn your phone off
Hold down the ‘ Volume Down ’ button while powering on the phone .
Keep the ‘ Volume Down ’ button held down until you see a white boot loader screen
After a few seconds , the boot loader will scan the SD card for update files .
It should locate PC36IMG.zip .
According to XDA - Developers , you ’ll see a blue progress bar and it should take about 30 - 60 seconds to complete
You should then see a list of images that were found , and it will ask you if you would like to flash .
Say yes .
Once that has completed it will ask you if you would like to reboot .
Again , say yes .
.
The phone will reboot into a fresh , rooted rom !
Enjoy !
Over at XDA they also recommend renaming the PC36IMG.zip on your SD card to something like ‘ root - PC36IMG.zip ’.
I ’m not sure why that ’s necessary , but I ’m sure they mentioned it for a reason .
How To Flash The Recovery Image :
You ’ll need access to the ‘ adb ’ utility from the Android SDK .
Luckily , toastcfh packaged this in to the EVO - recovery .zip .
Download the EVO - recovery.zip linked above
Once that ’s finished downloading , extract it to a directory you can access via the command line .
At this point we want to open up the command line
In Windows , you ’ll probably want to go to Run –> then type ‘ cmd ’ and press enter
In OSX , you ’ll want to go to Finder –> Applications –> Utilities –> Terminal
In Linux , use the terminal of your choice .
Hopefully you know your way around the command line .. at least enough to get to the directory where the files have been extracted .
If you do n’t , then you may want to hit the Googles for specific information on your command line program .
Once you ’re in the directory , type :
In Windows : ‘ adb- windows.exe reboot recovery ’ without quotes , then press enter
In OSX : ‘./ adb-mac reboot recovery ’ without quotes , then press enter .
If that returns an error , try typing this first : ‘ chmod 755 adb- mac ’ , then re-entering the first command
In Linux : ‘./ adb-linux reboot recovery ’ without quotes , then press enter .
If that returns an error , try typing this first : ‘ chmod 755 adb- linux ’ , then re-entering the first command
Your EVO should now be in recovery mode .
The next step diverges a bit based on your operating system
In Windows , Open up the directory you extracted ‘ EVO - recovery.zip ’ to in Explorer , then double click ‘ recovery - windows.bat .
Make sure it ’s running as an administrator .
In OSX : Again , from the terminal , type ‘./recovery - mac.sh ’ .
If that returns an error , try typing this first : ‘ chmod 755 recovery - mac.sh ’ , then re-enter the ‘./recovery - mac.sh ’ command
In Linux : Again , from the terminal , type ‘./recovery - linux.sh ’ .
If that returns an error , try typing this first : ‘ chmod 755 recovery - linux.sh ’ , then re-enter the ‘./recovery - linux.sh ’ command
At this point , you should be at the recovery image .
You ’re pretty much done .
You can make a Nandroid backup if you ’d like , or you can go ahead and reboot .
In order to navigate through the options in the recovery menu , you ’ll need to use the ‘ Voume Up ’ and ‘ Voume Down ’ rockers to change you selection , and hit the ‘ Power ’ button to perform the selected action
In order to navigate through the options in the recovery menu , you ’ll need to use the ‘ Voume Up ’ and ‘ Voume Down ’ rockers to change you selection , and hit the ‘ Power ’ button to perform the selected action
Again , many thanks to toastcfh over at XDA - developers for accomplishing this .

However , one person we know very well had the job assignment more than ....
Some people believe broad - based criticism of the media is a new thing attributed to the Internet allowing information consumers to shop for the news accounts they want to believe .
And as a result , as corrupt news gatekeepers , we intend to bury this bad - newsy item in the early hours of this morning so no one will find it and be able to leave snotty , all - knowing comments below about how biased " you medias are . "
Obviously this was a skewed poll with biased results .
Were you called for that poll ?
No , neither were we .
In fact , we do n't know a single one of the 1,000 Likely Voters they allegedly interviewed .
So , it 's a completely flawed sampling .
This includes an even - smaller 33 % who said they were Very Angry at the media .
The good news for American journalism is that fully about three - in - ten ( 31 % ) report being Not Angry at the news media .
And a minuscule two - out - of - three of them ( 66 % ) said they were at least Somewhat Angry at the nation 's news media .
Some very disturbing poll news out the other day .
Shocking too .
It seems that some professional polling outfit named Rasmussen Reports surveyed a whole bunch of obviously subversive people .
... four decades ago of fielding criticism from print readers .
In those days media critics used something called a " desk phone " that involved landlines connecting two hand - held mechanisms enabling people to talk without being cut off by a passing bridge .
There were numerous ongoing gangs of conspiracy - minded readers in those days ; one in particular regularly erupted to complain about the clear conspiratorial absence of news coverage on the disappearance of a famous U.S. aircraft carrier .
Informed that the absence of news coverage about the ship 's disappearance was due to the fact that the ship had not actually disappeared , the callers became Very Angry with said media conspiracist and hung up .
To this day , many believe the media is filled with gangs of like - minded liberal journalists who march the nation 's streets in large political packs ( see photo above ) seeking selected favorable factoids about the Harvard - like brilliance of a certain silver - tongued ex-state senator from the Democratic party whose record - breaking presidential fund - raising of $ 750 million showed an incredibly broad base of support among average Americans yearning for credible change and real hope following an unfortunate era of darkness that those same Americans had voted in .
And that a similar crowd of leftist - inclined journalists dutifully roams dirty alleys to collect negative info on things like the cob-webbed cognizance of some old Republican codger from Arizona who did n't use a BlackBerry and liked the Beach Boys .
Oh , and his loopy choice of a female GOP running mate who'd been elected governor of the nation 's largest state .
Some political paranoids saw a double standard just because those medias daily chronicled Sarah Palin 's clothing , shoe color and hairstyle without equal attention to the boring suits and lack of hair of her opponent , Amtrak 's most famous customer .
According to the new Rasmussen survey , 48 % of Americans believe that intelligent , though liberal reporters are trying to help President Obama pass his amazing agenda whenever they write or talk about the handsome , basketball - playing father of two lovely young daughters with the cutest black dog with a name made out of the president 's initials .
Fifty - five percent of Likely Voters say that news media bias about well - meaning Democrats simply trying to spend other people 's money as quickly as possible and rich Republican suits with winter tans , country club memberships and tendencies toward moral hypocrisy is a bigger , more serious national problem than out - sized political contributions from special interests .
So , hypothetically , said reporters would be likely to focus on , say , the chief executive of a large foreign oil corporation attending a yacht race while a company oil well spewed tons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico .
And they 'd likely overlook the inconvenient reality that at the very same time the chief executive of the United States was playing his gazillionth round of unphotographed golf while the same gooey spew continued .
Sixty - eight percent of Americans say they believe that reporters covering a political campaign would try to help the candidate they want to win while a majority ( 54 % , up seven points since November 2008 ) believe reporters would try to hide information that would hurt their favored candidate .
This would help explain , for instance , why Americans never heard anything about the racist rants of Obama 's long - time pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
Rasmussen reports that 76 % of Republicans and 56 % of independents say reporters are trying to help the president 's generous agenda to improve the life and health of every living American regardless of race , economic class or the costs while rebuilding an economy crippled by eight years of failed GOP policies and insufficient regulation from the nation 's capitol .
On the other hand , 33 % of Democrats say reporters are trying to block Obama 's budget - busting agenda of galactic reforms that will cripple the fiscal future of generations of U.S. taxpayers yet unborn .
In case anyone read this far , forget it .
Just move along .
Nothing to remember here .

In his " Rethinking PID 1 " blog post , open source developer Lennart Poettering , who is known for his work on Avahi and Pulseaudio , has announced " Systemd " , an alternative to SysV - Init and the Init system Upstart .
Upstart is used in a lot of modern Linux distributions to execute or launch all of the things and services required for operation when the system is booted .
In the very detailed blog entry , Poettering discusses the problems of current Init systems and explains how Systemd , which is still very experimental and currently only available via Git , is going to make things better .
For the system to be launched as quickly as possible , he argues that the Init system should only execute what is absolutely necessary and take care of as many tasks as possible in parallel in order to use resources efficiently .
Furthermore , services should only be launched when they are needed – as is done with ( x)inetd , which automatically launches server services such as SSH , Telnet and Webmin when a specific port is accessed .
Poettering adds that the large number of shell scripts executed when current Linux distributions are launched are a problem because they are relatively slow .
He discusses why he does not like the approach currently used by Upstart , which is used by Fedora , OpenSuse and Ubuntu , though he does have words of praise for a few properties of launchd used in Mac OS X .
Poettering also talks about how Systemd works .
He says a lot of the features he had in mind have already been implemented , while others are still being worked on .
He has made a Qemu image with a modified beta version of Fedora 13 available to those who want to give Systemd a test drive .
Systemd launches a system in a virtual machine three seconds faster than Upstart does , according to Poettering , though he admits that these values are only rough estimates determined with debugging activated ; only normal LSB launch scripts were used to call a number of services , which means that a lot of the concepts behind Systemd were not really used .
A Red Hat employee , Poettering makes it clear in the FAQ at the end of his announcement that Systemd is a hobby project , but that , nevertheless , he has coordinated the project with developers from a number of different companies , including Novell ’s Kay Sievers , who is known for his work as a Udev maintainer .
Poettering and Sievers seem to be working towards inclusion in Fedora and OpenSuse once further experiments with Systemd show that the concept is viable .
The main developer of Upstart , Scott James Remnant , commented on Systemd shortly after it was presented in his own blog .
Remnant admits that Upstart is by no means perfect and that he cannot argue with the points of criticism that Poettering brings up .
But now that Ubuntu 10.04 has been released , he says he plans to spend more time on Upstart and focus on a number of the criticised elements .
He adds that it is too early to tell which of the two approaches will be better in the long term .

Beast with two backs
What 's the meaning of the phrase ' Beast with two backs ' ?
Partners engaged in sexual intercourse .
What 's the origin of the phrase ' Beast with two backs ' ?
This modern - sounding phrase is in fact at least as early as Shakespeare .
He used it in Othello , 1604 :
Iago :
" I am one , sir , that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs . "
Shakespeare may have been the first to use it in English , although a version of it appears in Rabelais ' Gargantua and Pantagruel , circa 1532 .
This was translated into English by Thomas Urquhart and published posthumously around 1693 :
" In the vigour of his age he married Gargamelle , daughter to the King of the Parpaillons , a jolly pug , and well - mouthed wench .
These two did oftentimes do the two - backed beast together , joyfully rubbing and frotting their bacon ' gainst one another . "
See other phrases and sayings from Shakespeare .

The latest Opera beta debuted a week ago and along with it a security and stability upgrade .
Several security fixes have been incorporated and Opera recommends users to upgrade to the 10.54 version to take advantage of the improvements for both Mac and Windows users .
Although , there are a total of five fixes , details of only one fix have been revealed as of now .
10.54 version instead of 10.53 ?
The fix that has been revealed prevents Opera from being used as a vector for a font issue in the underlying operating system .
The bug was said to be on Windows systems and Microsoft issued a patch for it , but for users who have n’t patched the hole yet , Opera has its own fix .
Details of the other four fixes will be released at a later date .
However , their severity levels were released .
The second issue fixed is said to be of a ‘ severe ’ nature , the third defined as a ‘ highly severe ’ issue , the fourth as ‘ moderately severe ’ and the last as a ‘ less severe ’ issue .
According to an Opera spokesman , the company was making sure its honoring responsible disclosure practices .
The Mac updates now remove the older versions automatically before installing the new version along with fixing several errors the browser has had with Macs , such as shutting down prematurely and browser stealing window focus .

Modern high - yield farming lowered the amount of greenhouse gases pumped into the Earth 's atmosphere toward the end of the 20th Century by a massive amount , according to a surprising study from researchers at Stanford University .
Technological advances in agriculture helped reduce greenhouse gas output by reducing the need to convert forests to farmland , the study said .
Such conversion involves burning of trees and other naturally occurring carbon repositories , which increases emissions of carbon , methane and nitrous oxide .
If not for yield improvement techniques , which have dramatically helped corporate farms produce more crops with less land , authors of the study said an additional 13 billion tons of CO2 would have been loosed into the atmosphere per year .
" Our results dispel the notion that modern intensive agriculture is inherently worse for the environment than a more ' old - fashioned ' way of doing things , " said Jennifer Burney , lead author of a paper on high - yield farming to be published online by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Overall , the study estimated that new farming methods averted emitting as much as the equivalent of 590 billion metric tons of CO2 .
That translates into as much as a third of the world 's total greenhouse gas output since 1850 , a date often cited as the start of the Industrial Revolution in the West .
The production and use of fertilizer has led to significant greenhouse gas emissions , Burney said , but that increase pales in comparison with what might have been had more forests and grasslands been shifted to agricultural uses .
" Every time forest or shrub land is cleared for farming , the carbon that was tied up in the biomass is released and rapidly makes its way into the atmosphere , " said Burney , who is a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford .
A co-author of the paper at Stanford , Steven Davis , added that the evidence points to spending on agricultural research as one of the best and cheapest ways to prevent new emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases .
To conduct the study , the academics looked at agricultural production between 1961 and 2005 and compared it to hypothetical models that estimated the amount of land that might have been converted if not for the so - called " green revolution " in modern farming .
They found that improvements kept at least 317 billion tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere and possibly as much as 590 billion tons .
The researchers conclude by arguing for improvement of crop yields as part of any policy meant to reduce greenhouse gases .

The Lonely Beat Generation : Dawn of The New Journalism
The City and Man : Origins of The New Journalism
It is neither self - effacing and depressing antiquarianism , nor self - effacing and exhilarating romanticism that compels us to turn with a renewed passionate interest in learning about and appreciating the origins of the New Journalism .
Our present world of public discourse has taken rigidly hostile polarized constructs of traditional Main - Stream Media versus the contemporary incarnation of New Media .
However , while the former has long been understood to focus largely upon the accumulation of power and wealth , the same has come to be the goal of new media organizations .
In fact , present - day new media organizations are made even more repugnant by their petty , envy - based sarcastic commentaries and idolatry of faux - celebrity life .
Further , whatever their seeming differences , both forms of media share in the adherence to vicious levels of social and political ideology , which strongly bias and distort the communications and news presented to the public .
Jack Kerouac : An Early Catalyst for Avant - Garde Writers
No man should go through life
without once experiencing healthy ,
even bored solitude in the wilderness ,
finding himself depending solely on himself
and thereby learning his true and hidden strength .
Jack Kerouac , Lonesome Traveler ( 1960 )
Jack Kerouac ’s ( 1922-1969 ) athletic talent led him to become a 100 meter hurdler on his Lowell ( Mass . ) high school track team , and his skills as a running back in football earned him scholarship offers from Boston College , Notre Dame and Columbia University .
He enrolled at Columbia University , but when his football scholarship did n’t work out , Kerouac dropped out of Columbia , although he continued to live for a while on New York City ’s Upper West Side .
It was during this time that he met many of the people with whom he was later to journey around the world .
This group later came to be known as the pioneers of the so - called Beat Generation , including Allen Ginsberg , Neal Cassady , John Clellon Holmes , Herbert Huncke and William S. Burroughs .
Nostalgia often is to be the the main appeal of both Jack Kerouac and his 1957 groundbreaking , of - the - generation On the Road .
In reality , the characters in On the Road spent as little time on the road as they could .
Speed was essential .
The men rarely even had time to chase after the women they ran into , because they were always in a hurry to get to a city .
Kerouac ’s story is soaked through with an aching sadness that comes from the certainty that this world of hobos , migrant workers , cowboys and crazy joyriders was dying .
But the sadness is not sentimental , because many of the characters in the book who inhabited that world would have been happy to see it go differently , or else were too drunk or forlorn to care .
They did not share the traditional literary man ’s nostalgie de la boue .
They were restless , lonely , lost , beat .
Readers can witness that painful sadness by reading a sampling of Kerouac ’s personal journal entries between 1948 , when the twenty - five - year - old writer had recently returned to New York from a cross-country trip , to 1950 , when his first book , The Town and the City , was published .
There is a sense of something risky and exposed about Kerouac ’s reading , just as there is about Kerouac ’s prose .
The Beats were men who wrote about their feelings .
On the Road is somewhat sub-canonical , but it ’s also also a tour de force .
It is usually considered to be more a literary phenomenon than a work of literature .
On the other hand , it has had an influence that is equivalent to a work of literature .
Kerouac revealed how one could stretch a canvas across an entire continent .
He made America a subject for literary fiction ; he de-Europeanized the novel for American writers .
Had his publishers not insisted upon using pseudonyms for “ characters ” in the book ,
On the Road arguably could have been considered the first nonfiction novel .
As it finally emerged in publication , Kerouac described it as a narrative - novel .
Nevertheless , Kerouac ’s book came out eight years before Capote ’s In Cold Blood and twenty - three years before Norman Mailer ’s The Executioner ’s Song .
It is certainly one of the leading literary sources for The New Journalism of the nineteen - sixties and seventies .
On the Road served as a major catalyst for the outburst of magazine pieces by writers like Tom Wolfe , Joan Didion and Hunter Thompson , a surge of avant - garde articles which took America and its weirdness as its great subject .
Two films related to Kerouac ’s work are presented below .
The first is Pull My Daisy , an experimental art movie about “ The Beat Generation ” that Kerouac wrote and narrated in 1958 .
The second film is the 1994 biographical movie , Jack Kerouac : King of the Beats .

William S. Burroughs : Portrait of an Anonymous Man
William Seward Burroughs II ( 1914 - 1997 ) was a major figure in the inner-circle of the Beat Generation writers and a post - modern author who influenced popular culture as well as literature .
He is deemed one of the most politically trenchant , culturally influential , and innovative artists of the twentieth century .
Burroughs wrote eighteen novels and novellas , six collections of short stories and four collections of essays .
Five books have been published of his interviews and correspondences .
Burroughs also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians , and made many appearances in films .
After attending Harvard University , Burroughs became enamoured with contemporary counterculture , and fascinated by the underground society of drug addiction .
Much of Burroughs ’s work is semi-autobiographical , primarily drawn from his experiences as an opiate addict , a condition that marked the last fifty years of his life , his first novel being Junky ( 1953 ) .
His writings are often satirical and darkly humorous , based upon his socially critical observances and lifelong subversion to the moral , political and economic systems of modern American society .
In this regard , Burroughs is perhaps best known for his initially highly controversial third novel Naked Lunch ( 1959 ) .
In 1983 , he was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters .
Despite his life of constant globe - trotting and public appearances , there was always something cold , remote and forbidding about Burrough ’s personality .
This aspect of his life has perhaps been most clearly revealed by the state of his windowless New York City apartment , the former locker room of an 1880s YMCA on the Bowery in New York City .
Burrough ’s apartment , which he named The Bunker , has been preserved since his death in 1997 , and a photographic exhibition of his unusual “ stuff ” can be viewed here .
A documentary film about William Burrough ’s life is presented below .
The William S. Burroughs Tribute Documentary ( 1985 ) features Allen Ginsberg , Brion Gysin , Francis Bacon , Lauren Hutton , Patti Smith , Terry Southern , William S. Burroughs and others .

Allen Ginsberg : A Poetic Champion of Human and Civil Rights
I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by
madness , starving hysterical naked ,
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn
looking for an angry fix .
Allen Ginsberg , Howl ( 1956 )
Irwin Allen Ginsberg ( 1926-1997 ) was an American poet who vigorously opposed militarism , materialism and sexual repression .
In the 1950s , Allen Ginsberg was a central part of the inner-circle of The Beat Generation writers , who combined poetry , song , sex , wine and illicit drugs with passionate political ideas that championed personal freedoms .
Ginsberg ’s epic poem Howl ( 1956 ) celebrated his fellow compatriots and excoriated what he saw as the destructive forces of capitalism and conformity in the United States .
In Howl and in his other poetry , Ginsberg drew inspiration from the epic , free verse style of the 19th century American poet Walt Whitman .
Both men wrote passionately about the promise and betrayal of American democracy ; the central importance of erotic experience ; and the spiritual quest for the truth of everyday existence .
Ginsberg ’s book of poems , The Fall of America , won the National Book Award for poetry in 1974 .
Other honors included the National Arts Club Gold Medal and his induction into the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters , both in 1979 .
In 1995 , Ginsberg was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his book , Cosmopolitan Greetings : Poems 1986 - 1992 .
A taped recording of one of the original readings of Howl that Ginsberg gave at Reed College has recently been rediscovered and can be accessed on their multimedia website .
Posted below is a documentary film about Ginsberg , The Life and Times of Allen Ginsberg .
The Life and Times of Allen Ginsberg ( Trailer )
Gregory Corso : Poetry to Stimulate Individual Will
Gregory Nunzio Corso ( 1930 – 2001 ) was an American poet , the youngest of the inner circle of Beat Generation writers ( along with Jack Kerouac , Allen Ginsberg , and William Burroughs ) .
If Ginsberg , Kerouac and Burroughs were the Three Musketeers of the Beat movement , Corso could rightly have laid claim to being their D’Artagnan , a sort of junior partner .
As a late - comer to the group , Corso was accepted and deeply appreciated , but with less than complete parity .
After having been abandoned by his parents as a child , Corso had lived alone on the streets of Little Italy for years .
For warmth , he slept in subways in the winter , and then slept on rooftops during the summer , continuing to attend Catholic school , not telling authorities he was living on the street .
As a result of minor run-ins with the law , at the age of sixteen Corso was sent to Clinton Prison for three years .
While imprisoned , Corso studied Greek and Roman classics , consumed encyclopedias and dictionaries , and began writing poetry .
Upon his release from prison in 1951 , twenty - one - year - old Gregory Corso joined the Beat inner-circle and was adopted by its co-leaders , Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg , who saw in the young street - wise writer the potential for expressing the poetic insights of a generation wholly separate from those preceding it .
For Corso , poetry became a vehicle for change , a way to redirect the malignant course of society by stimulating individual will .
In 1957 , Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky traveled to visit Burroughs in Morocco .
Corso , who at that time was already in Europe , joined them and then led them to Paris , introducing them to a Left Bank lodging house above a bar at 9 rue Gît - le - Coeur that was to become known as The Beat Hotel .
They were soon joined by William Burroughs and others .
It was a haven for young expatriate painters , writers and musicians .
A short documentary about the life of Gregory Corso , and another about The Beat Hotel , are presented below :

Jamie Lee Curtis promises in TV adds that bacteria - laced Dannon yogurt will improve colon regularity .
Other companies sell little pills full of living microbes and even supplements promising to feed those microbes what they most like to eat .
Probiotics and prebiotics — from bacteria - infused beverages to microbe - filled chocolates — are gaining in popularity , even as some scientific studies find they do n’t always live up to their claims .
You carry around 3 to 5 pounds of bacteria in your colon and small intestine , and most , but not all , of these intestinal denizens are helpful .
Foods and supplements designed to support the good guys come in two main categories : Probiotics ( foods containing live bacteria of the beneficial variety ) and prebiotics ( containing foods those bacteria like to eat ) .
Though evidence is slim that ramping up on the good guys will help you stay svelte , these bugs do have other benefits .
Probiotics can banish constipation , diarrhea and bloating , says Dr. Anish Sheth , a gastroenterologist at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven , Conn .
In addition , they can crowd out disease - causing bacteria , such as those found in spoiled food that might cause diarrhea , says Dr. Leonard Smith , a retired general vascular surgeon in Miami .
The good gut bacteria , Sheth says , eat the starches and fibers that we digest , turning them into products we can use .
The bad ones produce fewer beneficial products and more undesirable output , such as gas .
People can easily get useful bacteria from fermented foods , such as sauerkraut and miso , Smith says .
In foods and supplements designed to be probiotic , lactobacillus and bifidobacterium are the most common additions .
Lactobacillus , used to make yogurt , is a normal resident in the small intestine , and it produces vitamins and antimicrobials that prevent nonbeneficial bacteria from growing .
Natural bifidobacteria boost the immune system and digestion while inhibiting growth of disease - causing bacteria and yeasts .
Prebiotics are fibers , such as inulin , that the good bacteria in the gut love to eat .
Many foods , such as banana , flax and barley , naturally contain inulin and other carbohydrates that gut bugs adore digesting .
You can also buy pure inulin to mix into soups or smoothies .
Probiotics and prebiotics are best used in combination , Sheth says .
He also advises looking for products that combine several kinds of bacteria .
Since scientists are far from understanding which ones are best , he says , using multiple kinds is the best strategy .
Some research studies support probiotic use .
For example , researchers from Imperial College in London reported in the British Medical Journal in 2007 that probiotic drinks prevented diarrhea in elderly people in the hospital .
The 135 people in the study were taking antibiotics , which can interfere with the normal gut community and allow diarrhea - causing bacteria , such as Clostridium difficilis , to move in .
Of those who drank a probiotic yogurt drink , only 12 % developed diarrhea , compared with 34 % who drank a bacteria - free milkshake .
Other reports claim probiotics can stave off the sniffles in children or prevent allergies .
For example , in a study published last year in the journal Pediatrics , researchers based at Danisco reported that probiotics are good for respiratory health .
Danisco makes probiotics and prebiotics .
The scientists gave probiotic powders , taken with milk , to about 200 children in a child - care center in Jinhua City , China .
One hundred others received a bacteria - free beverage .
Over the six - month study , the kids taking the probiotics had fewer instances of fever , cough and runny nose than the kids on the inactive product .
However , some scientists remain wary of the claims made by probiotics manufacturers .
And since the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate probiotics , proof of efficacy is often sketchy .

Hoping to tackle the long - standing challenge of financing charter school facilities , the State Board of Education is considering taking on a novel and controversial role for an elected body : landlord .
The proposal , spearheaded by member David Bradley , R- Beaumont , would draw about $ 100 million from the state ’s $ 23 billion Permanent School Fund to purchase buildings that would be leased back to charter schools .
Bradley and Commissioner of Education Robert Scott , both vocal charter advocates , call the arrangement a “ win-win , ” saying the fund could make money on the investment while at the same time saving charter schools money .
The board will take up the matter on July 21 , Bradley says .
Some observers , however , seem baffled at what looks like a too - good - to - be - true scheme .
The logic simply does n’t work , they say : Laws governing the Permanent School Fund require the board to invest the money to its best - possible advantage — so how can that standard be met while giving charter operators terms more favorable rates than they can get in the private market ?
“ Why would charters do this , " asks state Rep. Scott Hochberg , D - Houston , the vice chair of the House Public Education Committee , unless the board gave them a rent break ?
“ How does this help anybody ? ”
It ’s complicated , Bradley concedes .
But such an arrangement , he says , could take charters out of the business of facilities management and ownership — which they never wanted to enter in the first place — and realize cost savings .
That ’s because charter organizations often run into problems getting reasonably priced credit to buy buildings , he says .
Unlike traditional school districts , charters have no taxing power , are politically controversial and operate on five - or 10 - year contracts with the state , all factors the private lending market does n’t particularly like .
In addition , the schools that rent space pay hidden property taxes as part of their leases , which are not tax - exempt for their landlords because charters , though financed by tax dollars , are actually private entities .
Both situations could be avoided , Bradley said , with the SBOE taking a tiny percentage of the fund to purchase buildings and then lease them back , at market rates , to charters .
The YES Prep charter school network in Houston just embarked on an ambitious building campaign that will seek to raise $ 100 million — roughly half in debt and half in donations , says Anne McClellan , the network 's chief growth officer .
But if there were an opportunity to pay a “ reasonable ” lease , YES Prep might just jump at the chance , she says .
“ We ’re not in the business of having to build schools because we want to be , ” she says .
“ If we did n’t have to do fundraising to build $ 9 million buildings , we could spend more money on students in the classroom . ”
Facilities issues have long been the thorn in the side of the charter movement , because the Legislature has never given the schools extra money for buildings .
Instead , they must finance facilities out of their regular operating budgets — meaning they can spend less in the classroom than comparable campuses run by traditional school districts , which have broad taxing and borrowing power .
But the question of whether the SBOE could offer the schools “ reasonable ” rent hinges entirely on what rate of return the board needs to meet the “ prudent person standard ” it must follow for all Permanent School Fund investments .
In other words : Would a prudent person choose investing in the charter school facilities business — or , more accurately , directly running that business — over all other real estate investments available on the open market ?
Some remained unconvinced , including Board Chair Gail Lowe , R - Lampasas , usually an ally of Bradley ’s in the board ’s bloc of social conservatives .
“ I like the traditional asset allocation pathway we ’ve taken , ” Lowe says .
“ If [ investments ] help charters as a side effect , that ’s nice .
But that ’s not the main goal .
I think you have to prove that charter facilities are a better investment than anything else , and I have n’t seen anything to substantiate that claim . ”
Potential conflicts
It ’s unclear whether Bradley can muster the political support to secure board approval — particularly amid shifting politics on the SBOE .
Newly elected board member Thomas Ratliff , R - Mount Pleasant , who will take over from former chair Don McLeroy , R - Bryan , in January , said the board has no business going into the rental business .
“ If they want to do it , they better do it quick , because I do n’t think the votes will be there on the board in January , ” he says .
“ Charter school facilities are a legitimate issue .
But it ’s a problem for the state Legislature to solve . …
If a charter school has a good business model , than it should be no problem getting a loan in the commercial space .
And if not , why would we want to invest ? ”
Charter advocates have concerns , as well , about how much value the proposition would offer individual schools .
David Dunn , executive director of the Texas Charter School Association , says the group prefers an alternate proposal being floated by some legislators that would have the state guarantee loans to charter operators , thereby allowing them to borrow money at favorable rates .
“ We would of course support anything that made lease payments lower for charter schools , ” he says .
“ But I ’m not sure the state would be able to write a lease that ’s really favorable to the charter schools . ”
Whatever money schools renting from the state might save through a property tax exemption might well be eaten up by whatever profits a “ prudent ” SBOE would need to make on its investment , Dunn says .
The state could , however , provide a potential advantage in simple stability , he says .
“ Right now , charters are going in and out of shopping centers with private landlords .
Presumably , the state would be a more stable landlord , hopefully under favorable leases .
But there ’s something to be said for stability alone . ”
Legislative support ?
Bradley remains confident he can pull together support for his proposal .
“ This proposal is going to get buy - in from everybody , ” he says .
“ I ’ve had nothing but positive feedback at the Capitol . ”
He noted the support of state Sen. Florence Shapiro , R - Plano , chair of the Senate Education Committee .
Shapiro confirmed interest in the idea but says it has “ pros and cons . ”
Specifically , she says , it ’s not clear if the Permanent School Fund can legally be used to aid charter schools , as opposed to traditional school districts .
And she had the same concern raised by others about the ultimate value of Bradley ’s plan for charters .
But she says such complex ideas stem directly from the Legislature ’s failure to do the obvious thing : give charter schools enough money to pay for their facilities in cash , whether they choose to rent or own .
Shapiro , like some other lawmakers , has tried and failed in the past to introduce measures to finance charter facilities .
“ I ’m looking to try and give them incentive money , to reward good charter schools with money for facilities , but I have n’t been able to pass that , ” she says .
“ What Bradley is doing is looking at alternatives . ”
On the House side , Hochberg says the alternative stretches the SBOE far out of the bounds of its authority over the public school fund .
Common sense dictates that the best - possible investment mix to maximize Permanent School Fund revenues will change constantly , as the market changes .
Real estate in general might be a great investment today and a terrible one a month from now .
A board decision to lock itself into specific properties for the specific purpose of renting only to charters can’t possibly be the best business decision for all market environments — if it makes sense at all , Hochberg says .
“ Let ’s say you decide to invest a certain amount in real estate , and you buy a building and rent it to Wal - Mart — and then the market changes , so you decide to change investments and sell it .
You can do that .
But what if a charter school is in there ? ”
Hochberg asks .
“ They ’re not supposed to be in a specific business — they ’re supposed to be investing in the long - term interest of the children of the state of Texas . ”
Ron Paul's Legacy Lives on in His Son's Kentucky Senate Campaign Rand Paul is favored to win Tuesday 's GOP Senate primary in Kentucky .
May 17 , 2010 -- Rep. Ron Paul did not win a single Republican primary in the 2008 presidential race .
But his son , ophthalmologist Rand Paul , is poised to become the GOP Senate nominee from Kentucky in what is shaping up to be the second major Tea Party victory this month .
Even though Rand Paul is running for the GOP Senate nomination against Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson , the hand - picked candidate of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Ky. , Paul is leading in nearly all the public polling and is widely expected to win on Tuesday .
Paul credits the energy behind his candidacy to the Tea Party movement .
" I feel a part of the Tea Party , " Rand Paul told ABCNews.com 's " Top Line " last month .
" I probably was at the very first Tea Party in the country in 2007 .
I was also there in 2008 , and the first campaign event I went to in Kentucky was a Tea Party -- April 15 of last year . "
2010 Elections Map : Follow the Senate , House and Governor 's Races
If Paul wins , his victory would come on the heels of the Tea Party win in Utah last weekend when three - term incumbent Sen.
Bob Bennett was denied a place on the GOP primary ballot .
Paul has used McConnell 's support for Grayson to tag him with the establishment label that no candidate wants to be wearing this cycle .
" I think most Kentucky voters want to decide for themselves , " Paul said .
" They do n't want someone in Washington to dictate their candidate . "
Even though Rand Paul is expected to win on Tuesday , Grayson 's backers say Paul would be vulnerable in a general election because he wants to repeal the Patriot Act and do away with any federal role in either gay marriage or drug laws .
The anti-Paul argument was recently articulated by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , who famously clashed with Ron Paul during the 2008 presidential debates .
" Trey Grayson is the candidate in this race who will make the right decisions necessary to keep America safe and prevent more attacks on our homeland , " Giuliani said .
" He is not part of the ' blame America first ' crowd that wants to bestow the rights of U.S. citizens on terrorists and point fingers at America for somehow causing 9/11 . "
Sarah Palin Backs Rand Paul for Kentucky Senate
Even though Paul has been attacked by Giuliani , he has some high - profile support of his own .
Paul is backed not only by retiring Sen. Jim Bunning , R - Ky. , but also by Sarah Palin , the Republican former Alaska governor .
" He 's a federalist and he wants the states to have ... more say in a lot of the issues , " Palin said during a recent appearance on " Fox News Sunday . "
" But nobody 's ever going to find a perfect candidate .
There are things that I do n't agree with Rand Paul and yet his domestic policies , for the most part , I do agree with .
He wants limited government .
He wants the feds to start taking their hands off states ' issues .
" And I respect that and I 'm proud to support him -- again , never finding a perfect candidate , " she said .
" No doubt , he disagrees with me on a whole lot of issues , but -- proud to support him and others whom I can believe in . "
Even though the Republican Senate contest is capturing most of the attention in Kentucky , Democrats have a competitive primary of their own in the Bluegrass State .
National Democrats have tapped Jack Conway as their preferred candidate , but Lt. Gov. Dan Mongiardo has put up a spirited fight .
ABC News ' David Chalian contributed to this report .
On the Mavi Marmara , the ship that Benjamin Netanyahu has dubbed “ the hate boat ” , Israeli soldiers who had been hurt were given medical aid .
But some of the civilians who had been shot ended up dying because the Israelis refused to have them evacuated .
Accounts provided by activists on board claim that the first Israeli commandos to land on the ship were forcibly disarmed and then taken below deck for their own safety .
Photographs now published by Turkey ’s leading newspaper , Hürriyet , support this claim .
Soldiers from any military force rely on their weaponry to maintain their image of power .
The Israeli military is no different from any other in wanting to avoid having the vulnerability of its own elite soldiers highlighted .
What these photographs reveal , however , is that once these particular soldiers were no longer able to defend themselves , they were not lynched .
On the contrary , they were taken out of harms way .
Given the terror that Israelis experience when faced with the risk of having soldiers taken hostage , it appears that one element in the over - reaction of the remaining armed commandos was that they thought it inconceivable that any of their comrades could be held without coming to further harm .
Humiliation and fear .
Was this the context in which enraged soldiers decided that they would then set about teaching their adversaries a lesson ?
Did nine men , many of whom were well past an age where it seems at all likely they were engaged in any kind of combat , then become scapegoats ?
Were the deaths on the Mavi Marmara the result of a few soldiers demonstrating their military muscle in a desperate effort to restore their tattered pride ?

Mirroring a Censored WordPress
Blog is for bloggers with self - hosted *
WordPress blogs who believe their sites may be blocked by government filters .
Its goal is to help bloggers use a mirror site to make censored content available to readers despite these filters .
It contains step - by - step instructions for setting up a mirror for an original ( “ source ” ) WordPress blog .
This guide was written in 2010 by Sami Ben Gharbia ( Global Voices Advocacy Director ) , with Rebekah Heacock ( a research assistant for the OpenNet Initiative ) and Jer Clarke ( Global Voices web developer and WordPress designer ) .
When it comes to accessing banned web sites and blogs , most online free speech advocates focus on bypassing censorship using circumvention tools .
While this is important , teaching Internet users how to evade censorship is not enough .
Many people are not aware of or do not have access to circumvention tools , as countries that filter the Internet also tend to block proxy servers and other circumvention technologies .
When circumvention tools are used , they often affect connection speeds , making Internet access even slower in places where connectivity is already poor .
To make your content accessible you cannot simply rely on circumvention technologies or the technical knowledge of your readers *.
Taking your users ’ needs into account and keeping ahead of the blocking efforts of their governments are the first steps toward implementing creative workarounds that make your site 's content available to all potential readers , regardless of where they live .
One way to increase access to blocked sites for Internet users in countries that filter online content is through mirroring : duplicating a site 's content on another domain name or subdomain .
Mirror sites automatically reflect any changes made to the original site , allowing blog authors to get around censorship by providing multiple locations where readers can access their content .

In the late 1940s , a Herculean effort was undertaken by Britain and its allies to deliver vital supplies to a helpless West German population surrounded by hostile Soviet forces .
Today , a flotilla of ships is somewhere on the Mediterranean Sea , sailing to the Gaza Strip in an attempt to deliver similarly vital supplies .
In the Palestinian territory , a population of 1.5 million people lives in deplorable conditions , held at the mercy of Israeli and Egyptian - controlled borders .
It ’s a controversial comparison to make , so please allow me to explain .
On May 20 , the Straight published a story about a Victoria resident who was planning to take part in an aid mission for Gaza , which calls itself the Free Gaza Movement .
The following day , Kevin Neish flew to the Mediterranean Sea .
A few days later , he joined the flotilla and set sail for the Palestinian - occupied territory .
Since then , the Straight has kept in touch with Neish and requested that he keep the paper updated on his efforts with the Free Gaza Movement .
Upon receiving that request , Neish e-mailed the Straight a frustrated reply .
In part , that message read , “ I ’ll try .
Personally I ’d rather someone did a story about the lack of much mainstream coverage of this flotilla in general in Canada rather then me . ”
Neish ’s comments made me recall a speech that renowned journalist Robert Fisk recently made at the fifth Al Jazeera annual forum .
The Independent newspaper ’s Middle East correspondent focused his address on the power of semantics , and how language can shape people ’s perceptions of events .
But Fisk also asked the same question that Niesh had .
“ Yes , when it comes to history , we journalists really do let the presidents and prime ministers take us for a ride , ” Fisk said .
He continued :
Today , as foreigners try to take food and fuel by sea to the hungry Palestinians of Gaza , we journalists should be reminding our viewers and listeners of a long - ago day when America and Britain went to the aid of a surrounded people , bringing food and fuel — our own servicemen dying as they did so — to help a starving population .
That population had been surrounded by a fence erected by a brutal army which wished to starve the people into submission .
The army was Russian .
The city was Berlin .
The wall was to come later .
The people had been our enemies only three years earlier .
Yet we flew the Berlin airlift to save them .
Now look at Gaza today .
Which western journalist — and we love historical parallels — has even mentioned 1948 Berlin in the context of Gaza ?
Fisk later concluded his remarks by saying :
Al Jazeera is giving good coverage to the flotilla — the convoy of boats setting off for Gaza .
I do n't think they are a bunch of anti-Israelis .
I think the international convoy is on its way because people aboard these ships — from all over the world — are trying to do what our supposedly humanitarian leaders have failed to do .
They are bringing food and fuel and hospital equipment to those who suffer .
In any other context , the Obamas and the Sarkozys and the Camerons would be competing to land US Marines and the Royal Navy and French forces with humanitarian aid — as Clinton did in Somalia .
Did n't the God - like Blair believe in humanitarian ' intervention ' in Kosovo and Sierra Leone ?
In normal circumstances , Blair might even have put a foot over the border .
But no .
We dare not offend the Israelis .
And so ordinary people are trying to do what their leaders have culpably failed to do .
Their leaders have failed them .
Have the media ?
Are we showing documentary footage of the Berlin airlift today ?
Or of Clinton 's attempt to rescue the starving people of Somalia , of Blair 's humanitarian ' intervention ' in the Balkans , just to remind our viewers and readers — and the people on those boats — that this is about hypocrisy on a massive scale ?
The hell we are !
We prefer ' competing narratives ' .
Few politicians want the Gaza voyage to reach its destination — be its end successful , farcical or tragic .
We believe in the ' peace process ' , the ' road map ' .
Keep the ' fence ' around the Palestinians .
Let the ' key players ' sort it out .
The concept of framing is always a favourite of journalism students .
The question of whether an armed Kurdish separatist is a terrorist or a freedom fighter is a fun one to debate .
But it ’s also a question for which the answer has real consequences .
It is likely that the flotilla currently on its way to the Gaza Strip will not make it to land .
The Israeli Defense Force has promised to intercept any unauthorized ship attempting to deliver supplies to the territory .
If the ships are turned around or captured , it ’s highly unlikely that you ’ll hear a word about those events on CNN or even BBC News .
And it ’s almost unimaginable that any Western government official would comment on the affair .
As Fisk asked , is this a failure of the media ?
If so , why is it happening ?
And perhaps most importantly , what will be the consequences on the ground in Gaza ?

Were Ubuntu Linux ported to any device you could name , it would n't be much of a surprise , but developer Canonical intends to release a tablet - specific branch of the OS this time .
Like previous efforts on netbook and MID , you can expect the new version to be something of an Ubuntu Light , but with new multitouch gestures and an on - screen keyboard lovingly baked in .
Based on Ubuntu 10.10 " Maverick Meerkat , " the tablet version will actually be rolled into Ubuntu Light later on , but right now the company 's busy romancing hardware providers -- Freescale , Marvell , and Texas Instruments have all signed deals , and both Intel and Pixel Qi will reportedly bring power - saving tech to the table .
Time will tell if that means a Armada 618 or OMAP 4 powering the display of our dreams , or yet another ARM - based craptablet with a resistive screen .
The B in BP may no longer mean British , but tell that to New Orleans .
The city is using a $ 5 m cheque from the company to launch what might be seen as only a slightly tongue - in - cheek anti-British campaign , aimed at luring tourists who might be discouraged by the approaching oil spill .
New Orleans is using BP 's money to launch a series of television and newspaper advertisements across the US on Friday , including one that declares : " This is n't the first time New Orleans has survived the British . "
The slogan is set against a statue of General Andrew Jackson , who repelled a British assault on New Orleans back in 1814 .
But it says in the small print that " right now everyone is welcome , especially our friends from England " .
( In the US , the terms British and English are often regarded as interchangeable even when it comes to the World Cup . )
The advertising campaign is the brainchild of the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau , which fears a sharp reduction in tourism and gatherings of other kinds , just as business was picking up after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
" You ca n't just say we 're open , come , " the bureau 's president , Steve Perry , told the organisation as he launched the campaign , according to blogofneworleans.com .
" You have to acknowledge it .
It 's sorta like the poster with the family in front of the shark tank at the aquarium after Katrina , saying we 're pleased to report that this is the only part of New Orleans that 's still under water . "
New Orleans considered some other slogans including : " In times of stress , we eat . "
But then it was thought that stress and vacation did not really go very well together .
Perry said that the campaign was also about trying to persuade people that the Gulf of Mexico was a big place geographically and that the oil was nowhere near New Orleans , even if the city did sit beside the affected Gulf of Mexico .
" All of the things that visitors come to enjoy in New Orleans remain unchanged by the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf , " he said .
BP wrote a $ 15 m ( £ 10.1 m ) cheque to promote tourism in Louisiana last month .
It paid a similar amount to the state of Alabama , and $ 25 m to Florida .
The city plans to start the campaign on television stations in large cities such as Chicago and Houston and in national newspapers .
Since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded and sank in late April , BP has faced a barrage of criticism from the US president , Barack Obama , as well from environmental groups and from commentators across social networking sites .
But the anti-British sentiment is not limited to the non-British .
Or perhaps that should be anti-English sentiment .
Dame Helen Mirren told the American chat show host David Letterman that BP stood for " bloody piss - poor " and that she was glad England did not beat the US in their World Cup match .
Mirren was cut off by vigorous applause from the studio audience after putting the boot into BP , then continued : " I mean I do n't think I could have come on this show .
" I would have been so embarrassed and mortified at being British that I think I would have had to cancel . "
Kirsten Kukowski , a spokeswoman for Mr. Kirk ’s Senate campaign , did not respond on Friday to the comments from church officials .
In a statement earlier in the week , she said Mr. Kirk had worked “ as a nursery school teacher ” in his final year at Cornell .
Campaign officials began an inquiry into the scope of Mr. Kirk ’s work after receiving questions from The Times .
“ Congressman Kirk believes his time working in a nursery school and middle school provided valuable life experience , ” Ms. Kukowski said Friday in a statement .
The Kirk campaign has scrambled this week to try to confirm details of his time as a nursery school teacher , which he raised as recently as March in a speech to the Illinois Education Association .
“ As a former nursery school and middle school teacher , ” he said then , “ I know some of what it takes to bring order to class . ”
In an interview Friday , Ms. Grubb said that she had told a representative of the Kirk campaign of her concerns when the campaign contacted her on Thursday to try to verify Mr. Kirk ’s time at the nursery .
She said she had spoken to the teacher who led what was then a play group that met in the church basement .
The teacher had a “ vague recollection ” of having him as a work - study student , Ms. Grubb said , but she did not remember his name .
She added that Mr. Kirk did not have major responsibilities at the play group , like creating lesson plans , and he was assistant who played with the children .
The campaign of the Democratic Senate nominee in Illinois , Alexi Giannoulias , first raised questions with The Times about Mr. Kirk ’s classroom experience .
Mr. Giannoulias has also faced questions about his background and his ties to the federal seizure of his family ’s bank in Chicago .
The Toronto Maple Leafs put the C on defenceman Dion Phaneuf on Monday .
The 25 - year - old Phaneuf was acquired last January in a blockbuster deal with the Calgary Flames and had 10 points in 26 games with the Leafs last season .
For the full season , he notched 12 goals and 20 assists in 81 games , with 83 penalty minutes .
Head coach Ron Wilson has said the blue - liner had a major influence on the team 's young locker - room after his arrival , although it was n't enough to prevent Toronto from finishing last in the Eastern Conference with 74 points .
Several current Leafs were on hand for the announcement , including Phil Kessel and Luke Schenn , as well as former captain Wendel Clark .
Phaneuf said he learned a lot from Flames captain Jarome Iginla when they were teammates .
He added he hopes to follow the example set by Iginla and former NHL captains Mark Messier , Scott Stevens and Clark .
" You look at how they play the game and how they lead , " Phaneuf said .
" I think the best way to lead is you do n't have to be the loudest guy but you definitely want to be the guy who 's working the hardest day in and day out . "
Toronto has n't had a captain since Mats Sundin left the team in the summer of 2008 .
Phaneuf becomes the 17th captain in franchise history .
The Leafs also unveiled its new home and road sweaters .
The two stripes on the arm and the 11 - point Leafs ' front crest remain unchanged but the team has brought back the two horizontal stripes around the waist .
The veined Leaf logo with no interior lettering will return on the sweater as a shoulder patch as it did from 1992 to 2000 .
In addition , a string lace collar will replace the V - shaped collar .
The lettering and numbers of the sweaters will also be single layered again , without an outside trim .
" Our fans were pretty adamant that they missed the waist stripes , they missed the shoulder patch and so we worked with the league to bring it back , " said Tom Anselmi , the chief operating officer of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment .
The Maple Leafs will debut the uniform in their pre-season opener Sept. 21 against the visiting Ottawa Senators .
" I like the look , I think it really respects our tradition , said Leafs GM Brian Burke .
" I think it 's sharp looking and I can't wait to see the guys come on the ice with them . "
It 's the first modification to the uniform in three years .
The team 's nostalgic white third sweater that debuted in 1998 - 99 will remain the same .
" We have to be respectful of the brand , we have to be respectful of the logo , " Burke said .
" You 're not going to see us wearing crazy third sweaters or anything like a lot of teams do .
This is one of the most recognizable logos on the planet , in the history of professional sports .
" We want to be respectful of that and we think this sweater does that . "
FACEBOOK founder Mark Zuckerberg is being investigated by Pakistani police under a section of the penal code that carries the death sentence for blasphemy against the “ prophet ” Mohammed .
According to this report , Pakistan ’s Deputy Attorney General has launched a criminal investigation against Zuckerberg and others in response to Facebook hosting a “ Draw Muhammad ” contest on the site late last month .
Use of derogatory remark etc , in respect of the Holy Prophet , whoever by words , either spoken or written , or by visible representation , or by any imputation , innuendo , or insinuation , directly or indirectly , defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet Muhammad ( Peace Be Upon Him ) shall be punished with death , or imprisonment for life , and shall also be liable for fine .
On May 19 , Pakistani authorities blocked access to Facebook over the contest , and this ban was lifted on May 31 after Facebook removed the page in Pakistan and other countries .
Asked to comment , a Facebook spokeswoman told us the company does not comment on legal matters .
Last month , according to English - language Pakistani newspaper The News International , a Pakistani High Court judge summoned the police after lawyer Muhammad Azhar Siddique filed an application for a First Information Report ( FIR ) , claiming that the owners of Facebook had committed a heinous and serious crime under Section 295 - C of the Pakistan Penal Code .
In essence , an FIR launches a criminal investigation .
But so far no charges have been filed .
According to the paper , Section 295 - C of the penal code reads :
According to two reports â€ ” one at Boxcrack.net , a kind of citizen journalism site run by Privacy International , and another at Pro Pakistani , Â a Pakistani Telecom and IT news site that lifted the news from BBC Urdu â€ ” the Deputy Attorney General has indeed lodged an FIR against Zuckerberg , fellow co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes , and “ Andy ” , the German woman who initiated the Draw Muhammad contest under a pseudonym .
According to Pro Pakistani , petitioner Muhammad Azhar Sidiqque said he ’s waiting for the police to contact Interpol about making arrangements for the arrest of Facebook ’s owners and “ Andy ” .
The site also says that the Deputy Attorney General told the High Court that Pakistan ’s United Nations representative has asked to escalate the issue in the UN General Assembly .

This funny image makes fun of the No Flash Support and Apple ’s ongoing problem using the the Flash and the Justice League .
As the image illustrates , ALL the superheroes can be easily seen on the top spot since it is using a Google Android phone .
Unfortunately , the bottom spot shows the the Flash is gone and is replaced with the ‘ lack of flash ’ icon many iPhone users are so familiar with … and iPad fans recently joining .
Well , this spoof may not be as accurate since it is just an image and a parody , but it does best to illustrate how much the Flash is missed when using the Apple iPhone and iPad .

Several observers believe the situation is far worse .
The China Daily newspaper , which is run by the government , suggested that the total sum could add up to between 6 trillion and 11 trillion yuan ( £ 590 bn - £ 1.08 trillion ) .
A Reserve Bank currency firm was willing to supply prostitutes and pay bribes to foreign officials to win banknote supply contracts , according to a federal police witness at the centre of Australia 's most serious corruption investigation .
The explosive revelation is one of many made by a key witness in the federal police inquiry into the Reserve Bank 's polymer currency company , Securency .
The witness has told an investigation by The Age and Four Corners - to be aired tonight - that a middleman hired by Securency to win contracts from foreign governments told him that he intended to bribe a central bank governor from an Asian country .
The witness , who was a Securency employee , has given the investigators his diary in which he recorded the middleman telling him in 2007 that the " governor would be very happy if the commission [ payment ] was increased . "
Regarding the request to get a prostitute , the witness has revealed that one of the most senior Securency managers told him to arrange an Asian prostitute for a deputy governor of a foreign central bank .
" Next time that this official was in town , [ I was told ] that I was to procure him a bodyguard and with raised eyebrows and a wink ... a particular type of bodyguard being an Asian woman , " the witness told Four Corners .
" He was suggesting I might like to procure a prostitute for one of the central bank officials on his visit to Melbourne . "
The witness says he did not act on the request although he believed other employees had arranged prostitutes for officials .
In a 2008 diary entry , the witness recorded that a consultant employed in Asia by Australia 's overseas trade agency Austrade told him that to win contracts , Securency needed to hire someone to bribe officials or " to pass white envelopes for you . "
Austrade this week confirmed that the Securency employee - turned police witness did report the comment to an Australian ambassador in the Asian country where it was made in 2008 , but says that it had never been brought specifically to Austrade 's attention .
Austrade also stressed it has never endorsed bribery by Australian businesses .
Secureny is a Melbourne - based polymer banknote company oversighted and half - owned by the Reserve Bank which aims to convince foreign central banks and governments to buy its special polymer banknotes .
An AFP taskforce is investigating Securency for allegedly bribing government officials in countries such as Nigeria , Malaysia and Vietnam .
Leading international figures - including former Malaysian deputy prime minister turned opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim and Nigerian central bank governor Lamido Sanusi - have urged the Australian Government to reveal how far the RBA 's bribery scandal reaches .
" How could Securency allow ... huge bribes in the name of commissions ? "
Mr Ibrahim told Four Corners .
" It 's something very difficult for me to comprehend .
How is it a system [ in Australia ] , with such a strong institution and respect for good government ... could allow this ? "
In a 2008 diary excerpt from the police witness , a Securency employee is recorded as telling him that that the Reserve Bank firm paid exceptionally high commissions to middlemen to secure a contract in Nigeria because so many people were " feeding off it " .
" A range of senior government ministry officials and central bank officials would have been getting a slice of that 20- , 25 - per- cent commission , " the police witness said .
The Age has previously revealed that Securency paid millions of dollars into offshore accounts linked to mysterious middleman who helped the company win deals in Africa and Asia .
Some of the same middleman have been previously implicated in serious corruption scandals or have criminal convictions .
Last March , the Securency board released a seven - month audit of the company 's dealings with its global network of agents , who have received almost $ 50 million in commission payments since 2003 .
The KPMG audit is scathing of Securency management 's conduct in appointing , monitoring and paying its agents , several of whom operate in some of the world 's most corrupt countries .
After the release of the audit , the Securency board , chaired by RBA assistant governor Bob Rankin , announced the departure of the company 's two top executives , Myles Curtis and John Ellery .
KPMG found Securency management ignored specific legal advice to treat requests by agents to be paid via bank accounts outside their country of residence as ' ' high risk ' ' and to subject them to a ' ' higher level of due diligence ' ' .
A Reserve Bank spokesman says the RBA has nothing to add to its previous statements on the issue at this stage .
Earlier this year , the central bank said it endorsed the Securency board 's move to implement all recommendations made by a review of its arrangements with its network of agents .
Nick McKenzie is a reporter for The Age newspaper on assignment at Four Corners .
Teachable moments are rare in America .
George Bush missed the chance right after 9/11 to call for a new era of service to the nation ; he asked instead that Americans do more shopping .
Tuesday night , President Obama did not call for a tax on carbon .
He did n’t even ask the Senate to pass the cap - and - trade legislation that emerged from the House .
Instead , he said there were lots of good ideas out there and he ’s willing to consider any of them — which seemed more like a way of declaring cap - and - trade dead .
But maybe the President has a more subtle strategy in mind .
Here ’s what New York Magazine ’s John Heilemann thinks may be going on :
Lacking the 60 votes necessary for cap - and - trade , the administration plans to get behind a more modest conservation measure in the Senate , then push for a carbon pricing mechanism during the conference committee merger with the House bill — and do so during a lame - duck session after the midterms , when victorious Democrats will find it easier to make a tough vote and losing ones will be freed of political constraints .
It ’s plausible .
After all , the President has now gotten BP to agree to a $ 20 billion escrow fund .
Maybe the MO of this president is , like Teddy Roosevelt ’s , to speak softly and carry a big stick — make nice to adversaries in public and conceal his weapon until he gets them behind closed doors .
But if that ’s his strategy it ’s a curious one considering Obama ’s great gift ( on display especially during the 2008 presidential election ) to stir the nation and mobilize it behind him .
Furthermore , given the unprecedented power of large corporations to call the shots in Washington aided by unlimited campaign contributions and platoons of lobbyists , surely the only way to advance the public interest these days is to rally Americans to a cause .
Closed - door conference committees , back - room deals , and lame - duck sessions keep the public out .
And when the public is shut out , the big guys have even more clout .
Yet hard - boiled Washington hands I talk with disagree .
They point to the $ 80 billion back - room deal that bought off Big Pharma for health care .
They claim there ’s no other way to do business in Washington now because public opinion is too easily manipulated .
They say Machiavellian ( more accurately , Emanuelian ) deal - making behind closed doors ai n’t pretty but the public ca n’t be counted on .
The only way to get close to a carbon tax or anything else that ’s good for America is to buy the bums off .
Maybe .
But when the bums are paid off the public gets stuck with the tab .
We ’ll be paying far more for our drugs under the new health care law than otherwise because of the deal with Big Pharma .
The $ 20 billion deal with BP was also crafted in secret , and we have no way to know what assurrances were given the oil giant that might cost us later .
So too with the financial reform bill that ’s now being finalized in conference committee , and with any potential energy bill where the real deals are made in the back room .
Remember the back - room deal that bailed out Wall Street ?
We still do n’t have all the details but it ’s clear the public was taken to the cleaners , and the titans of Wall Street are beaming through their bonuses .
Call me old fashioned but I still think democracy is better than corporatist negotiation .
And when we have a president as articulate and thoughtful as the one we now have — more capable than almost any occupant of the Oval Office in modern times to educate the public about real challenges and real solutions — he and his advisors do a disservice to the American people when they make the important deals in secret .

At age 19 , as he approached the 2009 - 10 season , Evgeny Grachev elected to jump to the AHL with Hartford rather than return to Brampton of the OHL .
Evgeny Grachev turned heads during his six - game NHL preseason stint with the Rangers in September 2009 , scoring a goal and adding a pair of assists .
During his lone season of major - junior hockey with Brampton in 2008 - 09 , Evgeny Grachev took time out to win a bronze medal with Russia at the 2009 World Junior Championship tournament in Ottawa .
By Dan David , newyorkrangers .comEvgeny
Grachev had only been in North America for a few days when he first showed up at the Madison Square Garden Training Center to attend the Rangers ' 2008 Prospect Development Camp .
A day earlier , on June 21 , Grachev had been selected by the Blueshirts in the third round of the NHL Entry Draft at Ottawa , and he was all smiles as he came down to the Scotiabank Place floor and pulled on a Rangers jersey for the first time .
Now , 24 hours later , the Russian teen - ager was at the MSG Training Center , skating alongside other young Rangers prospects .
Reporters at the Development Camp were eager to meet Grachev .
As a highly - rated forward prospect from Russia ’s Lokomotiv Yaroslavl club , he was ranked by NHL Central Scouting as the No. 9 European skater and was considered the draft 's No. 24 overall prospect by the staff at Independent Scouting Service .
But the 6 - foot - 4 , 220 - pound native of Khabarovsk , Russia , was surprisingly still on the board in the third round , where the Rangers happily selected him at No. 75 overall .
As he prepared to speak to the media for the first time in New York , Grachev stood alongside friend and former Yaroslavl teammate Artem Anisimov , who had just completed a season with the Hartford Wolf Pack .
Grachev was still new to English , but it did n't stop him from declining the use of an interpreter .
Grachev did n’t understand all of the questions in English , but there was one he would n’t let go past him .
Asked if he had a favorite NHL player , Grachev was quick to answer .
" Malkin , " he said , referring to Pittsburgh Penguins superstar Evgeni Malkin , who would go on to lead the NHL in scoring and win the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP the following season .
After saying “ Malkin ” , Grachev paused .
Before the next question , he flashed a wide smile and spoke again .
" I want to be Malkin , " he said .
In Malkin , Grachev might have the perfect NHL role model .
Like Malkin , he had to overcome daunting barriers in his native country to reach North America , and his passion for hockey -- and lifelong desire to play in the NHL -- are what got him there .
Malkin had to wait two years in Russia before making it to North America and signing his first NHL contract .
Grachev was far more fortunate .
Within three months of his draft day , he had signed with the Blueshirts and begun his North American journey with Brampton of the Ontario Hockey League .
He would go on to win OHL Rookie of the Year honors in 2008 - 09 with 40 goals and 40 assists in 60 games , capture a bronze medal with Russia 's 2009 World Junior Championship team , and then make the jump to the AHL with Hartford at age 19 .
He was the youngest player on the 2009 - 10 Wolf Pack roster and one of the youngest players in the American Hockey League this past season .
" There 's no question in my mind he 's going to be a top - six NHL forward down the road , " said Kevin Maxwell , a Rangers pro scout and former NHL player who watched Grachev at Hartford . " ...
I think he 's going to be in that 25 to 30 goal range and possibly 60 points .
” To fully appreciate what it meant for a talent like Grachev to come over within months of being drafted and be on the cusp of an NHL career two years later , one has to understand what he had to overcome .
Since the International Ice Hockey Federation 's former transfer agreement with the NHL expired several years ago , it has become harder for players to leave Europe , particularly Russia , where youth stars often sign multi- year contracts with their club teams .
The red tape associated with signing high - profile Russians has clearly prompted some NHL teams to avoid drafting these players , even when they have greater pro potential than the more readily available North Americans .
The proof is in the numbers .
In 2000 , under the former transfer agreement , 21 of the top 100 drafted NHL prospects were taken from Russian club teams .
Amid fears of contract disputes such as Malkin ’s , the number declined steadily .
By Grachev 's draft year , there were only six such Russians in the top 100 .
Last year , there were three .
This steep drop - off is why a player such as the late Alexei Cherepanov , a top - five talent in 2007 , was still available to the Rangers at No. 17 .
It 's also why Grachev went at No. 75 , prompting Gordie Clark , the Rangers ' Director Player Personnel , to refer to him as “ potentially one of the best third - round picks ever made ” .
When it came to Grachev , the Rangers had done their homework .
They knew that he was determined to leave Russia for North America as soon as he could .
Soon after drafting him , they also discovered that it might be possible for him to come over right away .
Upon entering major - junior hockey , Grachev moved from center to left wing with the OHL ’s Brampton Battalion in 2008 - 09 .
He went on to become the first Rangers prospect to earn OHL Rookie of the Year honors , leading all first - year players in goals and points while placing fifth overall in the OHL goals race and fourth overall in plus - minus with a plus - 48 rating .
He arrived at the Rangers training camp last September and nearly earned a spot on the opening - night roster after an outstanding showing at the Traverse City ( Mich . )
Prospects Tournament and some head - turning preseason performances with the Blueshirts .
In six preseason games at left wing , Grachev registered a goal and two assists .
He was used as a top - six forward his first three preseason games , turning in some highlight - reel plays .
He was particularly impressive when skating with fellow Russians Anisimov at center and Enver Lisin on the right side .
Grachev gave a taste of his remarkable scoring ability in the final preseason game at Washington .
After leading a 3 - on - 1 rush up ice through neutral zone , he moved to the right side and rifled a wrister from right circle past Capitals goalie Semyon Varlamov .
He ended up as the final player cut from the Rangers ' training camp roster .
Ten days later , he was back up with the Rangers in Washington , ready to go if Ryan Callahan could n't play through a minor injury .
When Callahan managed to play , Grachev was returned to Hartford and spent the rest of the season with the Pack , where he immediately went on a four - game point - scoring streak .
As an AHL rookie , Grachev had some shining moments , including five multi- point games and three two - goal games .
He earned No. 1 Star honors four times , including a 3 - 2 victory on Jan. 16 at Providence , when he scored at 7:18 of the first period for a 1 - 0 lead and later delivered the game - winner at 3:19 of overtime .
His other two - goal games came at home on Oct. 25 vs. Worcester and Jan. 2 vs. Bridgeport .
He also had back - to - back multi- point road games on Nov. 6 at Providence and Nov. 7 at Bridgeport .
Rangers pro scout Maxwell was able to see Grachev at his best .
" On one goal I saw him score , he got a step on the guy , dropped his shoulder and drove to the net and used his reach to beat the goalie and put it in , " said Maxwell , " It was a moment that really brought you out of your seat , and I think he 's got a chance to do more of that as he develops .
" Perhaps Grachev 's most impressive statistic last season was playing in all 80 of Hartford 's games .
During a year that his team was plagued by injuries , Grachev was one of only two Wolf Pack players to appear in every game .
" I think he 's just really scratching the surface , " said Maxwell . “ …
For a kid that young , playing all 80 games is pretty impressive in itself .
That just goes to the fact that he is a healthy young man and a strong kid .
" With 12 goals and 16 assists , Grachev ’s numbers were respectable for a rookie , but scouts believe they might have been better had he been older .
Clark is confident Grachev would have been the talk of the OHL at Brampton last season had he gone back to the major - junior ranks , and Maxwell agrees that starting the season at age 19 was a disadvantage in 2009 - 10 .
" He did have a bit of an adjustment realizing that he was playing against men , " said Maxwell .
" He was so strong in junior that once he got a step on a guy , he just basically outmuscled him .
What we found as the season progressed was that he just needed to get stronger .
I attribute that to youth .
” Like Anisimov , Grachev had an opportunity to enter the AHL as a 19 - year - old and wanted to do so .
By the end of the season , Grachev was back in the prestigiousFuture Watch list of the Top 50 drafted prospects playing outside the NHL .
His No. 21 overall ranking was a testament to his potential .
" He's not a pure goal - scorer or a pure play - maker , if that makes sense , but he can do both , and I think that 's part of the attraction , " said Maxwell .
" He 's really got to work at driving to the net instead of sometimes hitting the blue line and going across it .
He needs to go all the way down the wall and try to cut to the net and drive to the net .
Once he learns to do that , he 's going to become much more effective .
" Given all he has accomplished in his North American career so far , it 's almost hard to believe Grachev wo n't turn 21 until next February .
He is sure to again be one of the most intriguing stories at the Rangers ’ training camp this fall , and Blueshirts fans can expect the determination he has shown since draft day to help him make another impressive run at the opening - night roster .
Self Care
Why Cervical / Vaginal Self Exam ?
By using a speculum , flashlight and mirror , a woman can observe her own cervix and the natural changes that occur over time .
Self exam enables her to see a vital part of her anatomy and monitor changes , secretions , menstrual cycle , and indicators of fertile time .
She can identify yeast imbalance , a common vaginal condition .
Cervical examination is one of the most powerful tools a woman can have .
Why is the cervix so important ?
As the opening to the uterus , it is the cervix through which menstrual blood flows , babies are born , and pregnancies are terminated .
Several methods of birth control work by placing a barrier over the cervix and keeping sperm out .
When a woman ovulates , cervical mucous has a distinctive texture and appearance .
With the aid of a speculum , viewing the cervix can be easy .
Self cervical exam is not a replacement for regular Pap Smears , nor does it substitute for screening for sexually transmitted infections , both of which rely on microscopic analysis of cells .
3 Easy Steps to Self Exam
In addition to the hand - held mirror , flashlight , and speculum , you may want KY lubricating jelly or water on the speculum for easier insertion .
( Use a water - based lubricant , not Vaseline . )
Before you start , practice opening and closing the speculum ; and make sure you understand how to lock it open , as well as how to unlock and close the bills .
Then sit comfortably ; leaning back with your legs open , knees up , on a bed or couch with pillows behind you .
( If you do n't already have one , get your own clear plastic speculum from FWHC . )
Put some KY jelly or water onto the bills ( the rounded part ) which you will insert into your vagina ) .
Take a deep breath .
As you exhale , let your muscles relax .
To insert the speculum , hold it in one hand , handles up , bills together .
Using your other hand , spread the labia and insert the bills of the speculum as you would a tampon .
When you have inserted it as far as it will comfortably go , open the bills using the mechanism on the handles that you practiced with earlier .
You will feel the speculum stretch your vagina open .
Lock the speculum into place .
Then you can let go of it .
With both your hands free , you can now hold the flashlight and mirror .
Shine the beam of the flashlight into the mirror so it reflects into the vagina lighting up the internal space .
Or shine the flashlight directly inside .
Adjust the mirror and flashlight so you can see inside .
At the back of your vagina is your cervix .
It looks like a small donut with a very small opening in the center .
When you are finished , unlock and close the speculum .
Then slowly and gently pull the speculum out .
You may smell the speculum to become familiar with your natural smell of secretions and examine the mucus picked up on the speculum .
An acidic smell is not unusual .
A yeasty or fishy odor may indicate an infection .
What You See
The cervix appears as a rounded or flattened knob about the size of a quarter or half - dollar .
The hole or opening in the center is called the cervical os .
If you cannot see your cervix , unlock the speculum , change the direction the bills are pointed , then reopen it .
It may help to sit on a firmer surface , like the floor .
If after a few tries you are unable to find your cervix , wait a few days and try again .
The cervix moves somewhat during the menstrual cycle and may be easier to see in a few days .
What 's Normal
Your cervix may be pink and smooth or it might have reddish blemishes .
It can also be uneven , rough or splotchy .
All of these are normal .
There may be mucus covering the cervix or coming out of the os .
Mucus is natural .
The character of the mucus changes throughout the menstrual cycle in response to hormones .
It ranges from pasty - white ( non-fertile ) to clear and stretchy egg - white texture ( fertile ) .
It does not have a strong odor .
The cervix may have fluid - filled sacs on it that look like blisters .
These are called Nabothian cysts and are not a problem .
They are caused by a blockage in the mucus - producing glands of the cervix .
In some women they come and go , and others have them for years .
They do not need treatment .
You may see polyps , outgrowths of tissue that dangle on a stalk and protrude through the os .
They may bleed easily but do not need to be removed unless they bother you .
Cervical bluing may be the first sign that a woman is pregnant .
Fifty percent of women who are pregnant will have a blue or purplish colored cervix due to an increase in blood circulation .
During pregnancy , the cervix may also look puffy and softer and the os more open .
What 's Not Normal
It is normal to have vaginal and cervical discharge .
However , if any of the following are found during self exam , it may indicate an infection .
green , gray or dark yellow discharge
any significant change in the amount or consistency of discharge
any strong odor unusual for you .
A health professional can take a sampling of cells and send them to a lab for tests .
You may choose to seek care from a clinician if you suspect an infection .
Some infections , such as chlamydia or gonorrhea , can cause serious complications if left untreated .
Other conditions may be easily addressed with natural remedies .
When you have a Pap test , the clinician removes a few cells from the cervical os .
The cells are sent to a laboratory and examined under a microscope for signs of cancer .
Your visual exam is not a replacement for a Pap smear .
With the exception of visible sores caused by the herpes virus , most sexually transmitted diseases cannot be seen during self - exam .
Chlamydia , gonorrhea , HIV / AIDS , hepatitis - all these STD 's need to be tested by a clinician and require prescription medication .
Recognizing what is normal for you is the primary reason for performing self exam .
By knowing what is normal , you can tell what is unusual for you .
A " yeast infection " is an overgrowth of natural vaginal yeast .
It can cause a white , cottage cheese - like discharge and usually causes uncomfortable itching .
There are many ways to curb yeast overgrowth , including garlic vaginal suppositories , yogurt douches , herbal or natural treatments as well as over - the - counter medications .
Pregnancy and Cervical Exam
When a woman is pregnant , the cervix appears bluish or purplish instead of the usual pink .
So , why self exam ?
To claim our bodies for ourselves .
Self exam can be a transformative experience .
It may be performed individually or in a group where the experience may be shared and each person in the group can learn more about the wide range of what is normal for women .
Some women do it every week , some once a month , some only occasionally .
Self exam can be more than simply knowing the appearance of your cervix .
It can be a tool for self - discovery and empowerment .
To know what was once unknown , to shed light on what was once hidden , and to have a sense of ownership and ability to care for our bodies can change our lives .
It 's about helping ourselves to health .
Get your own plastic speculum .

As with any Nimitz class carrier , the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower ( CVN 69 ) does n't deploy alone .
Instead she sails with a number of other support vessels composing a " Carrier Strike Group . "
Within the Eisenhower 's traditional strike group ( Carrier Strike Group Eight ) are :
Command Destroyer Squadron Two Eight , composed of 8300 ton Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyers focused on antiair , antisubmarine , antisurface , and strike operations using the AN / SPY - 1D Phased Array Radar , an AEGIS upgrade , and the best - in - class AN / SQQ - 89 integrated ASW Suite .
Originally designed to deal with former Soviet air threats ( like Iran 's Su - 25 , MiG - 29A ( Fulcrum ) and MiG - 29UB aircraft ? ) :
The USS Bainbridge ( DDG 96 )
The USS Barry ( DDG 52 )
The USS Laboon ( DDG 58 )
The USS Mitscher ( DDG 57 )
The USS Ramage ( DDG 61 )
Along with :
Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyers :
The USS Carney ( DDG 64 )
The USS McFaul ( DDG 74 )
The USS Farragut ( DDG 99 )
... and 9600 ton Ticonderoga class guided missile cruisers :
The USS Hue City ( CG 66 )
The USS Anzio ( CG 68 )
The USS Vicksburg ( CG 69 )
Generally , Carrier Strike Groups are also escorted by two or three attack submarines as well .
Those are n't talked about much .
Carrier Strike Group Ten , built around the USS Harry S. Truman , is composed of a substantially similar group .
It will , however , replace Command Destroyer Squadron Two Eight with Command Destroyer Squadron Two Six :
USS Hawes ( FFG 53 )
USS James E. Williams ( DDG 95 )
USS Kaufman ( FFG 59 )
USS Ross ( DDG 71 )
USS Oscar Austin ( DDG 79 )
USS Winston S. Churchill ( DDG 81 )
USS Elrod ( FFG 55 )
The presence of three Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates ( FFG 53 , FFG 59 , FFG 55 ) is interesting .
Zero Hedge readers may remember the Oliver Hazard Perry class by its most famous member , the USS Stark ( FFG 31 ) which was struck by not one but two Exocet anti-ship missiles launched from an Iraqi plane in 1987 and somehow managed to limp to Bahrain and was eventually repaired and returned to service .
Less famous , but more dramatic , the USS Samuel B. Roberts struck an Iranian mine , which blew a 6 meter hole in the vessel , flooded the engine room , and actually broke the keel .
For the unwashed , the end of the keel is typically the end of a warship .
Despite this , the Samuel B. Roberts was not only salvaged , but repaired and returned to action .
The USS Stark ( FFG 31 ) lists to port after being
struck by Iraqi Exocet missiles in 1987
For comparison , the only real action the Arleigh Burke class has seen is via the USS Cole ( DDG 67 ) which was attacked while in port by suicide bombers .
Though the Eisenhower and Carrier Strike Group Eight are due to rotate out of the area after a six month deployment in July , two things are interesting with respect to this rotation .
Firstly , the arrival of Carrier Strike Group Ten with the Harry S. Truman puts two anti-air and anti-cruise missile groups in the U.S. Fifth Fleet AOR ( " Area of Responsibility , " Persian Gulf , Red Sea , Arabian Sea and East African Coast ) at the same time .
Also , this is the first time the Harry S. Truman has been in the Fifth Fleet AOR .

Second , the outgoing Carrier Strike Group Eight is commanded by Rear Admiral Phillip S. Davidson .
Of course , one does not manage to command a Carrier Strike Group without active and combat deployment , but Davidson 's background is far more weighted to strategy and policy accomplishments .
To wit :
Adm .
Davidson ’s initial sea service assignments were in frigates and destroyers in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets and he has made deployments to the Persian Gulf , Western Pacific , Mediterranean , Indian Ocean , Red Sea , Eastern Pacific and Baltic Sea areas of operation .
He was also the Commanding Officer in two warships , commanding USS Taylor ( FFG 50 ) from August 1998 to June 2000 and USS Gettysburg ( CG 64 ) from October 2004 to June 2006 .
He deployed and earned Battle Efficiency “ E ” awards in both of those ships .
Ashore , he has served in a variety of operations , planning and policy billets on the U.S. Pacific Fleet staff , the Navy staff and the Joint Staff ; as the Navy ’s Military Aide to the Vice President of the United States ; and as a Special Assistant to the Commander - in - Chief , U.S. Pacific Fleet , the Commander - in - Chief , U.S. Pacific Command , and later , to the Chief of Naval Operations .
He was the Deputy Director for Strategy and Policy in the Joint Staff / J - 5 in his first flag officer assignment .
Rear Admiral Davidson is a distinguished graduate of the U.S. Naval War College .
His decorations include the Defense Superior Service Medal , the Legion of Merit , the Meritorious Service Medal , the Navy Commendation Medal with Combat “ V ” and other personal , unit and campaign awards .
He has a Master of Arts in National Security and Strategic Studies and is a Joint Specialty Officer . [ fn ]
U.S. Navy Biography of Rear Admiral Phillip S. Davidson .[/fn ]
His replacement , Rear Admiral Patrick Driscoll , Commander of Carrier Strike Group Ten , has enjoyed a career with a decidedly different focus , specifically : A combat hardened strike fighter pilot and commander with significant experience in the Iraq - Iran theater .
Notice :
Driscoll 's initial fleet assignment was with the 1983 Battle " E " winning VS - 32 “ Maulers , " where he completed two Indian Ocean deployments and was selected as the Atlantic Fleet Sea Strike Pilot of the Year .
Following transition training in the A - 7E CORSAIR II , Driscoll deployed with the VA - 105 " Gunslingers " to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean , which included participation in tanker escort operations during Operation Earnest Will .
His next sea assignment was with the " Clansmen " of VA - 46 , where he deployed aboard the USS John F. Kennedy ( CV 67 ) to the Red Sea in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm .
Driscoll then attended the Naval War College , with a follow - on joint assignment with the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in July of 1993 .
In 1996 , Driscoll reported once again to the " Gunslingers " of VFA - 105 deploying aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt ( CVN 71 ) and participated in Operation Deliberate Guard over Bosnia and Operation Southern Watch in Iraq .
Driscoll 's next assignment was the commanding officer and flight leader of the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron ( The Blue Angels ) for the 1999 and 2000 show seasons .
In April of 2001 , Driscoll reported to Carrier Air Wing 5 based in Atsugi , Japan .
During Operation Enduring Freedom , he led the TACAIR strike element aboard the USS Kitty Hawk ( CV 63 ) , which served as an Afloat Forward Staging Base during combat operations in Afghanistan .
He deployed again in 2003 and led his air wing in combat during Operation Iraqi Freedom .
In 2008 he served in Baghdad , Iraq as Director of Communication and spokesman for Multi-National Force - Iraq ( MNF - I ) .
He is currently serving as Commander , Carrier Strike Group TEN .
Driscoll ’s staff assignments include : Deputy Director , Deep Blue ; EA to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information , Plans and Strategy ; EA to the Vice Chief of Naval Operations and the Chairman ’s Joint Strategic Working Group .
Personal awards include the Legion of Merit with two gold stars , the Distinguished Flying Cross with Combat V , three Bronze Stars , and the Defense Meritorious Service Medal .
He is a distinguished graduate of the Naval War College and holds a Masters degree in National Security and Strategic Studies . [ fn ]

Hmmmmm .
In last couple of days there has been an outbreak of clickjacking attacks on Facebook 's " Like " plugin .
For those unfamiliar with Facebook , this plugin allows users to mark certain pages as interesting , and subsequently in their profile a statement will appear that they " like " certain content .
Since we received a lot of e-mails from our readers about these attacks ( and certainly some media covered variants of them ) , I decided to analyze one which is still up and working as I found it pretty interesting .
The main idea of this attack is to get a user to click on a hidden link while the user thinks he is actually clicking on something else – this is the basis for clickjacking attacks .
So , let 's see how it 's done in Facebook 's example .
The main malicious web page tries to entice the user to click on it to see the rest of the so called " best passport application rejection in history " .
The web page just contains a single JPG image and you can see below what it looks like :
Now , what happens behind the scenes is pretty interesting .
The HTML source contains two obfuscated JavaScript elements and an iframe that do all the work .
Let 's first see what the iframe does :
The div tag sets this iframe completely invisible ( and the attacker makes sure that this works in every browser by using all the possible opacity combinations ) .
Then the iframe points to the Like plugin at Facebook , and sets the href parameter to the target web site ( the credittreport .info site ) .
This is what shows in the iframe :
Yes , there are 15,687 people " infected " with this .
Now comes the interesting part – how to make the user click on this , relatively small icon .
The second obfuscated JavaScript element tells the rest of the story :
Let 's analyze this JavaScript code .
In line 2 they get the " icontainer " element – this element holds the iframe , you can see in the iframe code above that the div tag uses the id " icontainer " .
The standardbody object will contain the document body .
Now , let 's skip to line 21 – this line defines a handler for mouse movement .
So , every time the mouse is moved , this function , starting with line 22 is called .
The function checks if the iflag variable is 0 ( and it is , until the user clicks on the hidden element ) .
If the variable is 0 , the mouse movement handler will call the mouseFollower ( ) function .
And this is the main trick – the mouseFollower ( ) function actually moves the iframe to follow the mouse !
So the attackers made sure that no matter where you click on the web page , you will land on the hidden Facebook button and " infect " yourself by posting a message on your profile saying that you like this malicious site .
When a friend of yours click on that link , he / she will be taken to this web page again and no matter where they click , they will end up doing the same !
If you close the window , nothing will happen .
Attacks such as this one have become increasingly popular lately , so be careful what you click on , no matter if it 's in Facebook or not .
If you are a Facebook user , be especially careful of all links , especially those that require you to click on something else to see the real content .
While this is n't really a vulnerability in Facebook , it does appear that their team will have to step up and implement some controls to prevent clickjacking attacks such as this one .

A number of common applications on the Apple iPad 3G , including its YouTube viewer , Netflix , and ABC 's TV viewer , are running at downsampled resolutions over the device 's 3G connection -- or not at all .
Looking for an identical experience when using a " Wi-Fi-only " iPad versus Apple 's just - released iPad 3G ?
Guess again .
Electronista is reporting that a number of common applications , including the iPad 's YouTube viewer , Netflix , and ABC 's TV viewer , are running at downsampled resolutions over the 3G connection -- or simply not at all .
Previews of video content on the iTunes Store remain unaffected .
What 's to blame for the quality loss ?
TechCrunch got a hold of an AT&T spokesperson who had a brief , but cryptic response : " It 's just a question for Apple . "
Or is it ?
From Electronista :
" Subsequent investigations , however , have revealed that the policies are so far self - imposed , " the site reported .
" ABC is allegedly prevented from streaming over 3G due to rights issues , for example .
YouTube is most likely emulating the same bitrate scaling seen on the iPhone , with the larger screen size magnifying any drops in quality .
" AT&T is known to have called for adaptive video quality on iPhone apps to avoid oversaturating its network , but it has stopped short of making that a requirement on its own .
Sling Media noted earlier this year that its 3G - aware version of SlingPlayer had no help from AT&T and that it appeared to have been an unannounced change in policies that allowed it into the App Store . "
Self - throttling has usually been voluntarily imposed to maintain a constant connection rather than for concerns about the carrier or for rights issues , Electronista also noted .
The 3G service on the iPad comes in two different flavors : an unlimited data plan for $ 29.99 / mo and a 250 MB plan for $ 14.99 / mo .
We 've covered the nuances of the plans previously , including some helpful recommendations for what exactly constitutes 250 MB - worth of service based on a few casual scenarios .
If jacked - up multimedia quality is your primary interest when it comes to your iPad , there are a few alternative solutions that could maximize your Wi-Fi connectivity when on - the - go -- including AT&T 's basic 3G plan , which gets you free access to the company 's Wi-Fi hotspots , or a less expensive nationwide Wi-Fi service like Boingo Mobile Wi-Fi .

Federal regulators want to know just how fast you ’re surfing , and they ’re looking for 10,000 volunteers to submit to a speed check .
Four out of five high - speed Internet users do n’t know how fast their home connections are , according to a survey released Tuesday by the Federal Communications Commission .
That leaves those consumers unsure whether they ’re getting what they ’re paying for , and it hinders them in shopping for better service from competing Internet service providers , agency officials said .
“ Speed matters , ” said FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski , who has pushed for more consumer information about broadband service as part of a larger effort to expand high - speed Internet access nationwide .
In its National Broadband Plan released in March , the FCC asserted that consumers can easily determine a vehicle ’s fuel efficiency or the nutritional content of most foods from labels with standardized information , but they have little information about the speed of their Internet service .
To help resolve that problem , the FCC announced that it is seeking 10,000 volunteers who would allow special hardware in their homes to measure the speed of their broadband Internet service , as part of a scientific study of the performance of major providers .
“ In order to really make good consumer choices , people really need to be able to draw a line between the speed they need , the speed that ’s advertised and the speed they get , ” said Joel Gurin , head of the FCC ’s Consumer Task Force .
“ Right now , it ’s very hard for consumers to draw that line . ”
In a survey of 3,005 adults conducted in April and May , the FCC asked whether people knew the advertised speed of their home Internet connection ; 80 % said they did not .
That showed little improvement from an 81 % figure in a 2006 survey by the Pew Internet and American Life Project .
Still , the FCC survey reported that 50 % of home broadband users were very satisfied with their home connection speeds and 41 % were somewhat satisfied , even if most did n’t know the exact speed .
For people surfing the Web wirelessly on smart phones , 71 % said they were at least somewhat satisfied with their speeds .
The survey also found that 24 % believed they always got the advertised speed they were promised by their Internet service provider , and 67 % thought they always should get what they ’re promised .
Brian Dietz , a spokesman for the National Cable and Telecommunications Assn. , a cable industry trade group , touted the high consumer satisfaction in the FCC survey .
He said it was n’t surprising that consumers do n’t know their exact speed in light of the fact that competition among providers has led to network upgrades that have been boosting broadband speeds .
“ Even if customers are not able to keep track of these improvements , the survey confirms that they are pleased with the results , ” Dietz said .
The average maximum download speed for home broadband service was 8 megabits per second , while the actual download speed averaged about half that — 4.1 mbps — according to data from online research firm ComScore Inc. cited in the National Broadband Plan .
Internet service providers usually hedge their promises , advertising speeds “ up to ” a certain rate of data .
That ’s because various factors affect speed , including the quality of a person ’s computer and Internet router , as well as how many people in the home are surfing the Web at the time .
FCC officials acknowledge those factors could affect the ComScore data , so the agency will spend $ 600,000 on a scientific study that will use hardware that gauges the speed of a home Internet connection before it reaches the router or other equipment .
The hardware will measure specific information as well , such as speeds for video downloads and Internet phone calling .
To conduct the test , the agency will use SamKnows Ltd. , a London company that did a similar study in Britain .

The FCC also allows consumers to test their connection speeds themselves at https://www.broadband.gov.

“ It appears that almost any expression of Tibetan identity can be categorized as separatist or reactionary , ” she said in an interview from London .
“ These are not angry monks raising their fists in protest but people working within the system who are engaged in work that ’s essential for a healthy civil society . ”
Among the more prominent people arrested is Tragyal , an editor at a state - run publishing house in Qinghai Province whose whereabouts have been unclear since April , not long after his latest book came out with contents decidedly unflattering to the Chinese government .
The book , “ The Line Between Sky and Earth , ” was a marked departure for Tragyal , 47 , more commonly known by the pen name Shogdung , who was previously derided by many Tibetans for being “ an official intellectual . ”
But like many moderate Tibetans , especially those in the more gently administered provinces east of Tibet , he was dismayed by the crackdown that followed the 2008 unrest and included such sentiments in his book .
In one passage , he describes Tibet as “ a terrifying battleground , ” adding : “ At the junctions of monasteries and villages , soldiers parade .
Such places are full of spies .
It ’s so frightening . ”

His daughter , Yeshi Tsomo , said the family had been unsure of his whereabouts since the police took him from their home .
“ We ’ve been to the detention center more than 20 times , but we have never been allowed in , ” she said .
Those who study Beijing ’s Tibet policy say the authorities appear to have extended their deep - seated suspicions to the Tibetan educated and well - to - do , a tactic some say could radicalize a segment of the population that had come to accept the imperfections of Chinese rule .
“ For the first time , we ’re seeing the government attack a group of people who previously had nothing to do with politics , ” said Robbie Barnett , director of the modern Tibetan studies program at Columbia University .
“ These are cultural products of the Communist Party , people who were brought up by the system . ”
There are many ways to safely namespace your objects in JavaScript .
This article discusses common practices I have seen .
Prefix Namespacing
If the goal of namespacing is to avoid collisions .
The following system is just as likely to avoid namespace collisions as any other system as long as we know the global variable name prefix myApp_ is unique .
// add uniquely named global properties var myApp_sayHello = function ( ) { alert ( ' hello ' ) ; } ; var myApp_sayGoodbye = function ( ) { alert ( ' goodbye ' ) ; } ; // use the namespace properties myApp_sayHello ( ) ;
C programs frequently use prefix namespacing .
In the JavaScript world , you may have encountered Macromedia 's MM_ functions like MM_showHideLayers .
I think that prefix namespacing is the most clearly understandable namespacing system in JavaScript .
( The object namespacing strategies below can cause confusion when the keyword this becomes involved . )
Prefix namespacing does create many global objects .
This is not a problem in regard to namespace collisions as the prefix protects against that .
The problem with prefix namespacing is some web browsers ( e.g. Internet Explorer 6 ) perform poorly if there are many global objects , so I am told .
I ran some tests and there was a little thread on comp.lang .
javascript but I did n't peruse this topic completely .
Single Object Namespacing
Currently , the most popular JavaScript namespacing practice is using a single global variable to reference an object .
That referenced object then references your " real business " and because your global object is named uniquely then your code should run happily with anyone else 's code present .
If you are pretty sure no one in the world has used the global variable name myApp then you may have code like this
// define the namespace object var myApp = {} ; // add properties to the namespace object myApp.sayHello = function ( ) { alert ( ' hello ' ) ; } ; myApp.sayGoodbye = function ( ) { alert ( ' goodbye ' ) ; } ; // use the namespace properties myApp.sayHello ( ) ;
When the the last line of code above runs , the JavaScript interpreter first finds the myApp object , then finds and calls that object 's sayHello property .
A problem with object namespacing is it leads to confusion with object - oriented message passing .
There is no obvious syntactic difference between
namespace.prop ( ) ;
and
receiver.message ( ) ;
Looking at this confusion more carefully we have the following for the namespace concept .
Suppose we have the following library .
var myApp = {} ; myApp.message = ' hello ' ; myApp.sayHello = function ( ) { alert ( myApp.message ) ; } ;
The code using this library is free to write .
myApp.sayHello( ) ; // works var importedfn = myApp.sayHello ; importedfn ( ) ; // works
Compare this to the confusing message passing version which uses this .
var myApp = {} ; myApp.message = ' hello ' ; myApp.sayHello = function ( ) { alert ( this .
message ) ; } ;
The code using this library is free to write .
myApp.sayHello( ) // works because " this " refers to myApp object .
var importedfn = myApp.sayHello ; importedfn ( ) ; // error because " this " refers to global object .
The lesson to be learned here is that this should never refer to an object being used as a namespace because it leads to confusion about importing identifiers from that namespace .
This problem is one of the reasons that this makes my list of JavaScript Warning Words
( This also suggests that a library 's API properties should point to the same function so that these functions can be imported into other spaces .
This problem was pointed out in the comments of my Lazy Function Definition Pattern article .
The lazy function definiton can be used safely when hidden within a library and is not part of the API . )
Nested Object Namespacing
Nested object namespacing is another common practice which extends the idea of object namspacing .
You may have seen code like the following
YAHOO.util.Event.addListener(/*...*/)
Resolving the above line requires the interpreter to first find the global YAHOO object and then its util object and then its Event object and then find and call its addListener property .
This is way too much work each time an event handler is attached to a DOM element so the concept of importing is used .
( function ( ) { var yue = YAHOO.util .
Event ; yue.addListener (/*...*/) ; yue.addListener (/*...*/) ; } ) ( ) ;
If you know that the YAHOO.util .
Event.addListener function does not use the this keyword and always references the same function then the importing could be even more compact .
( function ( ) { var yuea = YAHOO.util.Event.addEventListener ; yuea (/*...*/) ; yuea (/*...*/) ; } ) ( ) ;
I think nested object namespacing is unnecessarily complex when the goal is simply avoiding identifier collisions .
Is Yahoo !
not confident that the global identifiers YAHOO_util_Event and YAHOO_util_Event_addEventListener are unique ?
I think the motivation for nested object namespacing is to have the appearance of the Java package naming convention which in Java is inexpensive .
For example , in Java you may see the following .
package mytools.text ; class TextComponent { /* ... */ }
A fully qualified reference to the class above would be mytools .
text .
TextComponent .
The following package naming description is in Learning Java by Niemeyer and Knudsen .
Package names are constructed hierarchically , using dot - separated naming convention .
Package - name components construct a unique path for the compiler and runtime systems to locate files ; however , they do n't create relationships between packages in any other way .
There is really no such think as a " subpackage " ; the package namespace is , in actuality , flat — not hierarchical .
Packages under a particular part of the package hierarchy are related only by convention .
For example , if we create another package called mytools .
text.poetry ( presumably for text classes specialized in some way to work with poetry ) , those classes wo n't be part of the mytools .
text package ; they wo n't have the access privileges of package members .
The illusion of nested namespaces in Perl exists also .
In Perl , the nested package names are separated by double colons .
You may see Perl code like the following .
package Red:: Blue ; our $ var = ' foo ' ;
A fully qualified reference to the above variable would be $ Red : : Blue : :var .
In Perl , like Java , the idea of a namespace hierarchy is only for the benefit of the programmer , not the language .
Programming Perl by Wall , Christiansen and Orwant explains
The double colon can be used to chain together identifiers in a package name : $ Red : : Blue : : var .
This means the $var belonging to the Red : : Blue package .
The Red :: Blue package has nothing to do with any Red or Blue packages that might happen to exist .
There is , a relationship between Red : : Blue and Red or Blue may have meaning to the person writing or using the program , but it means nothing to Perl .
( Well , other than the fact that , in the current implementation , the symbol table Red : : Blue happens to be stored in the symbol table Red .
But the Perl language makes no use of that directly . )
The parenthetical note at the end of the above quotation implies that Perl may have the same identifier resolution cost that using nested namespace objects in JavaScript has .
If the Perl implementation changes the cost could disappear .
In JavaScript , I believe that the cost of nested object namespacing will never go away because JavaScript uses late - binding .
I do n't think nested object namespacing in JavaScript provides any significant benefit but it is potentially very expensive at runtime if importing is not used .
A compromise
If pure prefix namespacing really is slow in some browsers , and the concept of nested namespaces helps keep things organized in the developer 's mind then I think the Yahoo !
example above could be written as either
YAHOO.util_Event_addListener
or with a few more globals ( but still not many for any give page )
YAHOO_util_Event.addListener
Namespacing in which dimension ?
Perl CPAN modules are namespaced based on what they do .
For example , I wrote a module in the namespace
JavaScript :: Minifier
If someone else writes his own module with the same name , and he unknowingly uses the CPAN module by the same name through some module dependency , then a collision occurs .
Java programmers takes the most verbose , but safest , approach , of course .
( Java programmers seem to think about code running in huge systems . )
In Java , packages are generally namespaced based on both who wrote it and what it does .
( A formalization of the myFunc style . )
The " who wrote it " part even uses a relatively guaranteed unique name that the developer " owns " .
If I wrote a Java minifier , it would use the following namespace since I own the michaux .ca domain name .
ca.michaux.javascript.minifier
In JavaScript , after the results of this discussion , this could be written more efficiently as
ca_michaux_javascript_minifier
Because JavaScript is served as text , this sort of namespacing seems too expensive by increasing download time .
Gzip compression finds common strings and replaces them with a small string .
If gzip is not available then importing could be used .
var ca_michaux_javascript_minifier = {} ; ( function ( ) { var cmjm = ca_michaux_javascript_minifier ; // refer to cmjm inside this module pattern } ) ( ) ;
I 'm not suggesting that these long namespaces are necessarily necessary but they are definitely the safest in avoiding namespace collisions .
Other Namespacing Issues
Identifiers are not only created in JavaScript source .
The name attribute of a form is added to the document .
forms object .
It makes sense to namespace these with < form name = " myCompany_login " > .
Namespacing class name attributes like < div class = " myCompany_story " > could be worthwhile also to reduce CSS namespace collisions and when JavaScript code is searching for DOM elements by class name .
Summary
Personally I think that anything like YAHOO.util .
Event.addListener , with dots or underscores , is overly paranoid of collisions .
It could have been just YUI .
on .
Dojo provides enough protection with dojo. connect for the same job because it covers the " who " and " what " dimensions of namespacing sufficiently .
No one in their right mind is going to come along and write a JavaScript library under the namespace dojo .
The Dojo developers will not forget they already have a connect function and write another one .
It might be good if we had a website where programmers could reserve their JavaScript globals identifiers , underscore prefixes and when ECMAScript 4 is released also their package names : " The JavaScript Namespace Registry " .
JavaScript is a powerful language with a minimal set of concepts .
Even though JavaScript does n't have language - level support specifically designed for avoiding namespace collisions , there are several ways to solve the problem .
There is no one " right " answer .
Pick the system you like best .
But please , whatever you do , just do n't put another global $ identifier out there !

comp.lang .javascript discussion on namespacing
Update August 9 , 2008
The Linux folks have a namespace registry : LANANA .
Die seit 2009 möglichen und stark umstrittenen Online - Durchsuchungen wurden bislang noch kein einziges Mal vom Bundeskriminalamt ( BKA ) eingesetzt .
Das bestätigte das Bundesinnenministerium nach einer Anfrage der Linken im Bundestag .
Nach der Novelle des BKA - Gesetzes im Jahr 2008 ist das BKA zwar berechtigt , Computer von Verdächtigen heimlich auszuspähen , jedoch ist die Maßnahme laut Ministeriumssprecher Stefan Paris als Ultima Ratio zu verstehen .
Das Gesetz ist also äußerstes Mittel zu verstehen , weswegen eine Durchsuchung zuvor von einem Richter per Beschluss angeordnet werden muss .
Bislang hätten Ermittler allerdings keine Veranlassung gehabt , auf die Online - Durchsuchungen zurückzugreifen .
Trotzdem bestehe die Möglichkeit , dass die Maßnahme gebraucht werde , weswegen die Rechtsgrundlage von Nöten ist , so Paris .
Jan Korte von den Linken bezeichnet die Online - Durchsuchungen stattdessen als „ völlig überflüssig “ .
Aufgrund dessen soll die Bundesregierung laut Korte die Maßnahme schnellstmöglich aus dem BKA - Gesetz streichen .
Die Kosten für die Online - Durchsuchungen liegen derzeit bei knapp 700.000 Euro , wovon 581.000 Euro für Personal aufgewendet wurden .

It has a sweet initial drop and a minimalist breakbeat vibe .

As staff at socialist daily newspaper , the Morning Star , prepare to go on strike this Sunday over pay and conditions , Ed Goddard from libcom.org caught up with one worker and found out about low pay and union busting in the name of " peace and socialism . "
1 . Can you tell us a little bit about the origins of the dispute ?
Back in October last year we got an offer of £ 1,000 for 2010 , which was probably the best in the industry in terms of percentage .
The problem was that this had been hitched to a three year deal , with increases for following years capped at 4 % .
That 's effectively a pay cut when RPI inflation is already at 5.3 % , and there 's very few trade unionists who'd be happy to sign away annual bargaining rights under those circumstances .
The headline £ 1,000 figure is also pretty misleading if you do n't know what it represents , which is catchup pay because we remain some of the lowest - paid people around for the kind of work we do - £ 19,000 as opposed to £ 24,500 which is the industry average ( and it ’s higher in London where we ’re based , around £ 26,000 ) .
We certainly are n't demanding that !
But the Star is actually a fairly complicated job even by normal standards .
Our industrial reporter for example has to know about the situation nationwide covering millions of working people on top of normal daily news writing , while our subs need a huge range of technical knowledge because they do n't have things like a picture desk , so they have to find their own pics , photoshop things themselves , deal with a really variable quality of work etc .
Some staffers at the paper who also do the occasional shift elsewhere reckon it 's usually an easy day compared to working here , even at the Guardian , because you 're not trying to do the job of three people !
So there does need to be some sort of encouragement to keep or hire high - quality staff even if they 're lefties , and we 've been asking for ages now about getting something extra for anti-social hours as a gesture towards alternative forms of compensation .
This should help put in context our initial suggestion , which was £ 1,500 over one year , plus discussions over compensation for anti-social working hours .
We were of course expecting to come down from that bargaining position and have repeatedly dropped it already ( I think it 's £ 1,000 plus some time in lieu for Sundays and bank hols atm ) .
However management only recently agreed to change their offer , just days before we were due to strike .
After initially telling us it would be £ 750 for one year instead , they said they simply would n't talk about anti-social hours , even though it would n't cost them anything financially .
Eight months down the line they ’ve finally shifted a bit on lieu time and suggested £ 900 plus a percentage rise next year as a two - year deal .
This incidentally is despite them having already paid our sister branch Unite ( covering admin , sales , that sort of thing ) the £ 1,000 , so we know they 've had the money for that as a one year deal all along .
2 . Do you have any idea of the pay that the Morning Star management are on ?
It 's about a £ 5,000 difference as far as I know , but I 'm not sure of the exact figures .
It was originally flat across the board I think but they wanted to " provide a career structure " to encourage people to stay longer .
Like treating their workforce with respect might , for example .
3 . What has been the level of participation from the workers in this dispute ?
What are the feelings of workers on the shopfloor about these issues ?
Depends on who you speak to , there 's a fairly hefty split into two camps with one being pro a three year deal and the other being anti .
All but two of the pro-deal group are publicly acknowledged Communist Party of Britain backers or members ( and one of those two is the daughter of a member ) , while the other side is made up mainly of left wingers from all kinds of different groups and theoretical backgrounds .
At the moment though there ’s a slim but solid majority in favour of fighting our corner .
4 . So where can you see these feelings going ?
Do you think there is a chance that this could result in staff taking strike action ?
We 've already been on strike , technically !
Having finally confirmed with the NUJ we had this really odd 10 minute mandatory chapel meeting in the meeting room , surrounded by memorabilia from the CPB 's hey - day , to initiate the strike period .
We 're due out for our first full day on June 20th .
To their credit , most people have already pledged not to cross the picket line regardless of their personal views .
5 . How have management responded to the organising activities of its staff ?
In ‘ regular ’ capitalist enterprises we often hear of management bullying in response to workers organising ; has it been any different at a newspaper dedicated to “ peace and socialism ” ?
Not really to be honest , most of the hallmarks are there , just in a different form .
They 're careful not to actively victimise people individually but as a group we 've come under constant pressure through a variety of different tactics and the atmosphere in the office has been horrendous – even worse than it was last year .
One of the more noticeable things has been the rising number of CPB members and sympathisers in staff roles as people have come and gone over the last while , and some of those have been brought in regardless of their skills base or the views of their immediate line managers .
With one , his name was included in an analysis we found of who'd vote which way in a strike ballot - before the job had even been advertised !
Such behaviour amounts to packing the branch with people who are prepared to take any offer going as long as the boss tells them its a good idea - union busting , in effect , even if the shell of the branch is left intact .
Related to this , we 've had huge problems because various CPB sympathisers and members in the branch have said they 're in favour of passing on our internal minutes to the chief management negotiator , editor Bill Benfield , on the grounds he's an NUJ member - an idea so absurd that even Bill excuses himself from meetings because he knows we would n't be able to wear it .
One of our members is currently under an investigation about this , so I ca n’t talk in full about it , but effectively their attitude means we can't have meetings in which people feel free to say their piece , because we do n't know what might be given over .
Beyond that there 's things like the " Rock and a Hard Place " document they 've been sending out , basically painting us as a bunch of crazed greedy paper - wreckers who are going to bring down the last left - wing paper in Britain .
It 's very similar tactics to those used in charities , where the workforce are told " how dare you ask for decent conditions when every penny goes to starving kids / puppies / blind people . "
It 's rubbish there and it's rubbish here , if you expect people to do a job then you have to pay them for it properly .
There 's also definitely been a concerted effort to spread around this idea that we 're being totally unreasonable to try and undermine us in the trade union movement , despite them being the ones who have repeatedly made no effort to compromise or even talk seriously about how to reach an amicable settlement .
At the People ’s Press Printing Society AGM meanwhile Bill officially branded us “ irresponsible adventurists ” to a crowd of hundreds of people – which gives you some indication of the attitudes we ’ve had to deal with .
This has come on top of a number of informal complaints being made about our chapel officers which are yet to be substantiated .
It 's very unpleasant for them being the subject of nasty rumours like that .
Most damaging though I think has been the constant threats of going into liquidation if we go on strike - the exact same thing BA has been threatening its staff with during their recent dispute and which we have criticised in the paper itself .
6 . Is n’t there a possibility that the Morning Star could go bankrupt as a result of the strike ?
Over a weekly Sunday strike ?
Unlikely and we 've been careful not to throw too heavy a body - blow at them .
However what we do know is that they 've been setting up for going into administration for months on the off - chance they can't beat us into submission .
If you have a look on the Companies House website you 'll find a company called Lextra Ltd , an " off the shelf " concern registered at Unity House ( the RMT headquarters - yes , we found that interesting as well ) on April 20th .
This company has apparently been incorporated to try and save assets in the event they close it down .
We 're not sure of the legalities of all this but it seems weird they 'd need a whole new company to do that - more usually you incorporate a limited company to , well , start or restart the selling of something .
If they were to restart the Star under a new company like that , it would amount to them using the absolute worst of the anti-trade union laws to break an independent trade union , which would be an astonishing fall from grace even for the CPB .
7 . Has there been much contact between the Morning Star and the trade union movement about this dispute ?
Interesting question .
If you define the Morning Star as its management and CPB backers , then yes , lots .
They 've been whinging about us for months to anyone who'll listen , sending out missives , collaring people at the various headquarters - we 've even heard from some sources that CPB members have been turning up to Trades Council meetings and conferences with a specific agenda of slagging the anti-deal side off .
However if you define the Morning Star as the shop - floor professionals who actually do most of the work in putting it out , then no , not really .
It 's notable that pretty much nobody from the top of the tree at the TUC has asked us our side of the story .
This interview is part of an attempt to rectify the problem , because to be honest we were unprepared for the sheer spite which would be thrown our way and we 're only just starting to get our running shoes on to counter it .
Reflections on a hijab - wearing Iranian feminist and how she touched my life
Each year the UC Berkeley - based Human Rights Center awards summer fellowships to students from University of California campuses , to enable them to work with human - rights organizations in the U.S. and abroad .
Several current Human Rights Fellows , including political - science student Rochelle Terman , have agreed to share their experiences this summer , with regular updates from the field to be published on the NewsCenter .
This is Terman 's final post for the summer .
Rochelle Terman
The daughter of a Muslim - Iranian mother and Jewish - American father , Rochelle Terman became interested in women 's rights in Iran while an undergraduate at the University of Chicago studying political science and Near Eastern studies .
During that time , Terman did a summer internship at Women Living Under Muslim Laws — an international solidarity network for women whose lives are shaped by laws and customs said to derive from Islam — and helped to found the Global Campaign to Stop Killing and Stoning Women ( SKSW ) .
Now a graduate student at Berkeley focusing on political science , Terman , 24 , will spend the summer researching and documenting success stories of local women 's organizations located in seven countries —
Afghanistan , Indonesia , Iran , Nigeria , Pakistan , Senegal and Sudan — as part of her continued work with SKSW .
In the summer of 2007 , I was an intern for Women Living Under Muslim Laws , working at its international - coordination office in London .
The organization has a network of thousands of people around the world working on human - rights issues , and staff in the office was often invited to events in town .
In June , the Council of Ex-Muslims , an advocacy group , was launching their U.K. chapter and we were invited to the kick - off event .
I had mixed feelings about the Council of Ex-Muslims , as they 're strong advocates of women 's human rights , but also exhibit anti-Muslim bias .
But I decided to accept the invitation , since many of the group 's founders are involved in Iranian women 's issues and I was working , at the time , on a report for WLUML on the contemporary Iranian women 's movement .
At the event , a number of the panelists talked about how the label " Muslim "
had been forced upon them — either because their families were Muslim or because they lived in Muslim - majority countries .
Many now considered themselves secular humanists , and told harrowing stories of the abuse they had suffered in the name of Islam .
The audience was filled with human - rights advocates , journalists , and friends of the panelists .
One individual , however , stood out — the only hijab - wearing woman in the audience .
She stood in the back , occasionally scribbling notes on her legal pad .
I was networking with some of the panelists when I overheard them talking about the hijabi woman in the audience .
Who was she ?
Why was she here ?
They were obviously skeptical .
Some assumed she was a Muslim opponent to the group , others hinted she might be a spy for the Iranian government or a fundamentalist group .
After most of the guests had dispersed , I was sitting alone on a bench — staring at my pocket - sized underground rail map , trying to figure out the best way to get back to the office .
The hijabi woman came up and asked if she could share the bench with me .
The first thing I noticed was her classic beauty , reminding me of Grace Kelly .
It made me jealous that she looked that good in a headscarf .
When I wear a hijab in Iran , I feel self - conscious .
Wrapped tightly around my head , the scarf can make my long , narrow face look like a Kosher hotdog poking out of an oversized bun .
The woman asked me where I was from and what I was doing in London .
She smiled when I mentioned Women Living Under Muslim Laws , said she had heard of them and respected their work .
Her smile was bright and enthusiastic , and as our conversation progressed , it only got bigger and bigger .
She said her name was Hengameh Shahidi and she was a journalist from Iran , studying at the School of Oriental and African Studies for her master 's degree .
She was involved in the Iranian women 's movement , she said .
Since I was trying to collect data for my research , I asked if I could interview her .
She responded enthusiastically , as if I was doing her an immense favor .
" Really ?!
Of course !
I would love to ! "
• • •
We arranged to meet a week later in Muswell Hill , a suburb of north London .
Having only been in town a few weeks , I got lost in the maze of double - decker buses and arrived 20 minutes late .
Hengameh did n't seem to mind ; in the coffee shop , she offered to buy me three different desserts .
Each time I declined politely but Hengameh persisted , refusing to take " no " for an answer .
( Among Iranians , the customary taarof form of manners requires that any offer be denied three times before one can finally truly accept ; Hengameh 's apparent pushiness was a way of being polite . )
Eventually I relented and started hungrily shoving the cakes into my mouth while Hengameh was speaking .
It was a rude thing to do , but Hengameh just smiled , delighted that I was enjoying my snack .
I was supposed to be interviewing her , but she kept asking about myself .
I confess that I kept thinking to myself " this woman must have a pretty mediocre career , " as I assumed anyone so interested in my life story must be pretty boring .
But Hengameh , it turned out , was n't boring at all .
She was a reputable journalist in Iran , writing for widely - read publications .
She conducted human - rights research for the President 's Office under Mohammad Khatami and the 6th Iranian Parliament .
She was a respected women 's rights activist and human rights defender .
But she was no revolutionary .
When I asked her how she saw her role , she replied that she saw herself as an Iranian woman , a Muslim woman , who wanted reform and a better life for her daughter .
" I have n't any role in the opposition , in the war against the government , in overthrowing the regime , " she said . …
" We believe we have to reform , without a revolution …
We just want to change the laws , to give the best lives for women in Iran . "
We talked for several hours — about Iran , about being a woman , about our families .
Hengameh opened up to me about her young daughter , her messy divorce in Iran , and her dreams of earning a PhD .
And when it was time to leave , she made me take home a pastry .
Hengameh and I saw each other a few times more that summer , usually for tea after I was done with work .
One time I brought my colleague Leila , another Iranian women 's rights defender .
Even though they had never met before , Leila and Hengameh hit it off right away ; as it turned out , they knew a lot of the same people back in Iran .
They laughed and chattered away in Persian while I desperately tried to keep up .
Eventually — exhausted from trying to think in two languages — I drifted off .
Every once in awhile Hengameh would turn to me , smile , and ask , " do you agree ? ' "
" Uh , sure ! " I 'd say , pretending to understand what they were talking about .
Hengameh just laughed , pinched me on the cheeks , and called me " khoshkelam , " " my cutie . "
• • •
I kept in touch with Hengameh over the next couple years , usually by Facebook .
I learned that she had returned to Iran for the 2009 presidential election , working as an adviser on women 's issues for Mehdi Karroubi 's campaign .
When I visited Iran , in the weeks leading up to the election , Hengameh urged me to come see her , sending her phone number via Facebook .
The next day , access to Facebook was blocked entirely by government censors and so I could n't access her number .
By the time the site was unblocked ( these back - and - forths were frequent in the pre-election excitement ) I was in another city , visiting family .
I left Iran without seeing Hengameh .
I wrote her a message : " Will you be back in London soon ?
I might be passing through this year .
Ca n't wait to catch up ! "
In the chaos following the Iranian election , I e-mailed Hengameh , along with other loved ones , to see if they were okay .
But e-mail and phone communication had broken down , and I did n't hear back from her .
• • •
A few weeks later , I learned that Hengameh had been arrested .
She was rounded up on June 30 , in the midst of post- election protests , and held for four months without charge .
In December 2009 she was sentenced to six years in prison for " gathering and colluding with intent to harm state security , " and one year for inciting " propaganda against the system . "
After a short stint free on bail , she was again arrested .
She is currently locked up in Evin prison , a notorious facility for political prisoners in Iran .
I thought of Hengameh often during that very chaotic time after the elections , especially when I read commentary dismissing the protesters as " anti-Islam , " " revolutionaries , " or " Western darlings . " I thought of Hengameh in the back of that room during that first meeting of the British Council of Ex-Muslims , the only " still - Muslim " present , smiling back at those who stared at her .
I thought of her daughter .
I thought of her pinching the cheeks of her interrogators .
From Iran , Hengameh wrote a letter saying she had been tortured and subjected to mock executions while in prison .
Her interrogators threatened to arrest members of her family .
She went on a hunger strike and was denied access to her lawyer or medical attention .
Her lawyer and fellow human - rights defender Mohammad Mostafaei , who has been arrested as well , disseminated the letter to news agencies .
There has been no news of her since .
On her Facebook page , friends write : " Everyday we remember you , " and " My dear Hengameh , the brave , the warrior . "
Some people used reports of her arrest and torture to demonize Iran and Muslims , linking it to terrorism and insurgency .
Others dismissed these reports as Western propaganda , linking her complaints to the war in Afghanistan and the occupation of Gaza .
• • •
As the summer draws to a close and I reflect on my internship with the SKSW Campaign , I am both inspired and worn down by the stories of women fighting for their rights in the face of cultural , religious , or traditional arguments that promote patriarchy .
Over the course of these last few months , I have thought long and hard about how to promote women 's rights without falling into racism , anti-Muslim bias , or paternalism .
Just the other day , I was reminded on how polarized this issue is : A man wrote to our campaign , asking why associations like ours do not spend the same amount of energy " to ask for the end of war in the Middle East , removal of NATO troops , support to end the siege of Gaza and Pelstine [ sic ] and threaten Iran with nuclear tactical missiles . "
He went on to claim that " positive as they may seem , protests like [ ours ] only diffuse the real violence of western culture , which is worse than that of Iran . "
As I think about this person and his concerns , I remember Hengameh and the time three years ago , over tea in London , that I asked her how she could defend women 's rights in such a politicized and polarized atmosphere .
How did she manage to continue working , without going crazy or giving up ?
She looked at me and said plainly , " Is what you 're doing good for women ?
That 's all you have to think about .
Is it a good change for women ? "

A TONDAR member in Iranian custody tells the State - run media his connection to the group originated through a U.S. - run media corporation .
Ali Motlaq , who is under arrest in Iran for “ planting bombs and orchestrating the assassination of top Iranian figures ” , was put in touch with the Los Angeles - based Royalist Association of Iran ( TONDAR ) through the U.S. State Department , he recently told Press TV :
In an exclusive interview with Press TV’s IRAN TODAY , he said he first got in touch with the group through Radio Farda — a Persian language radio station funded by the U.S. State Department .
TONDAR , a group represented by a former representative to the late - Shah of Iran ’s , public objective is to re-institute the Shah leadership in Iran — but hold elections for the post after whatever amount of time is necessary to ‘ re - educate ’ the Iranian people .
It is “ a terrorist group that has claimed responsibility for the attacks across Iran in the last 5 years ” , according to the Iran - government - run television station , which has “ killed and wounded hundreds ” :
In January 2010 , the group claimed responsibility for the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientist Masoud Ali-Mohammadi , who was killed by a remote - controlled bomb attached to a motorcycle outside his home in north Tehran .
The terrorist group had earlier claimed responsibility for the April 12 , 2008 bombing of a religious compound in the city of Shiraz , which left 14 people killed and more than 200 others wounded .
Mehdi Eslamian , a TONDAR member , was recently executed by the Iranian government for participating in the Shiraz bombing .
Mohsen Eslamian , his brother , was executed last year , but the group said in a statement , “ Similar to his brother , he was never a part of armed resistance . ”
On January 28 , two TONDAR members were hanged after confessing to “ obtaining explosives and planning to assassinate officials ” , Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi “ said at the time ” , the AFP reported in mid-May .
Mr. Dolatabadi linked Mehdi to the four members of the Party for Free Life in Kurdistan ( PJAK ) , hanged on the same day , Press TV reported .
This is significant , as Iran has been “ shelling ” the semi0autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan for almost two weeks now , killing at least one civilian — a 14 - year - old girl .
This is “ nothing new ” , Jason Ditz wrote yesterday at AntiWar News , as “ both Iran and Turkey have been launching salvos intermittently basically since the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq ” .
“ The attacks are aimed at Kurdish rebel groups that use the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan as a staging area , and generally have been shrugged off by the Iraqi national government and the U.S. occupation forces , ” he added .
Iran has “ begun constructing a small fort in Iraqi territory , suggesting they plan on staying for a while ” , as Asso Ahmed reported today at the Los Angeles Times , according to “ Kurdish officials ” .
Add this to the long - looming theory that the U.S. is fighting a proxy war with Iran in Iraq .
Past evidence has extended this war into the Islamic republic to depose the government via terrorist groups — notably , Jundallah and the Mujahedin-e Khalq ( M.E.K . ) .
Then again , this whole story could just be another case in the long list of belligerence by the Iranian government , with the latest threat to send ships to break the Gaza blockade .
Israel ’s ready to start World War III if it does and has recently prepared to station three nuclear - armed submarines off of the Iranian coastline — whether or not they ’re there yet , I ’m not aware .
On the other hand , this could be another case where Iran ’s belligerence is — yet again !
—easily baited into geopolitical pissing contests , as it is with economic sanctions against the Iranians due to pass the U.N. Security Council , tomorrow .
A Facebook group , claiming to be run by TONDAR , displays it as the type of group the U.S. typically wants to make efforts toward deposing the Iranian hard - liner regime .
It is secular , mutli- faceted and inclusive .
The page claims its members include : “ guerrilla fighters , news correspondents , legal activists , and thousands of active Iranians who say NO to the terrors of this Mullah regime ” .
The administrators and officers of the group are pretty savvy in 21st propaganda methods — with YouTube channels , syndicated broadcasts and surprisingly far - reaching access — when one considers the methods of its “ guerilla fighters ” .
Of course , a large reason for this is probably that — today ’s Press TV report notes — the U.S. government has not recognized TONDAR as a terrorist group , as it has not with Jundallah .
The M.E.K. is on the U.S. State Department ’s “ Foreign Terrorist Organizations ” list .
The group aims to “ rebuild ” Iran “ by using our great traditions in a modern way and getting help from new technology ” , TONDAR ’s English site claims .
Though , it dislikes being dubbed a monarchist group , it aims to re-institute the Shah — but with electoral political methods — and spokesman Forud Fuladwand “ worked with [ Reza Pahlavi , the former crown prince of Iran and eldest son of the late U.S. - puppeteered Shah of Iran , Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ] for twenty two years to help him to be the future Shah ” .
When I read this story on Press TV , it seemed like a ridiculous stretch .
It did n’t take much digging to begin bursting into laughter and wondering why the U.S. government would n’t back such a group , let alone aid it in recruiting .
You hold your iPhone a certain way and poof !
There goes your reception .
According to Apple Insider , the issue may not be hardware - related but rather a software quirk :
Readers report that Apple 's tech support forums originally confirmed that a iOS 4.0.1 software fix addressing the issue would ship early next week ( as early as Monday ) , before the comments were subsequently taken down along with all the other related discussion about the matter .
The fix is expected to address a issue in iOS 4 related to radio frequency calibration of the baseband .
Readers who saw the original forum discussions say that the issue is believed to occur when switching frequencies ; because the lag is allegedly not calibrated correctly , it results in the device reporting " no service " rather than switching to the frequency with the best signal to noise ratio .
iOS 4 introduced some enhancements to how the baseband selects which frequencies to use , so it makes sense that the error may have crept into those changes .
Additionally , this explains why iOS 4 has also caused similar problems for iPhone 3GS users .
I loathe those neat little summary headlines that purport to tell you why things sold off - -" Dow Drops 100 points on unemployment worries " and so forth -- as if the journalist surveyed all the millions of people who bought and sold stocks and found out why they did what they did .
So any attempt to fully explain this morning 's ugly market behavior in terms of one factor or another is bound to be deeply flawed .
I think what we can say is that the market is as nervous as a long - tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs .
And no wonder .
Greeks are rioting again , casting serious doubts on the viability of this austerity plan .
European leaders are still muttering about " wolfpacks " in the markets , which is usually the last refuge of desperate finance ministers taking unrealistic positions .
The euro has " relapsed " , falling back towards $ 1.20 .
Jobless claims in the US rose unexpectedly last week , dampening the sense of forward momentum in the economy .
Mortgage applications are down , which means the housing market may retreat from any tentative gains now that the tax credit has expired .
Financial reform is moving towards passage " with all the consistency and predictability of an old pickup with a busted clutch . "
And we seem to be hovering on the brink of deflation .
All of this raises the possibility of the dread " double dip " recession .
Worse , that recession was expected to come ( if it did ) when fiscal and monetary stimulus were withdrawn -- not when a peripheral member of the eurozone ran out of borrowed money .
The parallels to the Great Depression are not perfect . . . but they 're certainly uncomfortable .
And if we do double - dip now , there 's a good possibility that we 'll eventually triple - dip , because all that extra money does have to be mopped off at some point .
Which of these factors is driving the markets down so sharply ?
Frankly , any of them would be enough to trigger at least a little selloff .
At the moment , we seem to be in the middle of a highly imperfect
BP 's Quest for Time The Well from Hell ...
And What They 're Not Saying
The Dwarves dug too greedily and too deep .
You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad - dum ... shadow and flame .
— Saruman , The Lord of the Rings
There is something primordial about BP 's quest for oil in the Gulf of Mexico .
It 's an Icarus - like story of super - ambition ; of reaching too far , delving too deep .
I do n't know if you 've stopped to contemplate what BP was trying to do ...
The well itself started 5,000 feet below the surface .
That 's the depth of the Grand Canyon from the rim .
And then the company attempted to drill more than 30,000 feet below that — Mt. Everest would give 972 feet to spare .
Furthermore , the company sought oil in a dangerous area of the seabed .
It was unstable and many think BP sought it out because seismic data showed huge pools of methane gas — the very gas that blew the top off Deepwater Horizon and killed 11 people .
More than a year ago , geologists criticized Transocean for putting their exploratory rig directly over a massive underground reservoir of methane .
According to the New York Times , BP 's internal " documents show that in March , after several weeks of problems on the rig , BP was struggling with a loss of ' well control . '
And as far back as 11 months ago , it was concerned about the well casing and the blowout preventer . ”
The problem is that this methane , located deep in the bowels of the earth , is under tremendous pressure ...
Some speculate as much as 100,000 psi — far too much for current technology to contain .
The shutoff vales and safety measures were built for only 1,000 psi .
It was an accident waiting to happen ...
And there are many that say it could get worse — much worse .
Geologists are pointing to other fissures and cracks that are appearing on the ocean floor around the damaged wellhead .
According to CNN :
The University of South Florida recently discovered a second oil plume in the northeastern Gulf .
The first plume was found by Mississippi universities in early May .
And there have been other plumes discovered by submersibles ...
Some geologists say that BP 's arrogance has set off a series of events that may be irreversible .
There are some that think that BP has drilled into an deep - core oil volcano that cannot be stopped , regardless of the horizontal drills the company claims will stop the oil plume in August .
Need the Mudlogs
Geologist , Chris Landau , for instance , has called for a showing of the mudlogs .
A mudlog is a schematic cross sectional drawing of the lithology ( rock type ) of the well that has been bored .
So far , no one has seen them ...
BP keeps them hidden .
Mr. Landau claims :
It is a dangerous game drilling into high pressure oil and gas zones because you risk having a blowout if your mud weight is not heavy enough .
If you weight up your mud with barium sulfate to a very high level , you risk BLOWING OUT THE FORMATION .
What does that mean ?
It means you crack the rock deep underground ; as the mudweight is now denser than the rock , it escapes into the rock in the pore spaces and the fractures .
The well empties of mud .
If you have not hit high pressure oil or gas at this stage , you are lucky .
But if you have , the oil and gas come flying up the well and you have a blowout , because you have no mud in the well to suppress the oil and gas .
You shut down the well with the blowout preventer .
If you do not have a blowout preventer , you are in trouble as we have all seen and you can only hope that the oil and gas pressure will naturally fall off with time , otherwise you have to try and put a new blowout preventer in place with oil and gas coming out as you work .
Obviously , the oil and gas pressure has n't fallen off
In fact ... it 's increased .
The problem is that BP may not only have hit the mother of high - pressure wells , but there is also a vast amount of methane down there that could come exploding out like an underwater volcano .
I recently heard a recording of Richard Hoagland who was interviewed on Coast to Coast AM .
Mr. Hoagland has suggested that there are cracks in the ocean floor , and that pressure at the base of the wellhead is approximately 100,000 psi .
Furthermore , geologists believe there are another 4 - 5 cracks or fissions in the well .
Upon using a GPS and Depth finder system , experts have discovered a large gas bubble , 15 - 20 miles across and tens of feet high , under the ocean floor .
These bubbles are common .
Many believe they have caused the sinking of ships and planes in the Bermuda Triangle .
That said , a bubble this large — if able to escape from under the ocean floor through a crack — would cause a gas explosion that Mr. Hoagland likens to Mt. St. Helens ... only under water .
The BP well is 50 miles from Louisiana .
Its release would send a toxic cloud over populated areas .
The explosion would also sink any ships and oil structures in the vicinity and create a tsunami which would head toward Florida at 600 mph .
Now , many people have called Hoagland a fringe thinker and a conspiracy theorist .
And they may be right ...
But that does n't mean he is n't on to something .
EPA finds high concentrations of gases in the area
The escape of other poison gases associated with an underground methane bubble ( such as hydrogen sulfide , benzene , and methylene chloride ) have been found .
Last Thursday , the EPA measured hydrogen sulfide at 1,000 parts per billion — well above the normal 5 to 10 ppb .
Some benzene levels were measured near the Gulf of Mexico in the range of 3,000 – 4,000 ppb — up from the normal 0 - 4 ppb .
More speculation of doom
The Oil Drum , an industry sheet , recently ran an article about the sequence of events that tried to stop the oil spill .
The upshot of industry insiders was that after trying a number of ways to close off the leak , the well was compromised , creating other leaks due to the high pressure .
BP then cut the well open and tried to capture the oil .
In other words : BP shifted from stopping the gusher to opening it up and catching what oil it could .
The only reason sane oil men would do this is if they wanted to relieve pressure at the leak hidden down below the seabed ...
And that sort of leak — known as a “ down hole ” leak — is one of the most dangerous kind .
No stopping it
It means that BP can't stop if from above ; it can only relieve the pressure .
So , more oil is leaking out while BP hopes it can drill new wells before the current one completely erodes .
BP is in a race against time ...
It just wo n't admit this fact .
According to the Oil Drum :
There are abrasives still present , a swirling flow will create hot spots of wear and this erosion is relentless and will always be present until eventually it wears away enough material to break it 's way out .
It will slowly eat the bop away especially at the now pinched off riser head and it will flow more and more .
Perhaps BP can outrun or keep up with that out flow with various suckage methods for a period of time , but eventually the well will win that race , just how long that race will be ?
...
No one really knows ...
Which leads us back to Mr. Landau 's point about the mudlogs and why BP wo n't release them .
I do n't know ...
Maybe I 'm wearing my tinfoil hat too tight this morning ...
But this stuff seems possible — if it 's only a worst case scenario .
What strikes me as odd is the way the leadership of BP and the Obama administration is acting .
BP is running around apologizing to everyone they can find .
Obama says give us $ 20 billion in escrow and $ 100 million for the people Obama put out of work on the oil rigs due to his six month ban — and BP says , " Sure thing mate , no problem . "
And all of this in a 20 - minute meeting ?
I 've been dealing with oil companies for a long time and it just does n't add up ...
Contrast it , for instance , with the Exxon situation in Alaska or the Union Carbide disaster in India .
Exxon fought tooth and nail for its shareholders ; it appealed court rulings for 19 years .
Union Carbide was n't settled for 25 years .
BP is rolling over like a simpering dog .
Why ?
The only reason I can think of is that the company knows — better if not as well as the Obama administration does — that it will get worse .
Much worse .
I 've put together a list of oil cleanup stocks for the readers of my Crisis & Opportunity .
Many are running , and one has pulled back into a solid buy range .
Three more are on my buy list .
All I know is that this spill is n't even half over .
Oil in the Gulf will lead the news - cycle for the foreseeable future .
And the companies that make products that stop , absorb , or disperse oil have an endless supply of work .
I 've done the research , and found some companies that could profit cleaning up the spill .
You can learn about them in my investment letter , Crisis and Opportunity .

Kyrgyzstan 's interim government has given security forces shoot - to - kill powers in a bid to stop ethnic fighting which has taken nearly 80 lives .
It also declared a partial mobilisation of the army to combat " destructive forces and criminal elements " .
Thousands of ethnic
Uzbeks have been fleeing what they say are ethnic Kyrgyz gangs in the southern city of Osh .
Almost 1,000 people were also hurt in the worst unrest since President Kurmanbek Bakiyev 's overthrow in April .
Russia says it does not plan to intervene despite a Kyrgyz request .
And without international assistance there are fears the interim authorities in Kyrgyzstan may struggle to contain the conflict , the BBC's Rayhan Demytrie reports .
KYRGYZ - UZBEK TENSIONS
Kyrgyz make up nearly 70 % of the population , Uzbeks account for about 15 % and are concentrated in the Ferghana Valley in the south
Osh , the country 's second city , is home to a large ethnic Uzbek community
There has been tension in the south between the two ethnic groups over land and housing
In 1990 , hundreds were killed in Osh in clashes between Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks Eyewitness : ' The situation is worse today '
In pictures : Kyrgyzstan unrest
The south of Kyrgyzstan , an ex-Soviet Central Asian state of 5.5 million people , is home to an ethnic Uzbek minority of almost one million .
The latest violence has become the biggest challenge for the new government so far .
' Worse by the hour '
A decree from the interim government authorised security forces to shoot to kill in the Osh and Jalalabad regions .
Lethal force was permitted in areas placed under a state of emergency in order to defend civilians , in self - defence , and in the event of mass or armed attacks , the decree said .
Uzbek eyewitnesses told our correspondent at a border crossing with Uzbekistan that gangs of armed Kyrgyz had been marauding through neighbourhoods , killing residents and burning homes .
One woman pleaded for help : " We need food , we need water , I have got two sons and they are little and I need water and food to survive . "
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had received reports of tens of thousands people fleeing fighting and looting .
" Things are getting worse and worse by the hour , " said Severine Chappaz , deputy head of the ICRC 's mission in Kyrgyzstan , in a statement sent from Osh to the Associated Press news agency .
" The electricity and gas have been cut off , meaning there are also no water supplies .
Shops and markets are closed , leading to fears of a lack of food , especially in the hospitals and places of detention . "
There have also been reports of Kyrgyz casualties and violent clashes between the two ethnic groups have been continuing for two days .
' Out of control '
The interim Kyrgyz leader , Roza Otunbayeva , went on national TV to say she had sent a letter to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev asking him to send military help .
" The situation in the Osh region has spun out of control , " she told reporters .
" Attempts to establish a dialogue have failed , and fighting and rampages are continuing .
We need outside forces to quell confrontation . "
A spokeswoman for the Russian president said Moscow was not prepared to send troops under the current circumstances but would send humanitarian aid .
" It is an internal conflict and for now Russia does not see the conditions for taking part in its resolution , " Natalya Timakova said .
Mr Medvedev would consult with other members of the regional security grouping , the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation , about a response to the crisis , Ms Timakova added .
Russia has close ties to its fellow ex-Soviet republic and keeps several hundred service personnel at an air base it maintains there .
Mr Bakiyev fled with his family to Belarus after being ousted .
A move so smooth with regards to initiating sexual or pseudo - sexual congress with someone that it could only otherwise have happened in a heavily scripted
Person A : So I lean over to try and get her number and BAM , next thing I know we 're doing it in the back of my van .

Family of four die as giant sink hole swallows their house as they watched ice hockey on TV
The bodies of four members of a family who went missing after their house was swallowed by a gaping sink hole north - east of Montreal have been found , authorities said today .
The Prefontaine family was in their basement cheering on ice hockey team the Montreal Canadiens in their Stanley Cup play - off game against the Pittsburgh Penguins when the massive landslide struck on Monday night in the village of Saint - Jude .
Michael Dore , Quebec 's emergency management co-ordinator , said : ' After digging and going through the rubble we found the four victims .
[ caption ]
[ caption ]
' They were found very close to one another , some of them lying on the couch in the family room in the basement . '
The first body found belonged to father Richard Prefontaine .
The others were his wife Lynne Charbonneau and daughters Anais , nine , and Amelie , believed to be 11 .
The landslide tore a hole more than four times the size of a football field into Saint - Jude , a verdant village near Montreal .
Sink holes can occur when water undermines an area of land or when rock below the land surface shifts .
[ caption ]
This particular sink hole ate up three cars , one stretch of a concrete road and most of the house that once sat by a cliff over a tributary of the Yamaska River .
The landslide pulled down that cliff .
Rescue workers struggled for almost a full day - at times digging with their hands - to enter a home that was mostly buried in mud with only its green roof left peeking out .
Fire department spokesman Francois Gregoire said : ' It 's a pretty gigantic crater .
It 's hard imagining something like this .
It 's pretty impressive . '
The family 's lush green yard was transformed into an undulating mess of tangled trees , grass and clay blocks .
[ caption ]
Mayor Yves de Bellefeuille said the incident had the small village in shock , especially since the home is not in an area considered to be especially at risk .
The St. Lawrence and Ottawa valleys are laden with clay deposited in low coastal areas during the last Ice Age .
The clay is very sensitive and , if disturbed , it can lose its physical strength and liquefy , causing its slope to collapse and the land to slide .
Natural Resources Canada said clay earth - flows have caused 100 deaths in modern times , including the destruction of two Quebec towns - Notre - Dame - de - la - Salette in 1908 and St - Jean - Vianney in 1971 .
Following the lead of Arizona , the Buckeye State 's senatorial solons have passed a bill banning the creation of " human-animal hybrids . "
A press release from the Ohio Christian Alliance hails the proposed ban :
Ohio Christian Alliance President Chris
Long made the following statement , " For the past seven years , OCA has been working tirelessly with members of the Ohio Legislature to ban embryonic stem cell research , human cloning , and in recent years , animal - human hybrid .
Science has advanced to the point where DNA from animals and humans can be intermixed in scientific laboratory experimentation .
This is simply outrageous !
Animal - human hybrid research is currently being conducted in England , which many in the international medical community now consider to be a rogue medical state .
It is unknown how many U.S. laboratories are currently conducting similar research .
Among other activities , the Ohio bill would ban :
( a) A human embryo into which a nonhuman cell or a component of a nonhuman cell is introduced so that it is uncertain whether the human embryo is a member of the species homo sapiens ; ( b ) A hybrid human - animal embryo produced by fertilizing a human egg with a nonhuman sperm ; ( c ) A hybrid human - animal embryo produced by fertilizing a nonhuman egg with a human sperm ; ( d) An embryo produced by introducing a nonhuman nucleus into a human egg ; ( e ) An embryo produced by introducing a human nucleus into a nonhuman egg ; ( f ) An embryo containing at least haploid sets of chromosomes from both a human and a nonhuman life form ; ( g ) A nonhuman life form engineered with the intention of generating functional human gametes within the body of a nonhuman life form ; ( h) A nonhuman life form engineered such that it contains a human brain or a brain derived wholly from human neural tissues .
The Ohio bill would punish such " rogue " research by throwing perpetrators into jail for one year or imposing a fine of $ 250,000 or both .
As far as I know , only ( e ) and ( h ) have been attempted .
For example , in 2008 " rogue " British researchers introduced a human nucleus into a hollowed out cow egg and managed to get it to grow to the 32 cell stage .
The goal of the research is to create stem cells that might one day be used to figure out the genetic roots of illnesses and / or eventually to cure diseases by developing transplantable cells and tissues .
With regard to inducing human brain cells to grow in animals , researchers at Stanford University did this back in 2005 by injecting human embryonic stem cells into the brains of mouse fetuses .
The goal is to research the development of human brain diseases and create better models for testing drugs to cure such diseases .
The Ohio bill is very similar to a couple of bills introduced some years back by U.S. Sen.
Sam Brownback .
In two columns , " Brownback 's Chimerical Attempt to Curb Science " and " Senators Brownback and Landrieu Want to Outlaw Centaurs and Minotaurs , " I discuss some of the valuable research that would be derailed by such bans .
Now that I got your attention with the lead in photo .
I search google images for Elias Stein ( 1748 -1812 ) , the Dutch Chess Master who recommended 1… f4 as the best response to 1.d4 .
This picture came up in the first page of searches oddly enough .
No relation whatsoever to Mr. Stein … but it sure was different , no ?
Elias Stein was around during the days of Francois Philidor and probably frequented the Café de la Regence in Paris .
He wrote that “
If the opponent opens by pushing the queen ’s pawn two squares , you cannot do better than to push the king ’s bishop pawn two squares . ”
Other than 1..d5 , it ’s an alternative that immediate contests
White ’s quest to dominate both central squares .
I like the line that immediately plays 2.g3 but even the flexible 2.c4 can transpose .
After Black plays 2 … Nf6 3 . C4 brings us to the main line of all the major branches .
It ’s Black ’s third move that determines the course .
If he begins the finachetto with 3 … g6 it follows a Leningrad Dutch .
If 3…e6 is played we are going down the classical Dutch which unfolds into other realms ( like the Stonewall ) .
The reason I like the 2.g3 line is that with 1.. f5 , Black concedes his c8 - Bishop ’s best square to challenge the center .
White playing for immediate control of the long diagonal challenges the light squares .
Leningrad :
The critical Line so far : 1.d4 f5 2.g3 Nf6 3 . Bg2 and now 3 … g6 for Black enters the Leningrad Dutch .
Black plays a type of King ’s Indian with the f5 push .
The challenge is the weakness on e6 .
White actually has some flexibility with the fourth move .
4.c4 is theprinciple move but will sometimes hold off and develop the King ’s knight and castle first before bringing this pawn forward .
4 . Nh3 is a valid line with the intent of going to f4 blocking Black ’s f-pawn .
The general theme is to build pressure on e4 , nothing unusual in this d4 - games .
However , with the King side finachetto ,
White can really delay the e2 - e4 push and take his time to develop towards the Queen side .
Getting the Queen bishop on the other long diagonal is the best way to contest the Black pieces .
Classical :
With 3… e6 , again 4.c4 is the principle line but can delay it until after the Kingside is developed .
Though , playing 4.c4 is my choice as I would rather face the Stonewall variation ( 4…d4 ) with the option of exchanging cxd5 .
If Black plays 4… d6 we enter the main line of the Classical Dutch .
There are similar themes with building pressure for e4 .
In the classical line , White can play to gain space on the Queen side .
In the Stonewall , with 4… d5 5.cxd5 , this sets up similar themes of minority attacks for White .
With the pawn on f5 however , White has a little more of a hard time mustering up a king side attack as in the QGD - Exchange variation .
It just so happened that I was barely prepared to play this variation this past week at the club .
I lost due to a strategy error .
For some reason I was fearless and allowed my opponent to gain a nice outposted knight on c4 .
Blunder - Dutch Game :
I know , go ahead and beat me up …
I already did .
I did walk away with my class A player remarking that I played the strongest continuation to his variation of the Dutch that he decided he was not going to play it again at the Club because of it !
So there , even when I lose , I inflict some level of intimidation .
Go figure .
I ’ve been working on improving my strategy all week at chess.com using the mentor tools .
Good stuff .
Bring on the World :
I am hitting the road this week and heading to the World open .
If you are there look for me in the U1800 section .
This will be my year to win… right ?
( Everyone says that )
I just hope to have a strong performance and play some decent chess .
I am looking forward to this .
If you are there and in my section , be prepared and read my blog …
I want a good challenge or I will OWN you !
With economic output of about $ 17 billion , the Estonian economy is tiny .
Yet the country ’s central bank governor , Andres Lipstok , will now be able to take a seat on the European Central Bank ’s powerful council that sets interest rates .
Membership is also an important signpost that a country is on the way to achieving Western European standards of living , an important goal for a former Soviet republic like Estonia that has long been among the Baltic states eager to develop .
Perhaps most important , membership is recognition of the hard work and sacrifice it took to keep Estonia ’s bid on track .
Estonia , along with Sweden , were the two countries with the smallest shortfalls between revenue and spending among all members of the 27 - member European Union .
Moreover , public debt in Estonia at 7.2 percent of gross domestic product is tiny compared with that of most other countries in the bloc .
“ It ’s a great day for Estonia , ” Andrus Ansip , the Estonian prime minister , told Latvian state radio in an interview here .
“ We prefer to be inside , to join the club , to be among decision makers . ”
Estonia becomes the third ex-Communist state to make the switch to the euro , after Slovenia and Slovakia , but it is the first former Soviet republic to do so , sending a signal to other countries in Central and Eastern Europe that they , too , can aspire to membership .
That said , the euro zone is not expected to expand further for some time to come as other candidates like the Czech Republic , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Bulgaria , Romania and Poland still fall short of the entry criteria partly because of their large budget deficits .

And the accession of Estonia will do little to erase the chief criticism of the euro project : that Europe ’s nations are too economically disparate to maintain supranational institutions like a single currency in the long term .
Rafael Benitez has defended his record as Liverpool boss , insisting that they have progressed .
Reds boss insists he has not had the backing to compete
Ca n't compete
Rafael Benitez has defended his record since taking over as Liverpool boss , insisting that his side have progressed rather than fallen behind .
Benitez has been consistently linked with a move away from Merseyside , with Inter Milan reportedly lining him up as a replacement for his old rival Jose Mourinho , who looks likely to join Real Madrid this summer .
The 50 - year - old Spaniard took charge at Anfield in 2004 , winning the UEFA Champions League in his first season and the FA Cup one year later in what appeared to be the dawn of a successful era for the Reds .
However despite reaching another Champions League final in 2007 and coming close to winning the Premier League last season , this campaign Liverpool endured a miserable time , finishing seventh in the league and failing to qualify for Europe 's premier competition .
" There is this legend that Liverpool has n't won many trophies , that we have failed in that aspect , " Benitez told the " Well , Chelsea and Manchester United have won 10 trophies in the six years I 've been in Liverpool ; Arsenal , Spurs and Portsmouth one .
" Liverpool ?
Four trophies and we have played in three finals .
Liverpool have been competitive .
" Does Liverpool have to win the league , as everybody demands , every year ?
" The former Valencia boss also went on to state how his spending and dealing in the transfer market could not compare with the expenditure of United and Chelsea , who have been by far the most successful clubs in England since he took charge .
" Does the manager have absolute power in England ? " he questioned .
" No , it depends on a budget and on the executive director that negotiates the signings of players .
" And it depends on the money you have and the intelligence with which you operate in the market place .
" Look at the wages picked up by the players on Chelsea or Manchester United 's substitutes ' bench : ( John ) Obi Mikel , ( Michael ) Owen , ( Salomon ) Kalou , ( Dimitar ) Berbatov , ( Michael ) Carrick could be on £ 4 million a year !
" When Portsmouth offered Peter Crouch more money than we were paying him and promised him a starting place , it became very complicated for us to keep hold of him .
The arrival of Fernando Torres meant he could n't play as often at Liverpool . "
One of the main criticisms levelled at Benitez has been that he has had money to spend in the transfer market , however he countered this assumption stating that he had made money for the club rather than wasted it .
" Some people say I have spent £ 280 million , " he added .
" But we have spent £ 220 million on players and generated £ 160 million in player sales .
That is the equivalent of a £ 60 million net spend over six years : in other words , £ 10 million spent per year .
" Deduct from that figure the £ 120 million revenue from the Champions League success and qualification over that period , and we have in fact generated an additional £ 60 million benefits for the club . "

' At first I did n't know what to expect from this course and whether it would at all help me to improve my English pronunciation .
As I soon realized , the course opened my eyes to what certain words should sound like as opposed to what I thought they did .
After a few days I am now able to identify the words I struggle with and work on them in my own time .
I would certainly recommend it to anyone who aspires to improve their spoken English and British accent . '

A newspaper affiliated with Hezbollah accused a sixth - grade English teacher Wednesday of sympathizing with Israel because of an essay she used to teach her class .
The teacher , who works in the Christian Lebanese town of Ajaltoun , searched online for an essay on Earth Day , marked on April 22 , and lit upon a paragraph written by an Israeli student .
" My name is David Tagor , " the essay says .
" I am from Israel .
My country is small but very beautiful .
I live in Ashdod .
I am proud to live in Ashdod .
It is a big and modern city .
About 200,000 people live here .
" Ashdod is near the sea .
There is a big port in Ashdod .
It is very important .
There are many green parks and playgrounds for children .
My favorite place is the beach .
I am a pupil in the 6th grade .
The name of my school is ' Hazon Yaacov ' . "
The essay appears an innocent display of affection by a student for his home city , but the Lebanese Al - Akhbar was not sympathetic .
Wednesday 's report accused the teacher of presenting Ashdod as a legitimate city to her students by giving them a text that borders on propaganda .
The paper sent its conclusions to the school and its principal , Reverend Andrei Dahar , was asked to comment .
He accepted responsibility for the " unintentional infringement " , and said it appeared that information was made too easily available online .
The reverend vowed that it would not happen again , " especially with an enemy state such as Israel " .
He added that after questioning the students it appeared that they had " not been affected by the Israeli propaganda " .

The image above featuring the Great Globular Cluster in Hercules ( M13 ) was taken at the Deerlick Astronomy Village in Georgia .
This amazing mass of stars , one of many that surround the Milky Way , was first discovered by Edmond Halley in 1714 and cataloged by Charles Messier in 1764 .
An estimated 500,000 stars are clustered here within an area about 100 light years in diameter .
M13 is approximately 25,000 light years distant from us .
On clear summer nights , in a very dark sky , it 's possible to see it with the unaided eye .
The oblong blob at lower left is a much more distant spiral galaxy , NGC 6207 , some 30 million light years away .
Photo details :
Astro-Physics six inch refractor telescope ; Apogee U16M CCD camera with filters .
There 's over nine hours of total data for this image ; 22 red sub frames , 22 blue sub frames and 18 green sub frames , of 10 minutes each .
They were combined using CCDStack and Photoshop CS3 .
Data were collected data over a three night period , beginning April 28 , 2010 .
A friend of mine sent me something in the mail recently .
Attached to it was a post - it note that read simply , " These people scare me ! "
And given the fact that very few things seem to scare her , I was intrigued .
But by the time I was done reading , I myself was rather concerned as well .
What she had sent me was a fundraising pitch for a conservative Catholic organization by the name of Fidelis , which appears at face value to be the Catholic equivalent of the culture war crusaders of the evangelical movement .
And if you 've ever been unfortunate enough to be on the receiving end of conservative fundraising solicitations , you know exactly what this one was like , but I 'll paraphrase : the radical left led by Barack Obama is out to annihilate the influence of religion in public life and hates mom , apple pie , the American way of life , and puppies .
And we need some six million dollars in the next two weeks to save the puppies .
If you do n't do your duty you have failed Jesus .
And if you did n't do your part to chip in for theocracy in America , what would be the consequences ?
Why , the Freedom of Choice Act , which apparently would force doctors to perform abortions against their will .
And the horror of hate crimes legislation , which would supposedly criminalize criticism of homosexuality from the pulpit .
All of which would result in dogs and cats sleeping together , mass hysteria , and the concomitant end of Western civilization .
Now , the Christianist fervor in opposition to abortion is something that is abhorrent , but is at least comprehensible at an intellectual level .
After all -- if you start with the premise that life begins and conception and that abortion is therefore tantamount to murder , the fierce urgency that some feel towards ending reproductive rights in this country become clear -- provided that you can move past the intellectual dishonesty of the exemptions for rape or incest that somehow determine that one supposed human life is somehow less valuable than another .
The opposition to same - sex marriage , however , is just as fervent , despite seeming like a much less important problem .
While the prospect of two men or women being granted the same state - based legal rights as an opposite - sex couple may seem to pale in comparison to the hypothesized annual murder of millions , it seems to get at least equal billing .
Just last month , Pope Benedict XVI named both abortion and same - sex marriage among the greatest threats to civilization facing the world today .
No mention of climate change , worldwide hunger , global poverty , war , nuclear weapons , or any other issue mentioned in the Book of Matthew on which the Church may have a scriptural and moral obligation to take a more public stand .
This week has seen even more hard evidence of just how visceral to these people the denial of acceptance to the LGBT community really is .
On Wednesday came the embarrassing closing arguments of the defendant - intervenor in the Perry v. Schwarzenegger trial , in which the anti-equality lawyers sought to deny the unconstitutionality of a same - sex marriage ban through by claiming that the inability of a same - sex couple to reproduce biologically implied that denial of their rights was permissible .
And not content to deny rights to the LGBT community , there are major conferences , such as the Exodus International conference in Southern California next week , that are exclusively dedicated to converting gays back to the straight path and building the movement of " ex- gays " who have turned away from their allegedly sinful choice and suddenly discovered that , yes , they 're actually attracted to the other half of the population after all .
This is a large amount of emotional , temporal and monetary investment for what is just one of many sins .
The question , of course , is ... why ?
One possible answer to that might lie in that little theory of the so - called Demographic Winter :
And what is the concept of " demographic winter " ?
A right - wing notion with culturalist , if not racist , overtones regarding the end of first - world civilization because of declining birthrates .
There 's even a documentary about it , put out in part by the Ruth Institute 's christianist allies at the Family Research Council .
Righter - wing governments in Europe , such as that of Berlusconi's Italy , have offered economic incentives to the " right type of Italians " to conceive children -- and have notoriously taken them away when it was discovered that some of them were going to the wrong people - - namely , immigrant families .
But what does this have to do with people who supposedly were n't going to reproduce biologically anyway ?
A lot , actually .
The anti-gay movement has -- to its ever so slight credit -- changed tactics and beliefs recently .
As the LGBT community has gained more widespread acceptance and approval , especially among the young , the previously held doctrine that homosexuality is an evil , sinful choice that must be violently repressed or exorcised has had to yield to what is supposedly a kinder , gentler form of cure .
This newer approach favored by Exodus International and other groups dedicated to " curing " homosexuality is perhaps best exemplified by Richard Cohen , a leader in the movement , who expressed the new philosophy somewhat succinctly in an interview with UPI .
In short , the current belief is that homosexual attractions are not unnatural in and of themselves , but are also caused by emotional childhood trauma that may have occurred as the result of a broken home , parenting failures , or other emotional injury -- and that exploring and curing those emotional ailments will set a gay person straight again .
This may seem on its face like a mere mollification of the anti-gay stance of Christian conservatism -- but in so doing , it represents a fundamental shift in the nature of the relationship between the gay community and the conservative concern over the supposed decline in " traditional family values " as represented by increased divorce rates and other metrics .
In short where homosexuality has traditionally been viewed as a cause of family decline , it is now also a consequence .
And this opens up a world of intriguing implications .
As it is , Christian conservatism is very concerned about declining birthrates among Western ( i.e. , Christian ) women .
And here we get to the crux of the matter .
The legalization of gay marriage will end up resulting in the full acceptance of homosexuality as something that does not need a cure and is entitled to equal protection under the law .
As a consequence , more gays and lesbians who otherwise may have been shamed into attempting to be straight will " come out " and not have children -- leading to fewer births , which will result in further social problems that are now viewed as the cause of homosexuality .
This increase in homosexuality will then result in an autocatalytic positive reinforcement feedback cycle resulting in the death of civilization through an overabundance of gay .
I wish I were kidding , but I 'm not .
Some bigots who oppose gay marriage are so lacking for confidence in the attractions of the opposite sex that they think that society will wither if anything else is permitted .
And that 's a sad state of affairs .
Have you ever tried organizing your meetings , schedules or outings and you end up forgetting one or more of them .

The other way ( which I usually use ) is clicking on the day you want to create the event in , type then name then Edit event details >>.
In the event view window there are several things that can be done .
First setting the time of the event ( Whole day or a number of hours ) then if this event will be repeated ( Daily , Weekly , Monthly , etc. ) .

Weeks after a Silicon Valley county became the first in the nation to ban toys from McDonald ’s Happy Meals and other food promotions aimed at children , a public health watchdog group called on the fast food giant to remove the playthings from all its meal packages .
Citing toys aimed at promoting the latest “ Shrek ” movie , the Center for Science in the Public Interest said that the plastic promotions lure children into McDonald ’s restaurants where they are then likely to order food that is too high in calories , fat and salt .
The organization on Tuesday served the fast food giant with a letter expressing its intent to sue if toys are not removed .
The letter is legally required in several states , including California , before lawsuits can be brought under consumer protection statutes .
“ McDonald ’s is the stranger in the playground handing out candy to children , ” Stephen Gardner , litigation director for the advocacy group said in a statement .
“ McDonald ’s use of toys undercuts parental authority and exploits young children ’s developmental immaturity . ”
McDonald ’s disagreed strongly with that characterization , saying that its meals were “ right - sized for kids ” and that it offered healthful choices .
Toys , said spokesman William Whitman , are “ just one part of a fun , family experience at McDonald’s . ”
The chain ’s menu now includes the option of apple slices instead of French fries , he said .
And children can order milk or juice with their Happy Meals rather than soda .
Since the apple slices , called “ Apple Dippers ” by the company because they include a caramel sauce for dipping , were introduced in 2008 , customers have ordered them more than 100 million times in the U.S. , Whitman said .
In April , Santa Clara County supervisors won praise from nutrition advocates but ridicule from many conservatives when they voted to ban toy promotions from fast food meals sold in unincorporated parts of the county .
The supervisors gave fast food chains 90 days to voluntarily comply before the ordinance became effective .
Opponents of toys in fast food meals say the promotions are feeding the nation ’s obesity epidemic by making unhealthy food seem more desirable to children .
But the food industry says that healthier choices are now available to children — and urges parents to take responsibility for what their kids order .

So with this here entry I ’ve finally caught up to … how do I phrase this comprehensibly ?… “ things I was thinking about when I could n’t think of any comics ” maybe .
But , you protest , this is a comic !
( If you do not protest this you get to shut up . )
Yes , yes it is , but I did n’t want to lead off with it , because it ’s one of those comics that takes somebody else ’s comic and runs around with it in circles until it ’s good and droolly .
That ’s right , it looks familiar because it comes from this xkcd strip from a few months back .
When I read that one , I was like , well that is dumb , how ’s that guy supposed to care , and I had my first Nobody Scores installment written in quite some time .
NOT REALLY COMICS
Mostly I found xkcd readable during my comic allergy episode because it ’s hardly a comic , it feels like .
There are a couple of other projects that caught my eye during this time , neither of which are totally exactly comics .
The one is Hyperbole and A Half , a pretty popular blog written & liberally illustrated by a woman with a real knack for MS Paint stick figures .
I am not an art snob .
On the other hand some people are better at stick figures than others .
She ’s good .
The other is sort of a graphic blog called Firmuhment which uses scanned objects and handwritten entries to pretty solid expressive effect .
It ’s almost entirely abstract , artwise , but the backdrops do more for the project than , say , the photos behind A Softer World seem to contribute to that comic , somehow .
So it ’s worth a look .
YOU ASKED FOR IT AND BOY ARE YOU GONNA GET IT
Literally multiple people have asked me , “ where is your donation button ?
I want to donate ! ” and well , like my one true hero in this fallen world , I ’ll take any motherfucker ’s money if he giving it away , so I ’ve decided to oblige .
I ’ll set up a separate info page in a little while , but until then , this will be where you click to donate .
Get ready though , ‘ cause you know , this is Nobody Scores , where we do nothing half - assed except for comics :
( that ’s a PayPal donation button )
That ’s right , I have the power of Sarah McLachlan and sad puppies on my side .
Actually I ’d sort of rather set up donations to a group that ’s responding to Oil Catastrophe 2010 if that ’s possible , though honestly I ’m looking for something that ’s less in the form of “ cleanup crew ” and more along the lines of “ guerrilla organization ” at this point .
If I really have to , and I probably do , I ’ll settle for some sort of alternative - energy - fuck - you - oil - industry foundation , the further along the shoot - the - moon and fuck - you - oil - industry axes the better .
I ’ll try to look into this but ideas are totally welcome .
Big large comics are coming after this one .
Vietnam Day Committee : Attention All Military Personnel
The leaflet reprinted here was originally printed by the Berkeley Vietnam Day Committee in October , 1965 ; it was distributed in induction centers and on American military bases and sent to soldiers in Vietnam .
Its circulation among military personnel provoked a denunciation by civil and military authorities and threats of incrimination for treason .

Long - time readers of this blog will be well aware of my position on ACM and Open Access .
Although ACM is a non-profit organization which ostensibly has as its only mandate “ the advancement of computing as a science and a profession ” , the ACM Publications Board has been behaving like a rent - seeking publisher ; bullying students working to provide valuable resources to the community , and lobbying the US Government against Open Access initiatives , all in the name of protecting their revenue streams .
I have witnessed an outpouring of anger from the computing community at these events , convincing me that I am not alone in believing that the ACM Publications Board ( and by extension the ACM itself ) has tragically lost its way , prioritizing its income over the good of computing as a science and a profession .
In fighting Open Access they are on the wrong side of history ; witness all the leading academic institutions who have come out in favor of the very government Open Access initiative which the ACM has opposed .
If you believe as I do , then now is the chance to make a difference !
SIGGRAPH is holding elections now for three Director - at - Large positions , to be selected from five candidates ; the deadline for the elections is June 4th .
If you are an active SIGGRAPH member , you should have received instructions for voting by now ; you can vote at this link .
ACM is also holding general elections for various Council positions , including the President of the ACM ; you can vote at this link .
The deadline for the ACM General Council elections is May 24th .
For me , Open Access is the most important issue in these elections .
But which candidates will fight for Open Access , and which for the status quo ?
Of all the SIGGRAPH candidates , only one has explicitly mentioned Open Access in their position statement ( James O’Brien , as Eric pointed out in a recent post ) , and so far one of the ACM Council candidates have : Salil Vadhan ’s statment is here : http://www.acm.org/acmelections/candidate10.
To arm voting ACM and SIGGRAPH members with information on the candidates positions , I have composed some questions regarding ACM ’s copyright policy and Open Access , and put them up on a web page .
I have sent these questions to all the candidates for these elections ( except for the few which I have so far been unable to contact ) , and am posting the answers on the web page as they come in .
So far only two candidates for the SIGGRAPH election have answered ; Mashhuda Glencross and James O’Brien .
Both answers are Open - Access friendly .
No candidates for the ACM Council have come forward yet .
Keep following the questions web page , and make sure to use the information there to select candidates , and vote in both elections .
Nothing will ever change unless we make our voices heard !
A Perth woman involved in the murder of her abusive father has been told she must be jailed for life to demonstrate it is unacceptable for members of the community to engage in vigilante justice .
Christine Wong was found guilty of the murder of her 62 - year - old father John Wong at the Mission to Seafarers in Bunbury in June 2008 .
Her father had previously been convicted of sexually abusing her as a child .
Wong did not strike the blow that killed her father , but the court heard she did nothing to prevent the murder and stabbed him in the hand as he was dying .
Wong 's accomplice , Dennis Tony Burns , previously admitted his involvement in the murder and has been jailed for life with a minimum of 11 years .
In sentencing Wong , Justice John McKechnie says it was clear her father 's abuse had an irrevocable impact on her life , but that was no excuse for her to take matters into her own hands .
She was jailed for life with a minimum of 10 years .
President Barack Obama pretty much stated the obvious when he called the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico “ a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster . ”
The oil well pouring a river of crude into the Gulf of Mexico did n't have the normal type of remote - control shut - off switch used in Norway and the UK as last - resort protection against underwater spills , largely because the oil companies themselves are responsible for " voluntary " compliance with safety and environmental standards .

Bush was doing the same thing in Texas , a program pushed hard in the previous administration by Dan Quayle 's so - called " competitiveness council " charged with deregulating industry .
The accident has led to one of the largest ever oil spills in U.S. water and the loss of 11 lives .
Voluntary safety for oil wells , but you and I can get stopped by the police if we do n't fasten our safety belts ?
Eleven people have died because Halliburton and BP wanted to save money .
In the first hundred years of this republic it was commonplace for rogue corporations to get the corporate death penalty - being shut down , dissolved , and having their assets sold off .
Through the 19th century , it averaged around 2000 companies a year that got the axe .
If the Supreme Court now says that corporations are people - and they did - then these corporations should be eligible for the corporate death penalty .
Time to break up and sell off the pieces of Halliburton and British Petroleum .

Our Milky
Way churns out about seven new stars per year on average .
More massive stars are formed in what ’s called H II regions , so - named because the gas present in these stellar nurseries is ionized by the radiation of the young , massive stars forming there .
Recently - discovered regions in the Milky Way that are nurseries for massive stars may hold important clues as to the chemical composition and structural makeup of our galaxy .
Thomas Bania , of Boston University , said in an NRAO press release , “ We can clearly relate the locations of these star - forming sites to the overall structure of the Galaxy .
Further studies will allow us to better understand the process of star formation and to compare the chemical composition of such sites at widely different distances from the Galaxy ’s center . ”
The announcement of these newly discovered regions was made in a presentation today at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Miami , Florida .
The team of astronomers that collaborated on the search includes Thomas Bania of Boston University , Loren Anderson of the Astrophysical Laboratory of Marseille in France , Dana Balser of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory ( NRAO ) , and Robert Rood of the University of Virginia .
H II regions that you may be familiar with include the Orion Nebula ( M42 ) , visible just South of Orion ’s Belt with the naked eye , and the Horsehead Nebula , so famously imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope .
For more information on other known regions ( and lots of pictures ) , visit the 2 Micron All - Sky Survey at IPAC .
By studying such regions in other galaxies , and our own , the chemical composition and distribution of a galaxy can be determined .
H II regions form out of giant molecular clouds of hydrogen , and remain stable until a collision happens between two clouds , creating a shockwave , or the resulting shockwave from a nearby supernova collapses some of the gas to form stars .
As these stars form and start to shine , their radiation strips the molecular hydrogen of its electrons .
The astronomers used both infrared and radio telescopes to see through the thick dust and gas that pervades the Milky Way .
By combing surveys taken by the Spitzer Space Telescope ’s infrared camera , and the Very Large Array ( VLA ) radio telescope , they identified “ hot spots ” that would be good candidates for H II regions .
To further verify their findings , they used the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope ( GBT ) , a sensitive radio telescope that allowed them to detect radio frequencies emitted by electrons as they rejoined protons to form hydrogen .
This process of recombination to form hydrogen is a telltale sign of regions that contain ionized hydrogen , or H II .
The location of the regions is concentrated near the ends of the central bar of the Milky Way , and in its spiral arms .
Over 25 of the regions discovered were further from the center of the galaxy than our own Sun – a more detailed study of these outlying regions could give astronomers a better understanding of the evolution and composition of our Milky Way .
“ There is evidence that the abundance of heavy elements changes with increasing distance from the Galactic center , ” Bania said .
“ We now have many more objects to study and improve our understanding of this effect . ”

The tiny islands of the Pacific Ocean appear to be the very the picture of climate change vulnerability — some rise such a short distance above current sea level that it seems like any rise would swallow them up .
The Earth 's climate system , though , is a great deal more complex than the simplistic rhetoric that fills the political echo chamber .
That 's demonstrated again in a new study that argues some the Pacific 's low - lying islands are actually increasing slightly in land area rather than decreasing .
It 's good news , yes — but not without caveats .
First , the specifics .
Arthur Webb and Paul Kench published their work , based on decades of aerial and satellite photos , in the journal Global and Planetary Change .
During the years spanned by those images , the sea level in the area has been rising by about 2 millimeters per year .
Nevertheless , they say that 23 of the 27 Pacific islands they studies either held firm in land area or saw a slight increase .
How could this be ?
Unlike the sandbars of the eastern US coast , low - lying Pacific islands are made of coral debris .
This is eroded from the reefs that typically circle the islands and pushed up onto the islands by winds , waves and currents .
Because the corals are alive , they provide a continuous supply of material .
" Atolls are composed of once - living material , " says Webb , " so you have a continual growth . "
Causeways and other structures linking islands can boost growth by trapping sediment that would otherwise get lost to the ocean [ New Scientist ] .
For the people of places like Kiribati
, Tuvalu , and the Federated States of Micronesia , who fear the rising seas will swallow up their homes , the idea that these islands might have some kind of resistance to sea level rise is certainly a reprieve .
Says Kench :
" We have now got the evidence to suggest that the physical foundation of these countries will still be there in 100 years , so they perhaps do not need to flee their country " [ BBC News ] .
But even if Webb and Kench are right , it would n't put the islands out danger in the longer term .
As Kench notes , just having an island is n't enough :
" An important question is -- if islands still exist , will they still be able to carry human communities ? " [ AFP ] .
This study measures only total land area .
It does n't consider the nature of that land , nor the effects of a shape - shifting island on the people who actually live there .
Even on islands where the total land mass is stable or grows , one area may be eroded while another is being added to .
It 's not possible to simply move people living in highly urbanised areas to new land , says Naomi Biribo of the University of Wollongong in New South Wales , Australia [ New Scientist ] .
Furthermore , it 's not known whether that influx of coral sediment that recharges the islands with material could keep up if sea level rise accelerated past its current pace .
And the coral reefs themselves that supply this material are n't in the best of shape , either — marine scientists worry that they wo n't be able to cope with the increasing acidification of the ocean
, which is another effect of rising carbon dioxide levels .

June 30 , 2010  --
After Enron disintegrated in 2001 amidst brazen balance sheet chicanery , high - level heads rolled .
Former CEO Jeff Skilling went to jail .
Ken Lay , another Enron chief , was found guilty of fraud but died before sentencing .
Later in the decade , other unscrupulous executives ended up behind bars , among them former WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers and former Tyco CEO Dennis Kozlowski .
These convictions were part of a difficult process of restoring a shattered public confidence in the American economic system .
But it has now been two years since Wall Street helped cause a financial collapse – one which sparked a grueling recession and cost taxpayers more than $ 1 trillion – and only one trophy scalp , that of Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff , has been obtained by authorities .
Several major financial industry targets have wriggled free without ever being charged , while some others were tried and went free .
' As Long as it Takes '
However , for Americans still craving accountability from the most mischievous masters of the universe , the Federal Bureau of Investigation has a message : Stay tuned .
That 's because a special category of FBI cases connected to the epic subprime meltdown – and involving high - level Wall Street executives – remains the Bureau 's highest priority , according to Peter Grupe , the assistant special agent in charge of white collar crime for the FBI 's New York field office .
" We have a large number of active [ subprime ] cases which are being aggressively investigated , " Grupe said .
" These are complex , long - term , and resource intensive , but we will continue to pursue them for as long as it takes . "
In an exclusive interview with ABCNews.com , Grupe underscored the FBI 's commitment to Wall Street criminal probes .
He pointed to unprecedented and extensive resources being deployed .
He said new agents from financial and accounting backgrounds have been specifically recruited for the effort .
Thin Cases So Far
Grupe declined to say exactly how many Wall Street cases are currently being pursued .
However , testifying last month before a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs , Lanny Breuer , Assistant U.S. Attorney General , said that the FBI has 2,200 pending corporate and securities - fraud investigations across the country .
Nevertheless , there are numerous people , including some industry members eager to fully restore confidence in the financial system , who wonder , understandably , what 's taking so long .
" I would have expected thousands of indictments by now , " said Janet Tavakoli , president of Chicago - based Tavakoli Structured Finance .
She pointed out that after the savings - and - loan crisis two decades ago there were 1,100 indictments .
The biggest fish to fry were junk bond king Michael Milken and merger arbitrageur Ivan Boesky , said to be the inspiration for Michael Douglas 's Gordon Gekko character in the movie " Wall Street . "
" All we 've seen thus far are thin cases that seem to rely on emails , " Tavakoli said .
" Yes these cases take a long time but it 's been nearly two years . "
The first two people charged after the 2008 financial crisis , Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin of Bear Stearns , were ultimately found not guilty , despite the uncovering of a series of incriminating e-mails that seemed to suggest they were knowingly peddling hedge funds that were doomed .
A case involving mortgage derivatives and the biggest fish on the Street , Goldman Sachs , so far has only merited a civil charge filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
A criminal investigation is said to be ongoing , according to several media reports .
One of the biggest single episodes of financial chaos , the implosion of AIG , produced a memorable villain , Joseph Cassano , who headed up the unit that engaged in the risky derivatives activities that led to the insurer 's downfall .
But Cassano's lawyers were recently notified that the Justice Department had closed its file on him .
Grupe said he could not talk about specific cases .
Landmark Wiretap Use
However , the Feds have not exactly been idling while a nation simmers .
The U.S. Department of Justice announced the formation of a Financial Fraud Task Force last November .
Not long after that , it revealed a sweeping insider trading case involving a major hedge fund , Galleon Group .
The case is still ongoing and could ultimately produce the kind of message - sending convictions Wall Street usually gets after a period of excess ( and then forgets ) .
The Galleon case has been described by the Justice Department as the biggest hedge fund insider trading case in history , and the first insider trading probe to involve extensive use of wiretaps .
Accused mastermind Raj Rajaratnam has pleaded not guilty .
Of the 22 defendants charged in connection with this case , half have already pleaded guilty .
Complex cases like the one against Galleon take time – but as the two - year anniversary of the financial crisis draws near , pundits and members of the public will demand that someone besides Madoff be held accountable .
The FBI 's Grupe pointed to at least one successful , if not high - profile , conviction that he felt should have gotten more attention .
The case involved a Credit Suisse bond salesman named Eric Butler who misrepresented some auction rate securities positioned as safe , backed by guaranteed student loans , but which were in reality laced with risky mortgage - backed derivatives .
Butler was found guilty at trial last summer and earlier this year was sentenced to five years in prison .
More resources will continue to be used to go after Wall Street wrongdoing , Grupe said .
The Justice Department 's Breuer , meanwhile , told lawmakers last month that resources are being added to address mortgage fraud and related financial crimes .
In 2009 , U.S. Attorney 's Offices received money for 59 new prosecutors and 17 support positions for this effort .
The department 's budget for 2010 contains additional fraud enforcement resources , including five additional criminal division prosecutors and 35 U.S. Attorney 's Office positions .
And , in the projected 2011 budget , the department has asked for five fraud positions in the criminal division and 109 fraud positions in the various U.S. Attorneys '
Offices .
Could identifying criminals be as easy as holding up an iPhone , snapping a quick pic , and waiting for results ?
It sounds like a cross between a science - fiction fantasy and a silly joke , but the concept is no laughing matter for officers in the gang unit over in Brockton , Massachusetts .
Could identifying criminals be as easy as holding up an iPhone , snapping a quick pic , and waiting for results ?
It sounds like a cross between a science - fiction fantasy and a silly joke , but the concept is no laughing matter for officers in the gang unit over in Brockton , Massachusetts .
The city 's officers are currently testing a new biometric scanning program -- really , an iPhone app - - that allows them to use Apple 's handheld devices to snap a quick picture of a person 's face .
The photo is then sent over to a secure network for processing and , if the facial characteristics of a subject give him or her away , the person 's identity , photo , and background information are sent back to the officer 's iPhone .
If successful , the pilot program - - dubbed MORIS , or Mobile Offender Recognition and Identification System - - will expand to 28 different Massachusetts police departments and 14 sheriff 's departments .
While the app can only identify people based on a full facial shot right now , the developer BIT Technologies is looking to throw in iris and fingerprint scanning at some point down the line .
" The need and demand for the capability provided by MORIS is overwhelming , " said BI2 Technologies CEO Sean Mullin in an interview with the Daily Mail .
" It is not an overstatement to say that this may be the most significant technological advance for law enforcement since the introduction of radios .
It 's that significant . "
BI2 Technologies worked with Animetrics , a New Hampshire - based company , to give the app the ability to transform a 2D image into a three - dimensional face .
This increases the analytical power of the application and corresponding database to make matches , but it does n't come cheap .
According to the Patriot Ledger , the combination of iPhone and software costs roughly $ 3,000 per .
And , no , there 's no indication that you 'll be able to find a free version of MORIS on the App Store anytime soon .
The glue that binds a human society together is trust .
But people who trust others too much are likely to get taken for a ride .
Both trust and distrust , it now seems , are influenced by hormones that can induce people to ratchet their feeling of trust up or down .
The trust side of the equation is mediated by a brain hormone known as oxytocin .
A soft touch or caress will send a pulse of oxytocin into a person ’s bloodstream .
Swiss researchers found in 2005 that a squirt of oxytocin would make players in an investment game more willing to hand over their money to strangers .
It may seem strange that there is a hormonal influence in such a delicate calculation as to whether or not to trust someone .
But perhaps trust is so important to a society ’s survival that natural selection has generated a hormonal basis for it .
In any event , trust has a downside — one may hand over too much money to a Mr. Madoff who promises to generate steady returns in both up and down markets .
There needs to be an antidote to oxytocin that makes a person keep those warm , fuzzy feelings suppressed in the appropriate circumstances .
I gave myriad reasons in Bailout Nation for being strongly opposed to bank bailouts .
One of the most compelling factors was the horrific impact past bailouts have had on other competitors in the sector .
Bailouts rewarded the worst managements , the least deserving shareholders , and the most reckless creditors .
( That ’s not how capitalism is supposed to work ) .
As it turns out , the banking sector is no different than these other industries that have been bailed out .
After the government ’s largesse , bad companies do well — and at the expense of the well managed , responsible , non-reckless firms .
Forbe ’s Bob Lenzner shows us exactly how warped the bailed out banking sector has become : Bob notes that Six giant banks made $ 51 billion in profits last year , while the rest of the banking industry — the other 980 banking institutions — all lost money .
That is simply astonishing .
As the table below shows , the other 980 that lost money ( in the aggregate ) — thats a heckuva data point .

Last week , the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers ( ASCAP ) sent a fundraising letter to its members calling on them to fight “ opponents ” such as Creative Commons , falsely claiming that we work to undermine copyright .*
Creative Commons licenses are copyright licenses – plain and simple .
Period .
CC licenses are legal tools that creators can use to offer certain usage rights to the public , while reserving other rights .
Without copyright , these tools do n’t work .
Artists and record labels that want to make their music available to the public for certain uses , like noncommercial sharing or remixing , should consider using CC licenses .
Artists and labels that want to reserve all of their copyright rights should absolutely not use CC licenses .
Many musicians , including acts like Nine Inch Nails , Beastie Boys , Youssou N’Dour , Tone , Curt Smith , David Byrne , Radiohead , Yunyu , Kristin Hersh , and Snoop Dogg , have used Creative Commons licenses to share with the public .
These musicians are n’t looking to stop making money from their music .
In fact , many of the artists who use CC licenses are also members of collecting societies , including ASCAP .
That ’s how we first heard about this smear campaign – many musicians that support Creative Commons received the email and forwarded it to us .
Some of them even included a donation to Creative Commons .
If you are similarly angered by ASCAP ’s deceptive tactics , I ’m hoping that you can help us by donating to Creative Commons – and sending a message – at this critical time .
We do n’t have lobbyists on the payroll , but with your support we can continue working hard on behalf of creators and consumers alike .
Sincerely ,

This week saw the rise to incredible fame of a 12 - year - old boy who posted videos of himself singing and playing the piano on his own YouTube channel .
He also included one which saw him cover Lady Gaga ’s “ Paparazzi ” at a school play and which now counts over 14 million hits , literally making of him the hottest commodity there is .
As such , it ’s no wonder a record label has already jumped at the chance of signing him .
As of now , nothing has yet been confirmed officially but , according to CrazedHits , citing inside sources who cannot reveal their identity in the press , Greyson Michael Chance is already a recording artist , in the sense that he ’s been signed to a label .
Before anyone else had the chance to approach him with an offer for a deal , Interscope jumped at the chance and , as the saying goes , made him an offer he could not refuse .
Details of said deal are yet unknown though , if the report is accurate , more on it should surface in the following days .
“ According to our sources , Interscope Records have signed 12 - year old Greyson Chance , who has attracted over 13 million views on YouTube with his cover of Lady Gaga ’s ‘ Paparazzi . ’
Our sources tell us that Interscope closed the deal before any other label could even step in and meet the kid , ” the aforementioned music - oriented e-zine writes .
If true , this would mean Greyson will soon release an album or even come out sooner with a single , so that the label capitalizes on his instant boost in popularity to the maximum , it is being said .
Also this week , only a day after he became the talk of the town and a YouTube VIP ( of sorts ) in terms of number of views per hour , Greyson was also invited on Ellen DeGeneres .
Here , the 12 - year - old 6th grader talked about how he received 3 years in piano lessons but literally no vocal training , which is truly an incredible thing given his deep and strong voice .
He also revealed he sometimes wrote his own music , and that he already had two songs of his own : one about death and one about heartbreak .
Speaking of which , Greyson also said that , since his rise to international fame , he ’d started to get more attention from girls .
This is when Lady Gaga herself personally called in on the show to congratulate him for his amazing achievement and to tell him to continue pursuing his dreams – and a word of advice : forget about girls if you want to make it big , she said .
HUDSON --
They were two shy and awkward boys , best friends since kindergarten .
They lived a mile apart , rode the same school bus and tried to hide their budding sexual orientation , even from each other .
They took refuge in hanging out together and giving free rein to their quirky personalities .
When one of them " came out " as gay in eighth grade , it gave his friend the resolve to embrace his own homosexuality .
The second boy came out to friends in ninth grade , but did n't tell his family until the following year .
On June 5 , what began as a lark turned into a celebration of their courage to attend high school as openly gay young men .
Seniors Charlie Ferrusi and Timmy Howard were crowned Hudson High School 's prom king and queen in an open vote of their classmates .
" It was so cool when they called our names .
Kids were screaming and cheering for us , " recalled Ferrusi .
" I gave Timmy the biggest hug ever .
I was shaking with excitement .
People were taking our picture .
Everyone was going crazy . "
" It was wonderful and totally surprising , " said Howard .
" It started as a kind of joke among our classmates .
Instead of electing the typical king and queen , they voted for me and Charlie , these two gay guys . "
The king and queen are best friends , but not a couple .
Howard attended the prom with Sarah Cukerstein , a friend , and Ferrusi with his boyfriend , Ryan McDermott , a junior at Ichabod Crane High School , who , incidentally , was voted king at his prom recently .
The unorthodox victory for Ferrusi and Howard may have broken ground as the first openly gay high school students to be elected prom king and queen .
In some parts of the country , school administrators have scuttled votes electing openly gay and lesbian students to head their homecoming or prom courts .
Hudson High School was in the news two years ago when an openly gay senior , Augie Abatecola , lost the vote for prom queen by two votes in a disputed election .
Some seniors walked out of the prom in protest .
School officials insisted Abatecola had lost fair and square .
This time , Ferrusi and Howard won by such a wide margin that principal Steven Spicer and Superintendent John Howe could only salute the outcome .
They also had more time to prepare since Ferrusi and Howard went through proper channels and announced their intentions beforehand while Abatecola 's impromptu vote caught officials off - guard .
" The principal and I are in full support of the outcome of the prom vote , " Howe said .
" The students had a great time and they selected the prom king and queen they wanted .
We are a diverse student body and we celebrate our diversity . "
Their dual win touched off a small wave of media attention locally and on Huffington Post , Fox News and other national outlets .
Ferrusi and Howard were promptly named grand marshals for the first - ever Hudson Pride Parade on June 20 .
The inaugural event celebrates a large gay community in the river town that has become a haven for New York City weekenders who have gentrified downtown with antique shops , art galleries and boutique restaurants .
" We 're so proud of Charlie and Timmy and the fact that their school elected them , " said Victor Mendolia , an organizer of the Hudson Pride parade .
" We never expected this .
It 's been great , " said Ferrusi , who is senior class secretary , a member of the mock trial and robotics teams and a varsity cheerleader .
In the fall , he 'll major in nutrition education at State University of New York at Plattsburgh , which his older brother , Elliot , also attends .
Their younger brother , Avery , is a sophomore and three - sport athlete at Hudson High .
Elliot competes in bobsledding and winter sports in Lake Placid .
" My brothers are both really straight , but they 've been extremely supportive and so have my parents , " Ferrusi said .
Some kids picked on Howard when he first came out , but his senior classmates and his parents have been supportive .
Howard , who helped found a Save a Life , Save the World group at Hudson High , will attend the College of Saint Rose in the fall .
He plans to major in biology and hopes to work in environmental protection .
Despite a few complaints about the outcome of the prom vote and some hateful comments posted on Ferrusi's Facebook page , senior Molly Koweek considers such criticism sour grapes .
" The reason why they won is because they 're both well - liked and well - respected , " said Koweek .
" I think the school administration should be applauded , " she said .
" It 's wonderful that we 're in the news for something positive at Hudson High instead of for being a school in need of improvement . "
" I heard a few negative comments after Charlie and Timmy won , but people with open minds think it 's cool , " said senior class valedictorian Mohammed Ariful Ghani .
" There was a lot of clapping .
I did n't hear any booing . "
It was getting late and the 150 or so attendees were running out of steam after a buffet , picture - taking and dancing at Anthony 's Banquet Hall in Leeds when the paper ballots were counted .
There was such a buzz about the outcome that the two best friends never got their dance as king and queen .
They held a long hug , instead , before rejoining their respective dates .
Ferrusi chose to wear the king 's faux crown and Howard accepted the tiara and bouquet of flowers as queen .
They posed for cellphone shots with ear - to - ear grins .
The jubilant winners joined 40 others who had hired a bus and paid $ 5 for a ride to the prom .
Laughter and hurrahs for the king and queen filled the big yellow bus on the way home .
The driver happened to be Ferrusi 's grandfather , Dick Tracy , a former mayor of Hudson .
He may have been cheering the loudest .

Most children naturally seek close friends .
In a survey of nearly 3,000 Americans ages 8 to 24 conducted last year by Harris Interactive , 94 percent said they had at least one close friend .
But the classic best - friend bond  the two special pals who share secrets and exploits , who gravitate to each other on the playground and who head out the door together every day after school  signals potential trouble for school officials intent on discouraging anything that hints of exclusivity , in part because of concerns about cliques and bullying .
“ I think it is kids ’ preference to pair up and have that one best friend .
As adults  teachers and counselors  we try to encourage them not to do that , ” said Christine Laycob , director of counseling at Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School in St. Louis .
“ We try to talk to kids and work with them to get them to have big groups of friends and not be so possessive about friends . ”
“ Parents sometimes say Johnny needs that one special friend , ” she continued .
“ We say he does n’t need a best friend . ”
That attitude is a blunt manifestation of a mind - set that has led adults to become ever more involved in children ’s social lives in recent years .
The days when children roamed the neighborhood and played with whomever they wanted to until the streetlights came on disappeared long ago , replaced by the scheduled play date .
While in the past a social slight in backyard games rarely came to teachers ’ attention the next day , today an upsetting text message from one middle school student to another is often forwarded to school administrators , who frequently feel compelled to intervene in the relationship .
( Ms. Laycob was speaking in an interview after spending much of the previous day dealing with a “ really awful ” text message one girl had sent another . )
Indeed , much of the effort to encourage children to be friends with everyone is meant to head off bullying and other extreme consequences of social exclusion .
For many child - rearing experts , the ideal situation might well be that of Matthew and Margaret Guest , 12 - year - old twins in suburban Atlanta , who almost always socialize in a pack .
One typical Friday afternoon , about 10 boys and girls filled the Guest family backyard .
Kids were jumping on the trampoline , shooting baskets and playing manhunt , a variation on hide - and - seek .
When you sit on the loo in Ed Houben 's tiny bathroom , there 's a postcard at eye level that says " Welcome to Maastricht " .
It 's decorated with dozens of smiling tadpole - shaped creatures homing in on the words with cheerful intent .
It 's a little touch to make his visitors smile ; after all , most of them are here for Ed's sperm .
Houben has been donating sperm for more than 10 years now , first at the local sperm bank and then , after reaching the clinic 's legal limit , privately via the internet .
Most of his donating is done in his neat , modest flat on an estate on the outskirts of the Dutch town .
The T - shirt he 's wearing , which declares " Anytime , anyplace , anywhere , anyway " , is actually a bit misleading .
" In the old days I would gladly travel , and my colleagues covered for me if I was late to work , " he says .
" But my job at Maastricht 's tourism office has changed and I have to be around much more .
Now I ask people to come to me . "
And they do , from all over the world .
Houben has biological offspring in Australia , Israel , Canada , Cyprus , Germany and Luxembourg , as well as at home in the Netherlands .
His current tally of donor - conceived children stands at an eye - watering 62 , with the 63rd on the way .
It is by no means a world record – Houben once watched an episode of Oprah about a man who has fathered 200 , a number he says he 'll never catch .
But he has been called Europe 's most prolific sperm donor , and he 's happy to accept the title until someone has the , well , balls to challenge him .
In his late thirties , Houben is on what you 'd term the cuddly side , and he'd be the first to deprecate his looks , although the digital photo frame that 's scrolling through his brood – some fair , some dark , some hairless , puckered babies – reveals an unexpectedly attractive crop of kids .
He 's genial , bright and witty on the subject of his pastime ; but what his recipients value most of all is his commitment .
This week he 's seeing three women in four days , two from Switzerland and one from Germany .
Luckily the old scientific thinking that abstinence improves the quality of your sperm has recently been disproved ( Houben was n't surprised – he once got a woman pregnant two hours after failing with another ) .
He takes his sperm count seriously – there 's a recent test result lying on his desk , measuring everything from volume to pH and motility – and he 's extremely well read on the latest fertility research ; he also takes folic acid and fish oil .
As it 's illegal to sell your sperm in Europe , donation is a vocation rather than a career .
Houben got the calling in 1999 , after witnessing the trials and heartbreak of childless friends undergoing fertility treatment .
Donor numbers were declining dramatically in the Netherlands ( from 900 in 1990 to 200 in 2002 ) and those affected by the shortage , particularly lesbian couples , turned to the internet .
With his state - sanctioned quota fulfilled , and much more to give , Houben started placing ads on the websites and online forums that were springing up .
He scored with his very first attempt ; the day we meet , that child is celebrating her seventh birthday .
Houben 's first UK baby is expected later this year to a couple who , having heard about him , bought their first computer specifically to track him down .
Last weekend he had more than 20 of the children he 's helped create at his home for his once - yearly get - together ( he had a T - shirt for that occasion too : " Veni , Vidi , Vici " ) .
" I always felt the child should have a right to know where it comes from , " he says , and adds that he hopes that his openness on the subject will help to tackle the stigma surrounding sperm donation .
" Before I became a sperm donor , my own first thought was of an old guy in a long trench coat .
I want to take that image away and raise the level of discussion . "
Many European countries , including the UK , are suffering shortages in their sperm banks , limiting treatment through public health services .
For those who find themselves at the bottom of long waiting lists , or denied treatment altogether – particularly single women , gay couples and those starting a second family – the options are costly private treatment , or the do - it - yourself approach .
And there is no doubt that the online sperm donation scene is growing .
One popular website , Free Sperm Donations Worldwide ( FSDW ) , claims to have 1,100 UK donors ; if that 's true , it 's outstripping the NHS three to one .
Co-parentmatch.com was set up four years ago by a UK couple .
Jenny Kearns , 33 , and her partner were looking for a donor themselves , and after two years of research they pioneered an online membership community which works exactly like a dating website , allowing donors and recipients to search and browse each other 's profiles until they find what they 're looking for .
It now has 10,400 members , roughly 40 % of whom are donors .
" We were n't interested in going to a sperm bank because we wanted our child to know the father as they were growing up , " explains Kearns .
" On our site you can state what level of involvement you 're looking for from a donor – if any at all – and the site will match you up with the right people . "
Members pay £ 9.95 a month to send and receive messages , and those hunting for donors are , says Kearns , an even split of lesbians and heterosexuals .
" Most of it's to do with the costs and processes of fertility clinics , a lot of couples want to bypass that system .
There are strict regulations and long waiting lists for sperm in the UK , but we never have a shortage on our site . "
The website has the smiling , professional look of a Harley Street address offering upmarket dentistry , and Kearns says it is carefully monitored .
But the fact is that , outside of the health system , sperm donation is an unregulated , underground activity and sexually transmitted diseases , unknown medical histories , and clandestine meetings with complete strangers all pose genuine dangers .
Co-parentmatch recommends that women always request to see medical test results before considering a donor , but " ultimately it 's down to members to do checks , " says Kearns .
" We 're not a clinic . "
And it is not only risky for women .
Unless they donate to a licensed clinic , men are n't exempt from parental and financial responsibility for any begetting they do .
In 2007 , Andy Bathie , a fireman who fathered two children to a lesbian couple , lost a test case against the Child Support Agency , which had demanded he pay maintenance when the mothers split up .
For serial donors , however altruistic their motives might be , it is a potentially bankrupting situation .
It begs the question : why do it ?
And if it's hard enough to motivate more than 300 people in the UK to register as sperm donors each year , who are the men offering themselves out , week after week , for nothing more than tea and biscuits ?
To try to find an answer I head online and discover John , a regular donor who went private after he reached his NHS quota and is , like Houben , in considerable demand .
He 's paranoid about his identity and rather bossy on the phone , and when he agrees to meet me at a nondescript location , in between appointments , I 'm expecting to encounter the seedy , sinister side of the sperm trade .
I 'm pretty surprised when he turns up on a bicycle and orders a green tea .
It turns out John holds down a career in IT while answering SOSs from ovulating women all over the country , often travelling hundreds of miles a week because he hates to turn anyone down .
Once he 's committed to helping someone , he 'll keep trying until the job 's done .
He keeps records , does n't spread his seed too close to home , and he charges nothing more than the AA standard mileage rate of 40 p a mile .
I tell him he sounds like a superhero .
" You have to be quite flexible really , " he says modestly , " and sometimes you find yourself running around all week .
But I knew it was going to have a profound effect on my life . "
John started donating in his early 20s after a serious accident made it hard for him to have a normal relationship – " I thought that donation would be rewarding where other parts of my life were n't , " he tells me .
Now , he says , his duties mean a family of his own is unlikely , but it 's a sacrifice he 's willing to make .
" ' Donating often makes dating someone new seem more trouble than it 's worth .
This is n't like being a blood donor .
This is a lifestyle . "
I can't see any special reason why John would n't find a partner if he wanted one .
He 's in his thirties , decent looking , intelligent and articulate , if a tad jumpy , and a little obsessed with his subject .
But he seems to have well reasoned , altruistic motives for donating privately – he believes a woman should be able to meet and choose the donor who suits her best , rather than have the decision made for her at a clinic – and a genuine passion for what he does .
To be honest , if that passion was anything other than impregnating women , it might be quite charming .
John offers several methods with varying levels of discretion .
He has , in the past , produced for sperm delivery services , in which a courier comes to his house and bikes the freshly harvested product straight to the waiting customer .
He will help out a single lady with the syringe if required ; he will meet husbands so that they can compare hair and eye colour ; alternatively , he can be thoroughly invisible on the job .
One of his clients tells me that she leaves a room prepared and the back door open , and has never actually seen him ( " He 's very professional , he leaves everything in a nice and neat order " ) .
And like many of the online donors , he is also an experienced practitioner in " natural insemination " – in other words , sex .
Sperm donor forums bristle with terminology , but the most regularly used are AI and NI , and there is considerable debate in the community as to whether offering NI makes you a hero , an opportunist or a pervert .
FSDW instantly bans any donors offering NI ; Co-parentmatch says it recommends against donors who insist on NI only .
But John says it remains an important option for those who want to hurry the process along " if they feel their fertility might be limited , or they want to keep the costs down " .
Houben , who also offers NI , agrees .
" From my own experience , statistically NI is faster , " he says , and he has records to back up his claim .
" I take off my hat to the guys who only do AI , but if people are coming all the way from Italy they do n't want to be trying for three years . "
He only started offering NI when a couple specifically requested it – and he got a further shock when he discovered that the boyfriend expected to be present at the insemination .
Fortunately his sense of duty prevailed .
Houben points out that while it 's easy to accuse donors of looking for cheap sex , most of the women he sleeps with are n't people he would choose as sexual partners .
" This is n't Heidi Klum coming round and saying : ' Let 's do it ' , " he says .
" It 's genuine people who I would never want to hurt .
I have a good old - fashioned Catholic guilt feeling and I would be a candidate for therapy if I did this for the wrong reasons . "
Houben and John , however , represent the higher end of the service ; they are honourable guildsmen of the sperm fraternity .
Both are extremely committed and are choosy about who they help ( Houben has certain health requirements of recipients – non-smoking , light drinkers , not overweight – and also looks for some kind of sympathetic connection ) .
But they are aware of a less discriminating , and less palatable , marketplace .
John says plenty of donors use it as a money spinner , charging ludicrous , unsubstantiated expenses ; Houben remembers an early German donor website he discovered populated with " men who had clearly typed ' sperm ' in Google looking for porn " .
" It was gruesome , " he grimaces .
" It was basically the Wild West . "
An idle 10 minutes browsing Tadpole Forum gives you an idea of just how unpleasant and unsafe sperm donation can be .
It 's a UK site , the very first result on a Google search for " free sperm donation " , a place where users have handles like " Sir Lancelot " and " Exotic DNA " , and big - talking guys boast about their IQ , their looks and their virility .
The seemingly unmoderated message boards are riddled with gossip , innuendo and the occasional libel : users accuse each other of having multiple identities , falsifying references , sexual assault , and even – in one long - running thread which has unfolded like a compulsive soap opera plot – of donating while knowingly infertile .
John calls Tadpole " the dodgy backroom bar of the community – the kind of place you would n't want people to have to go " and argues that its existence demonstrates how desperate some women are for help .
" Sites like that are a direct result of the government 's failure to create a working regime , " he says angrily .
" The current guidelines act to create an enormous and totally unnecessary shortage of donor sperm . "
The figures certainly a hit a new low in 2004 , when the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority announced that donors were to lose their right to anonymity , and donor - conceived children would be allowed to request their biological father 's details at the age of 18 .
And while registration numbers have rallied since – thanks in part to recruitment drives – Dr Allan Pacey , senior lecturer in andrology at Sheffield University , points out that the UK is now having to import 20 % of its sperm from abroad .
" The number of sperm donation treatment cycles performed has gone down year on year , yet we know that there are waiting lists , sometimes of years .
It 's at odds with the message the HFEA puts out , and I 'd argue there 's a problem . "
Some fertility campaigners say they would like to see better compensation for donors ; others say that the system is too localised , and a central sperm bank is needed .
Houben and John both argue that current limits on donations per individual are arbitrary and unsupported by science .
The general consensus is that , in the meantime , unregulated websites are filling a void .
" The fact that there are alternatives is very concerning , " says Susan Seenan of the Infertility Network .
" If there was n't a shortage , people would n't be forced to look at that option . "
To see matters from another perspective , I head to the West Country to meet two of John 's happy customers .
Laura Bennett , 35 , and her partner Mandy Wedgwood , are playing with their six - month - old son Izak on the grass outside their home .
Bennett , a doctor , knew that their local NHS trust would only provide donor sperm to couples with proven infertility – in other words , they had to have a go themselves before they could get help .
" If you 're a same - sex couple , " says Bennett , " you 're in a bit of a predicament . "
The couple met some " very weird people " ( " There are men out there who think they can take over the world by procreation " ) before finding John , and it took Bennett seven attempts to get pregnant , at hotels of differing provenance along the M4 corridor .
" I am so relieved Izak was n't conceived at the service station at Newport Pagnell , " she says .
" It had brown Artex on the walls .
It felt like we were exchanging crack cocaine instead of beginning a new life … "
They are , however , delighted with the result , and have kept a scrapbook of their experiences – including a piece of that brown Artex – to show him where he came from .
John has never met Izak , or any of his biological children , and says he has no reason to think they 'll play any part in his life .
He admits it leaves him soul - searching about the future : " If you choose this , what do you fill the gap with when you 're older ? "
It 's a question that 's occurred to Houben , too .
How long he 'll continue adding to the world 's population he 's not sure , but he can't see a reason to stop yet .
Unlike John , Houben does have a girlfriend – someone who originally came to him looking to get pregnant – and she is happy for him to continue .
" But , " says Houben with a smile , " we might have a family together .
And then all bets are off . "

Music has long been part of NPR ’s identity , but perhaps never more than in recent years , as its NPR Music Web site has become an increasingly popular outlet for artists and music fans .
The site , at www.npr.org/music, features many artists who do n’t get heavy airplay on commercial radio , from the soprano Renée Fleming to the jazz musician Fred Hersch .
But big - name pop acts get attention too .
This month the Web site streamed 45 shows from the Bonnaroo festival , including the sets by the Dave Matthews Band and Tori Amos .
More than 40 can still be found on the Web site .
And on Wednesday NPR Music went mobile , introducing an iPhone application that provides a platform for the more than 300 pieces of new content  from videos to blog posts , podcasts to live concerts  that are added to the site each month .
“ There are music magazines and places to hear music , ” said Anya Grundmann , executive director of NPR Music , a 10 - member crew based in Washington .
“ We ’re trying to tap into all of the different ways to present music . ”
WORLD CUP 2010 : Emile Heskey blames the Jabulani ball for horror miss against USA
By Arindam Rej for MailOnline
Emile Heskey claimed the Jabulani ball contributed to his bad miss against USA on Saturday night - and said that goalkeeper Tim Howard was ' lucky ' to save his shot .
The England striker gave an impressive display , as Fabio Capello preferred him over Peter Crouch for England 's World Cup opener , but was criticised for spurning the outstanding opportunity .
It 's the ball 's fault : Emile Heskey ( left ) saw his shot saved by Tim Howard when clean through and blames the ball
The Aston Villa striker defended himself by saying : ' With my chance in the second half , the keeper ( Howard ) stood up quite well .
I just tried to get as much power behind it as possible because these balls do move around .
He has done well but he is lucky it has caught him right in the midriff but we kept plugging away and kept creating chances .
' Wazza ( Wayne Rooney ) had a shot which looked it was going in but at the last minute it swerved a bit and went wide .
That is what these balls do .'
Heskey also called for better service from his team - mates .
He said : ' The final ball was n't as good as it should have been .
I think as a team we were pressing quite high up the pitch , and we got the early rewards from that , so we have to keep doing that .
I just wanted to get hold of the ball , bring players into the game , and we managed to do that .'
Speaking about goalkeeper Robert Green 's blunder , which handed USA a soft equaliser in the 1 - 1 draw , Heskey said : ' Greeny is an experienced keeper and the reason he is there with England is because of all the brilliant stuff he has done .
' He made a great save in the second half from ( Jozy ) Altidore and people probably wo n't remember that because of the mistake he made .
But he 's a keeper who has been there and done it and he can bounce back from this . '
Almost the entire adult population of Scotland ( 97.5 % ) are likely to be either cigarette smokers , heavy drinkers , physically inactive , overweight or have a poor diet , according to a new study .
Researchers writing in the open access journal BMC Public Health also found a strong association between the presence of several of these risk factors and low income .
David Conway , from the University of Glasgow , Scotland , worked with a team of researchers to study data from 6574 participants in the Scottish Health Survey 2003 .
He said , " Our analysis shows that around two - thirds of the Scottish population is overweight or obese , a similar proportion are not sufficiently physically active , and most people have a poor diet -- it is just that it is not the same majority for each factor .
The most important determinants of multiple risk factors were low educational attainment and residence in our most deprived communities . "
The prevalence of multiple behavioural risk factors was high , with 86 % having at least two risk factors ; 55 % having three or more risk factors ; and nearly 20 % having four or all five risk factors .
Furthermore these risk factors are strongly associated with low socio-economic circumstances .
The researchers caution that , as the behaviours were self - reported , the real situation may be even worse than these figures suggest .
According to Conway , " Respondents might tend to give answers that would convey more favourable behaviours .
This was confirmed for alcohol consumption by an analysis comparing self - reported alcohol intake in the Scottish Health Surveys with alcohol sales estimates , which suggested that surveys may understate alcohol consumption by as much as 50 % . "
Astronomers are puzzling over an unusually shiny space rock orbiting billions of kilometres out from the Sun .
A team led by Professor James Elliot of Massachusetts Institute of Technology report their study of an object in the Kuiper Belt today in the journal Nature .
The Kuiper Belt , which orbits just beyond Neptune , is home to thousands of small remnants from the Solar System 's formation called Kuiper Belt Objects , or KBOs .
Because they are so tiny and far away , it 's difficult to examine KBOs directly , but scientists can study them when they block the light of a star they pass in front of .
They can work out its diameter by comparing the transit times seen at two or more telescopes that fall under the path of the shadow .
Stellar occultation
Elliot and colleagues used this method of ' stellar occultation ' to study one KBO , labelled 55636 .
Using a network of 20 telescopes across the globe , the team had 10 seconds during which to observe KBO 55636 and calculate the mean radius as 143 kilometres .
They then combined this diameter measurement with well - known measurements of KBO 55636's brightness to calculate the albedo , or reflectivity , of the object .
The albedo was a lot greater than previously thought implying the presence of pristine water - ice on its surface .
KBO 55636 is one of a number of KBOs formed from a strange football - shaped dwarf planet , called Haumea , which spins once every four hours .
It is thought that Haumea was involved in a collision about 1 billion years ago .
There is some evidence that the resulting ' chips ' are shinier than other KBOs .
But this is the first time a Haumea chip 's exact diameter and albedo has been measured accurately , and it 's confirming the group of KBOs are a strange lot indeed .
" The surprising thing is that the ice has somehow remained fresh for a billion years , " says Michele Bannister , an Australian researcher in Kuiper Belt Objects , also known as Trans - Neptunian Objects , at Mount Stromlo Observatory in Canberra .
Space - weathering
She says ice - covered KBOs generally get less shiny with what is called " space - weathering " by the solar wind , dust and other space debris .
" If you think of the snowfields in the Snowys [ Snowy Mountains ] , you have everything from dust to gum leaves dropping on it , " says Bannister .
" A snow field wo n't stay beautiful and bright once it 's fallen out of the sky . "
But for some reason a billion years of space - weathering does n't seem to have affected KBO 55636 .
" We do n't understand why this object is as shiny and bright as it appears to be .
It should have been weathered into being quite dark , " says Bannister .
Bannister says the new findings might help scientists in their search to understand how these Haumea chips were formed and why they are so dark .
She says one explanation is cryovolcanism - volcanoes made of water ice - as seen on Saturn 's moon Enceladus .
But , she says , KBO 55636 is way too small to support such volcanoes .
" Basically we do n't understand how this space weathering process works , " says Bannister .
" This is exciting .
Hopefully we 'll now have information to tell us a new theory about space weathering . "
This is the first time occultation has been used for an object of this size .
" The logistics involved in organising 20 telescopes spread half way around the world to observe something like this are horrendous , " says Bannister .
A year later , Hamas drove the Fatah - dominated Palestinian Authority entirely out of Gaza in four days of street battles , leading Israel to cut off all shipments in and out except basic food , humanitarian aid and urgent medical supplies .
Hamas declines to recognize Israel ’s right to exist , renounce violence or accept previous accords signed between Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
The diplomatic group known as the Quartet , made up of the United States , Russia , the European Union and the United Nations , has said that until Hamas meets those requirements , the Quartet will not deal with it .
But the world powers have grown increasingly disillusioned with the blockade , saying that it has created far too much suffering in Gaza and serves as a symbol not only of Israel ’s treatment of Palestinians but of how the West is seen in relation to the Palestinians .
“ Gaza has become the symbol in the Arab world of the Israeli treatment of Palestinians , and we have to change that , ” the senior American official said .
“ We need to remove the impulse for the flotillas .
The Israelis also realize this is not sustainable . ”
At a meeting of the Quartet a year ago in Italy , for example , the group asserted that the current situation was not sustainable and called for the unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian aid within Gaza , as well as the reopening of crossing points .
But Obama administration officials made it clear that the deaths had given a new urgency to changing the policy .
Pressure against the blockade continued to grow on Wednesday : Turkey , which withdrew its ambassador to Israel after the raid , said full restoration of diplomatic ties was contingent on an end to the blockade .

In this tutorial I will go over the structure of the nose and give detailed information about the bridge , ball , and nostrils of the nose .
At the end , I will show a step by step of a nose drawing .
The Major Planes
When drawing the nose , I ’ll usually start by indicating the 4 major planes – top , 2 sides , and bottom .
Getting the angles of these planes correct is important to show the proper perspective of the nose in relationship to the rest of the head .
Keeping it this simple in the beginning helps to ignore the details and focus only on the width to height relationship of the entire shape of the nose and to compare it to the rest of the features .
Once the big shapes and the perspective are solved , it ’s much easier to add the details on top .
Anatomical Information
I think the anatomical shapes in the nose are really interesting .
It ’s made up of interlocking pieces of cartilage and fat attached to the bone of the skull .
Half of the bridge of the nose is bone and the other half is cartilage .
The lateral cartilage on the bridge wedges between the two pieces that make up the ball of the nose .
The nostrils connect to the ball like curled wings .
Bridge
The bridge of the nose is composed of the nasal bone , maxilla , and lateral cartilage .
The nasal bone connects to the brow ridge at the glabella .
The edge of the nasal bone and lateral cartilage has a thin , sharp ridge as it transitions to the side plane and then connects to the maxilla .
The maxilla is usually slightly convex and gently transitions to the cheeks .
Ball
The ball of the nose ( Greater Alar Cartilage ) is actually made up of two halves with the lateral cartilage wedging between the two .
This separation of the two halves is not always visible .
The cartilage curves downward and tucks under itself to connect to the skull .
Nostrils
The nostrils ( Alar Fat ) , made of fatty connective tissue are like wings attached to the ball of the nose .
Viewed from the bottom , the nostrils connect to the face further back then the septum because of the protrusion of the tooth cylinder .
The Minor Planes
It ’s important to memorize the subtle plane changes in all the different part of the nose .
These subtle plane changes are usually seen as halftone shapes which to the untrained eye appear to be random .
Once familiar with the minor planes , you can easily figure out what each halftone shape represents and how to design it in your drawing .
Minor Planes of the Bridge
The Glabella is shaped like a keystone .
This keystone shape is slanted downward and will usually have some halftone on it connecting the eye sockets together .
Immediately after the glabella , the nasal bone turns upward and then back down after the connection to the lateral cartilage .
This area of connection between the nasal bone and lateral cartilage tends to be the widest part of the bridge and also creates a subtle ‘ bump ’ seen from the side .
Minor Planes of the Ball
The ball of the nose is n’t perfectly round , but has very distinct plane changes .
It has a top , front , and bottom plane as the septum curls under itself and connects to the skull .
The side plane acts as a step down to the nostril .
The shape of the greater alar cartilage varies drastically from person to person .
It can be soft , chiseled , large and bulbous , thin and pointy etc …
Minor planes of the Nostrils
The nostrils , also called wings , curl under themselves similar to the septum .
The nostrils are not paper thin , so an indication of the front planes is crucial to give them some thickness .
Do n’t forget to show the curve by separating the top and side planes , usually with a gradation of tone .
The hole of the nostrils often appears as a sideways comma shape with a sharp edge at the top , and softer edge at the bottom .
Drawing the Nose
The reference photo .
1 . I start drawing the nose the same way I start drawing anything : analyze the biggest shape first .
Make sure the placement on the face is correct and that the size and shape is working in relation to the other features .
What ’s the point in drawing any details if the underlying drawing is crooked , too big , and in the wrong place ?
2 . When I ’m happy with the big shape I ’ve established , I will lay - in some of the smaller plane indications and some anatomical information .
All my lines at this point are very light , so that I ’m able to easily erase them when making adjustments .
3 . When beginning to shade , the first thing I do is separate the lights from the shadows .
Stay simple and do n’t lose control of your values .
4 . At this final stage I ’ll use a lot of the information we learned about the minor planes of the nose to shade in subtle halftone shifts in the light areas and reflected lights in the shadows .
I try to visualize the interlocking anatomical shapes and make sure all the volumes look accurate :

On the second Day of World Cup , South Africa gave to me : Maradona ’s 4 - 3 -
3
So , at the end of it all , Maradona did n’t go for his four centre - backs at the back nor did he go for the proposed three at the back that was being bandied around a couple of days before the match .
However , he did opt for three up - front and more importantly , played Messi in a position that he had recently been successful in playing for Barcelona .
Over the past season , Messi has played on the wide right and during the end part of the Barcelona ’s successful league winning season , in the middle .
In this position , he flourished either behind the front man where he scored a hat - trick against third place Valencia .
He has also shown that he can be the man furthest forward as he showed against Arsenal with his four goals .
His turn of pace and his ability to turn on the proverbial peseta causes panic in defences , who do n’t know whether to close him down where they will inevitably get brushed aside or drop deep and give him time to have a shot .
This similarity between his position yesterday and his position for Barcelona is evident when studying respective heatmaps .
An interesting observation that was well picked up on by the commentary team was that the Argentinian front - line were all playing in between the lines and in the space without a traditional central striker .
Quite often the Nigerian central defenders were left without anyone to pick up and not knowing whether to keep in line or move up to close down the attackers .
This was an interesting choice , and could have been the right choice – by moving out and closing down the Argentinian front - three , this could leave spaces behind the defence .
Messi , Tevez and Higuain are all playing in between the midfield and defence .
This means that the Nigerian defence may want to push up to close down the space , but by doing this , they are always susceptible to a diagonal ball over the top .
With the central defenders not pushing up , the central midfielders need to stay deep to close down the space they have .
Like every tactical variation , this has knock - on effects in other areas of the pitch .
This means that quite often Veron had the time to find a good pass , as the Nigerian forwards were not too enthusiastic when it came to closing Veron down .
This allowed Argentina to dominate the game with 65 % of possession .
When a back four finds itself defending against a 4 - 3 - 3 , the full - backs have one man to pick up each , which means they are unable to tuck - in to help negate the threat of the central striker .
However , with Argentina having a very fluid front - three ( which turns into a front four when di Maria pushes on ) , a conundrum appears as the defence have the choice of pushing up or not at all .
Angel di Maria ’s heatmap shows that he was stuck on the touchline .
This created a front four that created opportunities for Argentina .
The Nigerian right - back went and picked up di Maria , stretching the defence that created gaps between the central defender and the full - back .
It is this space that Lionel Messi attempted to exploit time and time again .
Another problem that Nigeria found was that with di Maria always creating the need for the defence to be stretched , the left - full back often pushed forward to mark one of the Argentinian front three .
However , this often meant that there was space to exploit on the Nigerian left , this space is further widened as the Nigerian central defence tried to stay tight to reduce the chance that Messi will run between the two of them .
This created huge spaces for either Tevez or Higuain .
Maradona showed two interesting developments in their system yesterday .
Firstly , the position of Messi in the centre was complimented by di Maria ’s position wide on the left , creating large spaces in the central defence .
The use of three unconventional central forwards who all dropped deep created problems with Nigeria ’s defence and central midfield as they did not know how to pick them up zonally .
This allowed Argentina to dominate possession with the use of only two midfielders .
Argentina dished up an exciting 4 - 3 - 3 with emphasis on creating opportunities going forward to compliment their attacking strengths .
The deployment of Messi in a central role is one where he can get on the ball and turn and run at a central defence that has been stretched by the positioning of di Maria .
This new system seems to be more measured and may help prove that Maradona does indeed have method in his ( apparent ) madness .
Now that he ’s the Kentucky Republican Senate nominee Rand Paul is facing increased scrutiny for statements he ’s made regarding the 1964 Civil Rights Act .

Paul has contended that while the legislation was correct in ending racial discrimination , he ’s turned the question into a philosophical one over whether or not the federal government should be able to intrude on how a private business conducts itself .
That may work well in the classroom , but it ’s a tricky position to take as a political candidate on national television .
“ I ’m not in favor of any discrimination of any form .
I would never belong to any club that excluded anybody for race , ” Paul said on Maddow ’s program .
But when pressed on whether he supported aspects of what the Civil Rights law did , including desegregating lunch counters in privately owned restaurants , Paul gave a dodge-y answer : “ Does the owner of the restaurant own his restaurant ?
Or does the government own his restaurant ?
These are important philosophical debates but not a very practical discussion . ”

The penny : most people would rather toss it into convenience store trays or coffee shop tip bars than carry around in their pockets .
It ’s the coin most frequently seen laying on streets , sidewalks or parking lots .
While it might seem foolish to waste money ( however small an amount ) , the public ’s disregard for pennies is not as irrational as it sounds .
In fact , it now costs more than one cent to produce a penny in the first place .
How did the penny came to cost more than its face value ?
Copper & Zinc Price Increases
Pennies , as you may know , are made of 97.5 % zinc and 2.5 % copper .
Therefore , the costs of producing pennies is tightly linked to fluctuations in the prices of these two commodities .
This has been a negligible concern for most of the penny ’s life , as copper and zinc prices have typically been quite manageable .
But in 2007 , The Washington Post reported that in fiscal 2007 , the U.S. Mint lost $ 31 million in making 6.6 billion new pennies and $ 68 million in making nickels .
By 2008 , copper prices had trippled since 2003 , according to Fox News , while the price of zinc quadrupled .
In 2008 , it cost 1.26 cents to produce a single penny for circulation , compared with 1.67 cents the previous year .
At the end of 2007 , the cost of making a nickel was nearly ten cents .
In May , the Wall Street Journal reported that the costs of minting a penny have gone up to nearly 2 cents , while those of nickels were up to nine cents each .
Historical Production Costs
( stevendepolo )
The rising cost of penny production is not an extremely recent phenomenon .
In fact , the last time a penny cost less than one cent to produce was in 2005 .
A helpful chart from CoinUpdate.com displays rising costs in all but three years since 2001 .
Despite a brief dip in 2008 , rising copper prices sent penny production costs right back up into the 1.6 cent range in 2009 :
Fiscal Year U.S. Mint Costs 2009 0.0162 2008 0.0142 2007 0.0167 2006 0.0121 2005 0.0097 2004 0.0093 2003 0.0098 2002 0.0089 2001 0.0080
In total , CoinUpdate.com found that the U.S. Mint lost a combined $ 22 million producing nickels and pennies in fiscal 2009 .
And while gains from dimes and quarters have made up for these losses , the fact remains that total U.S.
Mint gains would be substantially higher without absorbing ongoing , yearly losses from pennies .
The ever - rising cost of the penny has prompted some to ask the obvious question : why not stop making them ?
It is the politically unpopular choice , to be sure .
In 2008 , then Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson conceded that it made pragmatic sense but was politically unfeasible , and that he had no intentions of attempting it .
U.S. Mint Director Edmund Moy also told Fox News that “ people still want pennies , which is why we ’re still making them . ”
A Penniless Future
( markhilary )
Despite what people might say about pennies , there is no denying how casually we dispose of them .
Presumably , people would not throw coins into ponds at parks and shopping malls if they were truly vital to day to day commerce .
Nor would it be especially common to see them laying flattened on railroad tracks .
And there certainly would not have been an entire sea of them ( pictured above ) at Rockefeller Plaza .
It seems that the public ’s professed feelings about pennies are a world apart from their revealed preferences about them .
There are also the potential savings at stake .
At a time when the U.S. is in the teeth of a recession , there are plenty of superior uses for $ 22 million than producing dead weight currency .
Retailers , too , incur penny - related costs of their own .
More than 10 years ago , in a 1999 article , Time Magazine estimated that Walgreens lost $ 1.3 million each year merely counting pennies .
Moreover , eliminating pennies would not create the economic chaos that many anticipate .
A common worry , for instance , is that prices will rise if stores begin rounding to the nearest nickel .
Yet as Time explains , rounding is standard , daily practice on military bases and in various foreign countries with no major corresponding price jump .
Threes and fours get rounded to five , and ones and twos get rounded to zero .
When debit or credit cards are used ( as is most common today ) , no rounding occurs at all .
In any case , prices are determined by supply and demand , not the presence or absence of one - cent coins .
If retailers could competitively charge more , they already would be .

Israel ’s High Court of Justice postpones arrest warrants against 22 mothers guilty of contempt of court for refusing to send their daughters to integrated classes .
“ Not a drop of racism ” but there “ is a set of rules ” to respect , parents say .
More than 100,000 Haredi invade the streets of Jerusalem in their support .
Jerusalem ( AsiaNews / Agencies ) – Israel ’s High Court of Justice on Friday morning postponed the implementation of arrest warrants to Sunday for 22 Haredi ( ultra - Orthodox ) mothers who refused to send their daughters to classes with less observant girls .
The case has led the largest public demonstration by Haredi in Israel ’s history ( more than 100,000 according to police ) after 35 men began two - week jail terms for contempt of court over discriminatory practices involving their daughters .
The controversy , which is being followed with passion by a divided Jewish public opinion and not only in Israel , stems from the refusal of parents of Ashkenazi ( European ) descent at an all girls ' school to let their daughters study with classmates of Middle Eastern and North African descent , known as Sephardim .
The Ashkenazi parents insist that they are not racist , but want to keep the classrooms segregated — as they have been for years — on the grounds that the Sephardic families of are not religious enough .
The Supreme Court has rejected that argument and ruled in favour of integration .
Yakov Litzman , an lawmaker from the ultra-Orthodox Ashkenazi party , United Torah Judaism ( UTJ ) , told army radio there was " not a drop of racism " in the parents ' decision ,
" There is a set of rules [ in the ultra - Orthodox community ] .
We do n't want televisions in the home , there are rules of modesty ; we are against the internet . [. . .]
I do n't want my daughter to be educated with a girl who has a TV at home , ” he explained .
The Court did not see it that way and ordered classes to be integrated , and faced with parents ’ refusal , charged and convicted both parents , ordering them to serve their sentence on rotation so that the girls would not be left without a parent .
Haredi responded to the court ruling by accompanying the fathers to jail and by invading the streets of Jerusalem , claiming the parents ’ right to decide whether their daughters should be educated separately or not .
“ I am going to jail with great excitement and joy over the support we 've received , ” one father said , because “ We are making sure our children get the best education possible . "
Overall , the demonstration was peaceful even though some marchers brandished banners saying , " The Supreme Court is fascist ” and one protester told the crow , " We are strong because God is with us . "
However , some Ashkenazi protesters tried to attack Sephardic Rabbi Ya'akov Yosef , a leading figure against segregation .

In yet other words , this means a failed auction .

It ’s always been that way .
Their relationship began on an April night in 1993 when Alexis was battling despair because her mother had fallen into a coma .
“ I have no one in my life , ’’ she remembers thinking then .
“ If only I had someone in my life I could lean on . ’’
A few minutes later , the phone rang .
It was Derek , whom she had met a year earlier in a Manhattan nightclub but had not seen since .
Her mother came out of the coma the next day , and when Alexis got around to mentioning Derek , her mother said : “ Go see him . ’’
Two years later she was at their wedding .
Over the next two years , those words would echo for them .
First , the company was weakened by a delay in payment on a $ 2 million contract .
Then , the recession began to take its toll , battering their business and forcing them to lay off all of their 15 employees .
Before they knew it , their once - robust company was fighting for its life .
Their dinner companion wrapped up his cloudy peroration with a silver lining :
When bad times arrived , “ at least the two of you have each other . ’’
Puzzled , the Brookses looked at each other across the dinner table .
Where was this gloom - and - doom coming from ?
After all , Inside Cable , Inc. , the telecommunications infrastructure company they ’d founded in 2001 , was doing well , having reaped nearly $ 3 million in revenue in 2007 .
In the spring of 2008 , Derek and Alexis Brooks were dining with a business acquaintance in London when suddenly he launched into a sober lecture about the inevitability that their company would face tough times .
So what lessons do entrepreneurial couples have to offer as new employment arrangements start to emerge from the ashes of the recession ?
How do they handle the constant togetherness — and the financial uncertainty ?
To find out , the Globe talked to three entrepreneurial couples who ’ve weathered the recession in different ways .
After all , they not only embrace a unique brand of 24/7 togetherness , but also live with a high degree of risk , given that all their eggs are in one basket , economically speaking .
Yet some analysts say they may represent the wave of the future , because the Great Recession has vividly illustrated that the traditional workplace is no longer a sure thing .
Married people who go into business with each other — called entrepreneurial couples or , less elegantly , “ copreneurs ’ ’ or “ couplepreneurs ’ ’ — choose to blend the personal and the professional , the homefront and the workplace , in a way that some find hard to fathom .
They live together .
They work together .
They spend virtually every waking moment together .
And when a historic recession hits with the force of a hurricane , they hold on to each other for dear life .
“ We have more time with the kids , ’’ Edna says .
“ This year I have been able to volunteer in the schools two days a week .
All the field trips , I was able to be there with my daughter , and my son , too . ’’
Adds Malcolm : “ They feel strange when they see their friends ’ parents working different jobs .
They ask ‘ Why are they doing that ? ’
They think we are the normal ones . ’’
But as the parents of two young children , they wanted more flexibility .
Since they launched their environmentally friendly house - cleaning business , called TerraMaids , they ’ve found it .
It ’s not that they did n’t like their jobs .
Malcolm , 36 , was a teacher ’s aide and an interpreter of Portuguese and Spanish at Keefe Technical School in Framingham .
Edna , 38 , counseled victims of domestic violence and sexual assault at a social - services agency .
In both cases , they did so for the same reason : to pursue a better life .
One year ago , in the middle of a painful recession , they did something equally daring :
They left secure jobs to start their own house - cleaning business .
Two decades ago , when they were teenagers and did not yet know each other , Malcolm and Edna Ball left Brazil with their families and came to the United States .
“ We never gave up , ’’ says Alexis .
“ When these things crashed down upon us , that was truly a litmus test .
If we can get through this , we can get through anything . ’’
As for their company , they ’re close to signing a deal they expect will restore it to solid footing .
And their marriage ?
They say it has been strengthened by the trials of the past two years .
Like a lot of entrepreneurial couples , they possess complementary skills .
Derek , who has a law degree , likes to burrow relentlessly into the details of projects , while Alexis , who has a background in marketing and radio , likes to get quickly to the point .
Yet each can anticipate what the other is thinking so precisely that in business meetings they sometimes fuse into a single personality .
“ We ’re always finishing each other ’s sentences , to the point that sometimes it gets on her nerves , ’’ says Derek , to which Alexis adds : “ Yes , it does .
But we tag - team well . ’’
“ Do we talk about business all the time ?
Yes , ’’ admits Alexis .
But , she adds , “ We love working together .
We have a blast .
We ca n’t get enough of being together . ’’
The secret may lie in the fact that they try to merge business with pleasure .
If a meeting goes well , they celebrate .
If they have a business trip , they build in what Alexis calls “ us time . ’’
It has evolved into a marriage with virtually no border between the professional and the personal .
During the hardest periods , says Derek , 46 , “ I would come in and see her and automatically know why I was doing all that . ’’
Yet beyond easing the always tenuous work - family balance , Edna sees another benefit to their business partnership :
It serves as an extension of their marriage .
“ He is a great person to spend time with .
He is my best friend , ’’ she says .
“ Working together , having the same goals and objectives , being a partner :
It goes beyond just being a business . ’’
That ’s not to say they have n’t felt pressure as the recession squeezed discretionary dollars out of many households .
A few customers have stopped the cleaning service , while others have cut back from once every two weeks to once a month .
They still have 22 customers , though ( chiefly clustered in Wellesley , Newton , Brookline , and Weston ) , and with only one employee besides themselves , the workload can be heavy .
“ It ’s hard sometimes , ’’ Malcolm acknowledges .
“ It brings a lot of stress .
We ’ll be driving home and we ’re talking , and we ’ll say :
This conversation ends here . ’’
He checks work - related e-mail ; she returns phone calls from clients .
( Explains Malcolm : “ Ninety percent of the time it ’s a woman calling , so they feel more comfortable talking to a woman . ’’)
When they go out on jobs together , she ’s more likely to focus on the kitchen and bathroom while he wields the vacuum and the mop .
Edna speaks admiringly of Malcolm ’s ability to notice the slightest speck in a seemingly clean room .
Malcolm says customers are surprised to learn they are married , sometimes asking : “ How do you guys stand each other ? ’’
It does n’t seem to be a problem .
“ We ’re friends , ’’ he says , adding with a smile : “ We do n’t get bored looking at each other . ’’
LIZZIE AND STEVE CURRAN Pod Digital Design , Lexington
In business together ( in current company ) : 6 years Married : 20 years
When Lizzie Curran tells people that she works all day in an office just a few steps from her husband , Steve , the reactions tend to range from incredulity to . . . more incredulity .
“ They ask ‘ How do you do it ? ’ ’’ says Lizzie .
“ Then they look at you like you have six eyes . ’’
Imagine their reaction if they knew that working together has been the norm for much of the Currans ’ 20 - year marriage — and even before .
They tended bar together in an off - campus pub when they were first dating at Syracuse University .
They comanaged product development at a video - game company in Miami from 1989 to 1995 .
They ran an interactive marketing company from 1995 to 1999 .
Now , they jointly run Pod Digital Design , which creates online games , videos , websites and promotional campaigns for companies like Yahoo ! , Sony Entertainment , and the Game Show Network .
It is a recession - era success that was born of failure during an earlier economic slump , and of Lizzie ’s faith in their ability to work as a team .
In early 2002 , a few years after they moved to Massachusetts , they took a break from working together .
Lizzie was staying home with their two sons while Steve was a founding partner at a start - up .
But the firm was faltering post - 9/11 , and he knew he needed to leave .
The safer path would have been to find a salaried job at an ad agency , but Lizzie told him that they should start their own company .
In his recollection , she told him that “ we had already managed to survive and be happy in a lean time , and since the economy was bound to improve , what did we have to lose ?
She said ‘ I can help you when you need me , but it has to start with you , and I know you can do this . ’ ’’
So he launched Pod Digital Design , and in 2004 , Lizzie joined him .
They ’ve been running the company since , walking to the office each day from their house , which is only 500 yards away .
The company ’s revenues have grown steadily as marketers have sought digital alternatives to traditional advertising .
The company ’s chief asset , though , may be the Currans ’ unshakeable belief in each other .
“ A lot of businesses fail because their partners do n’t trust each other .
With us , there is complete trust , ’’ says Lizzie .
“ If you ca n’t trust the most important person in your life , who can you trust ? ’’
Steve says facetiously that they abide by a strict rule : “ No fighting in front of the kids . ’’
He ’s not talking about their teenage sons .
He ’s talking about not letting disagreements over who forgot to put away the laundry seep into the office , where the Currans supervise 10 employees .
OK , but what about that constant togetherness ?
“ Obviously , it ’s not for everybody , ’’ Lizzie replies .
“ But seeing each other two hours a day , I find that really sad .
And if he ’s under stress , I know why that is . ’’

Suddenly , creating jobs is out , inflicting pain is in .
Condemning deficits and refusing to help a still - struggling economy has become the new fashion everywhere , including the United States , where 52 senators voted against extending aid to the unemployed despite the highest rate of long - term joblessness since the 1930s .
Many economists , myself included , regard this turn to austerity as a huge mistake .
It raises memories of 1937 , when F.D.R. ’s premature attempt to balance the budget helped plunge a recovering economy back into severe recession .
And here in Germany , a few scholars see parallels to the policies of Heinrich Brüning , the chancellor from 1930 to 1932 , whose devotion to financial orthodoxy ended up sealing the doom of the Weimar Republic .
But despite these warnings , the deficit hawks are prevailing in most places  and nowhere more than here , where the government has pledged 80 billion euros , almost $ 100 billion , in tax increases and spending cuts even though the economy continues to operate far below capacity .
What ’s the economic logic behind the government ’s moves ?
The answer , as far as I can tell , is that there is n’t any .
Press German officials to explain why they need to impose austerity on a depressed economy , and you get rationales that do n’t add up .
Point this out , and they come up with different rationales , which also do n’t add up .
Arguing with German deficit hawks feels more than a bit like arguing with U.S. Iraq hawks back in 2002 :
They know what they want to do , and every time you refute one argument , they just come up with another .

TORONTO --
The number of protesters arrested has climbed to more than 300 and officers expect more arrests will be made following a riot early Sunday morning .
By 6:15 a.m. , police said more than 300 people have been charged and a long line of protesters were also waiting to be processed , said Integrated Security Unit spokesman Wendy Drummond .
She said each protester would face a variety of charges , and could be held in custody depending on their violations and criminal history .
Only about 40 arrests were made between 6 a.m. and 4 p.m. Saturday , but by 3 a.m.
Sunday , the ISU confirmed arrests of more than 200 protesters who rampaged through the city 's downtown core all day Saturday and into Sunday .
Drummond told Canwest News Service that she was aware of more " people who want to go beyond the peaceful protest and have violence . "
" We will continue to support those who protest peacefully in the downtown core today , but these groups that committed these criminal acts are not protesters .
Do not associate yourself with them if your intent is to not commit criminal offences , " she warned the public .
" We are in it for the long haul , " she said .
The ISU is composed of thousands of officers from across the country .
Drummond said police have used ARWEN launchers , which shoot a special kind of bean bag or plastic projectiles , and tear gas against protesters .
There are reports that a large group of protesters wearing backpacks and balaclavas were marching near Queen St. East and River Street by 2 a.m .
A crowd of about 200 people chanted outside the Eastern Avenue temporary G20 detention centre nearby .
A small group of black - clad protesters were surrounded at a downtown intersection around 10 p.m. ET Saturday .
A police line in full riot gear began marching at the group , banging their batons on their shields , in hopes of preventing more protesters from moving towards the G20 security fence still located blocks away .
The mood was tense as a small number of protesters yelled obscenities .
Helicopters could be heard overhead .
The officers loudly chanted : " Move , move , " as they marched .
One older man was pushed by police out of the way as he was seeking shelter from the pouring rain .
Police were telling everyone to " leave the area , " but few were going .
This surround - and - disperse - the - crowd tactic was used many times by police Saturday .
The day began peacefully but by midafternoon , anarchists hiding within the 10,000 or so protesters stepped things up , hurling objects such as golf balls , burning police cars and smashing windows , then darting away - sometimes to change out of their black garb in an effort to throw police off .
Holding them off were some 5,500 police officers in full riot gear and on horseback who made repeated charges at the rioters in an effort to push them northwards and away from the downtown core where the leaders of the G20 have gathered for their annual summit .
As the night wore on , police continued to make arrests , darting forward into the crowds to grab rioters and pull him them back behind police lines .
The Integrated Security Unit confirmed that 130 arrests were made as of 9:30 p.m. ET on Saturday .
Refusing to bow to the pressure of anti-Israel activists , Sir Elton John arrived in Israel on Thursday and performed in front of tens of thousands of Israelis at the Ramat Gan stadium .
John 's arrival followed weeks of speculation due to several recent cancellations of concerts in Israel by other musical acts including Elvis Costello , the Pixies and Devendra Banhart for politically - related reasons .
The British music star , who last peformed in Israel in 1993 , greeted the enthusiastic crowd by saying " Shalom " in Hebrew .

ClimateWire ( via The New York Times ) reports that several key players are considering a push for a utility - only cap - and - trade system as part of an energy bill .
That could be a wise move , if it ’s done right .
First the main substance .
Take a look at this plot of emissions reductions under Kerry - Lieberman as projected by the EPA :
﻿
You ’ll notice that almost all of the emissions reductions from U.S. energy use come from electric utilities , not just in the early years , but through 2050 .
Transportation , manufacturing , and “ other ” ( my guess is mostly direct energy use in buildings ) make up a very small fraction .
A utility - only bill , then , should be able to get most of the reductions in U.S. emissions from energy use that an economy - wide bill would , but without some of the complexity and stigma .
For this reason alone , utility - only should receive serious consideration .
Now for the potential problems .
I can see at least four :
The percentage cut in emissions from electricity generation would need to be substantially greater than the percentage cut in economy - wide emissions in order to achieve the same power - sector carbon price .
( You ’re cutting the same absolute amount off a much smaller base , so the fraction is bigger . )
It may be complicated to explain why a target that looks much stronger than the 17 % cut from 2005 levels by 2020 is actually no more onerous .
If the result is a utility - only cap - and - trade with a 17 % target for utilities , that will be a failure .
Per the EPA graph , much of the emissions reductions in the EPA model of Kerry - Lieberman come from domestic and international offsets .
A smaller - scale cap - and - trade system will almost certainly lead to lower demand for offsets .
To the extent that the offsets represent real emissions reductions , utility - only would thus lead to lower emissions reductions .
Similarly , to the extent that international cooperation is driven by financial flows from offset purchases , utility - only cap - and - trade would likely reduce such flows .
This is not the end of the world , but it is not unimportant either .
Many energy intensive manufacturers use electricity from the grid .
If utility - only cap - and - trade increases the price of that electricity , but manufacturers do n’t face direct limits on their own emissions , they may shift to lower - cost but dirtier on - site sources of energy , raising their emissions above business - as- usual and undermining the broader emissions control effort .
Utility - only would thus need , at a minimum , to be accompanied by some sort of “ no harm ” efficiency standards for energy intensive manufacturing .
The politics of cap - and - trade have traditionally involved using revenue from the transportation sector to compensate every other affected entity ( utilities , manufacturers , consumers , etc ) .
That is part of why so many business interests have been willing to support a bill .
Utility - only does n’t deliver that money .
That may complicate the politics of a bill .
There is , of course , a fifth problem .
It has been very tough to tie cap - and - trade to public outrage over the oil spill .
A cap - and - trade system that deliberately does nothing about oil will be even harder to sell from that angle .
Sure , but does it project a 50 feet Princess Leia hologram ?
and better yet , what would you see when you look up from directly under the hologram ?
During this morning ’s ongoing congressional hearing featuring BP CEO Tony Hayward , Republican congressman Joe Barton of Texas called the victim ’s trust fund that was agreed to yesterday a “ slush fund , ” and said it was “ a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would call a shakedown , in this case a $ 20 billion shakedown . ”
Barton then apologized to BP , and said he does n’t want to “ live in a country where every time a corporation does something wrong , it ’s subject to a political process that amounts to a shakedown . ”
Oddly enough , Barton is not alone among Republicans who think it ’s just awful that BP was persuaded to repay the people whose lives it has destroyed with its negligence and complete lack of emergency preparedness .
The Republican Study Committee , a group of 115 Conservative House Republicans , for example , called the creation of the fund a “ Chicago - style political shakedown . ”
Guess we know how many in the GOP feel about helping the “ small people . ”
BP boss Tony Hayward faces Congress - live blog [ Guardian UK ]
Update : The White House has already pounced on Barton ’s remarks , releasing this statement : “ What is shameful is that Joe Barton seems to have more concern for big corporations that caused this disaster than the fishermen , small business owners and communities whose lives have been devastated by the destruction .
Congressman Barton may think that a fund to compensate these Americans is a ‘ tragedy ’ , but most Americans know that the real tragedy is what the men and women of the Gulf Coast are going through right now .
Members from both parties should repudiate his comments . ” [ Politico 44 ]
Update II : Joe Barton has apologized for his earlier comments : “ I think BP is responsible for this incident , ” he said .
“ If anything I have said this morning has been misconstrued , I want to apologize . ” [ WSJ ]
lol that hungry ?
About 80 cal . in one normal sized apple .
Some scientists say though that some food , e.g. apples contain " negative calories " , meaning that they cause the body to burn more calories ( e.g. by increasing the metabolism / providing vitamin C , etc. ) then they actually have .
So theoretically you would actually lose calories ( and in the long run weight ) by eating an apple .
Google has increased its commitment to clean and sustainable energy with a sizable investment in two wind farms .
The company will put $ 38.3 million into two NextEra Energy Resources wind farms to speed the process of serving consumers with renewable energy .
The wind farms currently generate 169.5 megawatts of power ; that 's enough to power more than 55,000 homes , according to Google 's blog post on the investment .
Energy conservation and renewable energy have been key initiatives for Google for the past several years .
Last year , Google.org ( the company 's philanthropic arm ) rolled out PowerMeter , a service to help consumers monitor and optimize their energy usage .
It 's been bringing the service to more users and more " smart " devices and appliances throughout the 2009 with the PowerMeter API .
And in February 2010 , Google was granted an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to buy and sell energy at market rates , mostly to make energy management for its data centers more efficient , but also in case Google Energy ever becomes a power utility .
So why did Google choose NextEra for its wind farm investment ?
Google 's Green Business Operations Manager Rick Needham wrote today that this company " uses some of the latest wind turbine technology and control systems to provide one of the lowest - cost sources of renewable energy to the local grid .
The turbines can continuously adjust the individual blade pitch angles to achieve optimal efficiency and use larger blades with 15 percent more swept area than earlier generations , allowing capture of even more wind energy for each turbine .
The control systems for these wind farms are also advanced and dynamic , allowing for remote 24/7 monitoring and operation to ensure maximum turbine up - time and power production . "

Fox News host Glenn Beck 's apocalyptic political thriller has shrugged off a pile of bad reviews to debut at number one on the New York Times bestseller list this week .
The story of a young , handsome PR executive 's quest to save America from a 100 - year - old plot to destroy it , The Overton Window was described as " didactic , discursive [ and ] sporadically incoherent " in the Los Angeles Times , and as " not just a bad book ... an instructively bad book because it offers a complete colour - by - numbers picture of the contemporary Wingnut psyche " in the Daily Beast .
" Thrillers often are marred by laughable prose , but few have stumbled along with language as silly as this one , " added the Washington Post , pointing to hero Noah 's reaction on meeting his true love , patriot Molly , for the first time : " Something about this woman defied a traditional chick - at - a - glance inventory . "
The Los Angeles Times agreed .
" You really can't make this stuff up , " wrote its reviewer , Tim Rutten , before singling out the same passage : " Without a doubt , all the goodies were in all the right places , but no mere scale of one to 10 was going to do the job this time .
It was an entirely new experience for him .
Though he'd been in her presence for less than a minute , her soul had locked itself onto his senses , far more than her substance had . "
Despite this , Beck 's army of fans sent the thriller racing to the top of the New York Times fiction bestseller list , ahead of the latest outing for Stieg Larsson 's Lisbeth Salander in The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets ' Nest .
" We got the news last night , how appropriate , it will be on the New York Times list for the July 4th weekend premiering at number one .
It 's driving the New York Times crazy .
It 's driving every author crazy , " said Beck .
" It is driving every pseudohistorian and I say pseudohistorian because I think they have so twisted history , they do n't even know what 's true anymore , that the books that we talk about on the show go to number one . "
The rightwing presenter describes the novel as " faction " in his introduction , part of the category of " completely fictional books with plots rooted in fact " , and predicted that his " critics will be fierce and unforgiving " .
" They will accuse me of being every kind of conspiracy theorist they can invent – and they will base it all on the plot of a novel that they likely never even read , " he wrote .
Readers on Amazon were more positive about the book .
Giving it five stars , JadedD called Beck " the Ayn Rand of our time " , although perhaps damned The Overton Window in the eyes of some by saying that " the most notable part of this book is the title " .
Mom4honor only gave the novel three stars but said that she thanked God every day for Beck .
" He is the voice of reason in an unreasonable world !
Some call the millions of his listeners brainwashed , and to some extent I agree .
Our brains have been washed and cleansed of the outright lies we 've been fed by those whom we trusted with guarding our liberty , " she wrote .
The Overton Window is Beck 's sixth number - one bestseller .
According to his publisher , Simon & Schuster , he has previously reached the top spot with An Inconvenient Book , The Christmas Sweater , Glenn Beck 's Common Sense , Arguing With Idiots , and the children 's version of The Christmas Sweater .
HUNDREDS of complaints about myki have flooded into the Public Transport Ombudsman , a body set up by Victorian train , tram and bus operators to deal with complaints from Victorian commuters .
The news comes as figures released to the state opposition show ticket revenue on regional buses has fallen since myki was introduced .

The $ 1.35 billion myki card , three years late and $ 350 million over budget , was introduced on buses in six regional Victorian cities from late 2008 .
It is also running on Melbourne 's trains , but is not yet valid on the city 's trams and buses .
The government will not say when myki will be fully operational .
Last year , problems with myki malfunctioning on regional buses led to drivers often waving passengers on board without checking their tickets .

A Trojan circulating in Japan seeks to extort money from shame - faced fans of hentai - themed games .
Those who download illegal copies of ” over 18 ″ hentai - themed games from file sharing networks are liable to wind up with a nasty surprise , Trend Micro warns .
Some bogus files posing as games from Abel software attempt to trick victims into handing over personal information as part of a supposed game registration process .
Meanwhile , in the background , the malware is collecting information on the victim 's computer including domain , OS version , file use history and IE favourites .
Screenshots from a prospective mark 's PC are also obtained .
This data is then published on a publicly - viewable website before victims receive an email pointing them towards the incriminating content from Romancing Inc , which also maintains the domain hosting the incriminating data .
The email offers to resolve the “ copyright infringement ” and remove incriminating ( and potentially embarrassing ) information in exchange for a fee .
Trend Micro notes that the Trojan forming the centrepiece of the attack drops MP3 files on a victim 's machine that are elsewhere offered for sale online at an extortionate price of hundreds of thousands of dollars .
Security researcher Rik Ferguson writes : " Could it be that once a victim has shown themselves to be extortion - friendly they will get hit with yet another ' copyright infringement ' notice from Romancing Inc ?
Japanese copyright law was strengthened this year largely in an attempt to address the problem of illegal downloading .
" This is certainly another illustration of why , in the long run , you may well be better off paying up front for your downloads and steering clear of file - sharing networks . "
Previous scams along the same lines have claimed to be FBI notices of copyright infringement .
The Hentai - themed ruse goes further by publicly shaming prospective marks before hitting them with extortionate demands .

Since the news broke that the United States Grand Prix will return to the F1 calendar in 2012 I ’ve had emails from many fans in Austin , Texas about the project .
It ’s clear there ’s already great enthusiasm for the project from fans in the area .
In order for the event to be a success the race organisers need to start by getting the track right – something F1 has failed to do at many of its newest venues .
A dream solution
Fans have been vocal in their criticism of modern F1 circuits in recent years .
Happily the message finally seems to be getting through .
McLaren team principal and Formula One Teams ’ Association chairman Martin Whitmarch admitted in a recent interview with Autosport that circuit design is letting F1 down :
We ’ve had lots of circuits , with Abu Dhabi probably the most bizarre one , where money is no object and they started with a clean sheet of paper .
Yet you ’ve got probably one of the longest straights in F1 with a chicane and when do we ever see an overtake in a modern - day chicane ?
Martin Whitmarsh
So what should race promoter Tavo Hellmund build with his $ 250 m on an as - yet undeveloped plot of land in Austin ?
My dream solution for the American Grand Prix is for a race on a superspeedway .
IndyCars have abandoned monster tracks like Michigan Speedway and Fontana ( now the ‘ Auto Club ’ Speedway ) with their 390kph ( 242 m ph ) average lap speeds .
Although the FIA regulations do allow for F1 cars to race on ovals , I ’d be amazed if it ever happened .
And the challenges of building a superspeedway to F1 safety standards would be immense .
But , without wishing to trade in simplistic national stereotypes , F1 would do well to draw on the American philosophy of , ‘ bigger , better , faster ’ embodied in those fearsome superspeedways .
That ’s why I think the United States Grand Prix organisers should make it their mission to build the fastest circuit in Formula 1 for its return to America in 2012 .
‘ F1 ’s fastest race ’
In America , more than anywhere else , F1 needs a unique selling point .
It offers a completely different style of racing to NASCAR and cannot rival the home - grown popularity of that series .
Instead it should play to its own strengths , and put on a race that shows just what modern F1 cars are capable of .
F1 does not need another Valencia , another Bahrain or another Abu Dhabi .
In a country with tracks as dramatic as Elkhart Lake , Road Atlanta and Laguna Seca , another Hermann Tilke cookie cutter effort wo n’t cut it .
What F1 needs is a new Osterreichring .
When the Austrian circuit was first used for F1 40 years ago it stole Silverstone ’s crown as the fastest circuit in Formula 1 .
Today Monza holds that title – even with two very slow chicanes F1 cars lapped it at an average of 251 kph ( 155 m ph ) last year
Providing it can be done within the FIA ’s restrictions on circuit design , a new track in the style of the original Osterreiching with long straights and wide , fast corners could eclipse Monza ’s average lap speed .
Yes , it would need wide run off areas .
But by copying some of the better features of F1 ’s newest track Yas Island – its impact - absorbing TecPro barriers and raised spectator stands – this could be achieved without pushing the spectators too far away from the action .
Being able to sell the event as “ F1 ’s fastest race ” would be a boon for the race organisers .
But whatever they choose to do with their race , F1 cannot afford to waste another opportunity .
It has sampled nine different venues in America – more than it has in any other country – yet failed to find a long - term home .
This is the first time it will hold a race in America at a track purpose - built for F1 .
Gimmicks like pit tunnels and hotel bridges wo n’t be good enough .
F1 in America needs something truly special and different .
This is my idea for what it should be .

2012 United States Grand Prix
Written by Nick Youngblood
This story takes place in my second fortress .
My first fortress starved to death in the very first winter , because I misunderstood the summary screen .
I thought that the food I had in the “ Other ” category was actually edible , and so while it seemed like I had enough , in reality I began to starve days after winter began .
I still remember the sinking feeling I got when it rained at the beginning of spring , destroying the road I had built for the human traders .
That caravan was our only hope , and when the road became impassable , I knew that all was lost .
But I digress .
On the fate of the second fortress : I had perhaps 24 dwarves in my fortress going into autumn , and I was confident that we had more than enough food .
It would be a lean winter , but I was confident that we would make it through without going hungry .
However , days before winter began , I was visited by a group of migrants .
Now , apparently my fortress had become known as some sort of greatly sought - after dwarven vacation spot , because in one group of migrants I went from around 25 dwarves to just over twice that amount .
Twice as many mouths to feed and not enough food to fill them .
Horses and dogs were slaughtered wholesale to make up the lack , but partway through winter we began to starve .
Things were very desperate at this point , but I had learned from my previous mistakes and made sure my road was in good repair .
Then , I began to plant crops as fast as I could .
Every dwarf I had was assigned to this task .
I was sure that if we could just reap a single harvest , we could survive until the humans came to help us .
For a time it seemed as though my plan might work .
The two plots were almost sown , and soon we would have food enough to survive .
I knew that some would die , but we would make it .
I then see this on my screen : “ Olav Eitherok has gone stark raving mad !
Olav Eitherok has destroyed Plot !
Olav Eitherok has destroyed Plot ! ” I gaped at the screen .
One of my farmers had gone mad with hunger , and in his senseless rage destroyed the city ’s only chance at life .
I knew now that we were doomed , but I had one last task that I would finish before the end .
On the spot of those farms I constructed a stone sepulcher decorated with the finest stonework I could create , four statues at the cardinal points .
When Olav finally succumbed to starvation , I had him interred within those walls .
I imagined that in their final moments my dwarves carved the story of the fall of Glas Galak upon those stones , so that for all time those who visited this place would know of the infamy of Olav Eitherok , and how his reckless madness had doomed an entire people .
Only the dead inhabit Glas Galak now , but I find some small comfort in knowing that the name of the traitor Olav Eitherok will be cursed for all time , and that though he is dead , he will never be at peace .
If this story inspired you , with Peter Tyson 's new book .
Police and paramedics should be excluded from health and safety laws which could prevent them taking risks to save lives , the Tory peer reviewing the legislation has said .
Lord Young said there were " children dying because of health and safety " .
He told the Times that the emergency services were " paid for doing a job that involves risk " and legislation should not be " an excuse for inaction " .
The review is also designed to tackle the " growth of compensation culture " .
Earlier this week , Lord Young told the BBC he wanted advertisements for personal injury claims firms to be banned .
' Get sense back '
Lord Young told the Times there had been " three instances of police officers standing by watching children drown and not doing anything because of health and safety concerns " .
" Well , I 'm sorry , that is just wrong and we are going to change it , " he said .
He said that under current laws " the firemen could say they would n't go to a fire because it was too dangerous " .
" We 've just got to get sense back into the system , " he added .
Money in the health service should be spent on health Lord Young , On claims for compensation in the NHS
Lord Young told the BBC a " compensation culture " had been allowed to grow up over the past decade , which the previous Labour government had allowed in an effort to " save the legal aid budget " .
The peer , who served as a cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher , said the NHS had paid out £ 8bn in five years - only a third of which went to claimants , the rest to lawyers and claims companies .
" Now that is really something that should be stopped , " he said .
" Money in the health service should be spent on health , not on these things . "
But unions have warned against attacks on rules that protect staff and lawyers say " compensation culture " is a " myth " .
' Saturated ' with laws
Muiris Lyons , president of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers , told the BBC : " Our organisation is all about trying to reduce the incidents of injuries and I 'm sure there is common ground there [ with the review ] .
" But where people are needlessly injured , through others ' fault , they should be able to obtain access to justice . "
Last December , Prime Minister David Cameron said the UK had become " saturated " by health and safety laws .
In recent years children had been told to wear goggles to play conkers and trainee hairdressers had been banned from using scissors , he added .
But Labour said the comments were a " caricature " based on " myth and exaggeration " .
Lord Young 's review is expected to report back some time during the summer .
Image caption Prime Minister Zapatero has been under pressure to make faster cuts
Spain's PM has outlined a plan to tackle the country 's budget crisis , amid concerns that problems afflicting Greece may spread across the eurozone .
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero announced a 5 % cut to public sector salaries , as well as reductions to pensions and regional government funding .
He said the plan would save about 15bn euros ( $ 19bn ; £ 12.5 bn ) over two years .
At the weekend Spain said it wanted to drastically reduce its budget deficit , which currently stands at 11 % of GDP .
The aim of the new package is to trim this deficit to 6 % of GDP in 2011 .
In his speech to parliament , Mr Zapatero revealed other details of the plan .
Automatic increases in pensions will be suspended from 2011 and funding for regional governments cut .
" We aim to cut civil service wages by an average of 5 % in 2010 and freeze them in 2011 , " he added .
He said his own salary and those of senior cabinet members would be cut by 15 % .
SPANISH COST -CUTTING PLAN 5 % average pay cut for public workers in 2010
Payout scrapped to parents for birth of children
Automatic inflation - adjustments for pensions suspended
Funding to regions cut by 1.2bn euros
Your reaction - Spanish cuts
Mr Zapatero said he wanted " to contribute , with our financial stability , to the financial stability of the eurozone " .
The cabinet is to vote on the new proposals later this week .
The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Madrid says Mr Zapatero approved an austerity package in January but that since then little has happened .
Our correspondent says Mr Zapatero had shied away from really painful measures .
But Madrid is now under pressure from the European Commission to deliver .
EU jitters
The European Union has been anxious to see more fragile European economies including Spain , Portugal and Greece impose tougher austerity measures .
On Sunday it approved a 750 bn - euro rescue package to prop up European economies struggling with large debts .
Many Spaniards fear the effect the cuts will have on the economy , which has already contracted sharply , and where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 % - twice the eurozone average .
Mr Zapatero was speaking as government statistics showed Spain had moved out of recession in the first quarter of this year , with growth of 0.1 % .
On Tuesday US President Barack Obama called Mr Zapatero , urging him to take " resolute action " .
The White House said Mr Obama was actively engaged in lessening the global impact of Europe 's debt crisis .

( CNN ) --
An Irish - owned aid ship headed for Gaza wo n't stop until it 's forced to , a former U.N. official aboard the ship told CNN Thursday .
" We have not stopped and have no intention of stopping , " said former Assistant U.N. Secretary - General Denis Halliday from aboard the vessel .
" We will only stop when Israelis force us to do so . "
The MV Rachel Corrie , named for an American activist killed in Gaza several years ago , was expected to arrive late Friday or early Saturday off the coast of Gaza .
Israel was offering to unload its cargo in Israel 's Ashdod port , screen the material and then deliver it to Gaza , but fears of another high - seas confrontation were in the offing .
However , Halliday said the 11 people aboard the ship -- which is carrying 550 tons of cement to help in the effort to rebuild schools , homes and other building destroyed in Gaza -- had no plans of confronting Israelis who may stop the vessel .
" We will stand back and show we are harmless and unarmed -- we will put up no resistance , " he said .
" We 're not going to make any silly mistakes . "
Earlier Thursday , a Free Gaza Movement activist told CNN that the Rachel Corrie delayed its voyage while it was being equipped with video and satellite devices to to record what is happening on the vessel .
Adam Shapiro , Free Gaza board member , said the additions to the ship are being made for safety purposes .
Shapiro said Israel has made it clear it would intercept the ship , and he hopes recording technology on the ship will make a difference in the behavior of any soldiers who board the vessel .
" Israel will be sensitive to the fact that we 'll be recording what 's happening and streaming it live , " said Shapiro , who did n't identify where the Rachel Corrie is docking .
He said it will head toward Gaza within the week .
An Israeli government official , who spoke on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue , told CNN the government is offering to receive the ship 's cargo , as it has offered other vessels , if it docks at Ashdod 's port .
That was the same deal rejected by the flotilla of six ships bound for Gaza before Israeli commandos raided one of them Monday .
Halliday acknowledged that cement the aid ship is carrying is not considered by Israel as a form of humanitarian aid , but he said the ship will push forward to Gaza : " We do n't want to see our cement sitting there " in Ashdod .
Michael Oren , Israeli ambassador to the United States , said the two countries are having initial talks about opening up a dialogue to address the civilian needs of the people in Gaza and Israel 's security interests .
However , Oren said the dialogue would not involve an end to the Israeli blockade of Gaza .
Referring to comments by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who called the situation in Gaza " unsustainable , " Oren said , " We do n't disagree with that .
We are open to suggestions on how to ameliorate the situation . "
Haaretz , the Israeli daily newspaper , reported on Thursday that a " diplomatic solution " that would allow the vessel to dock at Ashdod " seems imminent . "
Citing European diplomats and senior Foreign Ministry officials in Jerusalem , the newspaper said " quiet messages have been exchanged over the past few days between Israel and the group operating the ship , to allow it to dock " in Israel .
But Shapiro said people on the ship deny that report and believe it is part of a misinformation campaign by the Israeli government .
Aside from himself , Halliday said there are 10 others on the ship : Nobel Peace Prize winner Mairead Maguire , six Malaysians and Free Gaza activist Derek Graham and Graham 's wife and an Irish lawmaker .
Graham has said the plan was for the Rachel Corrie to be unloaded in Gaza and then return to Ireland .
" We 're just hopeful the Israelis will let us make a small gesture for the people of Palestine , " Halliday said .
" Because we believe Monday was a gross error . "
He added that Monday 's confrontation resulted from " faults on both sides , " saying the effort on the Rachel Corrie is a " different ball game . "
The Irish government is asking that Israel not interfere with the ship .
Haaretz said it would have been in the Monday flotilla that had been halted by Israel but was delayed because of technical problems .
According to the Irish Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the vessel , owned by the Irish Free Gaza movement , sailed from Dundalk , Ireland , in mid-May .
Aboard are a number of Irish citizens .
Ireland 's minister of Foreign Affairs , Micheal Martin , has told the lower house of the Irish parliament that he has asked the Israeli ambassador to convey to his government his request that , " following the tragedy which has occurred , the Rachel Corrie be allowed to continue unimpeded , and to deliver its cargo to Gaza . "
" We will be watching this situation very closely -- as indeed will the world -- and it is imperative that Israel avoid any action which leads to further bloodshed , " he said .
The Rachel Corrie left Ireland laden with educational materials , toys and medical equipment along with the cement in the latest effort by peace activists to deliver humanitarian goods and break Israel 's blockade , according to aid organizers .
Israel says it needs to have its naval blockade of Gaza to stop weaponry from being transported to militants there intent on attacking Israel .
The Free Gaza Movement said customs officials and a senator from the Irish Green Party inspected the vessel and found no weapons .
Israeli commandos stormed a six- vessel flotilla early Monday in order to stop it from reaching Gaza .
Violence erupted on one of the ships , leading to the deaths of nine people , all Turkish citizens -- including one of dual Turkish - American nationality , as well as many injured people .
Israel said its commandos were attacked and passengers said the troops assaulted them .
Israel briefly detained the 600 or so flotilla passengers .
The state eventually released all of the foreigners and four Israeli Arabs from prison .
The Israeli citizens , all activists , remain under house arrest until next week .
One of the four Israeli Arabs -- Sheik Raed Salah , leader of the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel -- told CNN that some people initially aboard the flotilla have since disappeared .
" There is only one explanation -- that some passengers were thrown in the sea , " Salah said .
" No one knows how many are there , unless after a detailed search that might last days or weeks , we do n't know .
There are passengers who were thrown in the sea during the attack on the freedom flotilla . "
The violence has sparked official and grassroots rage from capitals and street protests outside the Middle East on Thursday .
South Africa recalled its ambassador to Israel .
Turkish President Abdullah
Gul said that the once - close Turkish - Israeli ties " will never be the same .
This incident has left an irreparable and deep scar . "
Thousands of angry people attended a mass funeral in Istanbul for the victims and chanted slogans against Israel , and Turkish activists on the ship returned from Israel to a hero 's welcome .
At the United Nations , the Security Council has called for an inquiry of the raid and the Human Rights Council voted for a probe , but Israel says it alone and not an international entity should be investigating .
Mark Regev , the Israeli prime minister 's office spokesman , said after military operations , it is Israel 's " standard practice " to carry out " a prompt , professional , transparent and objective investigation in accordance with the highest international standards . "
One Israeli official , who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to comment on the subject , said , " the demand for a U.N. investigation shows a clear double standard towards Israel .
It shows hypocrisy and singles out the Jewish state for special treatment . "
" There is no case in recent history where a democratic country 's army has been involved in an overseas operation in which civilians have been killed , and has been subjected to an international investigation . "
The Israel Defense Forces Military Advocate General -- the body that ensures that the rule of law is upheld within the military -- said in a report that the interception of the Gaza flotilla was legal under international law .
The body said that international law allows for a country to stop a vessel in international waters if it attempts to breach a naval blockade -- even before such a blockade is actually breached .
" If it resists capture and refuses to stop , after prior warning , it may be attacked , " the MAG said .
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman told Israel Radio on Thursday that members of the flotilla were carrying large amounts of cash , a suggestion that people on the ship had untoward and not humanitarian intentions .
An Israel Defense Forces official said troops continued to count money they found , saying that they discovered envelopes in bundles ranging from $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 .

By the end of this article , you will know the answer to the question no one ever asked :
Whose games are better , Pixar or Dreamworks ?
With next week ’s release of Toy Story 3 ( SQUEEE ! ) , Pixar and Dreamworks are poised for more than a battle at the box office .
We ’ve done our damnedest to pit the most comparable movie games from both companies head - to - side - grinning - head using their highest ranking game .
And only the first game to stem from the movie .
No spin - offs , sideshoots , and most importantly , no Game Boy Color games !
That sad sort of shit has been thankfully relegated to the iPhone App Store .
WARNING : POTENTIAL BIAS !
While I carry a deep affection for almost every Pixar film , I consider every Dreamworks Animation movie that is n’t Kung Fu Panda to be a derivative puddle of pop culture - spewing , donkey piss .
However , the games were not selected so as to rig the contest in either company ’s favor .
Toy Story vs Shrek
For the most part we ’ll be looking at movies / games that came out within the same time period , but how could I not kick things off with these two heavyweights ?
Shrek is to Dreamworks what Woody is to Pixar .
Each icon is synonymous with the studios ’ most recognizable films , and their successful execution would pave the way subsequent theatrical CGI would be realized in terms of tone , style and production .
The toys take the win here , but obviously , there are several years between the two games .
And to be fair , Toy Story for Genesis came out during a time when mascot platformers were still all the rage , whereas Shrek did n’t have that luxury while being developed by a company known primarily for manufacturing blank cassette tapes .
The playing field from here on out will get much more balanced …
Ah , and thus we see the emergence of a notorious rivalry .
Did Dreamworks rip off Pixar , or was it just a case of parallel thought ?
Neither , actually .
Jeffery Katzenberg left Disney well aware A Bug ’s Life was in development at Pixar , but greenlit Antz anyway soon after creating Dreamworks , as it had been in varying stages of development for some time and character textures on insects ( as opposed to animal fur or human skin ) seemed far more doable given the current stage of CG technology .
Both movies were different enough to enjoy success , but the fact that Antz was rushed through production , seemingly with the sole purpose of beating A Bug ’s Life to the box office , remained a point of contention between the two animation companies .
Oh , the games ?
They ’re both utter dog shit barely worth revisiting .
Having almost cleared Dreamworks of plagiarism charges above , here we find them at their most rippy - offest !
Antz proved that they can crank shit out faster than Pixar ( Fact : Dreamworks has already produced more theatrical films than Pixar did with a three year lead ! ) but the similarities here start to get …
Christ , I ’m really trying not to say “ fishy ” because that would imply it was n’t outright theft .
As if the aquatic copycatting were n’t enough to have Pixar fans throwing poisoned McDonalds glasses over the gates of Dreamworks HQ , kindly note this tidbit :
The Shark Tale game scored higher than Finding Nemo on all platforms !
Attentive readers may already know why …
There once was a time when the government relied on a very blunt way of regulating the economy .
It told companies and individuals what they could do and what they could not do .
These were the days of command - and - control regulation .
But then came the market revolution of the last three decades .
With the Soviet empire collapsing , the United States economy growing more rapidly than Europe ’s , and newly market - friendly China and India booming , people saw the drawbacks of command and control .
Governments were usually better off avoiding outright bans and instead giving people incentives to behave in productive ways .
The classic example was environmental policy .
Most famously , a 1990 bill signed by the first President Bush forced coal plants to buy permits if they were going to emit the sulfur dioxide that caused acid rain .
With the price of emissions suddenly higher , the plants looked for innovative ways to reduce pollution  and succeeded more rapidly and cheaply than experts had predicted .
This history is the basic argument for putting a price on carbon today , and the next several weeks are likely to determine whether that happens .
The chances of Congress ’s passing a permit  or cap - and - trade  system that applies to the whole economy are low .
But it could still create a version that covered power plants , if not factories and transportation .
That would be no small thing .
PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - New Jersey politicians are due to battle on Monday over whether to slap a tax on millionaires or cut services for low - income senior citizens and the disabled .
The clash in the state legislature is part of a wider battle over how to erase a $ 10.7 billion budget deficit and is emblematic of the decisions facing states across America whose budget deficits have soared during the recession .
Democrats want to re-impose a one - year tax on millionaires that has been vetoed by Republican Governor Chris Christie .
The 10.75 percent tax on income above $ 1 million would hit 16,000 people , some of them likely to work as financial professionals just across the Hudson River in New York .
Both houses of the legislature , which are controlled by Democrats , previously approved the tax in May but it was immediately vetoed by Christie , who has pledged not to raise taxes .
The tax would raise $ 637 million that the state would use to fund rebate checks of up to $ 1,295 for some 600,000 senior citizens who would otherwise face steep increases in their property taxes during fiscal 2011 .
According to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services , a retired couple living on a fixed income of $ 40,000 would see an increase of $ 1,320 in taxes under the governor ’s plan while a family making $ 1.2 million would receive a tax cut of $ 11,598 .
“ Governor Christie ’s heartless vetoes denied property tax relief to senior citizens struggling to make ends meet , ” Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Cryan said in a statement .
The governor vetoed the tax because it would deter hiring , Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said .
“ These are the people who invest in New Jersey , ” Drewniak said .
“ That ’s where a lot of the hiring and the business expansion would come from . ”
Cryan appealed to the minority Republicans to join Democrats in Monday ’s vote after the original legislation passed by 46 to 32 , along party lines .
Democrats need 54 votes to override a veto .
Senate President Stephen Sweeney said he would immediately hold a vote in the Senate if the override is passed in the Assembly .
If it succeeds , the override would be the first since 1997 .
Two months after taking office in January , Christie announced cuts to hundreds of state programs and spending reductions in every department , calling New Jersey ’s budget hole a “ grand canyon . ”
In his May 20 veto of the tax , Christie said the bill would have represented the 116th increase in taxes in the last eight years .
New Jersey ’s shortfall , at 37.4 percent of the current year ’s budget , is the second - highest among U.S. states behind Nevada , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .

Well that sure did n’t take long .
The iPad just went on sale in Japan this past Friday and it ’s already being used as a prop in an incredible street performance by a 28 year old Japanese magician named Shinya .
The performance is unbelievable , and though the iPad video is pre-recorded , the sleight of hands are legit and the overall timing spot on .
Turns out the iPad really is a “ magical ” device after all .

It was almost enough to make you feel sorry for mayoral hopeful Rob Ford — and no one was even asking for drugs :
The occasion was yet another candidates ’ meeting , but this one was at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the subject was architecture and urban planning .
Needless to say , the poor man was seriously out of his depth .
So was George Mammoliti for that matter , but at least he had something to say about the issues , even if it was ridiculous .
The others — George Smitherman , Sarah Thomson , Joe Pantalone and Rocco Rossi — all presented passable arguments Wednesday , though some were better informed than others .
Rossi showed he had done his homework when he mentioned New York planning maven Amanda Burden , who gave a talk here several months ago .
Smitherman also demonstrated he has been paying attention in mentioning the need to stop the proposed sport facility the city wants to put in the Lower Don Lands , contrary to years of planning .
Pantalone defended the city ’s record , pointing out that the planning process may be long and lugubrious , but that “ 100 cranes ” are hard at work “ churning out ” new buildings in Toronto .
Thomson made it clear she really , really , wanted Toronto to be more beautiful .
She thought that might be accomplished by introducing more ethnic architecture to the city , though she did n’t explain what exactly that would mean .
Mammoliti suggested getting rid of all city planners and lawyers , and letting the private sector fill the gap .
No surprise , the second part — about lawyers — drew a stronger response than the first .
But as for sad - sack Ford , the evening was a disaster , a display of ignorance so deep it threatened to swallow the debate like some giant intellectual sinkhole ;
In the end , the audience could only laugh , albeit nervously .
Given his showing in recent polls , one can only conclude that suburban anger has reached the point where it has turned people ’s brains to mush .
The fact that Ford wears his lack of knowledge as a badge of honour further underlines the sheer nihilism of his campaign .
There was also much discussion about Toronto ’s chief planner , and the fact that in the current civic organization , he or she reports to an assistant city manager .
The serious contenders all acknowledged the critical importance of planning and pledged to make changes .
“ Planning is probably the foremost task that city hall has to do , ” Rossi declared .
The chief planner , he continued , should “ report directly to the mayor . ”
“ Do we seek greatness or do we seek mediocrity ? ” he asked .
“ Every opportunity is an opportunity for great design . ”
Smitherman pledged “ to elevate planning and transition it from reactive to proactive . ”
He also wants “ to eliminate some of the horse - trading ” that goes on at city hall .
And , he rightly pointed out , the Ontario Municipal Board does little more than “ create face - cover for councillors . ”
“ We need to have a major debate about how we do planning in Toronto , ” Pantalone said .
“ An elephant looks different depending on where you grab it . ”
That was the best line of the night , even though no one was sure quite what it meant , or how it related to planning .
Even Mammoliti recognized that getting a topnotch chief planner will be difficult once Gary Wright retires in January .
“ Good people wo n’t want to work with this system , ” he admitted .
No doubt about that , either .
But , of course , we ’ve heard it all before .
As has been observed many times , the fact remains that Toronto does n’t control its own destiny .
That privilege belongs to the province , which was n’t on the agenda Wednesday night .

Conventional solar cell efficiency could be increased from the current limit of 30 percent to more than 60 percent , suggests new research on semiconductor nanocrystals , or quantum dots , led by chemist Xiaoyang Zhu at The University of Texas at Austin .
Zhu and his colleagues report their results in this week ’s Science .
The scientists have discovered a method to capture the higher energy sunlight that is lost as heat in conventional solar cells .
The maximum efficiency of the silicon solar cell in use today is about 31 percent .
That ’s because much of the energy from sunlight hitting a solar cell is too high to be turned into usable electricity .
That energy , in the form of so - called “ hot electrons , ” is lost as heat .
If the higher energy sunlight , or more specifically the hot electrons , could be captured , solar - to - electric power conversion efficiency could be increased theoretically to as high as 66 percent .
“ There are a few steps needed to create what I call this ‘ ultimate solar cell , ' ” says Zhu , professor of chemistry and director of the Center for Materials Chemistry .
“ First , the cooling rate of hot electrons needs to be slowed down .
Second , we need to be able to grab those hot electrons and use them quickly before they lose all of their energy . ”
Zhu says that semiconductor nanocrystals , or quantum dots , are promising for these purposes .
As for the first problem , a number of research groups have suggested that cooling of hot electrons can be slowed down in semiconductor nanocrystals .
In a 2008 paper in Science , a research group from the University of Chicago showed this to be true unambiguously for colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals .
Zhu ’s team has now figured out the next critical step : how to take those electrons out .
They discovered that hot electrons can be transferred from photo - excited lead selenide nanocrystals to an electron conductor made of widely used titanium dioxide .
“ If we take the hot electrons out , we can do work with them , ” says Zhu .
“ The demonstration of this hot electron transfer establishes that a highly efficient hot carrier solar cell is not just a theoretical concept , but an experimental possibility . ”
The researchers used quantum dots made of lead selenide , but Zhu says that their methods will work for quantum dots made of other materials , too .
He cautions that this is just one scientific step , and that more science and a lot of engineering need to be done before the world sees a 66 percent efficient solar cell .
In particular , there ’s a third piece of the science puzzle that Zhu is working on : connecting to an electrical conducting wire .
“ If we take out electrons from the solar cell that are this fast , or hot , we also lose energy in the wire as heat , ” says Zhu .
“ Our next goal is to adjust the chemistry at the interface to the conducting wire so that we can minimize this additional energy loss .
We want to capture most of the energy of sunlight .
That ’s the ultimate solar cell .
“ Fossil fuels come at a great environmental cost , ” says Zhu .
“ There is no reason that we can not be using solar energy 100 percent within 50 years . ”

Solar !
Solar came to the Shelter as a stray but in a rather unique way - by hanging out under the Shelter solar panels !
For the past couple months , staff have observed Solar relaxing on the roof and have been slowly befriending her .
She was rather skittish and would run off when people attempted to approach her .
Slowly but surely , Solar warmed up to us and allowed a staff member to pick her up and bring her indoors to safety .
If you are interested in meeting Solar or any of our other adoptable animals , come into the Santa Cruz County Animal Shelter at 1001 Rodriguez Street in Santa Cruz during business hours ( 10 - 6 pm daily ) .

In honor of the 40th anniversary of the original release of Bitches Brew , Miles Davis ' 1970 paradigm - shifting landmark fusion breakthrough , we 've created our own Bitches Brew -- a dark beer that 's a fusion of three threads of imperial stout and one thread of honey beer with gesho root .
It 's a gustatory analog to Miles ' masterpiece .
Featuring the album 's iconic artwork , created by the late Mati Klarwein , on its label , Dogfish Head 's Bitches Brew was unveiled at SAVOR , An American Craft Beer & Food Experience , on June 5 , 2010 , at the National Building Museum , Washington DC .
Have n't experienced the Bitches Brew album ?
Two 40th anniversary editions of Miles Davis ' Bitches Brew -- a Legacy Edition and a deluxe Collector 's Edition -- are available .
According to Dogfish founder and president Sam Calagione , the ale is " the ultimate partner for chili or spicy curry chicken " and best enjoyed " sipped cool , not cold , from a snifter or red wine glass while listening to the Bitches Brew album . "
Sam was drawn to the alchemical spirits in Bitches Brew right out of college , acquiring a copy of the album " within months of the first time I brewed a batch of homebrew in my apartment in New York City .
I listened to it when I was writing my Dogfish business plan .
I wanted Dogfish Head to be a maniacally inventive and creative brewery , analog beer for the digital age .
You could say that my dream was to have Dogfish Head , in some small way , stand for the same thing in the beer world that Bitches Brew stands for in the jazz world .
You can imagine how excited we are to be doing this project 17 years after I wrote that business plan . "
" There 's a spirit of innovation , of creativity and individuality , that 's at the core of Miles ' music , " said Adam Block , Senior Vice President and General Manager , Legacy Recordings .
" Sam and Dogfish Head approach their art from the same place and consequently the marriage is an easy and cool one . "
Who can resist finding a piece of treasure left on the ground ?
That 's the idea behind this prank , where an Office 2007 Ultimate box was rigged with an alarm .

Alert : Egypt – Egyptian citizen tortured to death in public
Contents
1. Summary
2. Background
1. Summary
Khaled Mohamed Saeed Sobhy Qasem , 28 years old and owner of an import and export company , was killed on Tuesday 8 June 2010 by security informants in Alexandria , Egypt .
Khaled was arrested after objecting to the security and police informants ’ methods during a search of the internet café he was at .
He was roughly manhandled and pushed out onto the streets before being dragged into a nearby building entrance where he was viciously beaten and kicked .
Eye witnesses reported that the police then took him in a police vehicle only to come back later and dump his dead body .
2. Background
Khaled Saed ’s family filed a complaint with the General Prosecutor against the Ministry of Interior calling for the investigation of their son ’s death .
The victim ’s family accuse security informers and police officers of torturing Khaled outside the internet cafe as well as during the time in between arresting him and dumping his body on the streets .
The family insisted on their right to bring all perpetrators before the judiciary .
Ahmed Saed said that when he heard the news of his brother ’s death , he went to Major Emad El - Din Abdel Zaher , Head of Sidi Gaber State Security Investigations , to find out the reason behind the arrest .
The Major informed him that his brother was a drug addict and the reason behind his death was due to a drug overdose in the police station .
Ahmed Saed stressed that his brother was not detained during that night in any detention or police station as the time between him being beaten outside the cafe and his body being dumped in the streets was 10 minutes .
His mother , Layla Marzouq , stressed that she knows the reasons behind his killing .
According to Al - Shorouq newspaper she said that her son had recorded a video showing police officers and informers involved in drug trafficking activity .
Khaled sent the video to his friends over a month ago and said that he would make a blog to expose these crimes .
She added that she is surprised that they never threatened him before they came to kill him as is usual practice by Egyptian police .
Ahmed Saed , the victim ’s brother , said that Alexandria ’s Prosecutors Office ordered an investigation by a coroner to reveal the reasons and circumstances of Khaled ’s death .
IHRC condemns the use of the Emergency Law against civilians and urges the Egyptian government to abolish it as it is being used to commit shocking human rights violations by the Egyptian authorities .
IHRC calls for the immediate investigation of the killing of Khaled Saed and the reasons behind his death and to bring all the perpetrators before justice .

Surgeon cut off testicle ' by mistake ' at Bury hospital
Dr Al Hourani was working as a locum surgeon at Fairfield General Hospital A patient lost a testicle during an operation because the surgeon cut it off by mistake , a General Medical Council ( GMC ) hearing has been told .
Dr Sulieman Al Hourani was only supposed to cut out a cyst , but removed the whole right testicle instead .
Dr Al Hourani was a locum surgeon at Fairfield General Hospital in Bury , Greater Manchester , at the time of the surgery in September 2007 .
He is accused of misconduct and also of stealing medication .
It is alleged the doctor , who is now practising in Jordan and was not present at the hearing , also injected himself with a drug meant for a patient .
Sarah Prichard , counsel for the GMC , said the mistake was made as a nurse helping the surgeon turned her back to get a stitch .
When she turned around the testicle had been removed .
Doctor dismissed Ms Prichard said : " Literally as the nurse turned away to get a transfixion stitch , the incident occurred and the testicle was removed .
" Such was the level of concern they immediately realised it could be a serious medical incident and took steps to complete the relevant documentation . "
A month later it is alleged that the doctor , who qualified after studying at Jordan University of Science and Technology , stole two boxes of dihydrocodeine from a treatment room on a ward at the same hospital .
An investigation was launched and the doctor was dismissed by his employer , Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust , which ran the hospital .
The GMC was told of another incident in August 2006 , when Dr Al Hourani had consulted a colleague and was advised to inject a patient with 10 milligrams ( mg ) of midazolam , a powerful sedative drug .
He then gave the patient 8 mg and injected himself with the other 2 mg , the hearing was told .
The case against Dr Al Hourani is being heard in his absence as he was notified of the hearing but chose not to " engage " with the GMC or appoint lawyers to represent him .
The case , scheduled to last three weeks , was adjourned until Tuesday .

Farmers planting strawberries and other crops in California will soon have to contend with cancer - causing poison instead of bugs , worms and fungus if regulators get their wish .
The California Department of Pesticide Regulation has proposed registering methyl iodide as a pesticide in California to the dismay of scientists and environmental groups , who say it is so toxic that even chemists are reluctant to handle it .
The chemical will become legal for growers to use after a 60 - day comment period ending June 29 unless there is some kind of public outcry .
" This is one of the most egregious pesticides out there , " said Sarah Aird , the state field organizer for Californians for Pesticide Reform , a coalition of watchdog groups opposed to the use of potentially harmful chemicals .
" It is really , really toxic .
It is actually used in the laboratory to induce cancer cells . "
Methyl iodide was approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2007 for use as a fumigant over the protests of more than two dozen California legislators and 54 scientists , including five Nobel laureates , who signed a letter opposing registration of the chemical .
Bush - era decision
It was approved as a replacement for methyl bromide , which experts wanted phased out because its fumes waft into the atmosphere and damage the ozone layer .
Appeals have recently been made to the Obama administration to overturn the Bush - era decision .
Methyl iodide is now licensed for use in 47 states , but it is expensive and used only sparingly in Florida and the Carolinas , mostly on strawberries and occasionally on tomatoes and peppers .
Eleven states have used it at least once , according to researchers .
No problems have been documented , but very few studies have been conducted , Aird and others said .
California is considered a key battleground in the fight against methyl iodide because agriculture is a major part of the economy .
The substance , produced by Arysta LifeScience Corp. , is used primarily to prepare strawberry fields for planting because that fruit is particularly susceptible to soil - borne pests .
The stuff is normally mixed into the dirt and covered with tarps .
It kills weed seeds , insects , microscopic worms , bacteria and fungal diseases that infect plant roots .
" Fumigants , including methyl iodide , sterilize soil prior to planting , " said Lea Brooks , spokeswoman for the Department of Pesticide Regulation .
" It is injected into soil .
It is not applied onto plants or fruit . "
Brooks said the department is aware that methyl iodide is toxic , but management concluded that it could be used safely as long as protective measures were in place .
If it gets registered , she said , anyone who uses the chemical will have to set up buffer zones , limit application rates and treat only a limited amount of acreage at a time .
She said California 's exposure limits are twice as strict as EPA's .
Flirting with disaster
Susan Kegley , a consulting scientist for Pesticide Action Network , a nonprofit public interest group in San Francisco , said approving methyl iodide would be a flirtation with disaster no matter how many safeguards are in place .
" This stuff just kills everything , " said Kegley , a chemist , who pointed out that even low doses have caused neurological damage and fetal death in laboratory animals .
" It is a known carcinogen . "
Methyl iodide has been linked to thyroid disease , including cancerous tumors that can also affect the lungs and brain , she said .
If tarps typically used to cover the treated soil were to blow off , she said , the substance could waft into the air .
" We are likely to see a greater incidence of thyroid disease with use of this chemical , " said Kegley , who wears double gloves and uses syringes , a fume hood and ventilation devices whenever she handles the chemical in the lab .
" The only good thing about methyl iodide is that it does n't deplete the ozone layer . "
What 's really baffling , Kegley said , is that the state 's own scientists concluded that the chemical posed a potential risk to public health .
The department then appointed an outside review panel , which essentially came out with the same results .
Brooks said the department incorporated many of the review panel 's suggestions in the final risk assessment .
" However , the members are experts in assessing pesticide risks , not in regulatory risk management that leads to decisions on registration , " Brooks wrote in an e-mail to The Chronicle .
" Panel members were not familiar with the many options and measures that can be put into place by risk managers to avoid unsafe exposure levels . "
Pesticide opponents believe Arysta lobbyists put pressure on legislators and the regulatory agency to approve the pesticide .
" This is one of these chemicals that chemists give great respect to , " Kegley said .
" Allowing releases into the soil by farmers and others without training in safe handling techniques is ludicrous . "

BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel roundly rebuffed U.S. President Barack Obama 's call for Germans to aid the global recovery by spending more and relying less on exports , even as she warned that Europe 's own financial crisis is far from over .
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in her Berlin chancellery , an unapologetic Ms. Merkel said the nations that share the beleaguered euro have merely bought some time to fix the flaws in their monetary union .
She called on the Group of 20 industrial and developing nations meeting in Toronto this weekend to send a signal that tougher financial - market regulation is on its way to dispel the impression that momentum is fading amid resistance by big banks .
She took aim at an idea voiced by France , the U.S. and others that Germany should help global producers by spurring its persistently weak consumer demand and ending its dependence on unsustainable spending elsewhere .
The latest call came in a letter last Friday from Mr. Obama to the G - 20 , in which he asked big exporters — Germany , China and Japan — to rebalance global demand by boosting consumer spending .
Ms. Merkel countered that Germany 's growth and employment are rising — and therefore the world 's fourth - largest economy has no reason to rethink its dependence on its powerhouse industrial sector and large trade surplus .
" German export successes reflect the high competitiveness and innovation strength of our companies , " she said .
" Artificially reducing Germany 's competitiveness would be of no use to anyone . "
The U.S. reiterated its stance Wednesday .
" It is important for European growth in particular , and the world more generally , that advanced surplus economies in Europe strengthen the contribution of internal demand to growth , " a senior administration official said .
IEEE 's Erico Guizzo visited the lab of Masatoshi Ishikawa , a professor at the University of Tokyo , and videotaped this demo of his machine that scans the text and images of a book as you flip through its pages .
Ishikawa is well known in robotics circles for his Matrix bullet time - style amazing demos — like a robo - hand that can dribble a ball and catch objects in midair with superhuman dexterity .
How he does it ?
A Super Vision Chip ( that 's what he calls it ) that can " see " events too fast for the eye .
Ishikawa and his colleagues are already working on several applications — including a microscope that can track individual bacteria and a video game motion - capture system ( similar to Microsoft's Project Natal ) for gesture playing .
Late last year when I visited the lab , they showed me their latest creation : a superfast book scanner .
The system , developed by lab members Takashi Nakashima and Yoshihiro Watanabe , lets you scan a book by rapidly flipping its pages in front of a high - speed camera .
They call this method book flipping scanning .
They told me they can digitize a 200 - page book in one minute , and hope to make that even faster .
The challenge is particularly daunting in France , which has done less to reduce the state ’s obligations than some of its neighbors .
In Sweden and Switzerland , 7 of 10 people work past 50 .
In France , only half do .
The legal retirement age in France is 60 , while Germany recently raised it to 67 for those born after 1963 .
With the retirement of the baby boomers , the number of pensioners will rise 47 percent in France between now and 2050 , while the number under 60 will remain stagnant .
The French call it “ du baby boom au papy boom , ” and the costs , if unchanged , are unsustainable .
The French state pension system today is running a deficit of 11 billion euros , or about $ 13.8 billion ; by 2050 , it will be 103 billion euros , or $ 129.5 billion , about 2.6 percent of projected economic output .
President Nicolas Sarkozy has vowed to pass major pension reform this year .
There have been two contentious overhauls , in 2003 and 2008 ; the government , afraid to lower pensions , wants to increase taxes on high salaries and increase the years of work .
But the unions are unhappy , and the Socialist Party opposes raising the retirement age .
Polls show that while most French see a pension overhaul as necessary , up to 60 percent say working past 60 is not the answer .
Jean - François Copé , the parliamentary leader for Mr. Sarkozy ’s center - right party , says that change is painful , but necessary .
“ The point is to preserve our model and keep it , ” he said .
“ We need to get rid of bad habits .
The Germans did it , and we can do the same . ”
More broadly , many across Europe say the Continent will have to adapt to fiscal and demographic change , because social peace depends on it .
“ Europe wo n’t work without that , ” said Joschka Fischer , the former German foreign minister , referring to the state ’s protective role .
“ In Europe we have nationalism and racism in a politicized manner , and those parties would have exploited grievances if not for our welfare state , ” he said .
“ It ’s a matter of national security , of our democracy . ”
France will ultimately have to follow Sweden and Germany in raising the pension age , he argues .
“ This will have to be harmonized , Europeanized , or it wo n’t work — you ca n’t have a pension at 67 here and 55 in Greece , ” Mr. Fischer said .

' I'm feeling great , ' says Nicolas Mahut before resuming the longest ever tennis match , currently tied at 59 - 59 in the final set

It 's remarkable that he can even walk today .
But as he limbered up on the practice courts , Nicolas Mahut , the 28 - year - old Frenchman whose unfinished Wimbledon joust with the American John Isner , 25 , is making tennis history , was looking forward to more .
With 10 hours played so far , the fifth set alone stretching to seven hours , six minutes and standing at 59 - 59 , one could imagine he slept soundly after the two players left Court 18 yesterday evening owing to failing light .
" To be honest , I slept only four hours , " Mahut said , as he prepared to resume the epic battle that has propelled him and Isner into the record books .
" I 'm feeling great .
I have to finish the match .
It 's just unbelievable what happened yesterday and two days ago .
" I 'm feeling good , I just feel the tiredness .
I just want to come on court and enjoy it , finish the job and win it .
" We both enjoyed it a lot yesterday .
We had fun .
The crowd was fantastic , most amazing atmosphere .
We had a lot of fun on court .
" I 'm ready to play as I need to play . "
It was Mahut who finally implored the officials to take the players off shortly after 9 pm .
By then the match , which started on Tuesday , had lasted exactly 10 hours and notched up 163 games .
Umpire Mohamed Lahyani , who sat through the longest match without even a toilet break , actually wanted it to go on longer .
" I sat there for 10 hours but I wanted them to go on to a hundred games each , " he told London 's Evening Standard as he left the court last night .
" It has been an amazing game .
It is something very special . "
Afterwards fans mobbed him for his autograph and to pose for photographs with him .
But Isner 's mother , Karen , was less excited by the length of the match .
She told the Standard : " I can't bear it – it should n't happen .
There should be tie breaks .
This is crazy .
Insane .
" I just wanted him off the court .
I wanted him to stop playing " .
So far the match , due to resume after 3.30 pm today , has seen Isner set a new record for the most number of aces served by one player in a men 's singles match , with 98 .
Mahut 's 95 aces puts him in second place .
A total of 114 balls have been used so during their battle .
Is anyone else tired of all the " recovery " talk and how retail sales are up , and jobs are improving ?
Here 's the deal .
Same store sales are meaningless when dozens of chains went bankrupt and thousands of weak stores closed .
Moreover , alleged improvements in hiring do not mean diddly squat if income tax receipts are down .
With that backdrop please consider Budget Deficit in U.S. Widened to $ 82.7 Billion
The U.S. posted its largest April budget deficit on record as receipts declined in a month that typically sees an increase in individual income tax payments .
The excess of spending over revenue rose to $ 82.7 billion last month compared with a $ 20.9 billion gap in April 2009 , the Treasury Department said today in Washington .
It was the second April deficit since 1983 and exceeded the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey .
April marked a record 19th straight monthly shortfall , highlighting the challenges facing the Obama administration .
Deterioration in the government ’s balance sheet in coming years raises the risk of higher interest rates even as an improving economy helps lift tax receipts .
“ With the recovery in place , we should be seeing higher revenue and lower outlays , not the other way around , ” said Win Thin , senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York .
For the deficit as a share of gross domestic product to decline this year , “ we need to see some improvement in coming months , ” he said .
The last time the U.S. had back - to - back April deficits was 1963 - 1964 .
The government has reported budget surpluses in 43 of the past 56 Aprils .
For the fiscal year that began in October , the budget deficit totaled $ 799.7 billion compared with $ 802.3 billion during the same period last year .
Revenue and other income fell 7.9 percent to $ 245.3 billion in April from $ 266.2 billion the same month last year , the Treasury said .
Corporate tax receipts totaled $ 77.1 billion for the year to date , an increase of 8.9 percent .
Individual income tax collections were down 11.6 percent so far this fiscal year to $ 500.8 billion .
The Treasury is beginning to get a lift from an expanding economy as it emerges from the worst recession since the 1930s .
The economy grew 3.2 percent from January through March , the third straight quarter of growth , helping the government to cut long - term borrowing for the first time since 2007 .
Lift !?
What " Lift " Are You Talking About ?
As the end of the home buyer tax credit neared last month , we all argued whether or not the increase in sales and the relative price stabilization could survive on their own .
The first clues indicate the answer is : No .
Metros With Price Reduction Levels of 30 % or More
We expect to hit turbulence in some markets , ” says Pete Flint , Trulia co-founder and CEO .
“ We wo n’t know the true severity of the tax credit expiration until the conclusion of the peak home buying season in the summer months .
Only then will we have a better sense if the U.S. housing market can stand on its own two feet . ”

That ’s when the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) first began developing regulations for sunscreen products — and still has not implemented anything in 32 years .
Manufacturers have been able for decades to promote their sun-block lotions without proving they ’re “ waterproof , ” “ broad - based ” or “ lasts all day . ”
More importantly , because no federal standards exist , consumers have no way of knowing if the SPF level of a product means anything and if they are really getting the protection that numbers such as “ 50 ” imply .
Public health and consumer groups have objected to some SPF claims of sunscreen manufacturers .
The Environmental Working Group examined 500 products on the market and came away recommending only 39 .
The FDA came close to issuing regulations in 1999 , but officials backed off after the Cosmetic , Toiletry and Fragrance Association objected to certain rules .
FDA officials said they pulled the regulations because the proposal only addressed products offering protection against UVB radiation — which causes sunburns — and not UVA radiation , which leads to premature aging of the skin .
But both types of ultraviolet radiation can lead to skin cancer .

Image caption Felipe Calderon has called on the US to halt the flow of assault weapons
Police in Texas have seized a cache of weapons allegedly being smuggled to drug gangs in Mexico .
The haul , in Laredo on the US - Mexico border , included assault rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition .
Police say it was one of the largest weapons shipments found in recent years .
Two men have been arrested .
The seizure comes two weeks after Mexican President Felipe Calderon urged US lawmakers to help stem the flow of weapons to Mexico .
' Tremendous blow '
Texas police say they acted on a tip - off and stopped a truck .
Inside , they found 147 assault rifles , 53 bayonets and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition they believe were heading across the border to Mexico .
" This is one of the biggest cases we 've ever seen here in this city , " Laredo police officer Alberto Escobedo told Reuters .
" It 's a tremendous blow to drug traffickers and organised crime . "
In a speech to Congress last month , President Calderon said 75,000 weapons had been seized in three years - and 80 % of those that could be traced had come from the US .
President Obama has said that US demand for drugs has contributed to the violence in Mexico , and that the flow of guns from the US to Mexico must be stopped .
Drug -related violence in Mexico has left some 23,000 people dead since President Calderon came to office in December 2006 and launched a crackdown on drug gangs .
Angered by a pair of bills aiming at regulating the state ’s burgeoning medical marijuana industry just signed into law by Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter ( D ) , one group of medical marijuana advocates has announced plans to get a marijuana legalization initiative on the ballot in 2012 .
But there is already another legalization initiative filed with state officials and ready to go .
The competing efforts suggest a certain fractiousness in the state ’s increasingly crowded and complex medical and recreational marijuana communities , but they also illustrate the growing momentum toward legalization on the ground in Colorado .
Just last month , a Rasmussen poll showed marijuana legalization hovering on the cusp of majority support , with 49 % of likely voters approving , 38 % opposed , and 13 % undecided .
A 2006 legalization initiative got only 39 % of the vote .
The initiative effort in the news this week is called Legalize 2012 , and is being led by the Boulder - based education and advocacy group Cannabis Therapy Institute ( CTI ) , which is deeply unhappy with the new regulations provoked by a massive boom in dispensaries in the past year or so .
“ The problem we have in Colorado is that the medical marijuana amendment did n’t set up a distribution system , and now , 10 years later , that flawed language is coming back to haunt us , ” said institute spokesperson Laura Kriho .
“ The only way to cure the problems patients are now having is across the board legalization for all adults .
It will simplify things for law enforcement , patients , and people who are n’t patients . ”
Kriho had a litany of complaints about the recently approved medical marijuana regulation legislation .
“ Anybody convicted of a marijuana felony in the past is not going to be able to be a dispensary owner anymore .
Dispensaries are not allowed to compensate doctors or patients .
The local bans on dispensaries that will be found unconstitutional , but who knows when .
So many hoops for dispensaries to jump through , and they can still deny a license , ” she recited .
“ The stated intent was to put a big chunk of the dispensaries out of business , and I think it will , ” she predicted .
“ On the patient side , they ’re requiring three different follow - up visits to the doctor , plus registration fees , ” Kriho said .
“ For most of the patients I know , coming up with $ 90 for a license and $ 100 for a doctor ’s exam was the limit to what they could afford .
If you push it up higher , people wo n’t be able to afford it . ”
The initiative effort is just getting under way , said Kriho .
“ We ’re just in the process of getting it going , we ’re forming the language committee , ” she said .
“ It ’s important to us to make sure the language is acceptable to all the people in Colorado .
With a year and a half to write this , we should be able to get a good consensus .
We have a unique opportunity now — people have tasted that freedom and had it yanked away by the government . ”
“ They were upset with the regulation bills and have some major issues with them , ” said Brian Vicente of Sensible Colorado , which lobbied for some of the provisions in the measures .
“ But we are committed to working with them .
We do have patient access issues here in Colorado — for example , patients with severe depression or PTSD can’t currently access it under state law .
If we just legalize it for all adults , those individuals would have access . ”
“ We might have some philosophical differences with groups like Sensible Colorado , ” said Kriho , “ but we have to remember the end goal : keeping people out of jail . ”
“ We need to agree on what we ’re going to agree on and work together on these issues , ” said Vicente .
“ CTI , Sensible Colorado , and SAFER have enough common ground that I ’m optimistic we can work together . ”
“ I think we can build an effective coalition , ” said Jessica Corrie , an attorney , Republican , mother , and nationally known legalization advocate .
“ We have everybody from evangelical Christians to hard - core labor activists .
There are some concerns about the radical fringe of this movement , but we ca n’t ignore them and should n’t ignore them .
I ’ve seen many people with passionate radical views come into the fold .
In the eyes of most voters , this was all about tie - dyed hippies , but now it ’s people like me .
The effort should be to bring people together to the extent it ’s possible . ”
“ I support any effort to change marijuana laws so adults are able to make the safer choice , but this effort seems short - sighted and unlikely to garner the support of the voters , ” said an uncharacteristically tight - lipped Mason Tvert , whose SAFER ( Safer Alternatives For Enjoyable Recreation ) ran the successful 2005 Denver legalization initiative and the 2006 statewide legalization initiative that won 39 % of the vote .
Tvert and SAFER already have a legalization initiative drafted and filed with the secretary of state ’s office .
Known as Initiative 47 , the measure would legalize the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana , three seedlings , and three mature pot plants by people 21 or older .
It also calls for licensed marijuana cultivation and sales outlets , and it calls for a maximum tax of $ 50 an ounce .
“ CTI decided to announce this because they think there should be no tax on marijuana , ” said Tvert .
“ The initiative we filed has a tax of $ 50 an ounce at most and allows licensed production and distribution , no penalties for adult use or possession , and people can grow up to six plants .
That seems to me like a proposal that will be met with support by most Coloradans . ”
Tvert is willing to put that to the test at the ballot box .
“ We have every intention of running a ballot measure , ” he said .
“ The language is approved , the title is set , but we ’re holding off until 2012 .
We should n’t have any problem getting through that process again . ”
If there is one thing everyone seems to agree on , it is that victory is within grasp .
“ We ’re looking for freedom for the whole plant , untaxed and unregulated as much as possible , ” said Kriho .
“ Legalize 2012 comes from that .
We have to take this next step , and we have to get ready now .
Legalization is polling 49 % now and will be over 50 % by 2012 . ”
“ I think the prospects are very good , ” said Corrie .
“ If you look at the 2006 initiative , legalization outperformed the Republican gubernatorial candidate , and we saw a dramatic shift in terms of voter demographics in 2008 .
Now it ’s polling at 49 % , eight points more than any statewide candidate for office , and when you ask voters if marijuana should be regulated like alcohol and taxed , there is a jump of five or six points , which is a reflection of dire budgetary circumstances .
That ’s where the Republicans we see on board are coming from .
They think marijuana is bad , but they ’re tired of paying outrageous tax bills , and given some persuading that marijuana is safer than alcohol , I think they are reachable . ”
Married women with children have historically been one of the toughest demographics for marijuana law reform , but having activists like Corrie on board may be able to swing some of the worried mom vote .
“ Younger mothers worry that if we legalize marijuana , it ’s an endorsement of marijuana use , ” said Corrie .
“ My response is to ask whether prohibition stopped us from using marijuana .
We mothers are the most powerful tool for preventing our children from engaging in dangerous behaviors , and so many women across the ideological spectrum have handed government bureaucrats the responsibility for taking care of our children , ” she explained .
“ In speaking to older Republican women , many of them were actively involved in DARE in an effort to be the best parents they could be .
They want to feel like there was some good in that , and I tell them they did the best they could with the information available at the time , but now it ’s time to work together with the best information to protect our kids , ” Corrie said .
“ This is n’t a conversation you have in 10 minutes .
This is a process of getting people to rethink ideas and concepts and political views , and that can be difficult , especially when people are forced to admit the government was n’t correct . ”
“ I think Colorado is ready right now , ” Vicente laughed when asked if an initiative could pass in 2012 .
“ But 2012 is when we ’ll actually have the resources . ”
Still , Kriho and CTI are n’t putting all their eggs in one basket .
“ We are working with Roger Christie and his THC Ministry to bring on a cannabis religious revival , ” she said .
“ The Colorado constitution specifically protects method of worship , and we ’re confident the THC Ministry qualifies as a legitimate church .
We may be forming branch ministries , like the church sanctuary movement .
It ’s about protecting patients .
Sincere religious practitioners should form a church to get protection , ” she said .
But if Colorado ’s marijuana community can keep from flying apart , in a couple of years , patients and recreational pot smokers alike might have made the entire state a sanctuary , through the ballot box .

The tallest structure in Bristol , Connecticut , a city of about sixty thousand people some twenty miles west of Hartford , is a twenty - nine - story monolith where Otis Elevator tests new equipment and analyzes the flaws in existing equipment .
But the real beacon of the city is more horizontal : ESPN , whose headquarters , a sprawling campus of low buildings , has been there since the cable sports channel was founded , in 1979 .
Several thousand people work at the Bristol campus , and for the past four years a number of them have been working on bringing 3 - D television to the sports - watching audience .
On June 11th , ESPN launched a new channel , ESPN 3D , with the first game of the World Cup , between South Africa and Mexico , as its inaugural offering .
ESPN plans to air twenty - five of the World Cup games in 3 - D , which sounds cornucopic .
But only a thimbleful of viewers will actually be able to see them .
To watch , you need a 3 - D TV , and special glasses that get the images to your eyes in such a way that your brain can make sense of them , and cable service from one of only three current 3 - D providers , DirecTV , Comcast , and A. T. & T. ’s U-verse .
The June 11th launch , really , was more notional than actual , since 3 - D sets started being sold just a few months ago and a negligible number of consumers have them , but it was real enough for ESPN to be able to invite some guests to Bristol to watch the game .
In a small room in the building that houses the cafeteria , two sets had been set up for viewers , who included some of ESPN ’s technology staff .
One set was a seventy - two - inch Samsung model , and one was a Hyundai forty - six - incher , and they were completely different kinds of sets .
Yes , two different kinds : it ’s Betamax versus VHS , LaserDisc versus SelectaVision , Blu-ray versus HD DVD all over again , except that one technology , the one used in the Samsung set ( other manufacturers also utilize it ) , seems to have triumphed already , not because it ’s better but because it ’s cheaper to make and cheaper to buy .
The Samsung system requires heavy glasses with battery - powered receivers , which Chuck Pagano , ESPN ’s executive vice - president of technology , called “ Roy Orbison glasses . ”
In that system , the glasses and your eyes do all the work — receivers in the glasses control the lightning - quick , imperceptible shuttering of each lens , according to the signals sent by the transmitter at the top of the screen .
In the Hyundai system , the set does all the work ; you merely put on more or less regular - looking , lightweight dark glasses that have polarized lenses .
In this model , the screen glass is key in every way , because it ’s expensive to manufacture and has a problematic yield — that is , a high rate of having to be thrown away .
What has won out is the passive - screen / active - glasses combination — in other words , the cheap set and the expensive glasses .
The ESPN staff in the room did n’t try to oversell the moment ; in the future , the network will control every aspect of its telecasts , but FIFA , the World Cup ’s governing body , was controlling the feed from the soccer matches , and for now the ESPN people were like expectant fathers being kept out of the delivery room , relegated to the unsatisfying role of hoping for the best .
The atmosphere was n’t quite what it must have been at the 1939 World ’s Fair , when the new technology of television was demonstrated to the public .
In fact , it was n’t until a goal was scored that you sensed how 3 - D would change television .
Actually , it was n’t until the replay of the goal , when footage from a camera behind the net made it seem as though the ball were coming right toward you .
As it threatened to pop out of the screen , it provoked a “ Whoa ! ” from at least one viewer .
( Reactions to the game were hard to tease out above the overwhelming , hornet ’s - nest din of the fans ’ vuvuzelas . )
I tried watching World Cup games four years ago and was preoccupied with the peculiarity of a sport that does n’t allow the use of arms , which , after all , make up half our complement of excellent sporting appendages ( forty per cent , if you include heads ) , and of the confounding combination of endless minutes of scoreless running around and free kicks that lead to sudden goals .
( My analysis , which may not qualify me for on - camera commentary , was “ That just does n’t seem right somehow . ” )
My expectations for 3 - D were low , and they were borne out to some extent : 3 - D did n’t enhance the big picture , as it were — all that running around still looked like a lot of running around .
But , when the cameras were close to the action , the sense of depth , of people pushing , kicking , fighting for dominance , working , vying , and trying — the sense of action — was intoxicating .
Even closeup shots of the crowd were mesmerizing , and not because of the funny hats and the face paint .
Real sports fans will love 3 - D. A man wearing a jacket with the letters “ USA ” on the back , who came into the room in Bristol two - thirds of the way through the match , said loudly , “ This TV is sick , ” and , a minute later , “ This is ridiculously cool . ”
At the end of the match , he said to Pagano , “ That was awesome , man .
I ’m so chuffed about this . ”
He was the South African actor Sharlto Copley , on campus to do a promotion for the movie “ The A - Team ” ; too bad he ’s not available to barnstorm on ESPN ’s behalf .
One can imagine that certain sports , such as car racing and golf , would n’t be enhanced by 3 - D .
That was what ESPN operatives assumed , too , but , when they actually played around with camera placement , golf looked great .
After the soccer match , I saw a “ sizzle reel , ” a compilation of clips that showed what 3 - D could do for various sports , and one sequence stood out : a golf ball being hit out of a sand trap , in the direction of the camera .
( Any reference to “ the camera ” when you ’re talking about 3 - D shots should always be understood as “ two cameras . ” )
As the ball blasted out of the trap , the combined effect of the blades of grass , the flying grains of sand , and the ball coming at me was actively seductive , beyond “ you are there . ”
The picture enveloped me , as though the images were as drawn to me as I was to them .
No one knows yet whether the romance of 3 - D will ripen into love , and profits — whether anyone other than compulsive first adopters will find it necessary to their lives .
What does seem clear is that 3 - D will change the way that sports are presented .
The sand - trap shot did n’t reflect how golf really looks ; and crowds in stadiums are n’t really thrilling to look at .
The risk is that , in order to satisfy the craving that this technology engenders in us , sports producers will distort the particular energies of each sport and try to turn every shot into a highlight .
Pagano , considering that he ’s ESPN ’s No. 1 tech guy , did n’t seem overly anxious about the format ’s chances of success .
ESPN wo n’t live or die by 3 - D .
When asked what he likes to watch , Pagano said , “ NASA TV .
I like the Science Channel — I ’m an engineer . ” ♦
The discovery that gripping the iPhone 4 in a way that bridges the left and bottom antennas can cause serious signal problems has resulted in — to say the least — a lot of controversy .
However , most of the data that either " proves " or " refutes " that existence of said problem has been anecdotal at best .
So AnandTech used a clever hack to get an iPhone 4 to report actual signal strength instead of " bars , " giving some quantitative data about how bridging the antennas can negatively affect signal strength .
The analysis explains why not all users are affected by the problem , and further investigation also shows that the antenna design does in fact improve reception as long as the left - bottom area is n't bridged when holding the device .
Other mobile handsets definitely have antenna attenuation problems — when cupping an iPhone 3GS or Google Nexus
One in the manner that causes problems with the iPhone 4 , AnandTech measured 14dB and 18 dB drops , respectively .
However , the problem with the iPhone 4's external antenna is worse ; bridging the antennas detunes 3G reception by a full 24dB .
As long as you have a signal strong enough to show five bars on your iPhone 4 — between − 51dBm and − 91dBm — a 24 dB drop in signal strength should n't drop your call or data connection .
However , Apple only uses a very small range of signal strength for showing four or less bars , from −91d Bm down to the usable signal cutoff of − 113d Bm .
If your iPhone displays four bars or less , a 24dB attenuation will cut the signal below the useable limit .
That 's definitely a significant problem — one that Apple has so far failed to address adequately , in our opinion — but there is good news in all of this .
AnandTech also discovered that the iPhone 4 can actually use signal at the lower threshold far more reliably than any previous iPhone .
" It 's readily apparent that the new baseband hardware is much more sensitive compared to what was in the 3GS , " according to Anand Shimpi .
" The difference is that reception is massively better on the iPhone 4 in actual use . "
Rumors have suggested that Apple has an update to iOS 4 coming soon that may address the issue , and an e-mail from Steve Jobs to a frustrated customer seems to support that theory .
A reader indicated to us via e-mail that Apple may be using digitally adjustable solid state capacitors to tune the iPhone 4's antennas , which if true would make a software fix possible .
While Apple has yet to externally admit there is a problem , the company is definitely looking to beef up its on - staff expertise in antenna engineering — ironically posting job listings for mobile antenna engineers on the same day that the iPhone 4 problems were discovered .
Until Apple does offer an official fix ( assuming one can be made ) , using some type of case , or alternately covering the gap between antennas on the bottom left corner with some type of insulating material , is the only reliable solution if you 're affected by this problem .
HONG KONG —
A day after announcing that it would allow a more flexible currency , China said on Sunday that any appreciation in its value would be gradual , and it set the renminbi ’s value in early trading on Monday at the same level as it traded on Friday .
By early afternoon , the renminbi had climbed 0.27 percent in Shanghai trading .
This was the first time that the Chinese government has allowed such a jump in intraday trading since before it repegged the renminbi to the dollar almost two years ago .
The central bank ’s statement on Sunday and the decision on Monday morning to leave the currency unchanged represented clear attempts to reassure the Chinese people that there would not be a disruptive change .
The central bank ’s statement on Sunday afternoon coincided with signs of a negative reaction in China , where many view a weak currency and strong exports as symbols of national sovereignty .
The initial announcement on Saturday evening that China would allow its currency , the renminbi , to fluctuate drew caustic postings on Chinese Internet sites , like this one on Sohu.com : “ I did n’t imagine I would see the day when China would submit to America and agree to appreciation of the renminbi . ”
This is going to be one of the most dramatic live video events up there , arguably rivaling the famous re-entry of the Apollo 13 spacecraft .
Operation Top Kill , BPs attempt to plug the disastrous leak in the Gulf , will be shown on live video , contrary to some reports ( not ours , we reported that it was up in the air still ) that BP planned to shut off the video during the procedure .
For more details on what the top kill will involve , see here .

By GREG BLUESTEIN ( AP )
COVINGTON , La. — BP is going in for the kill .
The trick is to do the job quickly and cleanly .
As early as dawn Wednesday , the oil company will try to choke to death the gusher at the bottom of the sea by force - feeding it heavy drilling mud and cement — a tactic called a " top kill " that is routinely used above ground but has never been tried 5,000 feet underwater .
If it 's not done just right , it could make the leak worse .
The stakes for BP are high , with politicians and others losing patience with the company over its inability to stop the oil leak that sprang more than a month ago after an offshore drilling rig exploded .
Eleven workers were killed , and by the most conservative estimate , 7 million gallons of crude have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico , fouling Louisiana 's marshes and coating birds and other wildlife .
" We want what everybody wants — to stop the flow at the source as quickly as possible , " said BP spokesman John Curry .
" We understand the frustration and we just want to bring this to closure . "
Engineers were doing at least 12 hours of diagnostic tests Tuesday .
They planned to check five spots on the well 's crippled five - story blowout preventer to make sure it could withstand the heavy force of the mud .
A weak spot in the device could blow under the pressure , causing a brand new leak .
BP has been drafting plans for the top kill for weeks but had to delay it several times as crews scrambled to assemble the equipment at the site 50 miles off the coast .
A flotilla of rigs , barges and other heavy machinery stood ready there Tuesday .
A top kill has worked on aboveground oil wells in Kuwait and Iraq .
BP CEO Tony Hayward pegged its chances of success in this case at 60 to 70 percent .
Kent Wells , a BP senior vice president , cautioned that engineers are speeding through a planning process that would normally take months .
He warned that the top kill could be delayed or scuttled if Tuesday 's pressure readings are bad .
Once the test results are in , scientists with the federal Minerals Management Service will examine them and BP will consult with government officials before deciding whether to press on , Curry said .
If all goes as planned , engineers will pump fluid twice as dense as water from two barges into two 3 - inch - wide lines that will feed it into the blowout preventer .
Crews plan to pump it in at a rate of 1,680 to 2,100 gallons per minute in hopes of counteracting the upward pressure of the oil gushing to the surface .
They stockpiled some 50,000 barrels of the heavy mud , a manufactured substance that resembles clay .
Wells said it could take anywhere from a few hours to two days to determine whether the top kill is working .
If it succeeds , BP plans to follow through by injecting a stream of cement to permanently seal up the well .
They may also install a new blowout preventer on top as a fail - safe .
Live video of the leak has been available online for the past few days , and BP said Tuesday that it will continue throughout the planned ' top kill ' procedure .
An Obama administration official , speaking on condition of anonymity to disclose private discussions , said BP agreed to keep the public video feed only under pressure from the administration .
Earlier in the day , Rep. Edward J. Markey , D - Mass. , said he had learned that BP had planned to turn off the video feed during the top kill and complained that the blackout would " obscure a vital moment in this disaster . "
Bob Bea , an engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley , said the procedure carries a high risk of failure because of the velocity at which the oil may be spewing .
If some of the higher estimates of 3 million to 4 million gallons a day are correct , " it 's going to spit everything back in your face , " Bea told The Associated Press .
He estimated that anything above 1.6 million gallons a day would be too much for a top kill to work .
Nevertheless , " they 're trying and that 's a good thing , " Bea said .
" I certainly pray that it works , because if it does n't there 's this long waiting time " before BP can dig relief wells that would cut off the flow .
In addition to the danger of the blowout preventer springing a leak , the risks include the possibility that the mud could tear a new hole in the leaking well pipe .
If the top kill does n't work , or makes the problem worse , BP will probably turn to a containment box resting on the seafloor .
It is a smaller version of the 100 - ton box the company lowered several weeks ago in hopes of capturing much of the oil .
That larger device was clogged with ice crystals and BP had to abandon it , but the company hopes the smaller version might work better .
BP has had limited success with a mile - long tube it installed more than a week ago to siphon up some of the oil .
The device has captured more than 500,000 gallons but has also allowed untold amounts to escape into the sea .
The company 's backup plans include a junk shot , which involves shooting golf balls , tire scraps , knotted rope and other assorted objects into the well to clog it up .
BP executives say the only guaranteed permanent solution is a pair of relief wells crews have already started drilling , but that will take at least two months .

The boat was positioned deep in international waters .
Dawn is just breaking over the Mediterranean .
More news should be available soon .
The flotilla is the project of a coalition of organization , including the Free Gaza Movement .
Over 600 people from 50 countries are on the boats .
Urgent Call from the Freedom Flotilla !
( Cyprus , May 31 , 2010 ) At 11:00 pm Cyprus time and in international waters off the coast of Israel , the boats were contacted by the Israeli navy .
“ Who are you and where are you going ? ”
Our reply was that we were part of a flotilla and we were going to Gaza to deliver humanitarian supplies .
On the radar , the boats could see three Israeli war ships shadowing us , and 15 minutes later , a silent aircraft hovered over the flotilla .
One of our Hebrew speakers had found Israel ’s strategy and posted it to us .
It stated , “ You will be boarded by highly trained , very efficient and very SILENT commandos .
They will use silent inflatable boats to get to our boats and both try to board our boats directly from the inflatables and by dropping divers into the water to climb onto the boats , ” so people were preparing for them to come up and over the sides of the ships .
Our SPOT locator has sent out several HELP messages at http://www.facebook.com/....
Lubna Marsawa , Free Gaza ’s organizer on the Turkish passenger boat said in outrage , “ Very few times in history has a flotilla delivering humanitarian goods been welcomed by military war ships . ”
This is a call to the world from the people on the boats .
“ We are a civilian people doing what our governments have refused to do , challenge Israel ’s right to collectively punish 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza by blockading their right to their own sea .
This flotilla is bringing construction and educational supplies the people of Gaza and are being met by Israeli warships . ”

Update from Gaza Freedom March says 3 dead according to reports from the boats .
Israelis Kill 3 , Injure Dozens in Assault on Gaza Ship Convoy Carrying Humanitarian Aid May 30 , 2010
10 PM CST : Solidarity activists aboard one of six relief vessels traveling to Gaza with humanitarian report that they have been attacked by Israeli forces , with three of their human rights volunteers killed and roughly 30 injured .
Al Jazeera has just confirmed the numbers .
The assault comes in the wake of the flotilla being surrounded earlier today by three Israeli warships in international waters , roughly 70 miles away from the Israeli coast .
The Flotilla moved further west , deeper into international waters to avoid any conflict with Israeli navy vessels , but had been concerned all night that Israeli forces would send small inflatable military boats towards the flotilla and attempt to attack and board the humanitarian vessels .
Those fears have apparently been realized , with people aboard the Mavi Marmara , a Turkish ship with hundreds of aid workers and activists aboard , reporting that they have been attacked .
At least three passengers have been killed and dozens more wounded .
Israeli commandos apparently repelled onto the Mavi Marmara , whose passengers range in age from 88 to a year old and include Christians , Muslims and Jews seeking to end the blockade .
Live video from the flotilla shows Israeli naval commando vessels pulling alongside the aid ships , and what sounds like gunfire can be heard in the background .
No -one on the aid ships is carrying any kinds of weapons , including for defense against a feared Israeli attack in international waters .
Hundreds of elected officials , former diplomats , aid workers and activists -- including a Nobel laureate and many European legislators -- are with the flotilla , traveling by sea to Gaza to break Israel 's blockade of the tiny strip of land .
Foreign news correspondents and independent journalists are traveling aboard the Mavi Marmara , a Turkish ship with hundreds of aid workers and activists aboard which is also running its own press operation .
A total of six ships , including two cargo ships and other passenger vehicles , are carrying thousands of tons of humanitarian aid to the beseiged region , which has been under Israeli blockade since 2006 .
Israel has marshalled its most lethal military vessels to try to stop the humanitarian marine convoy , and at around 2:20 pm Central Standard Time ( US ) the first reports of unmanned drone planes buzzing the vessels was received from convoy passengers .
Two boats in the aid flotilla , one currently traveling with the convoy to Gaza and another in port in Cyprus for repairs , are flagged and registered in the United States .
The ships are U.S. territory under maritime law , and the U.S. government is required to intervene if this " U.S. property " is attacked or illegally confiscated by Israeli authorities -- a tactic Israel has threatened and deployed in the past .
Israel has a long history of attacking ships whose missions are deemed undesirable .
In December 2008 , it rammed the Dignity , carrying medical and humanitarian aid , doctors , human rights workers and a former U.S. congresswoman , without warning in international waters .
The story is being reported by AP :
By TIA GOLDENBERG , Associated Press Writer –
HAIFA , Israel – Israeli warships attacked at least one of the six ships carrying pro-Palestinian activists and aid for blockaded Gaza , killing at least two and wounding an unknown number of people on board , an Arabic satellite service and a Turkish TV network reported early Monday .
The Israeli military refused to comment on the report .
The al - Jazeera satellite channel reported by telephone from the Turkish ship leading the flotilla that Israeli navy forces fired at the ship and boarded it , wounding the captain .
The Turkish NTV network also reported an Israeli takeover with gunfire , and at least two people were killed .
The al - Jazeera broadcast ended with a voice shouting in Hebrew , " Everybody shut up ! "
Update 3
Live English reporting from Press TV .
Update 4
Press TV is reporting that Israeli TV says that at least 10 civilians are dead in this attack .
Protests at the Israeli consulate in Istanbul .
No word on the nationalities of those killed .
Update 5
Twitter feeds from the boats report that ships are being towed to Haifa , rather than Ashdod , where international press has assembled .
Update 6
Al - Jazeera English reporting that boats are heading to Haifa with 16 dead on board .
Update 7
h/t Brecht
The Israelis are claiming they were attacked
with knives , and they were forced to open fire .
Which seems unlikely , to say the least .
The activists were committed to non-violence , and were very careful not to carry weapons , so that their intentions would be unimpeachable .
Now the Israelis are towing the flotilla , unexpectedly , to Haifa .
I expect they 're taking away any cellphones and cameras they can find , and destroying evidence .
It will be hard for Israel to discount what really happened with so many witnesses , but if the wrong footage ( i.e. the truth ) gets out on film , the story will have much longer legs .
Update 8
Turkey has said that more aid ships would be heading toward Gaza escorted by the Turkish navy .
Turkey 's ambassador to Israel has been recalled .
UN Security Council will meet today to discuss the attack on the flotilla .
No statement from the White House yet .
Update 9
Great commentary from Electronic Intifada .
LONDON : The Vatican 's Secretary of State - No. 2 to the Pope himself - has suggested the paedophilia crisis engulfing the Catholic Church is linked to homosexuality , not priests ' celibacy .
During a press conference in Chile , Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone also insisted that the church has never stymied investigation of priests accused of paedophilia .

'' Many psychologists and psychiatrists have demonstrated that there is no relation between celibacy and paedophilia , '' the cardinal said .
'' But many others have demonstrated , I have been told recently , that there is a relation between homosexuality and pedophilia .
That is true .
That is the problem . ''
The cardinal 's remarks have sparked a storm of controversy in Italy as well as Chile , where they were strongly criticised by politicians and medical experts , who accused the Secretary of State of '' vast generalisations ' ' .
What would we say if the Arabs were to ignore an Israeli peace initiative for more than eight years ?
What would we write if , during all this time , the Palestinian leadership were not to have even one discussion about our initiative ?
How many Israelis , including learned members of the academic world , know what is written in the first pan-Arabic and pan-Islamic document that proposes recognizing Israel and exchanging hostile relations for normalization ?

Prof. Yoram Meital , the head of the Chaim Herzog Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev , who this week opened a comprehensive conference at the university on the initiative and its political and environmental implications , said that this was the only international conference that Israeli academia had held so far about the Arab peace plan .

For the first time , representatives from the West Bank , Egypt , and Jordan sat at a round table along with their Israeli colleagues and spoke about the nature of the peace initiative .
It was obvious that the guests from Bethlehem University , from the Egyptian media and the University of Amman had come to Be'er Sheva to try and figure out why the Jews , who are considered clever people , ( no one bothered to deny this ) are missing a rare opportunity to put an end to their exhausting conflict and at the same time to annoy Hezbollah and isolate Iran .
The Madrid Coalition for promoting the Arab plan recently held a meeting in Antalya ( before the flotilla incident ) which included representatives from Saudi Arabia , Israel , the Palestinian Authority and Jordan .
Prof. Elie Podeh of Hebrew University in Jerusalem was there together with MK Meir Sheetrit ( Kadima ) .
Podeh said Sheetrit , who has supported the initiative almost from day one , has not been able to convince his colleagues in the party to adopt it as the basis for negotiations with our neighbors .
Cabinet Minister Avishay Braverman ( Labor ) last week called on the his faction in the Knesset to demand of the prime minister that Israel be prepared to begin direct negotiations with the Arabs on the basis of the initiative .
Journalist Samir Ratas , a Palestinian who now lives in Egypt , brought a message to Israel at the conference : " The peace initiative is not an Arab plot to destroy Israel nor is it an ambush .
Many years ago , the Arabs recognized your existence . "
Ratas departed with two questions in mind : " How many more years will we have to wait until you understand that this initiative is a strategic choice ? "
And " How many years do you think that it will wait for you ? "
The item that was quarantined
Open gallery view Credit : Amos Biderman
The item was broadcast once only .
That was on Sunday , May 30 , at one in the afternoon , a few hours before the raid on the Turkish ship " Mavi Marmara . "
The news broadcast on Israel Radio's Reshet Bet stated that a number of hospitals reported they had been instructed not to give any information to the media in the event that wounded were brought to them after the flotilla was blocked from entering Israel 's territorial waters .
It is not clear why the news item was not mentioned in subsequent broadcasts nor why it did not appear in any other media .
It is clear that among those who were involved in planning the campaign , there were people who were not surprised by the welcome the Israeli soldiers received on board the vessel .
For the Turkel committee 's information .
Gossip about Taglit
Last week I took a night train from Ben-Gurion International Airport and I unintentionally became party to a secret about the Taglit - Birthright Israel campaign , that large project that brings tens of thousands of Jewish students from across the globe to Israel .
A group of men and women soldiers who had just bade farewell to the students from the Diaspora were discussing excitedly ( and at the top of their voices ) how they had spent the last few days in their company .
One of them spoke about a weird Jewish girl who wakes up in the morning and takes an energy pill and later goes to sleep with another pill , this one against depression .
Another spoke of a student who one happy night managed to down a dozen bottles of beer .
A cheerful girl soldier reported that she had managed to knock the hell out of an American student who said that if an Israeli soldier had been killed on the Turkish ship , " this would have helped Israel 's PR . "
Her colleague added another bit of information about a student " whose mother is n't Jewish at all and whose father is also not really attached to Judaism and who said he had come here just for the trip . "
On the other hand , another student had said that she had already decided ( after 10 days in Israel ) that she would immigrate here .
The soldiers all agreed that the meeting with the young Americans had been interesting .
It is obvious that this is not a representative sample of the profile of the 230,000 youngsters from 52 countries ( the project was the initiative of Yossi Beilin ) that Taglit - Birthright Israel has brought here over the years .
Thousands of them now live in Israel .
The project 's Internet site states that Taglit - Birthright Israel sets up the infrastructure for ambassadors for Israel in the world ; that it brings tens of thousands of Jewish students who are cut off from Judaism and Israel for a first educational tour of the land , strengthens their Jewish identity and sends young blood to the Jewish communities in the Diaspora .
Birthright Israel has increased the number of students who come here by 2,000 percent in a short period .
A research team from Brandeis University in Massachusetts found that 64 percent of the graduates of the program feel very attached to their Judaism in the wake of the tour ( as compared with 38 percent who felt that way before the tour ) and 55 percent feel very attached to Israel in the wake of the visit ( as compared with 22 percent who felt that way before they came ) .
It would be interesting to examine the extent of their connection with Israel and Judaism in another 10 years .
How can mainstream young Muslim students get heard when fundamentalists often have a stranglehold on their groups and societies ?
Saniya Gour , 17 , an east London A - level student , has struggled .
" Everyone where I live is so extreme .
There are very few who are not hardline about things .
And , as a girl , they do n't want to hear what you have to say .
I go to Leyton Sixth Form College and when I asked one of the heads of Isoc ( the Islamic Society ) if I could speak , he said no .
They do n't even like me talking to guys .
They say : ' You 're wearing a headscarf , you should n't be talking to boys ' . "
However , Saniya and other young Muslims now have a national forum where they can learn leadership skills and how to speak up .
The Young Muslim Leadership Network ( YMLN ) , funded by the Government as part of its controversial Prevent programme designed to stop violent extremism , is working hard to make its mark .
It needs to .
Early soundings by some of its two dozen members show that it is up against powerful forces .
The network was founded last year for young people aged 16 to 21 , and has three groups – two in London and one in Birmingham .
The central London group is researching university Islamic societies , and members have been shocked at what they have found .
Hazura Bazeer , 18 , a member of the central London branch of the YMLN , is in her final year at Coombe Girls ' School in New Malden , Surrey , and has a place to study medicine at King 's College , London .
She says : " In one case that we heard of , a girl was slapped in the face for not wearing a headscarf , and , in one society , women were not allowed to speak and had to hold up their questions in writing . "
On many campuses , societies are run by extremists , and moderate Muslim students avoid them .
Such students also know that these societies are now closely monitored by the authorities – even more so after the recent University College London - educated alleged " underpants bomber " – and worry about the consequences of membership .
She points out that a lot of societies do n't have any election process .
" There is no democracy , " she claims .
" Posts are just handed on , so it is all just a vicious circle . "
Her group is sending out a questionnaire to students and consulting on what changes people would like to see .
It is also planning to visit more open Isocs , such as those at Oxford and Cambridge , in order to produce a code of good practice .
" These societies have a lot of potential and ought to be a really cool part of university life . "
Muhammad Saqib , 20 , who is a student at Manchester University and active in the Birmingham group , has only recently become a practising Muslim .
" I only started praying last year .
Before that , I just thought it was a strict religion with a lot of rules that just seemed quite depressing .
All these Muslims blowing themselves up gave quite a negative impression . "
However , a talk at the LSE made him realise " that Islam is just the opposite " , and now he is helping to produce a series of short video clips aimed at counteracting stereotypes and encouraging young Muslims to become engaged in society .
The group has already interviewed Clare Short , the former Cabinet minister , and various prominent Asian figures , and , when the DVD is finished , they plan to show it in schools and to youth groups .
But Naqeeb Ahmed , 29 , project officer for the network , knows from his experience at the University of Birmingham that young Muslims are often prime prey for extremists .
" They 've been brought up in liberal families , but then they get to university and start to explore their own identity and who they are as a Muslim , and they get drawn into these societies and become more and more extreme so that , eventually , even if their own father dies , they refuse to say a prayer in the house for him because they have been told that that is wrong .
I 've seen it so often myself .
And these groups are strong and well - funded .
We 're up against the petrodollar – and how easy is it to fight that ? "
Najda Khan , 18 , who works for Bradford Metropolitan District Council , says schisms within Muslim communities can be deep and divisive .
" Where do I start ? " she says , rolling her eyes .
" It can be about someone praying in the wrong way , about the Prophet 's birthday , about issues with the Council of Mosques . "
She has already founded a campaigning environmental group and spoken to the House of Lords .
" I 'm passionate about getting young Muslims politically active . "
These young people are also working to counteract prejudices about Islam .
Crude stereotypes of oppressed women and bushy - bearded terrorists are , they say , reinforced by an irresponsible media , while barriers such as poverty , lack of confidence and family tensions stop many young Muslims playing their full part in society .
The network recently held its second national conference in London , and Bazeer , like others , values the chance to meet .
" There are n't many Muslims where I live , and I do n't have other Muslim friends at school .
Alcohol is a big problem .
You get invited to birthday parties , and there you are with a load of drunk people and you 're sober .
It can be difficult .
And my friends say : ' Oh you 're so innocent .
You do n't do this and you do n't do that ' .
Everyone in the network is dealing with these kinds of misconceptions and stereotypes . "
The network works alongside other organisations , such as the Federation of Student Islamic Societies and the Young Muslims Advisory Group , set up by Hazel Blears , the former Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government .
However the Prevent programme , which has backed the YMLN with £ 110,000 , has drawn widespread condemnation from critics who say it is being used to spy on Muslim communities .
In March , a cross-party committee of MPs published a report , after an investigation into the three - year - old programme which has spent £ 53 m on funding more than 1,000 community projects , which found it was doing more harm than good .
Why not use FFI ?
Here 's why .
[ Jun. 2nd , 2010 | 07:22 pm ] djberg96
On the FFI wiki there 's a nice list of reasons why you should use FFI .
That 's the foreign function interface for Ruby .
I imagine other languages have some similar facility .
It 's all Unicorns and Rainbows in theory .
It 'll be pure Ruby !
It 's cross platform !
You can use it with JRuby and Rubinius !
Unfortunately , my experience has not been too keen with FFI .
I 'm going to lay out a few reasons why you might not want to switch to FFI unless you absolutely , positively have to get your extensions working with JRuby , Rubinius , or IronRuby .
First , the last time I checked ( and someone correct me if this has changed ) , you can't build FFI with anything except the GNU tool chain .
That means no support for a Ruby built with the Sun Studio compiler , the HP - UX compiler and , perhaps most importantly , the Microsoft tool chain .
The good news for Microsofties is that you have the mingw one - click installer option .
If you 're using that you 'll be ok .
Otherwise , tough crap .
Second , the alternative implementations may not give you the low level access you need .
For example , my file - temp library does not work with JRuby even though it uses FFI because JRuby cannot deal with low level file descriptors .
That kills a lot of low level systems programming right out of the gate .
Third , the up front declarations , combined with cross platform support , are proving to be extremely burdensome .
Consider a simple interface for the getpwent ( ) function .
You might naively start with something like this on Linux :
attach_function : getpwent , [ ] , : pointer attach_function : setpwent , [ ] , :void attach_function : endpwent , [ ] , :void class PasswdStruct < FFI :: Struct layout ( : pw_name , :string , : pw_passwd , :string , : pw_uid , :uint , : pw_gid , :uint , : pw_gecos , : string , : pw_dir , : string , : pw_shell , : string )
end
This works fine .
On Linux .
But you immediately run into trouble the moment you try to run this on Solaris .
Why ?
Because the passwd struct on Solaris not only contains different members , it contains some of the same struct members , but in a different order .
For those of you who might not be C programmers , I 'll elaborate a bit on why the order matters .
You see , when you declare a variable in C , you 're really reserving memory .
With a struct you 're essentially reserving a block of contiguous memory .
That 's the important bit .
With C this does n't matter .
You can just access the memory by name , e.g. pwd-> pw_name , pwd -> pw_uid , and so on .
At worst you 'll have to add an #ifdef check before trying to access it .
I do n't have to worry about the ordering , because it 's already been ordered for me by a header file included on the operating system .
With FFI this becomes a major hassle .
It 's easier to show you why if I show you what the declaration would have to look like on Solaris :
class PasswdStruct < FFI :: Struct layout ( : pw_name , :string , : pw_passwd , :string , : pw_uid , :uint , : pw_gid , :uint , : pw_age , : string , : pw_comment , : string , : pw_gecos , : string , : pw_dir , : string , : pw_shell , : string )
end
There are two things to notice .
First , it contains two additional members , pw_age and pw_comment .
Second , it also has a pw_gecos field , but it 's not in the same position .
That 's where that contiguous memory comes into play .
I can't simply reference : pw_gecos by name on any old Unix platform and call it a day the way I can with C , because it 's a different segment of memory .
To be more specific , : pw_gecos on Linux should be held in bytes 16 - 19 , while on Solaris it 's 24 - 27 .
So , if you had thoughts of just declaring one massive struct that contains every struct member from every platform you can think of you 're out of luck because , while you can reference that data , it 's probably not going to return the data you think it will because it 's the wrong chunk of memory .
So now what do we do ?
We could create an array of members first , and adjust it based on platform like this :
# Danger ... members = [ : pw_name , : string , : pw_passwd , :string , : pw_uid , :uint , : pw_gid , :uint , : pw_gecos , : string , : pw_dir , : string , : pw_shell , : string ] members.insert(8 , : pw_age , : string , : pw_comment , : string ) if CONFIG [ ' host_os ' ] =~ /solaris/ layout ( * members )
Unfortunately , there are a host of problems with this approach .
First , it means you now have have to eyeball every struct definition on every platform to see what the declaration order is .
That means sprinkling your code with a bunch of platform checks .
Even then you might get it wrong , because the struct definitions may be different on earlier or later versions of the operating system .
For 3rd party libraries , the definitions could change between releases , and you 're again relegated to eyeballing the struct declarations .
Second , it would n't be so bad , except that 3rd party libraries ( and some operating systems ) have a habit of declaring their own variable types .
Now you not only have to know the struct definition , you have to figure out what the hell a type " foo_int_t " is ( or whatever ) so that you 're sure to reserve the right amount of memory for it .
Third , some struct members are opaque , and you simply can't declare the variable type , because there 's no way for you to figure it out .
Now you 're relegated to using FFI :: Pointers and extra work .
Lastly , the Ruby community might be good at local testing , but it has proven to be exceedingly bad when it comes to cross - platform testing .
In practice most testing only occurs on Linux and OS X ( and in some cases only the latter ) , with either no thought whatsoever given to other platforms , or simply no ability to access those other platforms .
Now you 're relying much more heavily on 3rd party patches .
So , what do we do in practice then ?
Well , you could do what the JRuby guys did and just create separate source files for every single platform where you have this kind of issue .
To wit :
$ find .
- name " etc.rb " ./ruby/site_ruby/shared/ffi/platform/i386-openbsd/etc.rb ./ruby/site_ruby/shared/ffi/platform/powerpc-aix/etc.rb ./ruby/site_ruby/shared/ffi/platform/i386-linux/etc.rb ./ruby/site_ruby/shared/ffi/platform/sparc-solaris/etc.rb ./ruby/site_ruby/shared/ffi/platform/x86_64-darwin/etc.rb ./ruby/site_ruby/shared/ffi/platform/x86_64-solaris/etc.rb ./ruby/site_ruby/shared/ffi/platform/x86_64-linux/etc.rb ./ruby/site_ruby/shared/ffi/platform/powerpc-darwin/etc.rb ./ruby/site_ruby/shared/ffi/platform/i386-windows/etc.rb ./ruby/site_ruby/shared/ffi/platform/i386-solaris/etc.rb ./ruby/site_ruby/shared/ffi/platform/i386-darwin/etc.rb ./ruby/site_ruby/shared/ffi/platform/sparcv9-solaris/etc.rb
Wow , that looks like a real joy to maintain , does n't it ?
The other solution is to sprinkle your code with a bunch of platform checks .
I also released mkmf - lite just this week to help with this problem , too , but it 's like putting a band aid on a fractured arm really .
Anyway , the upshot of all this work is that , in my opinion , FFI is actually more difficult to use than a C extension in practice for all but the simplest libraries .
You 've been warned .

Crime Posted by Ogged
on 09.30.05 Jesus H. The Ex is living in NY at the moment , and last night she woke up in her fourth - floor apartment to find a stranger standing five feet from her bed .
She yelled a loud - as - she - could " Hey ! " and the guy ran out the fire escape ( making off with the roomie 's laptop ) .
She and her roommate ( whom she 's known for a while ) both seem remarkably composed .
They 've extra - double secured the window that the guy must have come through , and apparently the cops were shocked that the guy had been able to get in in the first place .
In the grand scheme of city crime , this is n't even a blip , but it 's not hard to imagine that , for a lot of people , it would be enough to drive them from the city , or even cities generally .
Maybe not even initially , but after realizing that they had n't been able to sleep for a month , or that they were carrying around a gnawing unease .

A Democrat Posted by Ogged
on 09.30.05 Via the apostropher , a so very very good response by Barack Obama to groups on the left who are angry that any Democrats voted to confirm John Roberts , and a response , more generally , to calls that Democrats should n't compromise .
Read the whole thing to see a politician who " gets it , " both in terms of the issues , the language that will resonate with his audience , and broad political strategy .
These two paragraphs in particular seem downright wise .
According to the storyline that drives many advocacy groups and Democratic activists - a storyline often reflected in comments on this blog - we are up against a sharply partisan , radically conservative , take - no - prisoners Republican party .
They have beaten us twice by energizing their base with red meat rhetoric and single - minded devotion and discipline to their agenda .
In order to beat them , it is necessary for Democrats to get some backbone , give as good as they get , brook no compromise , drive out Democrats who are interested in " appeasing " the right wing , and enforce a more clearly progressive agenda .
The country , finally knowing what we stand for and seeing a sharp contrast , will rally to our side and thereby usher in a new progressive era .
I think this perspective misreads the American people .
From traveling throughout Illinois and more recently around the country , I can tell you that Americans are suspicious of labels and suspicious of jargon .
They do n't think George Bush is mean - spirited or prejudiced , but have become aware that his administration is irresponsible and often incompetent .
They do n't think that corporations are inherently evil ( a lot of them work in corporations ) , but they recognize that big business , unchecked , can fix the game to the detriment of working people and small entrepreneurs .
They do n't think America is an imperialist brute , but are angry that the case to invade Iraq was exaggerated , are worried that we have unnecessarily alienated existing and potential allies around the world , and are ashamed by events like those at Abu Ghraib which violate our ideals as a country .
Go on .

Based on the last eight years of living in Washington -- where I sometimes feel like the last yoga hold - out -- I 'd have thought the practice of yoga was much more widespread .
And that got me thinking .
I bet you could actually devise a pretty accurate test about how close you are to the center of the left based on what percent of your friends do yoga .
And if your male friends do yoga , too , well then , that 's about all that needs saying about what community you 're living in .
You might as well be eating flax seeds .

At work , there are some people I need to call only when something goes wrong .
They pick up the phone , I tell them it's me , and their voice falls , they try to act cheery , but I can practically see them slump down in their chairs .
Makes me feel horrible , even though it 's almost always something their company has screwed up .
( And no , it would n't be appropriate to call them just to say " hello " at other times . )

The Magic Words Posted by Ogged
on 09.28.05 Some of our winger friends -- first rate legal minds , every one -- are on about the fact that the indictment of DeLay does n't say what he did .
As I understand the charge of conspiracy , all Earle needs to show is that at some point , DeLay was informed of the funneling of funds and said something like " Ok . "
The end .
In fact , I 'd guess that DeLay 's involvement will be easy to prove .
The bulk of the case will go to showing that the transfer of funds from one organization to the other was intended to circumvent the law .
Without someone ( credible ) willing to testify , that 's a pretty tough case to make .
And like I said below , I sure hope Earle can make it , because if he can't , it 's going to become very difficult to use the law to check corrupt politicians .

To be a great artist is inherently right wing .
A great artist like Dylan or Picasso may have some superficial , naive , lefty things to say , but underneath , where it counts , there is a strong individual , taking responsibility for his place in the world and focusing on that .

on 09.28.05 Thinking about my self - congratulations in the previous post , I think " George Bush does n't play by the rules " is n't the line I 'd go with today .
What about " George Bush tries to skate by " ?
That seems to capture the privileged , spinning , corrupt , corner - cutting , no - plan - having nature of this administration .
Of course , we 're not running against George Bush anymore , but we can try .

You 've seen it elsewhere , but I really want to type it out : Tom Delay has been indicted .
( On the other hand , it 's really damn sad that this country is governed by such a corrupt bunch of people .
Here 's hoping this is the beginning of the end of that , and we can get back to the normal levels of corruption that we miss so much . )
Hey [ blogger self - congratulation ahead ] , maybe I should get back into the political blogging business :
What 's the one - sentence knock on George Bush ? ...
Here 's my nomination : George Bush does n't play by the rules .
From the Iraq war , to the South Carolina primary against McCain , to the outing of Valerie Plame , to putting political hacks into career civil service positions , to not holding enough press conferences , to refusing to release records , to his National Guard service all of these are examples of not playing by the rules ... because Bush is running on " boldness , " he 'll keep doing and bringing up things that can be called reckless , or indifferent to the rules .
And we should also keep in mind all the ongoing investigations of Republicans .
Every trickle of news about any of them will feed the " not playing by the rules " beast .
Having a counter to the " bold " / " strong leader " / " decisive " persona lets us shift the debate to facts and outcomes , which are overwhelmingly in our favor .

on 09.28.05 Have I mentioned that I 'm involved in a competition ?
My HDL ( good cholesterol ) is 79 .
A friend 's is 83 .
I 'm gonna beat his butt ( and have a higher HDL count ) .
And now I have a new weapon : booze .
I knew that alcohol was supposed to be " good " for the heart , but this is news to me .
The major benefit of alcohol seems to come from its ability to boost levels of HDL , the good cholesterol that helps keep arteries clear of plaque ...
" Depending on the individual , you can get increases of 10 to 30 percent in HDL in a week , " says Harvard epidemiologist Eric Rimm .
" Nothing else in the diet can have such a dramatic impact on HDL in such a short time . "
Bwahahaha !
Because , you see , this friend is a devout Muslim .
No nip at the bottle for him .
Victory is mine !!
( If you , like my Ex , feel compelled to point out that statistically , my friend and I have equivalent levels of HDL , just go bang your shin into a sharp corner , ok ? )
Oh , and the new news in the article is that all alcoholic drinks have this health benefit , not just red wine .
( But only in moderation , lushes . )

I 've never understood the heated authorship fights around Shakespeare either .
Whoever wrote the plays , that was Shakespeare ; what more do you need to know ?

It must some kind of milestone for blogging that now people are expected to know about blogs in cocktail - party detail , but not to actually read them .
In fact , I think the milestone is something like this : there is n't much of a distinction between blogs and mainstream media anymore , and not really even a distinction between professional and amateur online writing ; the operative distinction is between professional and amateurish writing .
( What does that distinction have to do with the Playboy cheat - sheet ?

on 09.27.05 Tia beats me to something I 've been meaning to post about .
Clive Owen has a distinctly average looking wife ( married 10 years ) , and Tia says that she likes him better because of it .
Absolutely .
Famous person w/ average - looking partner might be the best example of " keeping it real . "
My impression is that there 's a great temptation for famous people to couple with equally famous people ; both because of their own insecurities , and because it seems to be a good career move nowadays .
Anyone who can resist is probably someone of good character .

on 09.27.05 As Young Ben heads off to his first days of graduate school , I thought it might be a good time to offer words of advice to others at the very start of their graduate careers .
Ben 's talent and charm will carry him through with no problems , I 'm sure , but for any interested parties I offer these opening salvos .
Add your own in comments !
1 . The most important thing : recognize that graduate school is not at all college + 1 .
It 's a job - training program designed to qualify you for a very specialized line of work .
You 're a professional now .
Act accordingly .
2 . As a corollary of ( 1 ) , keep in mind that your relationship with your faculty is completely different from an undergraduate's .
In some ways this is good : you 're halfway a colleague .
In some ways this is bad : you 're completely dependent on them .
Getting abused , harassed , or mistreated ?
Any of the official lines of complaint might well result in a lukewarm letter of recommendation , which pretty much kills your chance at a job .
Never make the mistake of thinking that you 're one of them .
3 . In case you 're unclear about what ( 2 ) means : it entails that you should not [ behave badly ] .
I know you 're really drunk , but respect the boundaries .
4 . Partly because your work is all - consuming , and partly because of the strange relationship mentioned in ( 2 ) , you need to have some kind of outlet outside of your academic life .
This will cushion you when , inevitably , the professional life hits the skids .
If you can , make nonacademic friends .
Keep up at least one hobby from the old days .
You need to blow off some steam once in a while .
5 . Keep fit .
I 'm completely serious about this .
6 . Listen to your peers .
At the start of my program , I got invaluable advice from older , wiser heads .
Keep your ears open to learn the ins and outs , the standards , the expectations , and so on .
No need to reinvent the wheel .
7 . In any department there are stand - up , heart - of - gold people who are on your side .
There are also [ bad people ] .
Find out who 's who , and do n't take their word for it .
[ Appearances can be misleading ] .
Bite your tongue and bide your time , honky .
8 . Do your fair share .
From time to time , there will be annoying obligations .
Go to the parties .
Attend the receptions .
Take the visiting speaker to lunch .
You 're building a little goodwill , and it can really help to be seen as a team player if things get rough .
Being a good citizen is a good thing .
9 . Network like mad .
Meet people and impress them with your cleverness .
10 .
Do n't waste time whining about the market -- you could be working with that energy .
My advice : every six to twelve months , surface for air .
Go meta about your career choice .
If you 're not enjoying graduate school , if the work is n't moving you , if it 's not paying off as you 'd hoped , consider dropping out .
If you decide to continue , do n't think about it until six months later .
11 . There 's no shame in dropping out , either .
Smarter people than you are flourishing in nonacademic careers , and I invite you to bite their asses if you think your " Dr " means anything .
12 . Enjoy it .
You 'll probably never be around such smart , interesting , and completely fucked up people ever again .
It 's good times .
I 'm sure I 've contradicted myself , come across like a jerk , whatever .
I 'll amend as appropriate .

On the other hand , I had a great tan in February .

( This is Crocker 's dough - boy face after setting that world record .

She could n't stop laughing when she noticed this .
She ran around the living room with this psychotic Barney smile which never changed , and then started saying , " I 'm happy .

She laughed some more and then screamed , " Help me !
I do n't know how to feel . "

Why does China have to spend millions on new repressive opinion - blocking technologies and new complicated anti-speech rules when it could just adopt TimesSelect across the board and accomplish the same thing more efficiently and with less controversy ?...
The NYT might even lease its proprietary TimesSelect technology to threatened dictatorships around the globe as a turnkey solution to their Internet dissent problems .

Tillman , Again Posted by Ogged
on 09.25.05
It 's hard to read about Pat Tillman and not get very depressed that he 's dead ( and was killed by friendly - fire , at that ) .
Interviews also show a side of Pat Tillman not widely known  a fiercely independent thinker who enlisted , fought and died in service to his country yet was critical of President Bush and opposed the war in Iraq , where he served a tour of duty .
He was an avid reader whose interests ranged from history books on World War II and Winston Churchill to works of leftist Noam Chomsky , a favorite author .
...
Baer , who served with Tillman for more than a year in Iraq and Afghanistan , told one anecdote that took place during the March 2003 invasion as the Rangers moved up through southern Iraq .
" I can see it like a movie screen , " Baer said .
" We were outside of ( a city in southern Iraq ) watching as bombs were dropping on the town .
We were at an old air base , me , Kevin and Pat , we were n't in the fight right then .
We were talking .
And Pat said ,  You know , this war is so f illegal . '
I do n't just mean that he was a liberal , though that 's nice .
What I admire is the unusual mix of principled , brave , patriotism , with the political sophistication to make the distinction between fighting Al Qaeda and attacking Iraq .
What a waste .

on 09.25.05 Just saw Grizzly Man , which I 'd forgotten about for a while , but which you really ought not miss if it 's still playing where you live .
If you have n't heard of it , my dear biscuits , it 's the story of Timothy Treadwell , who lived among Alaskan grizzlies for 13 summers , before he and his girlfriend were finally killed by a bear .
I expected a nature documentary , intertwined with the story of an eccentric naturalist .
It 's more accurate to say that it 's the strangely riveting story of a complete nutcase , who managed to shoot unbelievable video .
Finally , a lot of reviews call this " heart - breaking , " and I do feel bad for his girlfriend , but Treadwell himself is crazy in a very funny way , and really , he could n't have gone out any other way .
