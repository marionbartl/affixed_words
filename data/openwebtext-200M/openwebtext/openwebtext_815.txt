The UN's sixteenth World Water Day , being commemorated today , is dedicated to cross - border waters .
Israel and the Palestinians in the West Bank have two trans - border water systems .
One is the aboveground Jordan water basin , which Jordan , Syria , and Lebanon also share .
Israel prevents Palestinians any access to this water reservoir .
The other is the Mountain Aquifer underground water system .
The Mountain Aquifer , which crosses the Israeli and Palestinian borders , is the primary , largest , and highest quality water source for Israelis and Palestinians , providing 600 million cubic meters of water a year .
Israel uses eighty percent of the output for its needs and allocates the remainder to the Palestinians .

Discriminatory and unfair division of the shared water sources creates a chronic water shortage in the West Bank .
Average per capita daily water consumption of Palestinians in the West Bank is two - thirds of the amount recommended by the World Health Organization .
Due to the shortage , many Palestinians have to buy water from tankers at three to six times higher than regular prices , forcing poor families to spend up to one - fifth of their income on water , compared to the slightly more than one percent that average - income Israeli families spend on water .

The water shortage in the West Bank is aggravated in drought years , as occurred last year , or in arid years , like this year .
The water shortage is not felt in household use or allocation of water to residents of Israel or to settlers in the West Bank .
An extreme example of the inequality is seen in the average daily per capita water consumption of the 396 settlers living in Pnei Hever , in Hebron District ( 194 liters ) , compared to the figure for the 70,000 Palestinians living in the eight kilometers away in the town of Yatta ( 27 liters ) .

The water shortage in the West Bank also results from the neglect in building water infrastructure and the handling of sewage in the West Bank during the course of the Israeli occupation .
Even after establishment of the Palestinian Authority , and transfer of the responsibility for the Palestinian water economy into the hands of the Palestinians , Israel , which currently controls sixty percent of the land area of the West Bank , makes it difficult for the Palestinian Authority to carry out plans to build and improve water infrastructure .
In 2008 , 227,500 Palestinians , in 220 towns and villages were not connected to a water network .
Another 190,000 Palestinians live in towns and villages in which a water network covered only part of the community .
The old infrastructure results in the loss of two - thirds of the water running through the network , three times the average water loss in water networks in Israel .
The lack of regular treatment of most Palestinian sewage in the West Bank prevents purification and use for agricultural irrigation needs .
The discriminatory and unfair division of shared water sources violates the right of Palestinians to water , sanitation , and health .
In addition , Israel 's policy violates the rights of Palestinians to gain a livelihood , by preventing development of the agricultural sector , one of the most important branches of the Palestinian economy .
More statistics :
Average daily use for flushing toilets in Israel : 55 - 60 liters
Average daily use for taking showers in Israel : 55 - 60 liters .
Average daily per capita water consumption for the 48,000 residents of Tubas District , in the northeastern West Bank , is 30 liters .
Average daily per capita water consumption for the 175 settlers in Beka'ot , in the Jordan Valley , twelve kilometers southeast of Tubas , is 401 liters .
Average daily per capita water consumption for the 180,000 residents of Bethlehem District , south of Jerusalem , is 71 liters
Average daily per capita water consumption for the 7,714 residents of the Efrat settlement , which lies 6.5 kilometers east of Bethlehem , consume an average of 217 liters .

In rich societies , poorer people have shorter lives and suffer more from almost every social problem .
Likewise , large inequalities of income are often regarded as divisive and corrosive .
Now , in a groundbreaking book , UK - based researchers go beyond either of these ideas to demonstrate that more unequal societies are bad for almost everyone within them — the well - off as well as the poor .
The authors forcefully demonstrate that nearly every modern social and environmental problem — ill - health , lack of community , life , violence , drugs , obesity , mental illness , long working hours , big prison populations — is more likely to occur in a less equal society , and adversely affects all of those within it .
The remarkable data the book presents and the measures it uses are like a spirit level which we can hold up to compare the conditions of different societies .
It reveals that if Britain became as equal as the average for the four most equal of the rich countries ( Japan , Norway , Sweden and Finland ) , levels of trust might be expected to increase by two - thirds , homicide rates could fall by 75 per cent , everyone could get the equivalent of almost seven weeks extra holiday a year , and governments could be closing prisons all over the country .
The Spirit Level : Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better , shows us how , after a point , additional income buys less and less additional health , happiness and wellbeing .
The issue is now community and how we relate to each other .
This important book explains how it is now possible to piece together a new , compelling and coherent picture of how we can release societies from the grip of pervasive and schismatic dysfunctional behaviour , a picture which will revitalise politics and provide a new way of thinking about how we organise human communities .
It is a major new approach to how we can improve the real quality of life , not just for the poor , but for everyone .

Updated Micro- blogging site Twitter suffers from a potentially devastating vulnerability that forces logged - in users to post messages of an attacker 's choice simply by clicking on a link .
It could be used to spawn a self - replicating worm .
The XSS , or cross-site scripting , error was discovered by Secure Sciences Corp researchers Lance James and Eric Wastl , who have fashioned this link to demonstrate their finding .
Clicking on it while logged in to Twitter causes users to immediately broadcast an innocuous message to all of their followers , as this dummy account shows .
More than 15 hours after this story was first published , the gaping hole remained .
A Twitter representative has yet to return our email .
Of course , it would be just as easy to craft links that do considerably more damage .
Tweets are limited to just 140 characters , making it almost mandatory to use shortened URLs that obscure their final destination .
While it 's possible to preview the link before visiting , many Twitter users have grown so accustomed to them they click on them directly .
" With a technology such as twitter , I could use it to infect massive amounts of twitter readers / users , say with malware or steal their accounts , etc. , " James wrote to The Register by instant messenger .
" Because it 's a serious hack , I was being nice and put a disclaimer up , but it could ( have ) been as bad as the samy is my hero stuff + more . "
A white - hat hacker , James was speaking hypothetically , of course .
James , who is the author of Phishing Exposed , was referring to the notorious Samy worm , the self - replicating XSS exploit that in 2005 added more than 1 million MySpace friends to a user named Samy .
In the process , the social networking site was knocked out of commission .
As the user base of Twitter has skyrocketed , so too have attempts to exploit the site .
Hackers have waged cat - and - mouse attacks on the site using so - called clickjacking exploits that , like the XSS vulnerability exposed by James and Wastl , forced logged - in users to tweet simply by clicking on an innocent - looking button .
Twitter has been quick to patch the vulnerabilities , but the hackers have been known to launch new attacks that work around the countermeasures .
Now , it 's clear Twitter has new potentially serious vulnerabilities to stay on top of .
We 'd expect this vulnerability to be fixed in fairly short order , but like the clickjacking tit - for - tat , we expect this is n't the last you 'll hear of XSS attacks on the site . ®
THE Obama Administration has suffered another setback in its quest to fill important posts .
Charles Freeman , the President 's choice for a major intelligence position , has withdrawn his name , blaming pro-Israel lobby groups , which he said had " plumbed the depths of dishonour and indecency " to quash his appointment .
The latest setback in filling important jobs in the Administration comes as it faces a barrage of criticism over the slow pace of appointments , particularly posts in Treasury .
It also follows several other withdrawals by prominent nominees , including two candidates for secretary of commerce - the New Mexico governor , Bill Richardson , and a Republican senator , Judd Gregg - and President Barack Obama 's first choice for the important health portfolio , Tom Daschle .
These withdrawals involved investigations about political fund - raising , or the failure to pay tax .
In Senator Judd 's case it represents a failure of Mr Obama 's attempt for bipartisanship in preparing his stimulus package .

Gold - price history charts denominated in US dollars show a flat line at $ 35 that runs through most of the 20th century .
Thirty - five dollars was , after all , the official gold price as set by the United States Treasury from 1934 on .
Prior to 1934 , the gold price had been fixed at $ 20.67 for almost a century , before President Franklin Roosevelt confiscated Americans ' gold and revalued the price to $ 35 that year .
The $ 35 price was an integral part of the Bretton Woods Agreement negotiated after World War II .
Bretton Woods specified a system of fixed parities between the US dollar and other industrialized currencies , and the convertibility by foreign central banks of US dollars into gold at $ 35 an ounce .
In other words , each dollar paid out around .03 ounces of gold , or 0.888671 grams .
This was not like the classical gold standard of the 1800s but a pseudo gold standard foisted on the world by central planners .
Convertibility could not be exercised by private individuals , only central bankers , and most currencies were not redeemable in gold ; only the dollar was .
Again , gold charts show a flat line through the Bretton Woods era of the 1940s , '50s , and '60s at $ 35 .
The problem with these flat lines is that they imply that monetary authorities were able to keep the actual gold price fixed at the precise level they specified , and conversely , that the purchasing power of the dollar remained constant .
This was not the case , as the market price for gold often differed from the official $ 35 price , sometimes quite significantly , and the dollar actually lost value against most goods , even though it was officially fixed versus gold .
When doing research for a gold chart project of my own , I spent several weeks nosing through old papers and magazines for market data from the era of $ 35 gold .
I hope to bring back into public memory the divergence of gold 's market price from the official price , a data set that has been forgotten .
Our chart begins in 1954 with the reopening of the London gold market , which , prior to being closed at the outbreak of World War II , had been the world 's largest venue for trading the metal .
Through the 1950s the London price fluctuated between $ 34.85 and $ 35.17 .
These upper and lower limits were set by arbitrage and the threat thereof .
Foreign central banks , as stipulated in Bretton Woods , could go to the Federal Reserve in New York and convert their dollars into gold or gold into dollars at $ 35 plus 8.75 ¢ commission .
The cost of shipping and insuring gold from New York to London and vice versa was 8 ¢ to 10 ¢ per ounce .
Thus , when the London price traded down to $ 34.82 or so , it made sense for central banks to buy gold in London , ship it to New York for 8¢ , then sell it to the US Treasury at the $ 35 official price less 8.75 ¢ commission , earning arbitrage profits of around 1 ¢ an ounce .
Conversely when gold rose to $ 35.18 in London , it made sense to buy gold from the US Treasury at $ 35.0875 , ship it to London for 8¢ , sell it at $ 35.18 , and earn arbitrage profits of 1¢ .
In the mid to late 1950s the balance of payments between the United States and the rest of the world grew ever more dramatically in the latter 's favor .
This was due to growing US military expenditures overseas , corporate investment outflows , and foreign aid to a rebuilding Europe .
As a result , European and Japanese central banks accumulated continuously growing US - dollar reserves .
Nineteen fifty - eight marked the first year in which foreign central banks exercised their convertibility rights in significant amounts and returned their dollars for gold .
US gold reserves fell 10 % from 20,312 metric tons to 18,290 that year , another 5 % in 1959 , and 9 % in 1960 .
At the same time , the US Federal Reserve continued to increase notes in circulation , resulting in dollars being backed by ever smaller amounts of gold .
Since this threatened future potential convertibility , rumors grew that the United States would be forced to devalue the dollar to staunch the outflow .
The US government tried to prevent gold from leaving by twisting the arms of foreign central banks to keep their dollars , and , later , setting travel limits on American tourists overseas and US private investment in Europe .
By 1958 , London gold was trading closer to its $ 35.18 upper limit rather than the bottom limit at $ 34.82 , which it touched in 1957 .
Participants in the London market — increasingly dominated by throngs of private investors and speculators — were ever more certain that the United States ' plunging gold reserves would force it to dramatically devalue the dollar .
In September 1960 , the United States experienced its largest weekly decline in reserves since 1931 as foreign central banks went to New York for the metal .
At the same time it was becoming evident that presidential challenger John F. Kennedy would win that fall 's election .
Kennedy 's promises to lower interest rates and increase government spending convinced many that gold outflows would only increase .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 12 % from the end of August to October 25 , hitting its lowest point since 1958 .
In this context , London gold prices rose above $ 35.20 for the first time in September 1960 , and on October 20 hit $ 36 , far above the ceiling implied by arbitrage .
The next week , a speculative gold rush touched off and the price soared , briefly hitting $ 41 before closing at a high of $ 38 .
With London trading at an impressive 17 % premium to the official price , the world 's monetary architects had lost control of the market price of gold .
Gold 's market premium to the official price was no small matter as it questioned the very fundamentals of the planned monetary system .
After all , if an ounce of gold was trading at a premium over dollar claims to that same ounce of gold , then the validity of those dollar gold claims was being challenged by the market .
Furthermore , by giving foreign central banks even more incentive to exchange dollars for gold at $ 35 in New York in order to sell it in London at $ 36 to $ 38 , the premium would exacerbate the United States ' gold drain .
" Gold 's market premium to the official price was no small matter as it questioned the very fundamentals of the planned monetary system . "
At the eleventh hour , the New York Federal Reserve cut an informal deal with the Bank of England to resupply said bank with any gold it spent , at its own discretion , in suppressing the gold price .
Prices soon began to fall as the Bank of England sold .
As one of his last acts as president in 1960 , Eisenhower tried to suppress gold demand further by making it illegal for Americans to buy the metal overseas — an extension of Roosevelt 's 1933 ban on American domestic holdings of gold .
By March 1961 , the gold price had been strong - armed back to $ 35.10 .
Fearing another gold rush in October 1961 , Western central banks formalized a plan by which they pooled together several hundred million dollars worth of gold , this stock to be mobilized to control the London gold price .
Thus was born the famous London gold pool .
The pool became an active buyer of gold when the London price fell below $ 35.08 an ounce and a seller at $ 35.20 .
In its first test — the week of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 — the pool effectively supplied the London market despite demand for the metal being greater than the 1960 gold rush .
Prices could not penetrate $ 35.20 .
The pool 's reputation strengthened : gold would stay benign and near $ 35.08 for the next few years .
In 1963 and 1964 , the United States would lose only small amounts of gold reserves to foreign central banks , and the London pool bought gold to support its price rather than suppressing it .
Bretton Woods , the dollar , and the $ 35 fix seemed safer than ever .
But with the Gulf of Tonkin incident in late 1964 and the acceleration of the Vietnam war in 1965 , US foreign military spending exploded .
This was compounded by President Lyndon B. Johnson 's expensive Great Society project , paid for in part by the Federal Reserve issuing new money to buy government debt .
The balance - of - payments deficit grew ever faster , and the United States lost more gold reserves to dollar - laden foreign central banks exercising convertibility and through gold - pool sales in London .
US gold reserves resumed their downward trajectory , declining by 9 % in 1965 .
At the same time , speculators were buying gold in record numbers in London , forcing price up to $ 35.20 , the London pool 's line in the sand .
Things only got worse with the exit of the French from the gold pool in early 1967 , tensions in the Middle East , and the collapse of the British pound in November 1967 .
The Tet offensive of early 1968 indicated the US commitment to Vietnam would only grow .
Speculators bought en masse in London through the remainder of 1967 and into March 1968 .
By March 14 , the members of the gold pool , having sold about $ 2.75 billion worth of gold to protect the $ 35.20 ceiling , or about 10 % of the member 's total reserves since the pound 's devaluation , had had enough .
They asked the Queen of England to close the London market the next day and dissolved the once - feared gold pool .
When London reopened two weeks later , without suppression , prices immediately vaulted up to $ 38 and would soon rise to $ 42 .
Reviewing this period in gold 's history makes evident the extreme difficulties experienced by the monetary authorities in controlling the price of gold .
The typical flat $ 35 line on charts gives the illusion that the dollar was a stable store of value .
In actuality , market prices diverged from $ 35 — and dramatically so in 1960 .
The attempt to fix the dollar at 0.888671 grams and gold at $ 35 — this while the dollar 's purchasing power had declined versus all other goods — was a losing battle carried out at great expense .
The United States and its allies would sell huge quantities of gold at prices below what a free market would have borne .
In 2009 , amidst some of the largest central - bank rescues and bailouts in history , let the 1960 gold rush and the eventual collapse of the London gold pool in 1968 stand as a reminder to us that central planning of monetary matters is doomed to fail .
The Big Table Issue
My friend / ex- coworker Sam the Wonder Boy used to send me late night AIM messages comprised of only three letters , “ M.F.R . ” This would then send chills up my spine , and I ’d curl up on the floor in fetal position and weep nonstop .
OK , I ’m exaggerating a quite bit , and Sam does n’t do that anymore .
“ M.F.R. ” stands for “ Monthly Forecast Report . ”
It was one of the many modules of a huge intranet web application we worked on years ago .
As the name implies , it was a report .
Before arriving to the actual report screen , the user could select some criteria such as date range , products , etc .
Depending on the selection , the report can have up to sixty columns and thousands of rows .
It was quite a challenge both on the backend and frontend .
I initially created it using server side Excel API and dumped it to the frontend as an excel sheet .
In version 2 I made it as an HTML table with the Excel export option .
In version 3 I ditched HTML and went for Crystal Report , in version 3.5 it became Active Report .
In version 4 we rewrote the whole application as a .NET client app , with the report section being Excel again .
In version 5 , well there was n’t a version 5 .
The whole project got outsourced to India and the team was disbanded .
But that ’s a blog for another day .
The Big Table Problem
In the perfect world of a web developer ’s life , a data table would have a few columns and rows so it ’d fit perfectly in our content area and blends with the rest of the UI elements seamlessly .
But in reality , a data table can get very big and ugly especially in financial web applications .
The problem is when the table gets big it no longer fits in the viewport .
A viewport can be the whole area of the browser window , or a container area within the browser window ( e.g. a scrollable DIV ) .
To see the rest of the data the user would have to scroll .
However this causes the user to lose sight of the column headers and the first column .
Another problem is performance .
A huge recordset takes a while to generate on the backend , and even longer to render to the frontend .
The Approach
I feel as UI developers / designers , our first role is a problem solver .
This means the solution does n’t always lie in HTML / CSS / JS .
Looking at the situation at hand , is HTML the best medium ?
I have to say no , that ’s why I opted for Excel first .
The benefit of using Excel :
Excellent with table format display .
Allows users for additional manipulation such as formulas and freeze panels .
Most printing friendly , the user can define print area .
Fast rendering .
However , there are downsides to using Excel :
Users have to have Excel client installed to view sheets .
( Although this is n’t too much of a problem for an intranet app )
Does not allow data manipulation ( not easily at least , unless you make custom VBA )
Let ’s look at other alternatives .
Active Reports and Crystal Reports are two popular enterprise level reporting tools .
I used both of them with .
Net . Both software have RIA report viewers using ActiveX .
Pros :
Fast rendering time .
Allows pagination .
Allows custom template report format .
Cons :
Additional cost .
Not printing friendly .
Does not allow data manipulation , view only .
Of course , the approaches I listed are for Microsoft shops .
There may be other non-MS solutions I ’m not familiar with .
Excel is my favorite so far .
However , there are times when you ’re stuck doing it the HTML way , which is what the rest of this article is about .
HTML Solutions
We have three issues : vertical , horizontal , and performance .
Vertical is the easiest to solve .
First , we can lock the column headers , so when the user scrolls down they ’d still see what data they ’re looking at .
When the table has hundreds or thousands of rows , it ’s best not to display them all at once .
Not only is it a performance hog , but it ’s also rather meaningless from a usability POV .
Pagination is the most commonly used .
One of the best examples of pagination combined with AJAX I ’ve seen is done by Blizzard ’s World of Warcraft Armory page .
The filtering feature allows the user quickly find data on the fly .
Another method without using pagination is , to load just enough rows to over fill the viewport area .
Then when the user scrolls a bit more , it loads additional rows using AJAX .
Google reader does this when loading feeds .
I feel this is the best way for front - load performance .
However , it may not be feasible where the user needs to see additional data quickly .
Horizontal scrolling issue , unfortunately is something I have n’t been able to solve despite much research .
Ideally , we should be able to lock the first column ( typically the identifier column ) , so when scrolling sideways , the user can easily identify which row they ’re looking at .
As of now , we ca n’t freeze column easily .
During my research , I ’ve run into a few sites that came close , but all with drawbacks .
Lock or Freeze Table Columns – Great work by Brett Merkey .
This is as close as it gets .
Unfortunately , it uses IE expression , which means it wo n’t work with Firefox or Safari .
However , if you ’re building an intranet app where IE is the standard browser , this is the only solution I know of .
Smart Grid , an Ajax - driven table – This does the job somewhat , however it has no control over data cell height , if the data spans to multiple lines .
Jquery driven table – This one uses nested tables and Jquery .
It ’s quite a performance hog .
x Table – The end effect is good , however this was done by nesting multiple tables .
Freeze Panes – Again , huge nested tables .
Not too realistic for real world applications .
Google Docs –
The spreadsheet in Google Docs behaves very much like Excel .
However it ’s done by DIVs .
Although this is a viable solution , but I feel the cost of development is too much .
My Proposal
I think the best way is to have the browser to have the ability to lock columns natively .
Unfortunately as of now , COL and COLGROUP have very little support other than few CSS attributes .
Ideally , to freeze a column , I ’d like it to be as easy as :
COL . freeze , COLGROUP .
freeze { position : fixed / relative ; /* lock */ display : none / inline / block etc /* so we can toggle */ left : x ; stacking - order : n ; /* allows multiple freezing */ }
I ’ve been reading up on HTML5 and CSS3 specs .
I do n’t see any evidence yet that much , or any improvement will be done with COL / COLGROUP in the near future .
One may argue that this is asking too much , after all HTML / CSS is for presentation only .
But seeing the advanced selectors in CSS3 , I believe the consensus is to have CSS replace some of the workarounds that are currently done by Javascript .
If you have any suggestions / solutions to this problem , I ’d LOVE to hear from you .

The Rise of Influencer Marketing
We will all probably agree that influencer marketing is on a steady rise , but figures and statistics might help us appreciate the acceptance and the recent boom that has hit the business .
Market Size :
The most important yardstick to measure business growth is the market size .

The figure presently stands at 6.5 billion , which is a 400 % increase from 2016 .
Internet Searches : Another vital metric to measure growth and popularity is the amount of search engine searches .
Increase in search is directly proportional to the increase in consciousness and acceptability .
The phrase influencer marketing was searched 4000 times in 2015 , 6400 times in 2016 , 21,000 in 2017 , and 60000 in 2018 , representing a 1500 % increase within 3 years .

What to Consider for a Successful Influencer Marketing
About 80 % of influencer marketing campaigns are successful while the failed campaigns are caused by inadequate planning and failure to set ideal key performance indicators ( KPIs ) .
The following should be considered for a successful influencer marketing campaign :
Get the Right Influencer : A major cause of a failed influencer marketing campaign is choosing the wrong influencer for your campaign .
Getting an influencer in the wrong niche , an influencer with poor contents , and an influencer that does n’t use your products are few of the reasons why an influencer might not be ideal for your campaign .
Making use of influencer agencies in choosing your influencer can help you avoid the mistake of choosing the wrong influencer .
Creative Contents :
When launching an influencer marketing campaign , it is essential to dedicate some time to creating engaging contents , and choosing a creative influencer may help with this .
Right Target Audience :
The success and popularity of an influencer does n’t make him ideal for the campaign .
Age , location , and gender of influencers ’ followers must be taken into consideration when choosing the influencer for your influencer marketing campaign .
Adequate Preparation :
Whatever is worth doing is worth doing well , to ensure a successful campaign , linking a URL to the campaign , selecting the right influencer and setting KPIs that will ensure good ROI are necessary .
Effective Terms of Agreement :
After identifying your ideal influencer , the next step is setting terms of the agreement that will clearly spell out each party ’s responsibilities as well as avoiding copyright issues .
What to Avoid When Choosing Influencer
Choosing the wrong influencer ruins an influencer marketing campaign , always avoid the following when choosing your influencer :
Fake Followers :
The major headache for brands seeking influencer is engaging fake influencers , there are a few fake influencers with fake followers , fake likes , comments , and reposts , going through agencies can greatly reduce chances of dealing with fake influencers .
One - off Campaign :
In order to improve influencer marketing campaign success , it is pertinent to try a continuous campaign that keeps your target audience engaged .
Making use of brand ambassadors who are contracted to represent , promote , and market the brand summer , winter , spring , and fall , ensuring your audience are engaged continuously .
Avoid Very Expensive Influencers : Macro influencers with huge followers command a huge fee , kylie Jenner charges 1 million dollars per post while Cristiano Ronaldo charges 975,000 dollars for a single post .
Only huge brands can afford the services of the macro influencer .
Always stick to a budget and make judicious use of micro-influencers in your niche .
Going beyond your budget to engage the services of a macro influencer may result in a failed campaign if the ROI does n’t complement the investment .
What Makes an Influencer Marketing Campaign a Successful One ?
Few metrics determine the success of an influencer marketing campaign , KPIs vary from brands to brands and campaign to campaign .
The commonest KPIs are :
Brand Awareness :
The essence of an influencer marketing campaign is to improve people ’s consciousness about the brand , to measure the level of awareness , engagements like likes , clicks , comments , links , and shares are taken into consideration .
This is particularly important for a newly launched product .
Improved Sales :
It is natural to experience a surge in sales during and after a successful marketing campaign .
New Audiences :
By the end of the campaign , brand awareness must have improved among the desired age bracket , gender , and location targets .
Lead Generation : Making instant sales is important , but so is having a list of potential customers and keeping in touch .
During the influencer marketing campaign , names and emails can be generated through account setups , give away entries , and newsletters .

These people are known as influencers , brands rely on influencers to reach more target audience , these types of marketing is rapidly replacing old ways of marketing of print media and billboards .
In the last year Influencer agencies almost doubled , the market grew more prominent with a potential to grow even bigger , by preparing adequately and going through the diligent process in selecting an influencer , brands can grow their brand bigger by reaching their target audience in different geographical locations .
Bank stocks have rallied hard off their lows on claims that they 've been largely " profitable " in Q1 , after quarters of losses .
January and February were apparently quite good for the likes of Citi ( C ) and JPMorgan ( JPM ) , but as Jamie Dimon said Friday , March has n't been quite as hot .
But a trader who works for one of the major banks has made a shocking claim -- that this profitability was solely due to exceptionally favorable trading with AIG ( AIG ) .
The claim , which was made in an email Zero Hedge , is essentially that AIG has become a pure money laundering operation , and rather than unwind its trades at favorable terms for itself , it 's offering banks excellent trades on the taxpayer dime .
AIG , knowing it would need to ask for much more capital from the Treasury imminently , decided to throw in the towel , and gifted major bank counter - parties with trades which were egregiously profitable to the banks , and even more egregiously money losing to the U.S. taxpayers , who had to dump more and more cash into AIG , without having the U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner disclose the real extent of this , for lack of a better word , fraudulent scam .
In simple terms think of it as an auto dealer , which knows that U.S. taxpayers will provide for an infinite amount of money to fund its ongoing sales of horrendous vehicles ( think Pontiac Azteks ) : the company decides to sell all the cars currently in contract , to lessors at far below the amortized market value , thereby generating huge profits for these lessors , as these turn around and sell the cars at a major profit , funded exclusively by U.S. taxpayers ( readers should feel free to provide more gripping allegories ) .
What this all means is that the statements by major banks , i.e. JPM , Citi , and BofA , regarding abnormal profitability in January and February were true , however these profits were a ) one - time in nature due to wholesale unwinds of AIG portfolios , b ) entirely at the expense of AIG , and thus taxpayers , c ) executed with Tim Geithner 's ( and thus the administration 's ) full knowledge and intent , d ) were basically a transfer of money from taxpayers to banks ( in yet another form ) using AIG as an intermediary .

Could this be the subject of Andrew Cuomo 's latest subpoenas ?
We were a bit confused last week about a report which said he was looking into the unwinding of the CDS , and the extent to which the company was making its counterparties " whole " .
If AIG is purposely trading " badly " to pump up its counterparties , it 's certainly a scandal -- not just of the company but of all the regulators and politicians that have designed this process .
Stay tuned on this .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. Navy ships capable of shooting down ballistic missiles are being moved to the Sea of Japan , a Navy spokesman said .
The move came as North Korea was preparing for an expected rocket launch next month .
Later Thursday , Japan announced it was ready to fire on the rocket if any part of it enters Japanese airspace .
Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada 's order was to destroy debris from the North Korean rocket if its launch fails and fragments fall in Japanese territory , said defense ministry spokesman Yuichi Akiyoshi .
The U.S. ships , with powerful Aegis radar that can track ballistic missile launches , were on regularly planned deployments but were , " prepared to track a launch or more , if afforded , " according to a U.S. Navy official who could not be named due to the sensitivity of the information .
The United States generally has a number of Aegis - capable ships in the Sea of Japan because of the threat posed by North Korea to launch missiles .
The ships monitor the region and are designed to track and , if need be , shoot down ballistic missiles .
See a satellite image of a North Korean launch site »
North Korea says it will launch a commercial satellite on top of a rocket sometime between April 4 and April 8 .
But Western governments fear the North Koreans will actually put a long - range missile on top of the rocket .
If North Korea launches , the Obama administration may have as little as five minutes to decide whether it is a threat and , if necessary , try to shoot it down .
The USS Hopper , a destroyer with the Aegis radar system aboard , was scheduled for a port call in Japan in coming days .
But the port call was canceled and the ship will remain in the Sea of Japan ahead of the launch , the official said .
Two other U.S. Navy Aegis - capable destroyers , the USS Chaffee and USS McCain , were leaving the port in Sasebo , Japan , and were heading to South Korea for a ceremony in coming days , according to the U.S. Navy official with direct knowledge of the operations .
The U.S. Navy just wrapped up military exercises with the South Korean military , bringing a number of its ships into the region .

Rogue Government
June 19 , 2008
As painful as it is to say , the true purpose of the federal government flying military helicopters around Denver without any sort of notification to the public is part of a plan to socially engineer people to the reality of a militarized police state .
The terrorists in the federal government are continuing their push to have a fully functioning martial law apparatus .
The city of Denver was recently invaded by a large number of military helicopters without any sort of warning given to the general public .
It was originally speculated that this training exercise had something to do with the upcoming Democratic National Convention , but a spokesman with Special Operations said that it was n’t related and that the exercises would last all week .
It is interesting that this spokesman said it had nothing to do with the upcoming DNC .
If that ’s the case , than what is the real purpose of this exercise ?
They are selling this exercise as an anti-terror drill , but in reality it has nothing to do with stopping terrorism .
The terror war has been proven to be a fraud time and time again so it certainly is n’t about fighting the terrorists .
As painful as it is to say , the true purpose of the federal government flying military helicopters around Denver without any sort of notification to the public is part of a plan to socially engineer people to the reality of a militarized police state .
The Denver Daily News reported on this situation and asked why the public was n’t informed in advance that these military helicopters would be flying around .
The article is largely a white wash of the situation , but it is incredible how the local government spins this military exercise as something that will actually benefit the local community .
Below is a statement from the local government on this urban warfare exercise .
“ The federal agencies sponsoring the ongoing multi-agency training in Denver agreed to make the proper notifications regarding the exercises to prevent surprise and inconvenience to Denver residents .
There seems to have been a misunderstanding about the reach and scope of these notifications , and they did not occur in the manner expected by the city .
“ Although these exercises are in no way connected to the upcoming Democratic National Convention , Denver officials were well aware that there would be heightened sensitivity to an exercise such as this because of its proximity to the convention ..
“ Denver recognizes that these are our federal partners , and we are fortunate that they have chosen Denver for their training exercises .
Should there ever be an emergency here that would require federal assistance , they will be familiar with our city and how best to navigate it . ”
So according to the local government it is good for the federal government to come in without any announcement to the public and conduct week long training exercises with military helicopters flying around .
Needless to say , these types of exercises are not good because the terror war is a fraud and there ’s no reason to have military helicopters flying around in a heavily populated area under the guise of this false war .
Unfortunately , what is happening in Denver is just part and parcel to other martial law oriented exercises that we ’ve seen in recent weeks and months .
Just recently , U.S. Marines invaded Indianapolis to conduct martial law training , we have unlawful police checkpoints being setup in Iowa under the guise of protecting people from the flooding , there was also a FEMA camp exercise in Iowa prior to the flooding and finally we have additional reports of black helicopters in Florida .
There is no question that these training exercises are simply meant to desensitize the American people to this draconian police state .
It is funny that the stooges in the mainstream press paint anyone who talks about black helicopters as a tinfoil hat wearing nut when there are now mainstream news reports of black helicopters flying around in Denver and in Florida .
Mainstream news organizations are not in the business of reporting news , but instead are in the business of ensuring the status quo remains the status quo .
Martial law exercises are bad enough , but unannounced martial law exercises are even worse .
These types of drills that we are seeing in Denver is yet more proof that the federal government is nothing more than a fascist crime syndicate that wants to enslave the American people .

The Post ’s Shailagh Murray has apparently
decided that it ’s so hard keeping track of all of Norm Coleman ’s lawyers nonsensical arguments about why he should n’t have to leave the senate that the only reasonable answer is just to hold a whole new vote .
Now , bear in mind , that ’s not me saying they ’re nonsensical .
It ’s mainly the judges shooting him down right and left .
Here ’s Murray from an online chat today at WaPo.com ( via Balloon - Juice ) …
Baltimore , Md. : Speaking of junior senators , do you see Al Franken being seated anytime before 2010 ?
Shailagh Murray : Perhaps , but it seems more and more likely that the Minnesota race will wind up as a re-vote .
At this point it seems like the quickest way to resolve the situation .
For what it ’s worth , there is vanishingly little evidence that there will ever be a revote of this race because Franken was certified ( *) the winner after the recount and Coleman ’s suit to overturn that result is going badly .
Even if it went well , it would almost certainly lead to reopening the recount rather than having a revote .
Asked later what she was talking about , she continued …
I do n’t have a revote “ theory . ”
I ’m just wondering how long this is going to sit in the court system .
If Coleman looks desperate , why not just hold another election and beat him handily ?
But there ’s a process in place here , and we can only assume both parties will abide by it .
So if he ’s really flailing so badly in his court case , why not just hold a new election ?
( ed.note : * — certification , in this context , has a particular meaning under Minnesota law .
As the term is normally understood , the canvassing board certified Franken ’s election .
But under Minnesota law , a certificate of election cannot be issued until all legal challenges have been exhausted .
So , because Coleman still had the right to appeal the result , no certificate was issued . )
I was interviewed by several journalists last week about Rick Santelli ’s Rant — my exact quote was it had a “ Faux ” feel to it .
( I have n’t seen it in print yet )
What was so odd about this was that Santelli is usually on the ball ; we usually agree more often than we disagree .
He ’s been responsible for some of the best moments on Squawk Box .
But his rant somehow felt wrong .
After we ’ve pissed through over $ 7 trillion dollars in Federal bailouts to banks , brokers , automakers , insurers , etc. , this was a pittance , the least offensive of all the vast sums of wasted money spent on “ losers ” to use Santelli ’s phrase .
It seemed like a whole lot of noise over “ just ” $ 75 billion , or 1 % of the rest of the total ne ’er - do - well bailout monies .
It turns out that there may be more to the story then originally met the eye , according to ( yes , really ) Playboy magazine .
Excerpt :
“ How did a minor - league TV figure , whose contract with CNBC is due this summer , get so quickly launched into a nationwide rightwing blog sensation ?
Why were there so many sites and organizations online and live within minutes or hours after his rant , leading to a nationwide protest just a week after his rant ?
What has n’t been reported until now is evidence linking Santelli ’s “ tea party ” rant with some very familiar names in the Republican rightwing machine , from PR operatives who specialize in imitation - grassroots PR campaigns ( called “ astroturfing ” ) to bigwig politicians and notorious billionaire funders .
As veteran Russia reporters , both of us spent years watching the Kremlin use fake grassroots movements to influence and control the political landscape .
To us , the uncanny speed and direction the movement took and the players involved in promoting it had a strangely forced quality to it .
If it seemed scripted , that ’s because it was .
What we discovered is that Santelli ’s “ rant ” was not at all spontaneous as his alleged fans claim , but rather it was a carefully - planned trigger for the anti-Obama campaign .
In PR terms , his February 19th call for a “ Chicago Tea Party ” was the launch event of a carefully organized and sophisticated PR campaign , one in which Santelli served as a frontman , using the CNBC airwaves for publicity , for the some of the craziest and sleaziest rightwing oligarch clans this country has ever produced .
Namely , the Koch family , the multibilllionaire owners of the largest private corporation in America , and funders of scores of rightwing thinktanks and advocacy groups , from the Cato Institute and Reason Magazine to FreedomWorks .
The scion of the Koch family , Fred Koch , was a co-founder of the notorious extremist - rightwing John Birch Society . ”
What is Playboy ’s evidence of this ?
“ Within hours of Santelli ’s rant , a website called ChicagoTeaParty.com sprang to life .
Essentially inactive until that day , it now featured a YouTube video of Santelli ’s “ tea party ” rant and billed itself as the official home of the Chicago Tea Party .
The domain was registered in August , 2008 by Zack Christenson , a dweeby Twitter Republican and producer for a popular Chicago rightwing radio host Milt Rosenberg — a familiar name to Obama campaign people .
Last August , Rosenberg , who looks like Martin Short ’s Irving Cohen character , caused an outcry when he interviewed Stanley Kurtz , the conservative writer who first “ exposed ” a personal link between Obama and former Weather Undergound leader Bill Ayers .
As a result of Rosenberg ’s radio interview , the Ayers story was given a major push through the Republican media echo chamber , culminating in Sarah Palin ’s accusation that Obama was “ palling around with terrorists . ”
That Rosenberg ’s producer owns the “ chicagoteaparty.com ” site is already weird — but what ’s even stranger is that he first bought the domain last August , right around the time of Rosenburg ’s launch of the “ Obama is a terrorist ” campaign .
It ’s as if they held this “ Chicago tea party ” campaign in reserve , like a sleeper - site .
Which is exactly what it was .
This looks like more than a coincidence .
This is now a very serious charge .
I have no insight as to whether this is true or not — but it certainly deserves a serious response from both Santelli and CNBC .
If its false , then they should say so , and demand an apology from Playboy .
But if any of it is true , well then , Santelli may have to fall on his sword , and CNBC may owe the public an apology .
I am VERY curious if there is any truth to this .

http://www.playboy.com/blog/2009/02/backstabber.html
From the February 19 edition of CNBC ’s Squawk Box :
REBECCA QUICK ( co-anchor ) :
We want to get to our task force right now .
Rick Santelli and Jason Roney of Sharmac Capital are standing by at the CME Group in Chicago , and Rick , have you been listening to this conversation ?
SANTELLI : Listening to it ?
I ’ve been just glued to it because Mr. Ross has nailed it .
You know , the government is promoting bad behavior .
Because we certainly do n’t want to put stimulus forth and give people a whopping $ 8 or $ 10 in their check and think that they ought to save it , and in terms of modifications — I ’ll tell you what , I have an idea .
You know , the new administration ’s big on computers and technology .
How about this , president and new administration ?
Why do n’t you put up a website to have people vote on the Internet as a referendum to see if we really want to subsidize the losers ’ mortgages ; or would we like to at least buy cars and buy houses in foreclosure and give them to people that might have a chance to actually prosper down the road , and reward people that could carry the water instead of drink the water ?
JOE KERNEN ( co-anchor ) : Hey , Rick , did —
TRADER : That ’s a novel idea .
KERNEN : Hey , Rick , did you — oh , boy .
They ’re like putty — they ’re like putty in your hands .
Did you hear —
SANTELLI : No they ’re not , Joe .
They ’re not like putty in our hands .
This is America .
How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor ’s mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can’t pay their bills ?
Raise their hand .
President Obama , are you listening ?
TRADER : How about we all stop paying our mortgage ?
It ’s a moral hazard .
KERNEN : This is like mob rule here .
I ’m getting scared .
I ’m glad I ’m — I ’m glad I ’m —
CARL QUINTANILLA ( co-anchor ) :
Get some bricks and bats —
SANTELLI : Do n’t get scared , Joe .
They ’re already scaring you .
You know , Cuba used to have mansions and a relatively decent economy .
They moved from the individual to collective .
Now , they ’re driving ’ 54 Chevys , maybe the last great car to come out of Detroit .
KERNEN :
They ’re driving them on water , too , which is a little strange to watch —
SANTELLI : There you go .
KERNEN : Hey , Rick , how about the notion that —
Wilbur pointed out you can go down to 2 percent on the mortgage —
SANTELLI : You could go down to minus - 2 percent .
They ca n’t afford the house .
KERNEN : — and still have 40 percent — and still have 40 percent not be able to do it .
So why are they in the house ?
Why are we trying to keep them in the house ?
SANTELLI : I know Mr. Summers is a great economist , but boy , I ’d love the answer to that one .
QUICK : Wow .
KERNEN : Jason —
QUICK : [ unintelligible ] you get people fired up .
KERNEN : Jason , you wanna —
SANTELLI : We ’re thinking of having a Chicago tea party in July .
All you capitalists that want to show up to Lake Michigan , I ’m gonna start organizing .
QUICK : What are you dumping in — what are you dumping in this time ?
Housing ?
Cars ?
SANTELLI : We ’re going to be dumping in some derivative securities .
What do you think about that ?
QUINTANILLA : Mayor Daley is marshalling the police right now .
KERNEN : Rabble - rouser .
QUINTANILLA : The National Guard .
KERNEN : Jason , are you nearby ?
Can you hear the cheering over —
RONEY : I am , but I do n’t have the gallery directly behind me , so it ’s going to be tough to follow that act for sure .
KERNEN : Yeah , exactly .
You agree ?
RONEY : I ’ll have to run down to the pit .
Well , clearly , we ’re going to debate the moral issues of what government is and is not doing for some years to come .
I mean — it ’s apparent , even for traders it ’s — the market gaps up and down a significant amount each day just on what one government may or may not do .
We ’re up 10 points or so on the S&P on the idea that core Europe may have some bank stability plans , so — the traders market , the uncertainty of the market will continue until we get through this process of weekly government plans .
QUINTANILLA :
You know , Rick , one of our producers says if Roland Burris steps down , man , Senator Santelli , the junior senator from Illinois .
It ’s a possibility .
I ’m just saying —
SANTELLI : Do you think I want to take a shower every hour ?
The last place I ’m ever gonna live or work is D.C .
KERNEN : Have you raised any money for Blago ?
SANTELLI : No , but I think that somebody ’s gonna have to start raising money for us .
QUICK : Hey , Rick ?
Can you do that one more time , just get the mob behind you again ?
I love —
QUINATILLA : Have the camera pull way out .
QUICK : Yeah , pull way out .
Everybody listen to Rick Santelli .
KERNEN : You ca n’t —
I do n’t think — you ca n’t just do it at will , can you , Rick ?
I mean , you have to say something .
QUICK : Yeah , do it at will .
Let ’s see .
SANTELLI : Listen , all ’s I know is , is that there ’s only about 5 percent of the floor population here right now , and I talk loud enough they can all hear me .
So if you want to ask ’em anything , let me know .
These guys are pretty straightforward , and my guess is , a pretty good statistical cross-section of America , the silent majority .
QUICK : Not - so - silent majority today .
So Rick , are they opposed to the housing thing , to the stimulus package , to everything out there ?
SANTELLI : You know , they ’re pretty much of the notion that you ca n’t buy your way into prosperity , and if the multiplier that all of these Washington economists are selling us is over 1 , then we never have to worry about the economy again .
The government should spend a trillion dollars an hour because we ’ll get 1.5 trillion back .
QUICK : Wilbur ?
WILBUR ROSS ( chairman , W.L. Ross & Co. ) : Rick , I congratulate you on your new incarnation as a revolutionary leader .
SANTELLI : Somebody needs one .
I ’ll tell you what , if you read our Founding Fathers , people like Benjamin Franklin and Jefferson , what we ’re doing in this country now is making them roll over in their graves .
Obama and his aides are plunging ahead on a large and expensive agenda that virtually assures 2009 will be marked by intense partisan battles .
Hardened Obama plans new fights
Emboldened by his victory on the stimulus package — but chastened by the pothole - pocked road that got him there — - President Barack Obama and his aides are plunging ahead on a large and expensive agenda that virtually assures 2009 will be marked by intense partisan battles about the size and role of government .
White House aides say they have concluded that Obama too frequently lost control of the debate and his own image during the stimulus battle .
By this reckoning , the story became too much about failed efforts at bipartisanship and Washington deal - making , and not enough about the president ’s public salesmanship .
Advertisement
For Obama ’s next act , the program is the same as he has been planning for months : New Deal - style plans to rescue struggling homeowners and rewrite regulations on the financial markets , plus a budget proposal that lays the groundwork for sweeping health care reform .
But the strategy to promote these items is getting an emergency overhaul .
Obama plans to travel more and campaign more in an effort to pressure lawmakers with public support , rather than worrying about whether he can win over Republican votes in Congress .
Officials suggested that the new , more partisan tone Obama embraced last week in his speech before House Democrats at their retreat and continued at his news conference Monday was what he should have been doing all along .
Meeting with reporters Thursday night , White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel said that there were times during the stimulus debate when “ I do n’t think we were sharp about the benefits ” of the legislation , letting Washington process dominate the message .
Reflecting as “ somebody who has been in this town , ” he observed that “ there ’s an insatiable appetite for the notion of bipartisanship here and we allowed that to get ahead of ourselves . ”
But Emanuel said that they recognized they had overdone their initial outreach to Republicans and had offered " a sharp message for the last week . "
For now , the hard - charging chief of staff added , “ He has an open hand , but he has a very firm handshake . ”
Translation :
Yes , the president will continue to do obligatory outreach to the GOP , but he ’s not going to be burned again by an out - of - power and toothless minority for the sake of appearances .
This may be the only practical course .
Obama ’s call for compromise and change in how Washington does its business was quickly rebuffed by both parties in Congress .
Both Democrats and Republicans have political needs and authentic ideological priorities that matter a lot more to them than whether Washington is a civil place .
Implicit in Obama ’s lessons - learned appraisal from the stimulus battle is also a new realism about his own party .
His initial decision to give House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the liberal House Democratic caucus so much leeway in drafting the stimulus bill allowed Obama to be tarred with some of the most controversial items in the package .
Going on the road means he is able to soar over Pelosi ’s head as well as Republicans .
The Washington climate , which led to a party - line vote on the stimulus , has big political implications :
It means that Obama will have sole ownership — whether that means credit or blame — for all the massive changes in government he envisions over the coming year .
For the near term , Obama ’s public agenda will keep its overwhelming emphasis on domestic matters , even as many of the most fundamental questions are in foreign policy .
Within the administration , urgent reviews of Iraq and Afghanistan policies are underway .
But the West Wing itself has been preoccupied , with Emanuel himself taking the lead on legislative arm - twisting on the stimulus vote .
The president ’s next few agenda items will be grouped as “ getting the country ’s financial house in order ” — a plan to help struggling homeowners , financial regulatory reform and the budget .
“ Financial regulatory and housing are the other … legs of the economic stool , ” Emanuel said .
Looking ahead , he also mentioned stem - cell research and renewable standards on energy , Obama continues to plan for year - one action on health care , starting with his budget request , although officials announce that his ambitions have been set back by the withdrawal of Tom Daschle , who was to be his White House health czar and secretary of Health and Human Services .
After a Valentine ’s weekend getaway to Chicago , Obama will sign the stimulus package early next week and then make his first trip to the West , with stops planned in Colorado and Arizona .
He ’ll also leave the country for the first time as president , heading over the border Thursday for a one - day trip to Ottawa for meetings with Prime Minister Stephen Harper and other Canadian officials .
The following week , the president will head to Capitol Hill to speak to a joint session of Congress , then will present his budget for 2010 .
On Feb. 23 , the day before the address to Congress , the president will convene a “ fiscal responsibility summit ” in Washington , most likely at the White House , with top administration officials , members of Congress and outside groups to discuss entitlement and long - term budget issues .
“ There will be a lot of things [ going on ] slowly but concurrently , ” a White House official said .
“ Senate ]
Finance will start working on health care , [ House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry ]
Waxman will start working on energy , [ House Financial Services Committee Chairman ] Barney Frank will start working on regulatory reform . ”
Capitol Hill Democrats expect an energy bill to be fast - tracked , since Waxman wants to move ahead on a comprehensive energy and global warming bill .
The White House may only pursue a lesser initial package dealing with such matters as funding the transmission grid .
David Plouffe , Obama ’s campaign manager , said the American people view Obama “ even more strongly now than they did before , ” because has responded to a “ crisis of leadership ” in the government and the corporate worlds — “ a sense that no one was in charge , no one was trying to course - correct . ”
During his Thursday roundtable with print reporters , Emanuel pointed proudly to the “ set of accomplishments ” from Obama ’s first three weeks , but acknowledged : “ There are things both on the inside and the outside I would have changed . ”
“ Inside , being how we would have handled certain negotiations , ” he explained , noting that given the size and speed of a bill with “ these many moving parts , there are differences [ of ] interpretation . ”
Obama looked liberated and at ease when he finally took to the road this week , prompting the banner headline “ Salesman - in - chief ” in his hometown Chicago Tribune .
“ We ’ve got to get him out of that White House , ” a top adviser said , listing “ some very valuable lessons ” learned from the stimulus fight .
“ He ’s happier , he ’s better , he ’s more effective .
The inside game is important , but it ’s actually not where the success of his presidency is going to come . ”
Officials say that although Obama wo n’t necessarily travel every week , as was suggested in one briefing , he will continue to be out of the White House a lot .
“ He feels best , he is at his best , and our agenda is the most popular and at its best when it ’s getting sold by the popular in the administration and the person who connects with voters , ” one official said .
A longtime adviser contends that Obama “ actually did n’t spend a lot of political capital ” on the stimulus , “ because at the end of the day , he was n’t on the phone begging Democrats to vote for it . "
The adviser added : “ He ’s going to get credit for getting some stuff done at a time when people are just desperate to feel like something is happening . ”

RHYS SUND was standing on the deck of his house in Chum Creek , near Healesville , when the smoke came .
There were 15 people in the house - seven small children among them - and as the fire came closer , Mr Sund knew they had to get out .
Standing in his boardshorts , he could not have imagined that , only hours later , he would play a major part in a daring rescue of his terrified family and neighbours on the back of a small tractor as the blaze threatened to swallow everything in its path .
CBS - owned online social networking music website Last.fm has announced that listeners outside US , UK and Germany will have to pay to use last FM 's listening services soon .
It will cost users 36 Euros per year ( 3 Euros per month ) to listen to tracks Last.fm , a figure mitigated by the fact that there is a 30 - track free trial .
All the other services including scrobbling , recommendations , charts , biographies , events and videos will remain free in all countries .
The move is likely to be motivated by pressures from the entertainment industry as well as decreasing revenues from the advertising sector which bankrolled Last . fm during the good years .
Last.fm has not said when the price plan will be introduced .
More than 30 million people use Last .fm every month , more than twice the amount of people using the service a year before .
The company also claims to be working with more than 280,000 labels and artists , building what has become the largest catalogue of any web radio platform with more than 7 million tracks .
Earlier this month , Youtube UK announced that it was blocking premium music videos after talks over royalties payout to musicians broke down .

Last.fm decision to introduce the price scheme means that many will to Spotify instead .
Spotify offers a free , ad supported version as well as a premium version which costs £ 99 per year , three times what Last . fm is charging .
A few days ago , ad supported music website Spiralfrog closed down as well following adverse economic conditions .

Amarok 2.0 offers a totally new user interface , extensive integration with various web - based audio services , support for a multitude of new KDE 4 technologies , and many other important changes .
Amarok , which was first released in 2003 by developer Mark Kretschmann , became one of the most popular and widely - used KDE applications on the Linux desktop .
The program is adored by its users for delivering a massive amount of power and flexibility in a very functional interface that leverages a wide range of KDE 's capabilities .
The new version brings the power of Amarok into the KDE 4 era with many significant improvements .
Although Amarok 2 largely stays true to its roots , there have been some highly controversial changes along the way .
One move that has attracted criticism is the adoption of MySQL Embedded for Amarok 's internal database and the decision to drop support for other database options .
The major overhaul also forced the developers to drop a few features , such as playlist filtering and support for portable audio devices , that will eventually be brought back in future versions .
Although a few of the major changes in version 2 will create some transitional difficulties for some users , the program itself is is now on a much stronger foundation for future innovation .
The user interface has been restructured with some major changes .
The active playlist is displayed on the right - hand side in a new list view that prominently displays album art and groups together consecutive songs that are from the same album .
This makes it easy to reorder these groupings together .
Album art is also displayed in the improved collection manager .
The center of the user interface is dominated by the contextual information area , which is implemented with Plasma .
The decision to adopt Plasma inside of Amarok generated some controversy , but the move brought some pretty big advantages .
Plasma , which was first introduced in KDE 4 for the new desktop shell , allows developers to build flexible interactive widgets — called plasmoids — that provide an interface to an underlying data engine .
Plasmoids are easy to develop and can be made in several other programming languages , including Ruby and C#. Supporting Plasma in Amarok will make it easier for users to extend the program and build new components that can be used in the context area .
The context area in the final release is much improved over what we saw in previous prereleases .
It has a paging system so that users can lay out several different sets of plasmoids and switch between them by clicking through the list .
There is also a button that allows users to zoom out and see thumbnails of all the pages so that they can select the one that they want to jump to .
The concept appears to be closely modeled after Plasma 's activity system in KDE 4 .
Amarok 2 ships with several plasmoids , most of which are designed to display additional information about the currently playing song .
These include plasmoids for track info , song lyrics , and Wikipedia information .
Their contents will change automatically when new songs start to play .
The Plasma context area is also used for drag - and - drop interaction with the application .
When you drag songs from the collection over the context area , it will change and display an interactive list with some of the options from the item 's context menu .
You can activate one of the actions in the list by dropping songs onto it .
Although the Plasma - based context area has some great functionality , it also has some weaknesses and limitations .
The font rendering in Amarok plasmoids is terrible and it makes the text difficult to read .
The layout is also very awkward in some places .
For example , the controls for managing plasmoids overlap the bottom plasmoid in the container .
Amarok is the first KDE application to make extensive use of embedded Plasma elements , so that aspect of the program is still experimental in some ways .
Plasma support will likely improve in future versions as Plasma continues to mature .
Scripting
One of the major features in 2.0 is a new scripting engine that allows developers to extend the program and add additional functionality using QtScript , a programming language that is based on the ECMAScript standard .
Amarok 's QtScript integration was implemented by Peter Zhou as a Google Summer of Code project .
A significant portion of Amarok 's functionality is now exposed through the scripting APIs , including support for manipulating playlists and collections , controlling playback , and customizing the user interface .
QtScript supports
Qt 's signal and slot callback model , which means that scripts can also bind functions to application events .
In several blog entries written earlier this year , Zhou demonstrated how to use some of those capabilities .
As an experiment , I made my own Amarok script that will detect when a new song starts playing and then automatically post the title and artist to Twitter :
/* Qt Twitter Script SegPhault ( Ryan Paul ) */ Importer.loadQtBinding ( " qt.core " ) ; Importer.loadQtBinding ( " qt.network " ) ; Amarok.Engine.trackChanged.connect(function ( ) { var TrackInfo = Amarok.Engine.currentTrack ( ) ; /*
This should probably use the toPercentEncoding function instead of replace , but I could n't figure out how to convert its QByteArray output back into a regular string */ var txt = ( " Listening to " + TrackInfo.title + " by " + TrackInfo.artist ) .replace ( " " , " % 20 " ) http = new QHttp ( " www.twitter.com " ) ; http.setUser(" segphault " , " XXXXX " ) ; http.post (" /statuses/update.xml?status= " + txt , new QByteArray ( ) ) ; } ) ;
Amarok has a lot of other advanced scripting capabilities that go much deeper than the example above .
Amarok 's scripted services API makes it possible for developers to use QtScript to add support for entirely new external content providers .
Amarok 's tight integration with the Librivox public domain audiobook provider is one example of a QtScript - based service .
The code for this service is remarkably concise and ability to add services in this manner has helped contribute to the large number of content sources that will work right out of the box in Amarok 2 .
Amarok scripts can even have their own custom user interfaces .
Last month , Zhou showed that it is possible to build a graphical user interface with the Qt Designer tool and then dynamically load the XML user interface description file into Amarok and display it at runtime with QtScript .
This is achieved by leveraging the QUiLoader class from the QtUiTools library .
Another really intriguing Amarok 2 scripting example is the Amarok webcontrol interface , which was created by Ian Monroe and is still in an early stage of development .
In a blog entry written a few months ago , Monroe explains that he used QTcpServer and QHttp to build a lightweight web server in QtScript that will allow users to remotely control Amarok .
Conclusion
After extensive testing , I 'm convinced that Amarok 2 is a major improvement .
Although it still has some weak areas that need improvement and there are still some missing features that need to be brought back , the overall user experience is better and the new infrastructure will make it possible for the player to evolve faster .
I am especially impressed with its scripting capabilities and I think that this extensibility will enable end users to do a lot of innovative things with the program .
Amarok 2 is available for download from the project 's web site and has already been packaged for several distributions .

bonus shot : the best vegetarian chili i've ever eaten
Several years ago , for a period of 7 years , I gave up all meat except for seafood .
I did it on a dare : a vegan friend bet me I could n't go without meat for 2 weeks .
I proved him wrong , and would 've remained mostly - meat - free except for a fateful trip to Egypt when some coworkers treated me to a traditional Egyptian barbeque .
I tried it to be polite , but by the end of the meal , I had two chicken drumsticks in each fist , barbeque sauce dripping off of my chin and down my arms .
It was n't pretty : when I fall off the wagon , honey , I fall off with gusto .
Ahem .
Last year for Lent , I decided to see if I could go back to my mostly - meat - free diet without disrupting life for Marcus and Alex , and it turned out I could .
Except for a regrettable lapse on New Year 's Day this year where a plateful of barbeque ribs ( always with the barbeque ) left me ill for 2 days , my only meat source since this time last year has been seafood .
And honestly , I have n't missed the meat at all .
This year for Lent , I 'm trying to go the whole way : I 'm giving up seafood as well .
So far so good , actually -- I 'd started doing a bit of research on good vegetarian recipes for a few weeks before , and have found some great ones ( except for any which involve tofu .
Oh , tofu , I want to love you , I really do , but what is with that texture of yours ? ) .
One of my favourites , however , is the following for vegetarian chili -- I 've always found vegetarian chili a poor substitute for the real thing , but this one is as close to traditional chili as I 've ever tasted .
I think it 's the bulgur wheat .
It gives the dish the appropriate texture .
Texture is obviously a very big deal to me .
Anyway , I thought I 'd share my recipe here with you .
Again , the following is a conglomerate of various recipes I 've found on the web , tweaked until it worked for me .
And so , I share it with you , in case you 've looking for a hearty , stick - to - your - ribs vegetarian dish : look no further .
Added bonus : while not necessary , this meal involves a crock pot , which makes life so nice and easy for lazy Sunday meals .
VEGETARIAN CHILI OF AWESOMENESS
1 can black beans , drained
2 cans kidney or chili beans , drained
1 large can corn , drained
2 large cans crushed tomatoes
2 medium - sized onions , chopped finely
5 cloves of garlic , finely minced
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground coriander
salt & pepper to taste
2 cups vegetable broth
1 cup bulgur wheat ( Update Feb 14 , 2010 : or , for those with wheat allergies , 1 - 1/ 2 cups quinoa works admirably as well )
extra virgin olive oil
1 . In a large pot , saute onion and garlic in olive oil over medium heat until onions are translucent ( about 5 minutes ) .
2 . Add chili powder , cumin , coriander and cinnamon .
Cook for another 5 minutes , stirring regularly .
Season with salt and pepper to taste .
3 . Transfer the mixture to a crock pot ( or keep in large pot , if desired ) .
Add vegetable broth , black beans , chili beans , corn , crushed tomatoes , vegetable broth and bulgur wheat .
Allow to get close to boiling , and then turn down the heat and simmer until bulgur wheat is tender .
In a regular pot , this should take about 10 minutes .
In a crock pot , I leave it for at least 2 hours or so ( Update 2/14/10 - if using quinoa , maybe 2 - 1/2 hours )
4. Serve hot .
I like to add grated cheddar cheese on top for a little added flavour ( although , omit it to make it vegan -- it 's pretty awesome either way ) .
Also ?
Leftovers freeze well , and frankly , I think this tastes better a day or two after you make it .
Comfortably serves a family of 4 , with enough leftovers for dinner another day .
Enjoy !
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The foreclosure picture suddenly darkened again in February .
More than 74,000 homes were lost to bank repossessions during the month , up from 67,000 in January , according to a regular monthly report from RealtyTrac , the online marketer of foreclosed properties .
Nearly 1.2 million have been lost since the foreclosure crisis hit in August 2007 .
The number of foreclosure filings rose 6 % during the month after falling 10 % in January .
Worse , filings leaped nearly 30 % compared with February 2008 .
And the results confounded expectations : A downtrend had been expected due to the numerous foreclosure moratoriums in effect during the month .
" We were very surprised , " said Realty Trac spokesman Rick Sharga .
" The moratorium were led by big players like Fannie and Freddie and all the major banks .
It was supposed to cover the whole waterfront .
The fact that foreclosures still went up was a shock . "
A particularly troubling aspect of the report was that , for many borrowers , once they go into default , they never get out despite moratorium efforts .
That 's borne out by comparing bank repossessions - homes actually lost by borrowers - with total foreclosure filings :
Nationally , repossessions increased 11 % for the month , almost double the 6 % rise for filings .
The same holds true for year - over - year figures : February filings jumped 30 % compared with last year but repossessions rang up a 60 % gain .
The reason so many people lose their homes once they are in default is partially attributed to the severe home price drops recorded in many of the worst - hit areas .
When borrowers are severely underwater , owing more than their homes are worth , it removes an incentive to keep up with mortgage payments .
Some simply walk away .
The worst hit states
Many states that had previously escaped the worst ravages of the foreclosure plague have started to feel the effects .
In South Carolina , foreclosure filings , which include notices of default , notices of foreclosure sale and bank repossessions , skyrocketed 254 % compared with last February .
The state recorded a filing for every 818 households , the 20th highest rate among the states .
As foreclosures soared , so did South Carolina 's unemployment .
By January , that had reached 10.4 % , the second highest rate , after Michigan , in the nation .
It rose 1.6 percentage points higher than December , the biggest increase in any state , and it jumped 4.7 percentage points over the past 12 months , also more than anywhere else .
According to the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America CEO , Bruce Marks , poorly underwritten mortgages is still the main source of foreclosures in the state .
" It continues to be problem mortgages , " he said , " loans that were unaffordable from the start .
But unemployment is adding to that . "
NACA , which counsels at - risk borrowers and refinances many into low - cost mortgages , is throwing a counseling event in Columbia , S.C. , this weekend .
The agency expects to host more than 20,000 attendees and has already pre-registered more than 7,500 homeowners .
The dubious honor of worst foreclosure state still belongs to Nevada , where one of every 70 households had a filing .
Foreclosures are up 156 % from last February and 9 % from January .
More than 2,800 homes were repossessed by banks during the month .
Second was Arizona , with one filing for every 147 households , up 88 % year - over - year and 23 % from January .
California , with nearly 81,000 filings , had more than any other state , with a rate of one for every 165 households .
Florida had more than 46,000 , one for every 188 households .
Other hard hit states were Idaho ( one in 358 ) , Michigan ( one in 360 ) and Illinois ( one in 369 ) .
Worst hit cities
Among metro areas , Las Vegas , where one in every 60 housing units received a foreclosure filing in February , led all other cities with populations of 200,000 or more .
Another Nevada city , Reno , had one for every 108 hosueholds , the eighth highest rate in the nation .
The Cape Coral , Fla. , metro area had the second highest foreclosure rate in February , with one in 65 housing units .
The rest of the top 10 consisted of six California cities : Stockton ( one in 67 ) , Modesto ( one in 68 ) , Merced ( one in 74 ) , Riverside - San Bernardino ( one in 80 ) , Bakersfield ( one in 85 ) and Vallejo - Fairfield ( one in 111 ) .
Phoenix rounded out the top 10 , with one in every 110 housing units receiving a foreclosure filing .
The Phoenix metro area posted the ninth highest foreclosure rate in February .
Unconfirmed : Lolla Headliner Rumor Roundup
By Johnny Loftus in Arts & Entertainment on Mar 23 , 2009 4:25 PM
As reported here and here , the full list of Lollapalooza 2009 headliners has been revealed .
In addition to the Beastie Boys , Jane 's Addiction , and Depeche Mode , the anchor stages at either end of Grant Park will also feature The Killers and Tool .
Lou Reed , the Decemberists , Neko Case , and Andrew Bird have also been tipped to participate .
Reaction to the headliners was mixed even before Brandon Flowers , et al and those well - off mood rockers in Tool were added to the bill , so what 's the verdict now ?
Does the list of Lolla 's big dogs read like a bizarro world No Alternative compilation , or is it something you can get behind and support ?

Comedian Stephen Colbert has urged viewers of " The Colbert Report " on Comedy Central to write - in his name for NASA 's naming contest regarding a new space station module .
Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert has been talking up the InternationalSpace Station recently , but NASA is iffy on naming a new module at the outpost afterthe comedian even if he wins the U.S. space agency 's online naming contest .
On a recent episode of the " The ColbertReport , " the eponymous host dismissed NASA 's suggested name Serenity , which ledthe online voting as of last week , and challenged the U.S. space agency tohonor the popularity of his TV persona in the final outcome .
" Will you now commit to naming thatmodule Colbert if I win your online vote ? "
Colbert asked WilliamGerstenmaier , NASA associate administrator for space operations , during asatellite interview on Tuesday .
" Well , we 're going to have to go think about that aswe get all the votes and we see where we are , " Gerstenmaier responded , noting that the voting continues until March 20 .
" That 's NASA 's problem , " Colbert said .
" You guys think too much . "
The rules on NASA 's contestsite say that the U.S. space agency will take the popular vote intoconsideration as part of its naming process , rather than as the ultimatedeciding factor .
That contest focuses on naming Node 3 , a new space module setto launch later this year to the space station .
Node 3 holds eight fridge - sized racks for many of thespace station 's life support systems .
It also houses an observation deck thatwould provide a working station for controlling the International SpaceStation 's 57 - foot robotic arm — not to mention excellent views for spacestation residents .
Colbert also brought up the future manned launchesplanned by nations such as India and Iran , and brought up the recentlaunch of NASA 's Kepler space telescope .
" Folks , it is crucial that America leads way infinding habitable planets , " Colbert noted .
" Personally , I cannot waitto taste Ewok . "
Colbert and Gerstenmaier discussed how NASA 's newplanet hunter will try to spot Earth - like planets by the dimming of astar 's light from the planet passing in front .
" America finds itself in a new space race , " Colbert said .
" Parents , start naming your kids ' Buzz . ' "
Neuroscientist Ole Jensen models the Donders Institute MEG machine A distinct pattern of brain waves which occurs just before we make a mistake because of a lack of attention has been discovered by scientists .
The US and Dutch researchers say the discovery could help devise attention - monitoring devices for workers such as air traffic control operators .
It may also help aid new treatments for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
The study appears online in the journal Human Brain Mapping .
Say you 're sitting in a room and you close your eyes - that causes a huge alpha rhythm to rev up in the back of your head
Dr Ali Mazaheri
University of California , Davis
The researchers , from the University of California , Davis , and the Donders Institute in the Netherlands , recruited 14 students to take part in the study , monitoring their brain activity using a recording technique called magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) .
Each student was asked to take part in monotonous test in which a random number from one to nine flashed on a screen every two seconds , and they were asked to tap a button as soon as any number except five appeared .
The test was so boring that even when a five showed up , the subjects spontaneously hit the button an average of 40 % of the time .
The researchers found that about a second before these errors were committed , brain waves in two regions were stronger than when the subjects correctly refrained from hitting the button .
In the back of the head ( the occipital region ) , alpha wave activity was about 25 % stronger , and in the middle region , the sensorimotor cortex , there was a corresponding increase in the brain 's mu wave activity .
Running on idle Researcher Dr Ali Mazaheri said : " The alpha and mu rhythms are what happen when the brain runs on idle .
" Say you 're sitting in a room and you close your eyes .
That causes a huge alpha rhythm to rev up in the back of your head .
" But the second you open your eyes , it drops dramatically , because now you 're looking at things and your neurons have visual input to process . "
The team also found that errors triggered immediate changes in wave activity in the front region of the brain , which appeared to drive down alpha activity in the rear region .
Dr Mazaheri said : " It looks as if the brain is saying , ' Pay attention ! ' and then reducing the likelihood of another mistake . "
He said it should be possible to develop a wireless monitoring device to read an air traffic controller 's brain waves , and trigger an alert when alpha activity begins regularly to exceed a threshold level .
A similar approach could be used to determine waning attention in children with ADHD .
" That can help us design therapies as well as evaluate the efficacy of various treatments , whether it 's training or drugs . "
Professor Nilli Lavie , of the Institute of Neurology at University College London , said in increase in alpha brain wave activity was often associated with sleepiness .
She said the study was interesting , but finding a practical application could prove difficult .
She said : " The best way to tackle the problem of monotonous tasks is to design the task to make it more visually interesting so it is easier to sustain attention . "

We ’re already closer to outright deflation than at any point since the Great Depression .
In particular , the private sector is experiencing widespread wage cuts for the first time since the 1930s , and there will be much more of that if the economy continues to weaken .
As the great American economist Irving Fisher pointed out almost 80 years ago , deflation , once started , tends to feed on itself .
As dollar incomes fall in the face of a depressed economy , the burden of debt becomes harder to bear , while the expectation of further price declines discourages investment spending .
These effects of deflation depress the economy further , which leads to more deflation , and so on .
And deflationary traps can go on for a long time .
Japan experienced a “ lost decade ” of deflation and stagnation in the 1990s  and the only thing that let Japan escape from its trap was a global boom that boosted the nation ’s exports .
Who will rescue America from a similar trap now that the whole world is slumping at the same time ?
Would the Obama economic plan , if enacted , ensure that America wo n’t have its own lost decade ?
Not necessarily : a number of economists , myself included , think the plan falls short and should be substantially bigger .
But the Obama plan would certainly improve our odds .
And that ’s why the efforts of Republicans to make the plan smaller and less effective  to turn it into little more than another round of Bush - style tax cuts  are so destructive .
So what should Mr. Obama do ?
Count me among those who think that the president made a big mistake in his initial approach , that his attempts to transcend partisanship ended up empowering politicians who take their marching orders from Rush Limbaugh .
What matters now , however , is what he does next .
It ’s time for Mr. Obama to go on the offensive .
Above all , he must not shy away from pointing out that those who stand in the way of his plan , in the name of a discredited economic philosophy , are putting the nation ’s future at risk .
The American economy is on the edge of catastrophe , and much of the Republican Party is trying to push it over that edge .
The U.S. Justice Department has launched a civil - rights investigation of the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office after months of mounting complaints that deputies are discriminating in their enforcement of federal immigration laws .
Officials from the Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division notified Sheriff Joe Arpaio on Tuesday that they had begun the investigation , which will focus on whether deputies are engaging in " patterns or practices of discriminatory police practices and unconstitutional searches and seizures . "
An expert said it is the department 's first civil - rights probe related to immigration enforcement .
Arpaio vehemently denies that deputies are illegally profiling as part of his immigration crackdowns .
He said Tuesday that he welcomes the investigation and intends to cooperate fully .
" We have nothing to hide , " he said .
Although Arpaio 's illegal - immigration crackdowns have broad public support , they also have led to calls for an examination of his tactics .
Last year , Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon asked for a federal investigation of possible civil - rights abuses .
Last month , four key Democratic members of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee asked Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to investigate Arpaio .
The lawmakers said Arpaio had exceeded the limits of a federal program that gives local police federal immigration - enforcement powers by ordering deputies to " scour " Latino neighborhoods looking for illegal immigrants based on skin color .
Arpaio , who was easily re-elected to a fifth term in November , called the investigation politically motivated and vowed to continue to arrest illegal immigrants .
" I am not going to be intimidated by the politics and by the Justice Department , " Arpaio said .
" I want the people of Arizona to know this : I will continue to enforce all the immigration laws . "
Arpaio uses the sweeps to enforce the state 's employer - sanctions and anti-smuggling laws .
He also participates in a federal program that lets local officers enforce federal immigration laws .
The sweeps have taken place in mostly Latino neighborhoods or near where day laborers congregate .
They have sparked two racial - profiling lawsuits .
The Justice Department frequently receives racial - profiling complaints against police departments , but investigations are rare , said David Harris , a University of Pittsburgh law professor and racial - profiling expert .
" The fact that this has come to their attention and they have announced their intent to investigate is highly significant , " Harris said .
" It says there is enough there to be investigated .
It 's not an iffy case that ( can be ignored ) . "
Harris said this is the first civil - rights investigation stemming from immigration enforcement .
The probe could last several months .
In a two - page letter dated Tuesday , Loretta King , acting assistant attorney general , said that if the investigation uncovers violations , her office will work with Arpaio to find remedies .
But Arpaio said he will battle the Justice Department in court if he disagrees with any of the changes the department tries to impose .
In the 1990s , the department conducted similar civil - rights investigations and found patterns of police discrimination in about 20 cases , including in Los Angeles and Pittsburgh .
In those cases , law - enforcement agencies agreed to significant changes aimed at preventing discrimination or face a court injunction , Harris said .
" Once the Justice Department finds violations , the threat of going to court is usually enough to encourage them to agree to change , " Harris said .
Changes have included increased supervision and changing policies , Harris said .
Investigations into patterns of police discrimination are " not about punishing individual officers ; they are about changing the fundamental " way an agency operates , he said .
Gordon , who met with King and Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Wodatch on Tuesday in Washington , praised the investigation .
" We should all be encouraged that our new attorney general is taking these issues seriously , " he said .
Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox , the board 's lone Democrat and most vocal critic of Arpaio 's immigration policies , had planned to help deliver a petition today with 35,000 Internet signatures calling for a Justice Department investigation .
" I think they 're going to find racial profiling , which is a civil - rights abuse , " said Wilcox , who was in Washington for a National Association of Counties conference .
" It 's time to put a stop to them .
It may cost us millions in lawsuits . "
Board Chairman Max Wilson , one of the board 's four Republicans , said he was surprised by the investigation .
" I know there 's been some accusations made , " he said .
" I do n't know if there 's any merits to them .
I 've almost had my hands full of people making accusations without people having some solid , hard evidence to back it up . "
Republic reporters Dennis Wagner , Yvonne Wingett and Scott Wong contributed to this article .

Imagine how much time you could save if you had a tool that could help you to avoid typing static text like " Kind regards " or your address .
Like the idea ?
Then you 'll most certainly appreciate the Autokey text expanding utility .
The current version of Autokey is distributed as a tarball archive , and it requires a few additional Python packages : python - gamin , python -xlib , and python - configobj .
On Ubuntu - based distros , you can install them using the following apt - get install command :
sudo apt - get install python - gamin python - xlib python - configobj
Download and unpack then the Autokey archive , move the resulting directory into your home folder , and use the autohot.sh script to launch the application :
sh ./autokey.sh
Autokey sports a rather simple two - pane interface .
The Folders and Phrases pane allows you to group text snippets , or phrases , into folders .
By default , Autokey contains two folders : My Phrases ( with the Addresses subfolder ) and Tray Phrases .
You can , of course , add your own folders and subfolders using the File -> New Top - Level Folder and File -> New Folder commands .
To create a new phrase , select the folder you want and choose File -> New Phrase .
In the right pane , give the phrase a descriptive name in the Phrase Description field and enter the desired text in the Phrase Contents field .
Next you have to specify a trigger which inserts the given phrase .
If you tick the Show in tray menu check box , the phrase becomes accessible via Autokey 's tray menu .
Another option is to specify an abbreviation for the specific phrase , so when you type , for example , " addr " , Autokey replaces it with the related phrase .
To do this , tick the Use an abbreviation check box and enter the desired abbreviation in the Abbreviation field .
Alternatively , you can specify a keyboard shortcut that triggers the phrase .
Switch to the Hotkeys section , tick the Use a hotkey check box , and define the desired hotkey .
In addition to that , you can set up a window filter to trigger the phrase only in a specific application .
For example , if you want to use the phrase only when you work in OpenOffice.org Writer , you can specify the .* - OpenOffice.org Writer filter in the Window Filter section .
Besides conventional text snippets , Autokey allows you to specify so - called macros which can insert the current date and time or execute a shell command .
The Folders and Phrases pane also contains the default Tray Phrases folder .
As the name suggests , all phrases in this folder appear in the Tray Phrases menu in the tray icon .
Finally , to make it easier to quickly find the phrase you want in the Folder and Phrases pane , there is also the Search field .
Using it , you can find the phrase by its title and description , or by its abbreviation .

The issue of Islamic / Islamist gender apartheid is one of epidemic and global proportions .
Although it has reached American shores , the feminist establishment here remains tragically ambivalent about how to deal with forced veiling , arranged marriage , separatism , and honor - related violence , including honor killings .
Many feminists fear that , were they to tie the subordination of women to a particular religion or culture , especially to Islam , that they would be perceived as “ racists , ” or “ Islamophobes . ”
This fear trumps their sincere concern for womens ’ rights and womens ’ lives .
The issue , quite simply , is whether or not non-Muslim white folks can discuss Muslim - on - Muslim crime or black - on - black crime or whether only people who share the same faith and skin - color are allowed to raise this issue .
The issue is also whether American feminists really support an American foreign policy , which both President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton have indicated can or should be tied to womens ’ rights .
Feminists viewed President Bush ’s post 9/11 invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq as morally outrageous and as far more hurtful to Afghan and Iraqi women than was their pre-existing subjugation .
Some feminists believed that women had been better off , at least , in Iraq , before the American invasion .
We may disagree with this analysis but , nevertheless , why would American feminists hesitate to condemn crimes against women which are being committed on American soil by immigrants , including Muslims , from Third World countries ?
The authors have both been speaking out about honor killings in the West and have both described the recent Buffalo beheading of Aasiya Z. Hassan by her husband as an Islamist - style honor - related killing .
Marcia Pappas , the President of NOW - NYS , has been scolded by national NOW ’s President and criticized by a coalition of domestic violence advocates for her views about this .
Dr. Phyllis Chesler , the author of thirteen books , including Women and Madness , has been writing about Islamic gender apartheid and its penetration of the West for many years .
She , too , has been challenged , even condemned , for her views about honor killings in general and for her views about the shocking case of Aasiya Z. Hassan , in particular .
We decided to join forces and write a short piece .
However , we discovered that brevity would not serve our goal .
The problem is much bigger than honor - related violence , honor killings , or this one case in Buffalo .
Indeed , the issue which we still face in 2009 , is one that has plagued American feminist leaders for at least 171 years .
The issue is that of racism and sexism and the diabolical way in which racism continues to trump sexism among feminists .
A little history lesson is in order .
For a long time , American women had been outspoken leaders in the fight to abolish slavery .
However , between 1838 - 1840 , their efforts were increasingly restricted to that of “ silent ” partners in Ladies Auxiliaries .
In 1840 , a World Anti-Slavery convention was held in London .
American women , including Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott , both ardent abolitionists , were not allowed to publicly speak out against slavery because they were women .
Instead , they were condemned to sit behind a partition and remain silent .
Cady Stanton returned home and composed a Declaration of Sentiments , modeled upon the Declaration of Independence .
In 1848 , three hundred American women and men , including former slave and abolitionist , Frederick Douglass , attended the Seneca Falls Womens ’ Rights Convention ; about a third voted for the Declaration which resolved that women should have the right to vote , control property , sign legal documents , serve on juries , and enjoy equal access to education and employment .
This vote and this Convention began the long , slow march towards American female suffrage .
See what former NOW - NYS President , Marilyn Fitterman , had to say about this very subject .
African - American men obtained the vote in 1865 .
It was fifty five years before American women of any race , color , religion , or ethnicity did .
These First Wave feminists and suffragists decided to put womens ’ rights first .
They refused to “ sit silently at the back of the ( abolitionist ) bus , ” and were sometimes willing to work with anyone , including those who were opposed to abolition , to further their cause .
This meant that some of our suffragist foremothers were routinely called “ racists . ”
They were also mocked as unnatural , selfish , and man-hating women .
On the other hand , those men and women who chose abolition over womens ’ rights were rarely ever condemned as sexists , misogynists , or woman - haters .
Fast forward to the American 1960s when many white women , ( Jews , too ) , joined the bravest African - American men and women in a struggle for civil rights .
This was a movement against southern and northern segregation , against Jim Crow and for the integration of public places , including lunch counters , buses , and schools .
The African - American right to vote–free of intimidation or violence– was also at issue .
Women of many races were also involved in the anti-Vietnam war and in various left - tilted black liberation movements which opposed racism , both here and abroad .
But , once again , American women were expected to do the secretarial work , and provide food and sex for the “ real ” leaders who were always men .
In the mid -to late 1960s , one of us left all that , driven out by Marxist , hippie , and black liberationist sexism .
Betty Friedan published the Feminine Mystique in 1963 and NOW began organizing in 1966 .
Second Wave feminism put women ’s ’ rights first and for about fifteen years , we achieved tremendous , dazzling progress .
However , by the end of the 1970s , with the rise of the anti-colonialist , anti-imperialist , and anti-Western academy , the ideas of academics like Edward Said , the author of Orientalism , took precedence over many feminist ideas .
Suddenly , in terms of symbols , women were no longer seen as the most “ wretched of the earth , ” oppressed by both poverty and violence .
Now , Arab men of color , Palestinians , Muslims , took stage center as the world ’s most noble and oppressed victims .
Caucasian feminists and academics were expected to “ atone ” for their country ’s history of slavery , racism , and imperialism by refusing to analyze or protest the fate of non-white women at the hands of their fathers , brothers , husbands , and leaders .
To do so would be “ racist . ”
Only women of color , ( or academics who were women of color ) , could comment on the fates of women of color .
Control of this academic “ discourse ” was viewed as too valuable a resource–one which should not be plundered by those whose ancestors had been racists , crusaders , colonialists , and imperialists .
In the 1970s , feminism had embraced a universalist philosophy which believed in one standard of human rights for all .
By the 1980s , feminism began to devolve into a politically correct “ culturally relativist ” philosophy in which one standard applied to the West and another standard to the formerly colonized Third World .
Because Third World countries suffered from many serious problems , they were seen as blameless innocents who did not deserve to be harshly judged .
Meanwhile , just as left - influenced Western , Caucasian feminists began to view themselves as suspect , and their culture as guilty , they simultaneously began to view Third World barbarians of color as misunderstood innocents .
Feminists did not defend the values of the West to which most intellectuals , especially dissidents from Third World cultures , aspired .
Just as dissidents abroad cited Enlightenment values against the Third World tyrants who impoverished , tortured , and silenced them at home , western academics , including feminists , refused to “ judge ” such tyrants and insisted on viewing them sympathetically .
When forced to , western feminists usually condemned the United States and Europe for having contributed to the rise of such tyrants .
They absolutely could not imagine that Third World barbarism , including corruption , including misogyny , might also be indigenous .
Nor could they see that they , too , were collaborating with evil tyrants .
Thus , despite great interest in connecting with western - style feminists in Third World countries , and despite genuine interest in the plight of women around the world , by the end of the 1980s , American feminists , especially if they were Caucasian , were highly reluctant to condemn barbarism against women of color , Arabs , Palestinians , Muslims by men of color , Arabs , Palestinians , Muslims , since such condemnations were , by definition , “ racist , ” or could potentially be used against men of color by white racists .
In 1848 , American suffragists decided to focus on the rights of American women only .
That struggle was hard enough ; indeed , it is still ongoing .
However , Second and Third Wave feminists in the latter part of the twentieth century , began to focus on the rights of women globally .
To the detriment of feminist movements everywhere , American feminist activists and academics have now recanted , pulled back , apologized , because they have decided that , once again , racism trumps sexism as a feminist concern .
Just as men and women once stood together as abolitionists , we now call upon men and women of all races and religions , including secularists , to stand with us against the subordination of and violence towards women in the name of religion , beginning with Islam or Islamism .
This is the first of two articles .
In our next piece , we will give specific examples of the ways in which mainstream feminists , including NOW , have been sacrificing womens rights in order to be perceived as politically correct in terms of racism .

Roman Catholic and Orthodox Jewish officials in New York are mounting an intense lobbying effort to block a bill before the State Legislature that would temporarily lift the statute of limitations for lawsuits alleging the sexual abuse of children .
A perennial proposal that has been quashed in past years by Republicans who controlled the State Senate , the bill is now widely supported by the new Democratic majority in that chamber , and for the first time is given a good chance of passing .
If signed by Gov. David A. Paterson , a longtime supporter , the bill would at minimum revive hundreds of claims filed in recent years against Catholic priests and dioceses in New York , but dismissed because they were made after the current time limit , which is five years after the accuser turns 18 .
Similar legislation has passed in Delaware and in California , where a 2003 law led to claims that have cost the church an estimated $ 800 million to $ 1 billion in damages and settlements .
The rekindled prospects of the New York bill , known as the Child Victims Act , come at a delicate juncture for the Archdiocese of New York , the nation ’s flagship see , where Cardinal Edward M. Egan is scheduled to hand over the reins in April .
His successor , Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan of Milwaukee , was so hard hit by settlements for past abuse by priests in that archdiocese that he was forced to put its headquarters up for sale .
Sun announced the availability of new flash storage systems equipped with Intel X25 - E SLC ( Single Level Cell ) SSD drives on Wednesday .
The new launch is part of a sustained effort on Sun 's part to push flash storage and its Open Storage initiative across the market ; the company has bet on SSDs as the future home of enterprise data systems and it is n't looking back .
SSD technology has been aggressively marketed by just about everyone as The Next Big Thing , but jumping for Intel 's X25 - E SLC drives may not be the best approach to gaining or holding market share in a depressed economy .
Sun has published a paper ( PDF ) detailing why it feels the time is right for SSD adoption in general and its own products in particular ; the company makes a damning case against the very enterprise - class hard drives it has spent years selling .
Hard drives are slow , inefficient , and consume up to 15 - 20 W of power .
Sun 's ideal data center is one where DRAM , Flash , and HDDs coexist , with hard drives used primarily for bulk storage rather than in situations where fast data access is required .
The server OEM 's portrayal of potential cost and power savings is dramatic to say the least — provided that you drink the Kool - Aid .
The new X25 - E SDD offerings are compatible with Sun Fire and Sun Storage 7000 servers at $ 1,199 a pop ; Infoworld reports that a total of 14 server models are supported .
Solaris ZFS is also
briefly discussed in the company 's whitepaper , and is billed as " ready to seamlessly take advantage of SSDs today .
Unlike less sophisticated file systems , ZFS can recognize different media
types and will optimize the file system to use SSDs as high - performance disks that improve read and write throughput . "
Are we ready for a sea change ?
A year ago , it seemed a given that businesses , particularly large enterprises with a need for high - performance storage systems , would leap on the SSD bandwagon for all the valid benefits they offer .
Such a shift is probably still inevitable in the longer term , but no one is willing to predict the shape of the IT market in 2009 .
Instead of precise figures , analysts are issuing vague warnings of downward trends , with a possible recovery at some point in 2010 .
Sun 's Open Storage initiative ( and the servers built around it ) are based on a hybridized system of DRAM , SSDs , and HDDs .
Given the current economic climate , however , it 's possible that Sun could have the best price / performance ratio available and still see extremely limited success — if no one 's buying , no one 's buying .
Lousy economy or no , Sun intends to continue backing SSD technology .
The company has already demonstrated concept servers built entirely around DRAM + SSDs as well as a 24GB flash module based on Samsung 's " open flash module " standard .
We 've already forecast how 2009 could be a very rough year for flash storage manufacturers — it 's an open question as to whether aggressive marketing efforts like this can create a meaningful boost in sales .
First of all , I would like to thank Toma Alin Gabriel for collaborating with me in creating this wonderful piece .
In this tutorial we are going to create a dark surreal illustration using a few techniques and a handful of images .
In the end , we will apply stylish color settings and give the illustration that extra polish it needs to give it that finished look .
Also , I would like to take this opportunity to thank the photographers for giving me permission to use their images .
Without them I could never create this art .
Please visit their amazing galleries : blacksockstock , Wayne Benedet , Drew Hopper , Nikola M. , and Nicolas Raymond .
Now , let 's jump into this tutorial !
Final Image Preview
Take a look at the image we 'll be creating .
You can view the final image preview below or view a larger version here .
Video Tutorial
Our video editor Gavin Steele has created this video tutorial to compliment this text + image tutorial .
Step 1
First , open up the desert image created by Nikola M.
This is the image you will be working over .
Next , duplicate the image by simply pressing Command +
J or go to Layer > Duplicate Layer and name it " Sand . "
Step 2
Next , we need an image with really nice grass .
The image Drew Hopper created is amazing and perfect for this piece .
After you import the image into the document you will see that the width of the image is smaller then the width of the sand image so you will need to duplicate the grass image a few times and then blend each piece together .
To do this you first need to erase a few parts of the duplicated grass images using the Eraser Tool ( E ) , merge all of them .
Next , retouch the grass and make the images blend in nicely using the Clone Stamp Tool ( S ) .
Step 3
Next , erase the upper part of the grass image .
Do this using the Pen Tool ( P ) .
After you cut out the trees and sky you will need to make the transition between sand and grass look more interesting .
Use some brushes that are already installed in Photoshop and create an effect similar with the one below .
Step 4
Now you need to import another image .
I chose the one photographed by Wayne Benedet .
Before you import the image you will have to first cut the wind turbines using the Pen Tool ( P ) .
Here is a really great tutorial to show you how to use the Pen Tool .
After you finish cutting the turbines , position them into place .
Next , burn the lower part of the turbines , sand and grass .
The image indicates the places you need to use the Burn Tool ( O ) .
Now duplicate the turbines using the Transform Tool ( Command + T ) and place the turbines on the sand , make them look like a shadow .
Next , make a selection of the turbines and fill them with black .
Go to Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur and give some blur to the layer .
This makes it more like a shadow .
The final step is to use the Warp setting under the Transform Tool and change the shape of the shadow as you want to make it more real .
Step 5
Next , place a balloon in the upper left side of the image .
I used the image photographed by Nicolas Raymond .
Before you are done , you will need to create a new layer over the balloon and you need to draw 2 spots over the balloon using a soft brush , like in the image below .
Color codes are : # c101a4 and # 0984 bf .
Set the layer to Multiply and Opacity to 50 % .
Step 6
Now it is time to add in the woman image .
The image I used was photographed by ~ blacksockstock .
Cut her out from the picture using the Pen Tool ( P ) and place her on the document you are working on .
Copy a piece of the wooden legs and place it below her hand .
This will give the impression that the girl is supporting her body on that wood .
Step 7
Duplicate the girl layer and place it behind the original one .
Desaturate it , set it to Hard Light and Opacity to 75 % .
In the end , use the Transform Tool ( T ) with Warp and Distort to make her look like in the image below .
The original woman layer is invisible .
Activate the original woman 's layer again so we can see her over the duplicate .
Now using the Lasso Tool ( L ) make small selections of the woman 's body and drag them around to give a break - apart effect .
And one last thing is to make her hair wild .
For this I have used a brush provided by gorjuss - stock .
Same as you did with the girl , duplicate the hair , desaturate it , set it to Hard Light and Opacity of 75 % .
Step 8
Create a new layer and spray some color over the image .
As you can see , I have used the same blue I used for the balloon in the top right , the same pink over the girl and a few greens .
After you finish applying the spray you need to set the layer to Multiply and Opacity to 60 % .
To choose these colors I used the Eye Picker Tool ( I ) and picked some colors from my document .
Step 9
In this step we will use the Brush Tool ( B ) and using a bubble brush I have provided in this tutorial folder available for the Psd Plus Members .
You will need to spray a few bubbles like in the image below and set the layer to Soft Light .
Double - click the layer and in the Blending Options choose Drop Shadow , set it to Multiply with a 53 Opacity , 90 for the Angle , 299 Distance , 0 Spread and Size 13 .
This effect ads shadow on the grass and makes the bubbles look like they are floating .
Next duplicate the layer and go to Filter > Blur > Motion Blur and use a 0 angle and 15 % Distance .
In the end , set the layer blend mode to Normal and 60 % Opacity .
Step 10
Now it 's time to create the rain effect .
For this you need to make a new layer on top of all the other layers and fill it with black .
Then go to Filter > Noise >
Add Noise and use 86 for the Amount .
Next go to Filter > Blur >
Motion Blur , chose a 50 degree angle , and 25 pixels distance .
Then press Command + L to activate the Level Adjustment and set the Adjustment Shadow Input Level to 100 .
Then in the end Scale the " rain " layer and set it to Screen Mode .
Step 11
These are the final steps , where I will use some splat brushes behind the girl and also work some more on details .
Now you will have to save your work as a JPG , as from now on you will work only with the JPG image .
Then as you open up the JPG you need to add the Adjustment settings represented in the image below .
The project has been done with Photoshop CS4 and the tabs you see there might be new to you but they can be found in the Adjustments tab .
Step 12
Next up you will have to add in some more effects .
For this you can use a plug - in called Topaz Labs .
So with your JPG open , go to Filter > Topaz Labs , use the Vibrance Effect and Portrait Drama , these will make the image more interesting .
Step 13
At this point , your image should look like the one below .
Now it is time to start taking this illustration in a dark direction .
Step 14
First of all you need to duplicate your current layer by pressing Command + J .
Step 15
Next go to Image > Adjustments >
Levels and add 244 to the highlight input level .
Step 16
Next you need to create a new layer and name it " Color Fill 1 . "
Next , go to Create a new fill or adjustment layer and choose Solid Color with this code # 0f6465 .
Step 17
Set the current layer style to Color Dodge , Opacity 65 and Fill to 37 .
After this flatten the image .
Step 18
Now you will need to set the Color Balance .
Change only the Midtones levels 0 , - 33 , 0 .
Step 19
Go to Adjustments >
Selective Color and use cyan +45 % for Red , cyan - 14 % magenta - 18 % and yellow +21 % for Neutrals , yellow +12 % and black +14 % for Blacks , yellow +74 % for Whites , and then duplicate the layer .
Step 20
Next go to Filter > Render >
Lightning Effect , and use the settings below , then flatten the layer and duplicate it again .
Step 21
Use the selective color settings again , but this time change only the Blacks to yellow - 20 % and black - 11 % .
Step 22
Make another Fill Layer as you did in Step 16 but use a different color # 0b1a39 .
Step 23
Set the layer style to Lighten .
Flatten the layer , duplicate the background layer and set the duplicated layer 's Fill to 47 % .
Step 24
Again go to Filter > Render >
Lightning Effect and use the settings shown below .
Merge the layers and duplicate the layer again .
Step 25
Now it is time to apply another selective color to the layer .
Chose Blacks and set yellow to - 14 % and black +17 % .
Step 26
I must say that the result looks pretty amazing as it is now but I am looking for a darker look .
Go to Image > Adjustments >
Curves and use the settings below , then duplicate the layer .
Step 27
Go to Image > Adjustments >
Hue / Saturation and change the Master Saturation to - 100 .
Step 28
Go to Image > Adjustments > Auto Levels .
Then set the Background layer Opacity to 96 % , flatten the image , then duplicate the background , and set the Fill to 46 % .
Flatten the image and duplicate it again .
Step 29
Again you need to go to Image > Adjustments >
Selective Color and for Neutrals use magenta +1 % , yellow - 6 % , black +6 % and for Blacks use yellow - 9 % and black +5 % .
Step 30
Make another Fill Layer , this time use this code # 39340 c .
Then set the layer to Lighten and Fill to 8 % .
Conclusion
The final step is to flatten the image and use a final Selective Color set to Neutrals as magenta - 7 % , yellow - 12 % , and black + 24 % .
Hope you learned something new and had fun .

Many exciting new functions and features are being thought up for CSS3 : text - shadow , box - sizing , opacity , multiple backgrounds , border - radius , border - image , etc …
CSS3 leads to greater flexibility and makes it much easier to recreate previously complex effects .
Not all current browsers support CSS3 , but it is however possible to create equivalent effects and serve it with the power of jQuery .
This article presents 5 CSS3 techniques which can dramatically get you a stunning user interfaces and how to achieve almost the same effects using jQuery for browsers that are not compatible yet with CSS3 new features .
1. Border Radius : Create rounded corners
W3C has offered a very interesting option for borders in CSS3 , of which one is border - radius .
This CSS3 styling rule allows rounded corners to be set .
Both Mozila / Firefox and Safari 3 have implemented this function , which allows you to create round corners on box -items .
Use the followig css code to replicate the above example .
#rounded - box { - moz - border - radius - topleft : 15 px ; - moz- border - radius - topright : 0px ; -moz-border-radius - bottomright : 15 px ; -moz-border-radius - bottomleft : 0px ; - webkit-border-top-left-radius : 15 px ; - webkit-border-top-right- radius : 0 px ; - webkit-border-bottom- left-radius : 0 px ; - webkit-border-bottom - right - radius : 15 px ; }
Below you will find jQuery solutions and plugins that will allow you to create rounded corners without using images .
How To » jQuery Canvas Rounded Corners
j Query Plug - in to make rounded corners on your DOM objects using element .
Tested in IE7 and FF3
You can change the following Options :
radio – ( int ) radius size of corners
inColor – ( color ) inside color of element
outColor – ( color ) outside color of corners
borderSize – ( int ) border width
borderColor – ( color ) color of borders
How To » jQuery Corners
This jQuery plugin will easily create beautifully rounded corners .
No images or obtrusive markup necessary .
2. Border Image
Another exciting new border feature of CSS3 is the property border - image .
Border - image , allows an image to be used as the border of an element .
Each side of the image corresponds to a side of the HTML object .
Currently “ Border Image ” is only implemented in the upcoming Firefox3.1 and recent releases of Safari and Chrome .
Below you will find a tricky jQuery solution that will allow you to have this feature work in : Firefox 2.* , Firefox 3 , Firefox 3.1 , Safari 3.* , Chrome 1.0 , Opera 9.* , Opera 10
and IE7 .
How To » jquery.borderImage.js
jquery .borderImage is a cross - browser , partial implementation of CSS3 ’s border - image property .
This plugin can create the same effect as border - image by creating nine slices from the image one by one , and then tile them in the background of our element .
3. Multiple Backgrounds
CSS3 allows for multiple background images on one element , this is a real time saver .
To do this , you can separate backgrounds by commas , like this
# multiple - background - box { background : url ( top - bg.gif ) top left no - repeat , url ( bottom - bg.gif ) bottom left no - repeat , url ( middle - bg.gif ) left repeat-y ; padding : 20 px ; }
Since this features is not supported by most browsers yet , and you want multiple / layered backgrounds for a div tag , you would nest div tags inside of each other with the CSS to give it the background you wanted .
That ’s a lot of code , and does n’t seem too effecient .
The solution is to use jQuery with the Background Layers plugin .
How To » CSS Multiple Backgrounds / Background Layering with jQuery
The Background Layers plugin reduces the amount XHTML you need to write simply by adding a few lines of JavaScript , making your code much less cumbersome .
The concept is similar to the use of layers in Photoshop , one background image on top of another .
The code above demonstrate laying backgrounds than to use a few sprites from the classic video game , Super Mario Bros 3 .
4. Box Shadow and Text Shadow
The main goal of this property is to give designers and css coders a nice way to display a shadow behind your text .
The property syntax should look like this :
h3 { text - shadow : 2px 2px 2px # 333 ; }
A very useful article i found at Kretschmann ’s website , explaing different usage of this property and including different example for using it in a nice way .
Again , this property is not supported by Firefox and IE , so we have to find ourself another way of doing it using jQuery .
How To » Drop Shadow
This plugin creates soft drop shadows behind page elements , including text and transparent images .
It accepts options for the horizontal and vertical offsets , amount of blur , opacity , and color .
Please look at the demo page for examples .
How To » Text - shadow in Internet Explorer
Text - shadow in Internet Explorer adds text - shadow effects to Internet Explorer .
You can easily turn it on by calling textShadow ( ) ; .
5.Transparency & Opacity
The most widely implemented feature of CSS3 up till now is opacity .
‘ opacity ’ sets the value to how opaque an elements .
An element with opacity value 1.0 will be fully opaque ( visible ) while an element with opacity value 0.0 will be the complete opposite , invisible .
Any value inbetween will determine how opaque ( or transparent ) the element is .
Check out this interesting post by Zen Elements explaining how to use it .
The above opacity example is set in another layer containing a completely random , never seen before background and each layer uses the following CSS :
div.L1 { background : #036 ; opacity : 0.2 ; width : 575 px ; height :20 px ; } div.L2 { background : #036 ; opacity : 0.4 ; width : 575 px ; height :20 px ; } div.L3 { background : #036 ; opacity : 0.6 ; width : 575 px ; height :20 px ; } div.L4 { background : #036 ; opacity : 0.8 ; width : 575 px ; height :20 px ; } div.L5 { background : #036 ; opacity : 1.0 ; width : 575 px ; height :20 px ; }
How To » Element gradient
It allows you to define a gradient fill and have an element filled with a gradient .
You can set the direction of the gradient ( right - left or up - down ) and the opacity of the gradient easily .

David Tennant and his successor as Doctor Who , Matt Smith Fans of Doctor Who , armed with questions ranging from hair length to toy spin - offs , have gone face to face with the hit TV show 's production team .
A few behind - the - scenes tricks were revealed at the packed event on the opening night of the three - day Celtic Media Festival in Caernarfon .
The 30th festival brings together film and TV from the Celtic nations .
The Doctor Who panel included executive producer Julie Gardner and designer Edward Thomas .
Outgoing executive producer and lead writer Russell T Davies was forced to cancel because of his workload , as filming starts on Monday for another of the four specials he is working on before he leaves .
The two - part show will see the present Doctor , David Tenant , regenerate into Matt Smith .
After a short introduction questions were invited from the audience .
Those ranged from why Doctor Who was not available in Lego - the series needs to be bigger in America apparently - to whether the new Doctor would cut his fringe before taking over from David Tennant ( the diplomatic answer to this one was " your comment will be passed on " ) .
Casting Matt Smith as the new doctor was the " easiest " decision because of his " other worldly " qualities according to the team .
His assistant looks set to remain firmly from the 21st Century however , as Julie Gardner explained why the Doctor never had an assistant from another place in time .
As a child Doctor Who was so scary and it is fascinating because I am still frightened now
Jan Storie , student
She explained the team had decided the assistant needed to " root " ' the doctor and be a credible link between him and the audience .
There were snippets of trivia too - such as the story behind why the Tardis was a police box .
According to designer Edward Thomas when the original Dr Who series was being put together in the 1960s the designer was told to " go into the props department and look for something commonplace in which to disguise the Tardis " .
He returned with a police box , which was a common sight on the streets of Britain at the time , and as they say ... the rest is history .
Modern advances in technology now allow viewers a glimpse into the Tardis when the Doctor opens the door .
This is achieved by printing various images from the Tardis set and lighting them from behind giving the impression of ' depth ' when the door is opened , Mr Thomas explained .
There was also an insight into the challenges facing a production designer .
Mr Thomas recalled an incident when the script demanded a plethora of aliens and props , " by page five I 'd spent the budget , and then I turned over and I saw it needed a space ship in a field ... there was no way it could be done " .
A worried Mr Thomas then had to tell Russell T Davies about the problem , only to be told : " Do n't worry , the spaceship can be invisible ! "
The Easter special is already completed and the audience was treated to a brief montage of scenes which definitely whetted the appetite , but yet gave nothing away .
Suffice to say it involved a bus , sand , and lots of running .
The rest of the festival carries on until Friday , with workshops and events for those working or studying in the film and TV industry from the Celtic nations .
Organiser Hugh Edwin Jones said it was important for the area on two levels .
Media industry " From the council 's point of view it is the economic input , whilst the other element is for the creative industries , which are so important in the Caernarfon area , " said Mr Jones , who is on secondment from Gwynedd Council to help arrange the three - day event .
Mr Jones denied the event was exclusively for media industry insiders .
" I think that is a fair point but I 've been involved in this festival for a number of years and we have been making an effort to open it out .
" In Caernarfon I think we have been successful in this for the first time .
" There is a mobile cinema on the square which is open to schoolchildren and members of the public , and we are opening one of the ( media ) sessions to the public - a big step forward , " he added .
The event has attracted both industry insiders as well as students .
Jan Storie had travelled from Plockton in the Highlands of Scotland to take part in various workshops to improve her script writing .
" I 've never been to this festival before and it is a lovely venue , " she said .
" It is interesting because I come from a Gallic speaking area , and I 've heard French voices , and of course Welsh , and Irish - it is bringing people together because we are quite far flung , " she added .
The Dr Who event was recorded for broadcast on BBC Radio 7 this Saturday night at midnight ( and will be available afterwards as a podcast via the Doctor Who website ) .

HELENA – Legislators are considering a bill that would decriminalize adult possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana in Montana , instead making it a civil violation to hold smaller amounts of the drug .
House Bill 541 , introduced by Democratic Rep. Brady Wiseman of Bozeman , would allow for a civil penalty of $ 100 for adults caught holding 30 grams or less .
Current law allows a criminal misdemeanor charge for holding anything under 60 grams of marijuana , with a fine up to $ 500 and jail time up to 6 months .
The proposed law would also apply to marijuana paraphernalia carried by adults .
Wiseman says studies indicate decriminalization could save the state thousands of dollars in enforcement costs , and reduce marijuana use in Montana .
“ The opinion that somehow decriminalization results in higher rates of use is flat wrong , ” Wiseman told members of the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday .
Legislative services estimates the proposed law would save the state ’s Office of the Public Defender about $ 44,000 a year in legal costs .
But savings could be substantially higher if law enforcement costs were included in the tally , said the bill ’s supporters .
Marijuana enforcement laws were softened in Missoula County in 2007 , after voters approved the change in a ballot initiative .
The county ’s rules now ask law enforcement officers not to arrest adults who are carrying under 60 grams of marijuana .
They also instruct prosecutors to make charging marijuana misdemeanors a low priority .
But the most recent impact report from a citizen committee that was also created by the initiative claims law enforcement in the county has generally ignored the new arrest guidelines .
“ Our current marijuana policy in Montana is an expensive government program that harms people and is ineffective , ” said John Masterson , chairman of the citizen oversight committee .
Other counties throughout the United States have also issued what are known as deprioritization rules regarding the arrest of adults holding marijuana , and 13 states have decriminalized carrying small amounts of marijuana to some degree , according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) .
“ Once police get over their first opposition and phobias , which is in general the reaction , they pretty quickly realize it ’s functional , ” said Allen St. Pierre , director of NORML .
The Montana Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association , the Montana County Attorneys Association , the Montana Association of Chiefs of Police and other law enforcement groups testified in opposition to the bill .
“ We believe that decriminalization of marijuana in any amount sends a message statewide that marijuana is not a harmful drug , ” said Jeff Jergens on behalf of the Montana Narcotics Officers Association .
Putting limits on enforcement could also have the dangerous effect of reducing marijuana ’s price in Montana , and complicate preventing marijuana DUIs , opponents said .
“ You can argue that it ’s harmless , but we ’ve also proved that it impairs your ability to drive , ” said Jesse Slaughter , spokesman for the Montana Police Protective Association .
Supporters , though , say current law leads to charges that permanently mar a person ’s record and carry harsh punishments that are out of scope with the crime .
“ The way that this is enforced , there are all sorts of people that you know and love that use marijuana recreationally like you may use martinis or a glass of wine , and they are functioning adults , ” said Scott Crichton , executive director of the Montana American Civil Liberties Union .
The Montana Citizens for Responsible Crime Policy and Patients and Families United , a support group for medical marijuana patients , also testified in favor of the measure .
Russia 's flag air carrier Aeroflot has taken another blow to its reputation after a newspaper detailed an incident in which more than 100 passengers demanded that an apparently drunk pilot be taken off the plane .
The first sign of trouble came when the pilot slurred his words during the pre-flight announcement , The Moscow Times said on Tuesday .
The paper quoted passengers aboard the flight from Moscow to New York on December 28 , including one of its own reporters .
" The first thought that occurred to me was , ' This guy is drunk , ' " passenger Khatuna Kobiashvili told the newspaper , an English - language daily .
" His speech was so slurred it was hard to tell what language he was speaking . "
In this post John from Ace Online Schools shares some tips for writing educational blog content .
When the titans of blogging write about building a successful blog , they always emphasize the importance of insanely useful content .
One of the best ways to be useful is to educate your readers .
If you can give your readers knowledge that helps them achieve their goals , people will hang on your every word and happily link to your content .
Teach What You Know
The first requirement of effective teaching is having a depth of knowledge to share .
If you have n’t mastered a topic yourself , you have no chance of teaching it to others .
It amazes me how many people try to do this , particularly in the make money online niche .
If you want to start a blog to educate yourself that ’s fine , but do n’t expect to have much success until you know your topic inside and out .
Once you have a base of knowledge to impart , the second step is effective communication .
Mix General Concepts with Specific Examples
Darren recently posted about this idea .
What he realized is that many readers like to be told what to do .
Learning is about understanding important ideas ; both as concepts and as they relate to reality .
Understanding general concepts is important because it empowers readers to make decisions for themselves based on their unique circumstances .
Examples are indispensable because they make an abstract idea concrete .
There is no excuse not to weave specific examples into your posts because it requires only a simple reference link .
Use Illustrative Images and Diagrams
One of the most underutilized educational techniques in blogging is the use of diagrams .
By this I do n’t mean random images from Flickr that you to toss in at the last minute .
I mean handcrafted diagrams that illustrate the key ideas from your article .
A great example of this is the SEO Success Pyramid by Small Business SEM .
Diagrams help educate your readers where words alone fall short .
They ’re also link magnets .
There ’s a bit of a learning curve if you are n’t good at creating images , but the results are worth the effort .
Learn to Write for the Web
You need to understand how people read on the web and learn to write for them effectively .
Go to Jakob Nielsen ’s web site and read this paper .
It will do more to improve your blogging than any other article .
If you look at the top blogs , you ’ll find they follow Nielsen ’s style guidelines remarkably well .
Do n’t Be a Link Snob
Insecure blogs are scared of linking out .
They ’re afraid of losing traffic and giving link juice to sites that compete with them .
This is absolute rubbish !
If you share valuable information with readers , you ’ll be rewarded with trust .
Readers will value your site more and be more likely to return .
Some of the most popular sites on the web are almost entirely short summaries and links to outside content .
Clearly it has n’t hurt their traffic .
Help your readers educate themselves by pointing them in the right direction .

Remember in Tim Burton 's Batman when he asked Vicki Vale how much she weighed before zipping upward in that alley to escape the Joker 's goons ?
If Batman had a T - PLS pneumatic " tactical line - throwing system " with a 7 mm Kevlar line and titanium grappling hook , he could 've brought Vicki , some of her friends , Robin AND a bag of Scooby snacks ( did anyone else see that crossover cartoon ? ) along for the ride .

It is bulkier than most of Batman 's gear at 19 pounds , but it 'll shoot 120 feet ( 12 stories ) straight up with up to 350 psi from its compressed air source .
It 's also super silent for stealth infiltrations .
It 's more Christian Bale 's SWAT / ninja Batman than Michael Keaton 's thinner , jaded Dark Knight — I could see it in the Tumbler 's trunk .
Side question :
How far would someone fly if they got beaned in the chest with this thing ?

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 25/1/2009 ( 4265 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
BILL REDEKOP / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS Cam and Lisa Cleaver and their 2,500 - square - foot underground house Cam built into the Manitoba escarpment south of MacGregor .
NEAR MACGREGOR --
So what does it cost Cam and Lisa Cleaver to heat their home , nestled in a gorgeous 22 - acre woodlot atop the Manitoba escarpment ?
Twenty bucks .
No , but seriously , you guys , what do you pay to heat your home ?
Twenty bucks -- the same as they 've paid every year for the past 14 years .
Oh well , they must live in a shack , you 're thinking .
No .
At 2,500 square feet , their house is probably bigger than yours .
The Cleavers live in one of only two known underground homes in Manitoba , but theirs is all the more fantastic for its location -- burrowed into the top of a hill .
In fact , it 's located right on the line where the escarpment begins .
Ten thousand years ago , it might have been a beach house on Lake Agassiz .
There are two reason the Cleavers have virtually no heating cost .
First , they are embedded in at least five feet of earth on all sides ( except the south side , to maximize sunshine for light and warmth ) .
At anything more than four feet below ground , temperatures are from 10 to 12 Celsius .
So the Cleaver home only has to be heated eight to 10 degrees above that soil temperature to be made livable .
That 's compared to most houses which have to be heated against the outside air temperature .
The second reason their heating cost is so low is they live in a forested area and use an outdoor boiler .
Cam and the kids take the pickup truck each fall to gather and cut deadfall .
The $ 20 is the gas for the truck and chainsaw .
They feed the boiler once a day and burn about four cords ( a 4 x 4 x 8 - foot stack ) each year , but that 's also to continuously heat a workshop separate from the house .
Even if they paid for the four cords of firewood , it would only cost in the $ 400 range , depending on the type of wood .
On a day when it was worse than - 40 Celsius with the wind chill , their home was unbelievably cosy inside , especially with its radiant floor heat .
They have electricity and could use electric heat , but it would still be jaw - droppingly cheap .
Plus , they pay no air conditioning cost because the earth cools their residence in summer .
Cam built the underground home 15 years ago , working evenings after his day job .
He was frequently interrupted by gawkers who stopped by to shake their heads and tell him to expect a visit from some men in white suits .
" Everyone thought I was a lunatic , " Cam said .
Wife Lisa included ?
Well , let 's just say she went from being a city girl from Winnipeg 's North End to a country gal when she met Cam , to one of the mole people .
Cam originally bought the property as a place to hunt .
He got his idea after visiting cousins in Wichita , Kansas , where he spotted a house piled with dirt to keep it cool in summer .
The floors , walls and ceiling of the Cleaver home are concrete .
Cam knew concrete because he was employed at the time by a company that built concrete septic pools for large hog farms .
The home 's inside walls have been textured so they look like a stylish stucco .
The ceiling is a story in itself .
Cam erected 500 two - by - four studs , one foot apart , to hold a plywood platform while concrete was poured over top .
The studs were removed once the concrete hardened .
When you build with concrete , you have to plan in advance for things such as switches and electric plugs , because you can't make new holes later .
Cam almost forgot the dryer vent .
Just as the concrete was being poured , he shouted for the operator to stop so he could make the adjustment .
The home is 100 feet long by 25 feet wide .
" It 's like a long trailer home , " said Cam , although it 's much wider .
From the front , it looks like a one - storey school , or even a little strip mall , although that sounds uncharitable and the description is n't meant to be .
The bedrooms and main rooms , such as the den and living room , all face south to obtain natural light .
The bathroom is on the other side and has no windows .
Lisa said it 's like living in an apartment and not an issue .
It 's also the safest kind of building in a tornado .
There were two tornados in the general area last summer , including one south of the town of Holland .
Their kids love the house , plus the giant playground of 22 acres of hilly woods around it .
Cam has a word of caution for anyone wanting to duplicate his feat .
Lenders will not grant a mortgage on an unconventional house , he said .
He had to take a regular loan like you 'd get for buying a car , at a higher interest rate .

I have lived in Sin City for more than 15 years .
Sin City is a place painted with glamours , excitements , extraordinary behaviors of people ( whether acceptable or unacceptable behaviors ) , etc .
I am not a democrat myself , and I am not a republican either .
However , I support President Obama ’s statement , in which he stated , “ You ca n’t get corporate jets , you ca n’t go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayer ’s dime . ”
The statement consists of a great level of ethics .
I presume that the majority of us should be educated in a way which morales and ethics are emphasized .
Las Vegas is known as a place for entertainment , and entertainment is paid by and should be paid by disposable income .
How is it justifiable for Person A to have great fun on Person B ’s expense ( sometimes this may not even work in a marriage ) ?
Oscar Goodman , the Mayor of Las Vegas disagrees , and believes the city is owed an apology :
What ’s a better place , as I say , than for them to come here ?
And to change their mind and to go someplace else and to cancel and at the suggestion of the president of the United States , that ’s outrageous .
That ’s outrageous , and he owes us an apology .
He owes us a retraction .
Is the bailout fund considered to be disposable income by the Las Vegas mayor , Mr. Goodman ?
Does the Las Vegas mayor , Mr. Goodman , think that it is quite alright for bailout fund holders to fly to Las Vegas with the bailout money ?
Does the Las Vegas mayor , Mr. Goodman , think that it is absolutely ethical for tax payers to pay executives to engage in activities which may not be accepted by the general public ?
Does the Las Vegas mayor , Mr. Goodman , think that entertainment in Las Vegas be prioritized before necessities in life such as food , mortgages , insurances , etc ?
The sales volumes in Las Vegas will definitely decrease in an abnormal pattern regardless if the word , Las Vegas , was present or absent in President Obama ’s statement .
I suggest to certain people that they should go ahead and accept the reality .
Additionally , focus on the current situation , rather than being particular in one comment .
Sports drinks containing protein are better at improving athletes ' performance .
Research published in BioMed Central 's open access Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition has shown that drinks containing a mix of carbohydrate and protein are superior to carbohydrate - only drinks in improving cyclists ' recovery from exercise .
John Berardi of Precision Nutrition worked with researchers from Gettysburg College and The University of Western Ontario to study which energy drink best helped cyclists recover after a strenuous ride .
He said , " Liquid carbohydrate and protein supplements given early during a six hour post - exercise recovery period helped subjects better maintain subsequent time trial performance and power output , compared to supplements with carbohydrate alone " .
In the test , cyclists rode exercise bikes that were attached to monitors allowing them to compete against a virtual opponent .
After a morning session , they rested for six hours drinking either the protein - containing sports drink or the carbohydrate only version .
Both formulas had the same energy content .
After their six - hour rest , the athletes did another virtual cycle race .
According to Berardi , " Both groups showed a reduction in performance in the afternoon session .
However , the reduction in distance traveled and power output during the afternoon exercise was significantly less among those who had the protein and carbs drink , relative those who just had the carbs " .
The subjects ' self - reported fatigue levels were lower in the protein group and increases in fat oxidation were also seen .
Beardi concluded , " These findings may be important considering that most endurance athletes concern themselves primarily with carbohydrate intake and often fail to recognize the potential benefits of protein with respect to performance recovery " .
How to Tweet Your Way Out of a Job
March 17 , 2009 by Hutch Carpenter
I saw this exchange on Twitter , which is a painful lesson in how NOT to use Twitter in this tough economy .
A lucky job applicant tweeted the following :
Cisco just offered me a job !
Now I have to weigh the utility of a fatty paycheck against the daily commute to San Jose and hating the work .
This tweet caught the attention of Tim Levad , a channel partner advocate for Cisco .
To which he responded :
Who is the hiring manager .
I ’m sure they would love to know that you will hate the work .
We here at Cisco are versed in the web .
Ouch !
The person who dissed the Cisco offer quickly took their Twitter account private .
But Twitter search retained the record .
Remember a couple months ago when the PR guy ’s tweet about Memphis came back to bite him ?
This is another example of the need to be careful with what you post on Twitter , and social media in general .
I ’m @bhc3 on Twitter .
At least that was the case on ABC’s What Would You Do ? which explores human nature using hidden cameras .
You might be surprised …
I would n’t go as far to say “ tolerance is an American value . ”
Try to same situation in an Oklahoma or Texas bar and the outcome might be very different .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
The return of peanuts to the snack menu at Northwest Airlines this month has prompted a spasm of protests from travelers with allergies .
Just weeks after Northwest began handing out peanuts as flight snacks , customers have raised allergy concerns .
The change comes four months after Northwest merged with Atlanta - based Delta Air Lines and in the midst of a national salmonella outbreak involving Peanut Corporation of America .
Georgia , where the company has a plant , is the top peanut - producing state in the country .
Northwest began handing out the goobers as snacks on February 1 , as Delta has been doing for years .
In Minneapolis , where Northwest is based , news of the change has resulted in a flood of responses on the Web site of the Star Tribune , a local newspaper .
" This is a very disappointing development , " wrote one man who responded to the story .
" My wife 's allergy is so severe that if someone is sitting next to her and eating peanuts , the odor is enough to trigger an allergic reaction . "
" Northwest is really out of touch with its customers and the reality of allergies to peanuts , " wrote another reader .
" What 's wrong with pretzels ? "
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says more than 3 million Americans are allergic to peanuts or tree nuts , while nearly 7 million are allergic to seafood .
Combined , food allergies cause 30,000 cases of anaphylaxis , 2,000 hospitalizations and 150 deaths annually .
Delta says it will make accommodations for those with peanut allergies , if a request is made .
" We 'll create a buffer zone of three rows in front of and three rows behind your seat , " the airline 's Web site says .
" We 'll also advise cabin service to board additional nonpeanut snacks , which will allow our flight attendants to serve these snack items to everyone within this area . "

Mr Ban said that all countries are threatened by climate change UN chief Ban Ki-moon has warned a climate change conference in India that failure to tackle the issue will lead to global economic upheaval .
He appealed to nations to reach agreement on carbon emission cuts .
Mr Ban is attending the Delhi Sustainable Development Summit which , organisers say will press for cuts in carbon emissions .
He is also expected to discuss with India the attacks in Mumbai ( Bombay ) last year which killed 170 people .
' Destabilise economies ' " Deserts are spreading .
Water scarcity is increasing .
Tropical forests are shrinking .
Our once prolific fisheries are in danger of collapse , " said Mr Ban at the start of the conference in Delhi .
Mr Ban is attending a climate change conference in Delhi " Failure to combat climate change will increase poverty and hardship .
It will destabilise economies , breed insecurity in many countries and undermine our goals for sustainable development . "
He said that all countries must work towards a " conclusive carbon emissions reduction " deal at an international climate change conference in Copenhagen in December which will debate initiatives when the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012 .
" Copenhagen must clarify commitments of developed countries to reduce their emissions , " said Mr Ban .
" We must also achieve clarity on what mitigation actions developing countries will be prepared to make .
In Copenhagen we must now bring all this all together in an ambitious , comprehensive and ratifiable agreement . "
India faces the " challenges of poverty eradication , sustaining the rapid economic growth and dealing with the global threat of climate change " , Rajendra Pachauri , head of the UN's 2008 Nobel prize - winning climate panel and one of summit organisers , told the AFP news agency .
Riots Mr Ban arrived in India from Afghanistan and Pakistan .
In Pakistan - his first visit to the country since taking office in 2007 - Mr Ban announced that the UN would launch " very shortly " an independent inquiry into the killing of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto .
Ms Bhutto was killed in an attack on a rally in 2007 .
Mr Ban was due to meet the Indian foreign minister and Congress Party chief Sonia Gandhi to discuss the Mumbai attack later on Thursday .
The UN leader began his regional visit on Wednesday in Afghanistan , where he said the country would be a priority for the UN in 2009 .
His visit to Pakistan later on Wednesday came amid growing unrest in Pakistan 's border areas , with Taleban rebels attacking Nato supply routes into Afghanistan while government forces engage the Taleban in the Swat valley of North West Frontier Province .

Anheuser will have to rely on trademark laws in individual states
A European Union court has decided that Budweiser - brewer Anheuser - Busch should not have rights to the " Bud " brand throughout the 27 nation bloc .
It is a victory for the Czech brewer Budejovicky Budvar , which said it had registered the name in France , Austria and former Czechoslovakia in 1958 .
Anheuser will now have to rely on registering its trademark in each individual member state .
It said it already had trademark protection in 23 of the EU states .
It is the latest stage of a long - running trademark dispute between the two brewers .
Budejovicky Budvar was founded in 1895 in Ceske Budejovice , which was known as Budweis by its German - speaking inhabitants .
Beer had been brewed there since 1265 .
Budweiser was first produced in St Louis in 1852 and was America 's first national beer brand .
The name was taken because it was familiar to the German founders of the company .
Confusingly , an EU court last year ruled in favour of Anheuser - Busch on a dispute involving the " Budweiser " name .
Anheuser - Busch is now owned by the Belgian brewer InBev .
The LHC suffered a malfunction just nine days after it was switched on
The Large Hadron Collider could be switched back on in September - a year after it shut down due to a malfunction and several months later than expected .
Scientists had said they expected the £ 3.6 bn ( $ 5.4 bn ) machine to be repaired by November , but then pushed the date back to June , before the latest delay .
The LHC was built to smash protons together at huge speeds , recreating conditions moments after the Big Bang .
The fault occurred just nine days after it was turned on last September .
The European Organization for Nuclear Research ( Cern ) said : " The new schedule foresees first beams in the LHC at the end of September this year , with collisions following in late October . "
Repairs
An investigation into the LHC 's problems concluded the initial malfunction was caused by a faulty electrical connection between two of the accelerator 's magnets .
Cern said that as a result , 53 magnet units would have to be removed from the LHC 's tunnel to be cleaned or repaired .
Cern had also said new protection systems would be added as part of £ 14 m repairs .
It blamed the shutdown on the failure of a single , badly soldered electrical connection in one of its super - cooled magnet sections .

Working at Goldman has long been regarded as a sure path to riches .
But Goldman ’s employees
are losing money on their personal investments — particularly in Goldman ’s own elite investment funds , which have been considered one of the perks of working at the bank .
Now these funds have stumbled , and some Goldman employees who financed their gilded lifestyles by borrowing in good times are suddenly short on cash needed to meet commitments to their personal investments in the funds .
“ It ’s a problem with the culture of spending , ” said Gustavo Dolfino , the president of Whiterock Group , a Wall Street recruitment firm .
“ No matter how much you have , you spend like you have a lot more . ”
The development comes at a tumultuous time for Goldman Sachs , which is struggling to recapture its former glory — and profits — since it became an old - fashioned bank holding company .
Goldman is one of the eight banks that were told to accept taxpayer money , and it is trying to pay that money back soon .
At least one of the vehicles , in a group known as the Whitehall funds , sank more than 50 percent last year .
Another let its investors withdraw their money this year — at a significant loss .
With a focus on real estate and private equity investments , the funds — which also include Goldman Sachs Capital Partners — have traditionally performed extremely well , sometimes increasing sevenfold in a few years .
Goldman even promoted its employee participation in the funds as a selling point to outside investors .
Some Goldman employees got rich before the markets collapsed , allowing them to invest several million dollars in the funds , often on a leveraged basis .
Only three years ago , Goldman paid more than 50 employees more than $ 20 million apiece .
In 2007 , its chief executive , Lloyd C. Blankfein , collected one of the biggest bonuses in corporate history — nearly $ 70 million .
But one former Goldman partner estimated that a quarter of the bank ’s roughly 100 partners are now worth $ 5 million or less because of losses on their company stock and other investments .
Last year , the bank ’s seven top executives received no bonuses .
One of them , Jon A. Winkelried , resigned from his position as co-president a few weeks ago , saying he wanted to spend more time with his family .
His estate on Nantucket is on the market .
It is unclear how many Goldman bankers and traders will take up the bank ’s offer .
The funds periodically require investors to add more money , and late last year , Goldman ’s most senior management and board began to realize some employees might have trouble living up to this obligation after receiving low bonuses , according to a person briefed on the situation .
Employees in the funds are contractually obligated to meet requests for more capital .
Several funds have such capital calls scheduled for April .
Employees who fail to make the payments risk losing their jobs , according to a person familiar with the situation .
The new loans at Goldman are being offered to help employees meet capital demands from the internal funds and cannot be used for other personal needs , according to people familiar with the matter .
A spokesman for Goldman Sachs confirmed the existence of the loan program but declined to elaborate .
The funds that are the most troubled were raised right before the financial crisis .
Goldman raised $ 20 billion in its most recent private equity fund and some $ 9 billion in the Whitehall real estate funds in 2007 and 2008 .
About a third of the money in the funds typically comes from Goldman and its employees , and since 1991 , the bank and its employees have accounted for $ 7.5 billion of the $ 26 billion in the Whitehall funds .
Some employees now wish they had not invested .
Properties like the Helmsley building , which Goldman helped purchase in 2007 , have nose - dived in value .
Stuart Rothenberg , the former head of Goldman ’s real estate group , warned just before he retired last year about Goldman ’s real estate exposure and said Goldman became “ for all intents and purposes , almost an enlarged hedge fund , ” according to Reuters .
Beyond the drop in the stock market , there are various reasons cash is tight for some Goldman employees .
Some traders , for instance , are facing tax bills for bonuses paid in early 2008 .
They already spent that money , and their bonuses early this year were too small to foot the bill .
Others who borrowed against their stock holdings have been forced to sell at losses or put up more collateral against their loan .
Goldman is one of many banks that has issued margin calls on its employees .
The employee loans , of course , may not turn out to be a good investment for Goldman , though Goldman can take employees who do not pay to court or seize money from their brokerage accounts .
To some , the development underscores how many wealthy Wall Streeters got in over their heads .
“ Most people investing in Whitehall thought this was a sound and probably even a conservative investment , ” said Janet Hanson , a former Goldman employee who is the founder of 85 Broads , an organization for women that takes its name from the address of Goldman ’s headquarters .
“ No one saw the entire thing collapsing . ”

Live television is hardly the most convenient setting in which to be reminded of the age - old proverb that only children and fools speak the truth .
So the father who nicknamed his child 's toy monkey after Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , must have been mortified to have his private joke cruelly exposed when the youngster took part in one of the country 's most popular TV phone -ins .
The embarrassing disclosure was made on Amoo Pourang ( Uncle Pourang ) , a programme watched by millions of Iranian children three times a week on state TV .
It came when the unsuspecting presenter , Dariush Farziayi , asked the name of the toy animal his young caller had been given as a reward for good behaviour .
" Well , my father calls him Ahmadinejad , " the child replied .
Now the father 's discomfort has spread to the programme - makers after the state broadcaster , IRIB , responded by withdrawing it from viewing schedules .
The final episode will be screened next week after a successful seven - year run .
A conservative website , Jahan News , quoting " reliable sources , " said the decision was prompted by the " high financial and spiritual damage " inflicted by live broadcasts .
Stopping short of identifying the president by name , it highlighted an incident in which " a child in a live telephone line compared its doll to one of the well - known authorities and managers " .
The incident is believed to have been the last straw following several other naive indiscretions by callers , which caused acute embarrassment and offended Iran 's religious conservative mores .
In one instance , Farziayi was left open mouthed and groping for an appropriate response when , after asking a participant to hand the phone to his mother or father , he was told : " They are in the shower . "
On another occasion , asking which of two twins was kissed first by their father on his return home from work , he was answered : " My daddy always kisses mummy first . "
It is not the first Iranian broadcast to become a victim of the pitfalls of live transmissions .
In the 1980s , the spiritual leader of the Islamic revolution , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , pronounced death sentences for the makers of a radio programme in which a female respondent named a Japanese soap opera character as her role model , rather than Fatimah , the Prophet Muhammad 's daughter .
They were later pardoned .
On February 12 , 2009 Representative Jerrold Nadler ( D , New York , 8th ) and Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) introduced the Uniting American Families Act ( UAFA ) which would eliminate discrimination in immigration laws and allow gay Americans to sponsor their foreign - born partners , providing a legal path to U.S. citizenship .
Representative Nadler …
“ In 2009 , we should be ready as a society to acknowledge that stable American families come in all varieties .
We in fact strengthen our communities – and our nation – by encouraging loving couples and families to stay together and live as cohesive units .
Any committed couple deserves the potential to form a life and a family together – this is a basic human right – and whether that couple is gay or straight should be irrelevant .
Gay and lesbian Americans in loving , committed relationships deserve the same rights as everyone else . ”
Senator Leahy …
“ Like many people across the country , there are Vermonters whose partners are foreign nationals and who feel abandoned by our laws in this area : Vermonters like Gordon Stewart who has come to talk to me about the unfairness of our current laws , or a committed , loving couple of 24 years in Brattleboro , Vermont , who travel back and forth between Vermont and England , and who wish nothing more than to be able to be together in the United States .
This bill would allow them , and other gay and lesbian Americans throughout our Nation who have felt that our immigration laws are discriminatory , to be a fuller part of our society .
The promotion of family unity has long been part of Federal immigration policy , and we should honor that principle by providing all Americans the opportunity to be with their loved ones .
“ The idea that immigration benefits should be extended to same - sex couples is not a novel one .
Many nations have come to recognize that their respective immigration laws should respect family unity , regardless of a person ’s sexual orientation .
Indeed , 16 of our closest allies – Australia , Belgium , Brazil , Canada , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Iceland , Israel , the Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , South Africa , Sweden and the United Kingdom – recognize same - sex couples for immigration purposes . ”
The UAFA has now been referred to the judiciary committees in both houses for review , which has been the case for each of the previous versions of the bill introduced since 2000 .
The difference this time however is that there are no longer Republican majorities in those committees so the bill may have legs to walk out of the judiciary and back into the houses for debate and eventually a vote .
Reaching out to members of the judiciary committees — particularly Democrats , and those on the immigration subcommittees ( marked by an “ x ” ) — could make a difference in helping move the legislation forward .
If you or someone you know would benefit from the passage of the UAFA , please urge the representatives and senators listed below to take action .

Chad Ocho Cinco , who has largely held his tongue this season , let it rip Wednesday in a conference call with reporters that cover the Cowboys and later in the Paul Brown Stadium locker room .
“ That ’s America ’s team .
It ’s one of the greatest organizations ever , ” Ocho Cinco said of the Cowboys .
“ This week , to show my respect for Dallas and its owner , Jerry Jones , I ’m going to score and I ’m going to kiss the star .
I ’m telling you , I ’m not being rude about anything .
I ’m going to kiss the star .
It ’s going to be fun .
I ’m excited to go to Dallas .
You know , T.O. ( Terrell Owens ) , you ’ve got two of the do n’t - know - what - is - going - to - happen - next receivers playing .
It ’s going to be fun . ”
The wide receiver was asked by Dallas reporters about the Bengals ’ 0 - 4 start , their worst since 2002 .
“ Man , we are going to throw everything , including the kitchen sink , out there in Dallas , ” he said .
“ I ’m bringing the cold tub , the hot tub .
I ’m bringing the training room .
What else can we do ?
I think we need to open up , period .
That ’s what I think .
I think we ’ve been very vanilla .
I do n’t know the word to use .
I ’m not sure why , but at this point , you ’ve got to go all out . ”
You have to love the NFL .
Where else can a winless team make such an impact ?
Speaking at a landmark press conference today , California Assemblyman Tom Ammiano ( D - San Francisco ) introduced comprehensive legislation to tax and regulate the commercial production and sale of cannabis in a manner similar to alcohol .
“ With the state in the midst of an historic economic crisis , the move towards regulating and taxing marijuana is simply common sense .
This legislation would generate much needed revenue for the state , restrict access to only those over 21 , end the environmental damage to our public lands from illicit crops , and improve public safety by redirecting law enforcement efforts to more serious crimes ” , Assemblyman Ammiano said .
“ California has the opportunity to be the first state in the nation to enact a smart , responsible public policy for the control and regulation of marijuana . ”
The proposal is the first marijuana legalization bill ever introduced in California .
“ It ’s time for California taxpayers to stop wasting money trying to enforce marijuana prohibition , and to realize the tax benefits from a legal , regulated market instead , ” said Dale Gieringer , director of California NORML , a sponsor of the bill .
As introduced , Ammiano ’s measure would allow for the licensed production and sale of cannabis to consumers age 21 and over .
Licensed cultivators would pay an excise tax of $ 50 per ounce of cannabis .
In addition , the proposal would impose a sales tax on commercial sales .
( Ammiano ’s proposal would not affect the state ’s medical marijuana law , allowing patients and caregivers to grow their own medicine . )
If enacted , the measure would raise over $ 1 billion per year in state revenue , according to an economic analysis by California NORML , available online here .
Ammiano ’s bill comes at a time of growing public support for legalizing marijuana .
A recent Zogby poll reported that nearly six in ten west coast voters support taxing and regulating marijuana like alcohol .
Faced with a $ 40 billion budget deficit , other public officials have joined in endorsing Ammiano ’s bill , including San Francisco Sheriff Mike Hennessy and Betty Yee , a member of the State Board of Equalization , which oversees collection of sales taxes .
Currently , tens of millions of dollars are paid annually in state and local taxes by licensed distributors of medical marijuana .
However , these sales only represent a fraction of the overall statewide marijuana market .
“ The millions of dollars raised each year on the sales of medicinal cannabis is only the tip of the iceberg , ” Gieringer said .
“ Kudos to Assemblyman Ammiano for proposing a path - breaking bill that would benefit our economy , safety and freedom by making marijuana a winning proposition for California . ”

Genesis tells us about the moment humans first " realized " they were naked , quickly followed by the moment they were first ashamed of being naked -- but it does n't explain why humans were ashamed .
Animals are naked ( albeit furry ) , and for tens of thousands of years , so were human beings .
So what changed -- and if we wanted to , could we change back , and unlearn our shame ?
Recently , some British researchers attempted to find out .
Their theory is that the shame of being naked was codified in ( most ) human societies as a way of protecting mating pairs .
( Perhaps it 's no coincidence that humans are among the few mammals that mate for life -- and they 're also ashamed of being naked . )
The thinking goes that humans ' natural gregariousness and need to interact outside the family group , coupled with nakedness , created too many temptations to stray from the mating pair .
That 's where our shame of nudity comes in .
Over thousands of generations , we 've learned that showing off a naked body sends out sexual signals that threaten the security of mating pairs .
And we 've chosen to agree that that is a bad thing .
Shame is the ideal emotion to enforce that code of conduct .
Because it feels unpleasant , we avoid it at all costs .
So what was this crazy study ?
As part of a BBC television program , a group of psychologists took a group of ordinary British folks , and in a few days attempted to break down some of the societal prohibitions regarding nakedness amongst them , to see if they could ever start to feel comfortable being naked in the presence of strangers .
From the BBC :
Eight ordinary people - none of them nudists - were recently brought together for an experiment filmed by the BBC's Horizon programme , to test some of the scientific theories that explain why naked bodies make us so uncomfortable .
Among them were Phil , 39 , from Birmingham and Kath , 40 , from Dorset .
Kath 's greatest worry was that people would laugh at her .
Some of the men in the group were more concerned about inappropriate excitement .
After a series of experiments , Phil and Kath , who had been so self - conscious at the start , each came face - to - face with a newly stripped fellow volunteer .
They were invited to paint the body in front of them , colour coding every patch of skin to show how uncomfortable they felt touching that part of the body - red for no - go ; yellow for squirming and green for fine .
Phil drew the line at colouring his subject 's genitals , but Kath had lost all her inhibitions .
Within moments she 'd painted her subject completely green .
Every inch .
Over a couple of days , the volunteers had unlearned many of the social conventions that normally govern their life , and reached a new consensus that permitted them to be naked in each other 's company .
It chimes with the psychologists ' theory that we are not born with a shame of nudity .
Instead we learn it , as an important behavioural code that allows us to operate in human society .
What do you think ?
Is being clothed an outmoded societal remnant , or is it still necessary to " protect mating pairs " ?
Journalists are advised : " If you need to identify individuals over the age of 50 , ' older adults ' is preferred over ' senior ' and ' elderly ' , which can be discriminatory in nature .

This job board is the only subscription service that I am including in these links , but it ’s because I firmly believe in it .
For $ 7 a month , you cut down on the sheer amount of people you are competing against .
I got a job from here my very first month , making a 50x ROI over the long run .
On the internet and other places I frequent , the question of firearms prohibition comes up a lot .
The usual approach mentioned for avoiding being disarmed at some point is to buy pistols , rifles , shotguns and wrapping 'em in oily rags and burying them somewhere .
And lots and lots of ammo too .
And do n't forget spare parts and accessories .
And spare parts for them , too .
This sounds like a lot of bother and all , reminding me at least of the Y2 K millenium doomsday forecasts a few years back .
Now at the risk of annoying the sophisticates reading this , the above mentioned approach does have its merits .
The bandits and guerillas throughout the world have done this for years .
Mrs. O'Leary in Londonderry , Northern Ireland plants a new patch of rosebushes .
But under them Mr. O'Leary has planted a few snuggly wrapped boxes of plastic explosive , an AK - 47 rifle , ammo , and a half dozen pistols .
If needed , they got 'em no matter what the British and Sein Fein agree to .
And the only people who know of it are the two others in Mr. O'Leary 's three - man cell , and it 's unlikely they 'd give him up .
Now there are as many regional and worldwide variations on this theme of ' stash a cache ' as there are involuntarily disarmed people in the world .
Which is to say a lot .
If this strategy works for you , then so be it .
But being the contrarian that everybody tells me I am , I can't get past my feelings that this approach has serious flaws , too .
Beyond the obvious ones like someone ratting you out , or accidental discovery , or forgetting where you buried them .
One is the ammo and spare parts problem .
When I was a kid , my gramp and uncles would go deer hunting .
One year my uncle made a lot of money , and one thing he 'd always promised himself if he ever had the money was a custom - built Weatherby rifle .
The only problem , though , was the ammunition .
Weatherby rifles in those days before a Japanese industrial conglomerate bought them out and started making Japanese owned , Chinese built and American labeled rifles , used proprietary ammunition that you could not readily locate to buy .
My uncle and the crew drove eight hours to the very westernmost part of Michigan 's Upper Peninsula near the Wisconsin border .
After unpacking , my uncle discovered that he left his ammunition at home .
Now if he had a rifle in 30 - 30 Winchester or any of the other typical deer rifle calibers , he'd have been OK .
He'd have made a quick trip to the closest town and gone to the local Wal - Mart or a gun shop and bought some .
The trouble , though , is that those places do n't sell proprietary Weatherby ammo .
He never found a single box for sale in a whole daylong auto trip to every place that sold ammo within a hundred - mile radius of the deer camp .
Uncle made numerous telephone inquiries too , but also to no avail .
And so my uncle got no deer that year .
The point is this could easily happen to even a dedicated stasher .
However many rounds you stash for your SKS or AR - 15 , sooner or later if there ever is a gun prohibition regime in place , the ammo stash will run out .
Or an extractor will bust or get bent or some other mechanical malfunction that can't be jury - rigged or fixed .
Unless you have a spare or a spare rifle you can cannibalize for parts , your rifle just became a very expensive club .
So what to do then ?
I am thinking more and more of improvised , hand - built shooting devices .
Not firearms or guns in the usual sense but mechanical instruments that will shoot a projectile with enough muzzle energy to kill a man or most game animals at 50 meters .
Air guns to be exact .
Now I hear people reading this saying , ' An air gun !
Are you finally nuts now ?
I need something better than a darn BB gun .
I need something to shoot small game for food , pest animals bothering the garden , and just maybe a two legged critter that is a threat . '
You can do all that with an air gun , would be my reply .
I made a pass through the online catalogs of the major brands of air gun makers as well as a few custom air gun makers and discovered much to my delight that there are a good assortment to choose from .
Listed below are few that struck me as good values given their price and utility .
The Bandit is a .50 - caliber rifle that shoots a 0.495 round lead ball weighing 182 grains .
It is made by Quackenbush Air Guns Ask for the price .
The Beeman GS1000 .22 cal Barrel Break Pellet Rifle with a Walnut Stock $ 230.00
Tech Force Pellet Rifle Model 34 .22 Caliber $ 65.00
Gamo Airguns - Young Hunter Air Rifle $ 115.99
Today 's modern air guns are quite capable of doing all those things previously mentioned very handily .
Their projectile velocities and muzzle energies are not as high as conventional firearms .
I stipulate that right now .
But if you need to pop off a few pesky rats that are rummaging through the trash at night , or a rabid skunk , or feral dog , they are just the thing .
If you want to shoot a rabbit or two for some fresh meat , it will easily kill them cleanly with proper shot placement .
I have done all the things listed above with an air rifle and with a conventional .22 rifle .
To be honest , it was good knowing that the neighbors or the ' authorities ' would n't hear me if I were discrete .
And if things ever get real bad some day in the future to where you dare not be caught shooting at all , well then air guns would be an even better alternative .
Air guns make no loud noises associated with shooting , leave behind no spent cartridge casings , produce no smoke , or smell of burned gunpowder , and leave no GSR sticking to your clothes and making them smell bad .
Better still , you do n't have ringing ears after you are done shooting , either .
In my uncle 's sad case previously mentioned , his expensive rifle did n't do him much good or provide him any sport because he did n't have any ammo for it .
That really should n't ever be the case with air guns .
The typical air gun shoots .177 or .22 caliber lead or copper jacketed lead projectiles .
They are cheap , abundant and interchangeable , too .
One air gun can easily shoot a cheap brand as an expensive imported brand .
It depends as always on your purpose and wallet thickness .
In most states , air guns are not regulated as strictly as traditional firearms .
Which is one reason to consider getting one .
Ammunition for them and related items is easily obtainable anonymously by fax , phone , mail and internet orders .
Dealers require no FFL to ship orders to and because they are n't considered firearms by most of the shipping companies like UPS or DHL , they wo n't get their panties in a wad over deliveries to you .
If worst comes to worse and the JBT 's decide to round up all the guns , you can hand it over while inwardly smiling that you got those monkeys off your back cheaply , and knowing that Mrs. O'Leary wo n't mind too much if you till the soil around her rosebushes later .
You and the boys have plans for tonight .
SPARTANBURG , S.C. --
At a factory here that churns out plastic parts for everything from spray cans to blasting caps , laying off just one worker can be more trouble than it 's worth .
The plant , owned by Cleveland - based Parker Hannifin Corp. , has become so lean over the past decade that many assembly lines run with only a handful of highly trained workers .
Fewer Workers on Factory Floors In Parker Hannifin's Spartanburg , S.C. , factory , workers are safer than in many other industries because cutting a full - time employee has become quite costly .
So while mass layoffs have driven the U.S. unemployment rate to its highest in 26 years , Parker and other companies like it are responding to the slump in more surgical ways , mainly by cutting hours and shedding temporary workers .
" Because of productivity gains , every one of my people carries more dollars in sales today , " says Donald Washkewicz , Parker 's chief executive .
In 2000 , the average Parker worker represented about $ 125,000 a year in sales .
Today , that figure tops $ 200,000 .
" If I need to cut back , I have to cut back fewer people to achieve the same goal . "
Similar trims are taking place at each of Parker 's nearly 300 factories .
And to varying degrees , this is happening at thousands of other large and small factories across the U.S .
The selective cuts help explain a curiosity of this recession .
The manufacturing sector is suffering a sharp contraction and has had to slash many jobs -- some 1.3 million , according to a Labor Department jobs report released Friday .
But fewer positions have been eliminated than would be expected given the depth of the slump .
As of February , 14 months into this recession , manufacturers have cut payrolls about 9.4 % .
That 's slightly less than the 9.5 % cut 14 months after the start of the 2000 recession , when the economy was already recovering .
The drop in production and orders , however , has so far been much worse this time around , indicating that companies have sought ways to cut back other than simply shedding workers .
As of January , the latest figures available , U.S. manufacturers cut production 12.8 % since the start of this recession , compared with just 2.6 % at the same point after the last recession began .
The sheer speed of this downturn , and the fact that it hit many manufacturers after the economy as a whole was officially in recession , may have muted layoffs .
A good chunk of the factory sector was still humming along until late last year , aided in part by strong exports .
Manufacturers may also be trying to hold on to workers as long as possible , in the hope that business revives .
But deeper changes in manufacturing are also playing a role .
A decade ago , most factories tended to do " batch " work , with large groups of employees churning out endless runs of the same pieces .
Since many workers did identical tasks , it was easier for companies to cut people during downturns .
That kind of work , which employs more people and includes a larger share of less - skilled positions , has been steadily migrating to lower - cost locales overseas .
In the U.S. , companies now have new equipment and streamlined operations that require fewer , more highly trained people to make more goods .
The sector lost 3.5 million workers -- one in five jobs -- between January 2000 and the start of this recession .
Even as employment contracted , production in that same time period rose 10 % .
" When you get down to where we are now , where manufacturing is less than 10 % of the employed population , there just is n't that much more you can cut , " says Kurt Karl , chief U.S. economist at Swiss Re. Mr. Karl says manufacturers are especially eager to hold on to workers who are trained to operate their increasingly sophisticated equipment .
At Parker 's Spartanburg plant , five workers make the tiny plastic rings that become seals on aerosol cans .
Each member of the group runs a different set of high - speed machines doing a distinct step , such as extruding long noodles of plastic , grinding them or cutting them into final product .
The group can curb production several ways short of layoffs .
Two workers can complete the first two steps in one day , then the other three workers can finish those products the next day , essentially cutting everyone 's hours by half .
Or , all five can take whole days off together .
But permanently pulling one or two of them out of the mix is far more difficult to accomplish , and could make it impossible for the line to operate efficiently .

Mr. Washkewicz , the Parker CEO , says the last thing he wants to do is lay off a worker he 's spent money training : " You want to sustain those skills . "
But cutting hours might not be a long - term solution .
Mr. Washkewicz says during the recession that hit the U.S. in the early 1980s , he headed one of Parker 's operations that cut back to four - day weeks in order to save jobs .
It worked for a while .
But after about three months , many people were struggling to pay bills on salaries that had been reduced by 20 % .
The company ultimately changed its approach , laying off workers and restoring those who remained to a fuller schedule .
Many of the current Parker workers whose hours have been cut say that they prefer it to losing their jobs entirely , but that they do n't feel out of the woods yet .
" I try not to worry about the economy , " says Miriam Porter , one of the workers now taking two unpaid days off each month .
However , she adds , " it is looking kind of bad . "
The Spartanburg plant , which employs about 133 workers , is part of Parker 's hydraulic - filter division , which has plants in several U.S. locations as well as overseas .
In the 2000 recession , the division 's sales fell about 7 % , prompting layoffs of 22 % of its work force .
This time , sales are down substantially more -- the company declines to provide a specific percentage -- but only 5 % of workers have lost jobs .
Last week , Parker announced a one - year salary freeze for its workers world - wide .
When it comes to scaling back production , each part of the company is given broad leeway in how and whether to cut workers or their hours .
As part of its announcement last week , Parker trimmed the hours and salaries of everyone at its Cleveland headquarters by 10 % through the end of June .
The pay cut for top executives , including Mr. Washkewicz , was even bigger , because it included reductions in incentive bonuses .
Parker is n't alone .
The Labor Department reports that in February , manufacturing production workers spent an average of 39.6 hours a week on the job , down from 41.2 hours a week a year earlier .
In a survey of chief financial officers conducted by Duke University and CFO Magazine last month , 55 % of manufacturing firms said that they had reduced employee hours over the past month , compared with 30 % for other firms .
Over the next year , 58 % of manufacturing firms said they planned to cut hours , compared with 32 % for other firms .
Streamlined production and technological improvements also mean fewer jobs need to be cut in a downturn .
In another section of Parker 's Spartanburg plant , two long rows of machines churn out plastic tubes for blasting caps .
The small explosive devices are used by construction and mining companies to clear debris .
With demand down for blasting caps , Parker recently went from making them on two shifts to just one .
That move cost the jobs of two workers who ran those machines on a second shift .
A decade ago , those same two blasting - cap lines required up to eight people to operate .
Eliminating production on that second shift would have meant shedding four times as many workers .
The labor - saving improvements included replacing nearly 400 mechanical rollers that required workers to painstakingly apply lubricant throughout the workday .
Now the line has mechanisms that do n't need oiling .
Another factor saving jobs thus far is smaller inventories .
A decade ago , Parker , like many other companies , structured its factories so that workers were building large batches of goods at each stage of production .
That often led to huge stockpiles and made it harder to adjust when a downturn hit .
There might have been six months or more of goods on Parker 's shelves before the signal finally came to reduce production .
Parker 's plants today have been largely restructured to create smaller production clusters .
Seals for aerosol cans , for example , are only made in numbers that match the flow of orders .
Mr. Washkewicz says those big stockpiles of yesteryear used to mean he had to cut more people , much faster .
" In the past , we were trying to adjust to past sins , as well as the current drop , " he says .
Some companies say tighter inventories helped them notice a dropoff in orders more quickly than they might have in years past .
" We saw the economy changing early last year and started cutting back , " says Rick Olson , who oversees four of Toro Co. 's plants in the northern U.S .
Toro , based in Bloomington , Minn. , makes lawn mowers and other equipment that traditionally sees lots of seasonal flux in sales .
Rather than laying off workers in droves , the company curbed seasonal hiring and overtime and did n't replace workers who had left .
Some smaller companies have found ways to shrink head count since the last downturn .
Germantown , Wis. - based Mahuta Tool Corp. , which makes items such as 600 - pound screws used in cranes , went from 23 to 12 workers in the last bruising manufacturing recession .
This time , the company has only had to cut two workers , reducing its payroll to 17 , in part because each worker now represents far more production than before .
" The highly skilled person , you 're not going to lay them off , " says CEO Lynn Mahuta .
" You will find other work for them to do . "
For workers who have n't been spared the ax , the future is an open question .
Spurgeon Jackson , a 34 - year - old machine operator who has spent 15 years at Parker 's Spartanburg plant , was one of the two people laid off from the second shift making parts for blasting caps .
He was recently called back to cover for a worker on medical leave , but he does n't know how long it will last .
" The 2000 recession was bad , " he says , stopping next to the clattering row of machines , " but not nearly as bad as things are right now . "

( CNN ) --
The poet Sylvia Plath , who made a name for herself through prose and poetry that conveyed a sense of depression and suicidal tendencies , famously died by asphyxiating herself in an oven in 1963 .
There is evidence that depression runs in families , but both genetics and environment influence the condition .
The recent reported suicide of her son , marine biologist Nicholas Hughes , brings to light a known psychiatric phenomenon : the heredity of suicidal behavior .
A first - degree relative -- a parent , sibling or child -- of a person who has committed suicide is four to six times more likely to attempt or complete a suicide , said Dr. David Brent , psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center .
Studies on twins have shown that suicidal behavior is between 30 and 50 percent due to heritable factors , he said .
Suicide victims ' biological relatives who were adopted away also show an increased risk of suicide , he said .
The rate of suicide in America is 10.9 suicide deaths per 100,000 people , according to the latest information from the National Institute of Mental Health .
That means , although the likelihood of suicidal behavior increases in families , a completed suicide is still a rare event , Brent said .
" Genetics is not destiny , " he said .
" The odds are still very much against you having this happening to another relative . "
Family history of suicide and family history of mental disorder are two risk factors that the National Institute of Mental Health lists .
More than 90 percent of people who die by suicide have depression or another mental disorder , or a substance abuse disorder in combination with another mental problem , according to the National Institute of Mental Health .
Learn about the link between depression and creativity
Research shows that depression runs in families .
A new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows biological markers for the inherited condition .
The researchers found , in a sample of 131 people , that the biological offspring of depressed people had structural differences in their brain .
Some of these people had been followed for more than 25 years .

People at high risk of developing depression had a 28 percent thinning of the right cortex , the brain 's outermost surface , the study found .
Those with an extra thinning abnormality in the left cortex were most likely to develop depression or anxiety .
The data set shows that this brain surface thinning was present before these people developed mental problems , and was found in both children and grandchildren of depressed people , said Dr. Bradley Peterson , psychiatrist at Columbia University Medical Center and co-author of the study .
The new study may point toward more individualized medicine -- one day people may be screened for these brain abnormalities that indicate high depression risk , and receive treatment based on that , he said .
Researchers believe the cortical thinning causes depression by interfering with the processing of emotional stimuli , he said .
A person with these brain abnormalities may benefit from therapy targeted at responding to social stimuli more appropriately , he said .
With both depression and suicide , research suggests that causal factors are a combination of genetics and environment , Peterson said .
The best way to prevent suicide is to treat the underlying psychiatric disorder , Brent said .
Besides Hughes and Plath , famous examples of two or more close relatives committing suicide include Ernest Hemingway 's family -- Hemingway 's father , brother , sister and granddaughter , in addition to the famous novelist himself , killed themselves .
The poet John Berryman jumped off a Minneapolis bridge in 1972 ; his father had committed suicide when the poet was a child .
More recently , the playwright Spalding Gray apparently killed himself in 2004 ; his mother had taken her own life many years earlier .
Do relatives of people who killed themselves imitate suicide ?
This is possible , but hard to prove or disprove , Brent said .
In fact , there is more evidence of copycat suicides among people who did not know the victim well , but merely learned about him or her through the news .
If you 've actually lost a relative to suicide and go through the bereavement process , you may be more likely to understand the aftermath of suicide , Brent said .
Suicide " can also represent the learned or transmitted way of coping with unbearable stress , " Peterson said .
What exactly gets transmitted in families with suicide ?
One theory is that it's a difficulty in emotional regulation .
" Not necessarily depression per se , but it 's the ability to restrain yourself from acting on suicidal thoughts , " Brent said .

All About Depression • Suicide
Being a felon can be quite a setback to the prospects of a person .
Most felons are aware of the fact that they tend to lose some of the rights made available for them by the American constitution .
Some of these rights are the fundamental rights that make life worth living .
In general , the United States is one of the countries that can boast of freedom of expression , freedom of religion , right to vote and be voted for if you qualify .
We will answer some of the questions bothering on the rights and requirements for a person to run for public office .
But first , Can a felon run for president ?
Can a felon run for president ?
Yes , a person convicted of a felony can run for the office of President of the United States of America .
The reason for this is that no part of the constitution prohibits a felon from contesting .
The constitution spells out that all you have to do to become the president is to be 35 years old , a native - born American , be a resident of America .
Also , he can only serve two terms of 4 years each at the maximum .
But if he or she has already served up to two years of another person ’s tenure , he or she can only go for one more term of 4 years thus meaning that he or she can only serve 6 years maximum .
The only major negative effect of being convicted as a felon is that it hurts your character and this can be leveraged upon by your opponents .
Has There Ever Been An American President Convicted Of A Felony
So far , there has never been an American president that has served time or been convicted as a felon before entering into office .
What Are The State Requirements To Run For Office ?
When it comes to the issue of felons running for public office , it is subject to the state that is in question .
Some states impose rather strict restrictions on people who have a conviction for felony while others do not .
There are also varied responses in the manner with which the states handle such issues .
Some states allow felons whose offense was ten years and above to run for office .
Some other states insist that anybody that is convicted of a crime that has to do with moral turpitude may not be allowed to contest for the position .
Issues of moral turpitude include deceit , lying , fraudulent receipt of public funds or issues of defaulting on financial responsibilities .
For instance , the state of Texas indicates that anyone that has a conviction for bribery , forgery , perjury , and other high crimes may be excluded from holding public office .
The state of Georgia , on the other hand , holds that anyone that has been convicted of a crime about moral turpitude may not be allowed to hold office .
The only exception to this is if the person has had his or her rights restored and ten years must have elapsed after the sentence .
They must also not have been convicted of moral turpitude or crime .
How Can One Get His Rights Restored ?
For a felon to have all their rights fully restored , they must complete all the parts of their sentence .
This includes probation and they must have paid all their restitution and not have any pending criminal charge .
In a situation where they meet these criteria , they can seek for their rights via a process known as clemency .
It should be pointed out that clemency will not in any way establish a state of innocence .
Thus the record will still stand , but the rights of the felon will be restored thus permitting them to run for and hold public office .
The loss of civil rights greatly hurts the ability of a person to hold public office .
It , however , does not affect the right of the person to run for the office .
There are situations where certain felons have run for office and been elected .
However , due to the extant laws of the state , they were not sworn into office .
The aforementioned is quite different in the case of federal positions .
In this case , when a person decides to run for a public federal office like congress , they are free to run , but regarding if they can serve , that is a prerogative of Congress .
For you to be eligible to run for congress , you have to be 25 years old and have to have been a citizen for at least 7 years .
In the case of the senate , you have to be at least 30 years old and been a citizen for at least 9 years .
You must also be an inhabitant of the state you seek to represent when you are elected .
The federal elected positions are often different from the state positions mainly because the American constitution is minimalist .
This means that many decisions are left to the states to establish .
How Can A Felon Succeed While Running For Office ?
The moment the rights of a felon have been restored and they decide that they want to run for office , it is ideal that they have a plan to handle the felony conviction .
The fact is that a felony is a component of your public record and as such , it ca n’t be hidden .
The secret to success in this regard is in the manner it is handled .
Ideally , it is wise that you do not attempt to hide it ; neither should you try to make it the focus of your campaign .
You can simply make it a part of the campaign .
The felony can be seen as a part of the person ’s past while they made errors .
They then came to a point where they decided to live their lives quite differently .
Public service is indeed an important aspect of it .
During a campaign , even though the criminal record is there , it should not define who the felon is .
If the issue is however raised , you must be open and honest about it .
There is no need to be defensive about anything or even dwelling on the mistakes made in the past .
What Kind Of Support Should Be Given To Felons Running For Office ?
When a convicted felon decides to run for office , the first thing he or she needs is the support and encouragement of their family members .
They ought to be encouraged to be focused on the goal of becoming elected as a public official .
They must be ready to serve the public while also establishing some level of trust .
If you are close to one , ensure that you remind them of their innate desire to serve the greater good .
You should do all you can to ensure that they do not give up .
Also ensure that you stand by them in their time of need , because when they succeed , all will profit .
Can A Prisoner Vote And Be Voted For
This debate is one that has to do with the right of people to vote for prisoners and there are currently only states that allow felons to vote in prison .
The states are Vermont and Maine .
Also in 14 states including Utah , Hawaii , and Massachusetts , felons will lose their rights to vote while in prison .
The right is however restored after they have served their time .
In 22 states including Texas and New Jersey , felons will lose their rights to vote while incarcerated and even when on parole .
The felons may have to pay certain fines before they are allowed to vote again .
In about 12 states , which includes Arizona and Alabama felons lose their rights to vote due to certain crimes and they may only get the rights restored when they are pardoned .
What this means is that about 48 states do not allow prisoners to vote .
It , therefore , suffices to say that over 6 million people in America cannot vote because they are in prison .
What Are The Categories Of Voting Rights ?
The restoration of the rights to vote for ex-offenders is different from one point of America to the other .
Some of the classifications of voting rights include the one after parole , the one that ends after been released , the one that ends after probation and the circumstantial one .
Quite several efforts have been made to help the rights of people to vote and be voted for .
Conclusion
We have been able to establish the fact that a felon should be able to vote and be voted for .
This is however subject to the existing rules of the state .
Currently , there is no known President of America that has ever been convicted of a felony .
Also , the hurdles faced by a felon are one that can be very challenging to surmount .
This is why the family and friends of a felon should be very supportive of their dreams and aspirations because it is a part of their past .
But Kim Gandy , president of the National Organization for Women , said separate classrooms reinforce gender stereotypes .
“ A boy who has never been beaten by a girl on an algebra test could have some major problems having a female supervisor , ” she said .
While some advocates believe that girls are more likely to participate in class when no boys are present — and that boys , particularly those from low - income families , tend to focus better without girls around — academic research is inconclusive .
“ The question always must be : What are you trying to accomplish with separating the students and how will you do it ? ” said Rosemary C. Salamone , a law professor at St. John ’s University and author of “ Same , Different , Equal : Rethinking Single - Sex Schooling . ”
She added , “ If you do n’t do it thoughtfully , you run the risk of reinforcing stereotypes and playing to students ’ weaknesses . ”
In California , a high - profile governor ’s initiative that split six middle schools and high schools into single - sex academies in the late 1990s ended after a few years , and few students showed sizable improvement .
At the Bronx ’s Eagle School , there is also little evidence so far of improvement , at least of the easy - to - measure variety .
Students of both sexes in the co-ed fifth grade did better on last year ’s state tests in math and English than their counterparts in the single - sex rooms , and this year ’s co-ed class had the highest percentage of students passing the state social studies exam .
But these numbers are as much a reflection of who is in which room .
In general , struggling students are steered toward the single - sex classes ( anyone who objects can opt out ) .
While test scores might not show it , Mr. Cannon and his teachers said there have been fewer fights and discipline issues , and more participation in class and after - school activities , since the girls and boys were split up .
Mr. Napolitano , one of four men among the school ’s 30 classroom teachers , said he thinks of his students as “ 23 sort - of sons , ” and engages them with Marvel Comics and chess .
He proudly held up the book “ Patrol Boy , ” with a picture of a young man with a large tattoo on his back , as an example of material he would not have used in a co-ed class .
This bad , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s office shows us :
If you are having trouble reading the fine print :
The blue line shows job losses in the 1990 recession ; the red line is 2001 , and the green line is the path we are on now .
UPDATE : To clarify , these are not projections .
This is actual job - loss data . *
Pelosi ’s office explains :
This chart compares the job loss so far in this recession to job losses in the 1990 - 1991 recession and the 2001 recession — showing how dramatic and unprecedented the job loss over the last 13 months has been .
Over the last 13 months , our economy has lost a total of 3.6 million jobs – and continuing job losses in the next few months are predicted .
By comparison , we lost a total of 1.6 million jobs in the 1990 - 1991 recession , before the economy began turning around and jobs began increasing ; and we lost a total of 2.7 million jobs in the 2001 recession , before the economy began turning around and jobs began increasing .
* Pelosi ’s office says they used Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers .
UPDATE2 : Justin
Fox looks further back , and puts the recession in percentage terms here .
“ The corporate welfare commission and military acquisition reform are two things the president - elect wants to do very soon , ” Rahm Emanuel , Mr. Obama ’s chief of staff and a participant in the meeting , said in an interview .
The new administration is already preparing to introduce legislation echoing a previous McCain bill on the commission idea , Mr. Emanuel said , adding , “ We have been very respectful and solicitous of his ideas . ”
Mr. Emanuel said he did not remember any discussion of Iraq .
“ Barack has been clear that he is going to stick to his responsible reduction in forces , and he has n’t changed from that , ” he said .

But Mr. Graham , who accompanied Mr. McCain to the meeting , said Mr. Obama took a notably different tone toward Iraq than he had during the campaign , emphasizing the common ground in their views .
“ He said that he understands that we had differences but he wanted to let us know that he also understands that we have got to be responsible in how we leave Iraq , ” Mr. Graham recalled .
“ What the Obama - Biden administration has talked about is not losing the gains we have achieved . ”
He added , “ Obama does not want to be the guy who lost Iraq when it is close to being won . ”
Mr. Emanuel , whose only previous contact with Mr. Graham was negotiating the terms of the presidential debates , began calling him more than once a week to follow up .
“ Constantly , ” Mr. Emanuel said .
“ There has been a running dialogue . ”
Mr. Graham , in turn , called his counterpart “ a pleasure to do business with . ”
Vice President - elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. , a friend since Mr. McCain was the Navy ’s liaison to the Senate three decades ago , has also played intermediary .
He called Mr. McCain to ask him to appear at the inaugural dinner , and he invited Mr. Graham on another recent trip to Iraq and Afghanistan .
Gen Rzayev became air force chief after Azerbaijan 's independence
The commander of Azerbaijan 's air force has been shot dead outside his house in the capital , Baku , officials have said .
Lt - Gen Rail Rzayev , 64 , was shot once in the head by an unknown gunman while getting into his car in a western area of the city at around 0800 ( 0400 GMT ) .
Defence ministry officials said the general was taken to a military hospital , but died shortly afterwards .
The authorities say they have launched an investigation into the murder , but they do not know what the motive was .
Nijmedin Sadykhov , the head of the Azeri military general staff , told Lider TV that security cameras near Gen Rzayev 's home might help catch the perpetrator .
" There was a single shot .
According to preliminary information , Rzayev 's car had been under surveillance for several days , " he said .
Oil - rich nation Gen Rzayev , who had commanded Azerbaijan 's air force since 1992 , was rarely seen in public or in the media .
He was the first high - ranking military official to be killed in the former Soviet state since 1994 , when the country was at war with Armenia over the disputed territory of Nagorno - Karabakh .
Since then , a fragile ceasefire has held in the region , but there is still no lasting resolution as to how the territory should be governed .
More recently , the general was the Azeri representative in the stalled negotiations between Russia and the US over the use of the Qabala radar station in northern Azerbaijan .
Moscow had offered Washington access to data from the Soviet - built radar station , which it leases from the Azeri government , as an alternative to US plans to station elements of a missile defence shield in Eastern Europe .
Azerbaijan , which lies on the Caspian Sea and has major oil and gas resources , has recently invested much of its wealth into the military .
Official statistics show the government spent more than $ 1bn ( £ 696 m ) on improvements to its armed forces last year .
Some military analysts say Gen Razayev played a role in the country 's recent large - scale military acquisitions .
" Rzayev was the focal point for air force and air defence military acquisitions , and the largest part of [ Azerbaijan 's ] military budget is being allocated for acquisitions in these spheres , " Baku - based analyst Uzeir Jafarov told the AFP news agency .
In October 2008 , the International Crisis Group described Azerbaijan 's armed forces as " fragmented , divided , accountable - to - no - one - but - the - president , un- transparent , corrupt and internally feuding " , and highlighted problems in supply and procurement .
" A lack of transparency and parliamentary oversight of tenders for military construction and food and other purchases for the army allows inflated prices and proxy companies to receive preferential treatment , " it said in a report .
However , the BBC's Tom Esslemont in Baku says it is too early to say whether the general 's role in such decisions may have formed any part of a motive for his murder .
Foreign diplomats have also warned that the mainly Muslim country , which borders Iran and Russia 's troubled Caucasus region , also faces a real threat from Islamic extremism .
Azerbaijan 's President , Ilham Aliyev , won re-election in October in a vote which international observers said fell short of fully democratic standards .
He took over power from his father , Heydar Aliyev , who was president for 10 years until his death in 2003 .
The country will vote in a referendum in March on the scrapping of a two - term limit on the presidency , which would allow Mr Aliyev to run again for office after his current term ends in 2013 .

A crew member on a Chinese trawler uses a grapple hook in an apparent attempt to snag the towed acoustic array of the military Sealift Command ocean surveillance ship USNS Impeccable ( T - AGOS - 23 ) in the South China Sea in this picture taken March 8 , 2009 and released March 9 .
REUTERS / U.S. Navy / Handout
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - China ’s dispute with the United States over accusations it harassed a U.S. naval vessel is the worst between the two countries since the detention of a U.S. spy plane and crew in 2001 , the top U.S. intelligence official said on Tuesday .
National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair said Chinese policies “ seem to be in a more military , aggressive ” stance .
“ That is a trend that we are seeing , ” he told the Senate Armed Services committee .
It was still unclear , he said , whether China was using its growing military power “ for good or pushing people around . ”
His comments came a day after the United States accused China of harassing a U.S. naval survey ship , the USNS Impeccable , in international waters off a Hainan island , a key strategic base from which China projects military power in the South China Sea .
China rejected the accusation and charged the United States with violating Chinese laws regarding its disputed exclusive economic zones .
Blair called the incident “ the most serious ” since a Chinese military plane collided with a U.S. electronic surveillance plane also off Hainan in April 2001 , the early months of former President George W. Bush ’s presidency .
A Chinese pilot was killed , and the U.S. plane made an emergency landing on the island .
The crew was released 10 days later , and the plane was also later returned .
The director of the Defense Intelligence Agency , Lt. Gen. Michael Maples , told the committee that China was strengthening its ability to conduct military operations along its periphery “ on its own terms , ” and acquiring sophisticated air defenses from Russia that would greatly extend its capabilities .
“ It is building and fielding sophisticated weapon systems and testing new doctrines that it believes will allow it to prevail in regional conflicts and also counter traditional U.S. military advantages , ” he said .

A machine defines ( by its very structure ) a language , viz .
its input language : conversely , the semantic definition of a language specifies a machine that understands it .
In other words : machine and language are two faces of one and the same coin .
I am going to describe such a coin .
I leave it entirely to you to decide which of these two aspects of the subject matter of my talk you think the most important as it is rather ridiculous in both aspects .
The language I am going to sketch is prohibitively difficult for a human user and the machine I am going to describe is of a perverse inefficiency .
Therefore , if my mental construction , nevertheless , has a right to exist it should derive this from other qualities .
My machine derives this , to my taste and judgement at least , from its extreme simplicity and elegance , from the uniform way in which it performs its ( at first glance ) rather different operations ; the justification for my language are its clearness and the unusually high degree of ambiguity , derived from a strict sequential interpretation and an explicit indication in the program to perform operations , which are usually implicitly understood ( and therefore apt to misunderstanding ) .
If one wishes to do so one may regard my machine and my language as being conceived for the purpose of clarification .
Before I really start with my description I should like to warn you for two intentional omissions .
The system I am going to present is the result of a careful choice between a great number of " neighbouring possibilities " .
I shall not give my motivations for these choices , I shall even leave the consciously rejected alternatives unmentioned .
In other words , I refrain from introducing my system at least in some respects as , say , a " local optimum " .
As this diminishes the convincing power of my presentation , I personally regret this omission .
I have to omit these motivations , however , for the sake of brevity .
The other question I shall not touch is the question how to implement this system with the aid of a conventional machine .
One might even raise the question — as I did myself to check that I was not thinking nonsense — whether it can be implemented at all , no matter how crudely .
You have to take my word for it that it can be done .
I have worked out a method of implementation to a degree that could convince , I think , the most suspicious auditor of the possibility .
But it is my intention not to show you the particulars of this implementation , because I had to incorporate too many arbitrary decisions in which , when mentioned , would only divert the attention from the essentials .
In particular , the question of storage allocation will remain untouched .
My Machine operates on ( and under control of ) units of information which I call " words " .
Without loss of generality I can restrict myself to a finite number of different words , each represented by the same number of bits .
The machine distinguishes between different kinds of words , say numbers , operators , variables and separators .
For the time being we shall confine our attention to the first of these , " number words " and " operator words " .
A normal arithmetical operation , say the addition or multiplication of two numbers , has two number words as input and one word , also representing a number , as output .
The rules according to which a numerical value should be attached to ( i.e. derived from the bits of ) a number word are embodied in the workings of the arithmetic unit , which has the usual property that these same rules apply to both input and output : the output of the arithmetic unit can be fed into it again at some later stage of the process .
As we assume that the properties of the arithmetic unit are constant in time , we may say that the number words have " a fixed meaning " .
As the fixed interpretation of number words is coupled to the constant properties of the arithmetic unit it is not so surprising that we shall denote the basic arithmetic operations by operator words ( " + " , " - " , " * " , " / " , etc. ) the meaning of which can also be regarded as fixed .
The machine works under control of a program which primarily consists of a string of words .
For the time being I shall confine myself to pieces of program prescribing the evaluation of arithmetic expressions .
Let us consider the expression that would normally be written down as
5 + 39 / ( 7 + 2 * 3 )  6 ;
in the usual postfix notation ( also known under the name " Reversed Polish Notation " ) this would give rise to the following sequence of numbers and operators ( successive items in this sequence for the sake of representation on paper being separated by spaces )
5 39 7 2 3 * + / + 6  .
The well known mechanism especially devised for the sequence evaluation of such an expression is what I prefer to call a " stack " .
( This device has been invented and generalized independently by so many people that it is known now under a great variety of names , such as " push down list " , " nesting store " , " cellar " , " last- in- first-out - memory " etc . )
If we regard the above sequence of numbers and operators as the string of words representing a piece of program , the machine reads this string word by word from left to right .
If it reads a number word , this number ( i.e. a copy of this number word ) is added to the top of the stack , if it reads an operator word , the operation in question is performed at the top of the stack .
In illustration I give on successive lines the successive pictures of the top of the stack is at the right hand side of the line .
..... 5
..... 5 39
..... 5 39 7
..... 5 39 7 2
..... 5 39 7 2 3
..... 5 39 7 6
..... 5 39 13
..... 5 3
..... 8
..... 8 6
..... 2
and the net result of the execution of this little piece of program is that the value of the expression has been added to the stack .
As clearly shown in the above example the machine starts by copying the program text word by word into the top of the stack .
Sooner or later this has to be interrupted , otherwise our machine would just be a copying machine .
In the above system the process of copying is interrupted by the occurrence of an arbitrary operator in the program text .
The function of an operator , therefore , is a double one : firstly it indicates that the copying has to be interrupted for a while , because now an operation has to be performed , secondly it specifies this operation .
I propose to separate these two completely different functions : from now on arithmetic operators are primarily treated in exactly the same way as numbers are treated , i.e. the operator word is copied into the stack as well .
Every time the process of copying has to be interrupted I shall indicate this in the program explicitly by the insertion of a special word , introduced now and represented by " E " ( from " Evaluate " ) .
My machine now takes the following form .
It reads the program text word by word , from left to right .
By " reading " is meant the following : if the word read is unequal to " E " a copy of it is added to the stack , if the word read is equal to " E " , it is not copied but , instead , the operation takes place as specified ( primarily ) by the top word of the stack .
According to these rules the program prescribing the evaluation of the expression of our previous example will now consist of the following string of words
5 39 7 2 3 * E + E / E + E 6  E
and under control of this piece of program text ( i.e. when this string of words is " read by the machine " ) the top of the stack will be in succession as shown in the following lines :
..... 5
..... 5 39
..... 5 39 7
..... 5 39 7 2
..... 5 39 7 2 3
..... 5 39 7 2 3 *
..... 5 39 7 6
..... 5 39 7 6 +
..... 5 39 13
..... 5 39 13 /
..... 5 3
..... 5 3 +
..... 8
..... 8 6
..... 8 6 
..... 2
As said above the machine performs the operation specified by the top word of the stack when it reads the word " E " in the program text .
We shall restrict ourselves to such programs that at such a moment the top word of the stack is indeed an operator word ( and not , for instance , a number word ) .
Furthermore we shall restrict ourselves to the case that the immediately underlying stack words be in accordance with any requirements that the execution of the operator at the top may set .
( For instance , in the case of the binary arithmetic operations illustrated above the two immediately underlying words must be numbers . )
In other words : if an operand of an arithmetic operation happens to be an expression we substitute for this expression its numerical value before the operation is called into action , thus appealing to the fact that , primarily , the arithmetic operations are defined only when supplied with numerical operands .
We regard the replacement of a ( sub ) expression by its numerical value as a " substitution " , and we indicate explicitly when these substitutions have to be performed , although , linguistically speaking , this rather abundant : " 3 + 4 " will always be equal to " 7 " , no matter when we perform this addition .
This situation , however , radically changes as soon as variables in contrast to constant numbers  are taken into account .
( In the following we shall denote variables with small letters , reserving capital letters for " special words " , such as " E " and others , to be introduced below . )
Let us assume that we have to compute the value of the expression
" x + 4 "
at a moment that the value of the variable x equals 3 .
This means that in the above expression we must substitute for " x " its numerical value at that moment ; only after having done so we can perform the arithmetic substitution ( " 3+4 " being replaced by " 7 " ) .
Given something dependent on x ( viz . the expression " x +4 " ) we create a result ( viz. " 7 " ) which , thanks to the fact that we have substituted for x its present value , is made in dependent of the future history of x .
We have fixed an " instantaneous picture " of the variable x .
Obviously I insist upon indicating explicitly when this instantaneous picture of the variable x ( which is varying in time ! ) has to be taken .
Now we are going to harvest the first fruits of our labor for the mechanism for this explicit indication is already introduced .
The piece of program prescribing the evaluation of the expression
" x + 4 "
now takes the following form :
" x E 4 + E "
and under the above assumption the successive pictures of the stack are
..... x
..... 3
..... 3 4
..... 3 4 +

Our machine invites us to describe the fact that " the value of the variable x equals 3 " in slightly other wordings , viz .
that the state of the process is such that reading the word " E " at a moment that the top word of the stack is " x " results in the replacement of this top word by the number word " 3 " .
The variable on the top of the stack is thus regarded as a variable operator which , upon evaluation , is replaced by something dependent on the state of the process at that moment ; in this case it is an operator the execution of which sets no special requirements to the immediately underlying stack words .
( The similarity between operators and variables will be further stressed by our next example . )
All words read in the text are added to the stack except the word " E " which causes the machine to perform a substitution .
For reason to be explained below we should like to have also the possibility of adding the word " E " to the stack .
The framework for this extension , however , is already present .
We introduce a special operator , denoted by the word " P " ( from " Postponement " ) , which effects upon evaluation a fixed substitution , vis. its replacement by the word " E " .
We shall illustrate the use of the operator " P " in the next example .
In this example we have three variables , named " x " , " y " and " plinus " .
Suppose the state of the process to be such that reading " plinus E " generates the word " + " on top of the stack .
When reading the text :
" x P E y P E plinus E P E "
the top of the stack will show in succession
..... x
..... x P
..... x E
..... x E y
..... x E y P
..... x E y E
..... x E y E plinus
..... x E y E +
..... x E y E + P
..... x E y E + E
and the top of the stack thus contains the string of words which , when read as a piece of program , would effectuate the evaluation of the expression " x + y " .
If the value of the variable " plinus " would have been "  " we would have generated ( the string of words corresponding to ) the expression " x  y " .
What we have done amounts to a partial evaluation of the expression " x plinus y " , the result again being an expression .
In our previous examples the final addition to the stack always consisted of a single number .
But a number is a trivial example of an expression and generating not only numbers but also more general expressions as intermediate results is therefore an obvious extension of normal practice .
Up till now we have described the generation of words on top of the stack but not what we are going to do with these words .
Furthermore we have assumed that with respect to given variable the process could be in such a state that evaluation of this variable would give rise to a previously defined substitution , but how this definition should take place is not mentioned in the above .
These two gaps in our picture will both be filled by the introduction of the assignment operators .
For the assignment of a single word value , as in " x := 3 " we could write in our program
" 3 x := E "
resulting into the stack pictures :
..... 3
..... 3 x
..... 3 x :=
Upon evaluation of the assignment operator " : = " the machine investigates the immediately underlying word .
This must be the variable to which an assignment has to take place ; the next underlying word is assigned to this variable ( a process , about which more below ) and the three words on top of the stack ( which have now been processed ) are removed from the stack .
Until further notice i.e. a new assignment to the variable " x "  the evaluation of this variable will result in the replacement of the top word of the stack by the word " 3 " .
But for the interchanging of left and right hand side this is closely analogous to the assignment statement as known in ALGOL 60 .
But we need more than that for , in general , the assigned value will not consist out of a single word , but out of a string of words and we must therefore have a means of indicating how deep in the stack the assigned value extends .
The simplest way to do this is to insert in the stack a marker , say the special word " T " ( from " Terminal " ) at the bottom side of the assigned value .
Furthermore we introduce another assignment operator " :-" ( called the " string assignment " in contrast to the " word assignment " introduced in the previous paragraph ) .
Upon evaluation of this operator the machine investigates the top of the stack in downward direction .
The first word ( immediately under the operator " : - " ) must be the variable to which a value has to be assigned .
Thereafter the machine continues its word by word investigation in the downward direction until it meets the special marker " T " : the words passed in this way form together the string that acts as the assigned value .
The simplest way to add a " T " to the stack would be just to insert the word " T " in the proper place in the program under control of which the stack is being filled .
This arrangement , however , will not do ; for reasons to be explained later we need the possibility of generating a " T " on top of the stack under control of a program that itself does not contain this word .
We can do this with the same trick that enabled us to generate an " E " on top of the stack .
We introduce a new operator , denoted by the word " S " ( say from " Separator " or because it precedes the " T " in the alphabet ) which upon evaluation is replaced by the word " T " and we make it a rule that this will be the only way in which words " T " are added to the stack .
Using all this we have an alternative to write the assignment statement " x := 3 " , viz .
" S E 3 x :- E "
giving in the top of the stack in succession :
..... S
..... T
..... T 3
..... T 3 x
..... T 3 x :-
.....
The net effect of this is equivalent to the previous form using the word assignment " := " .
Let us use the more powerful assignment in an example which is an extension of one of our earlier ones , viz .
the one describing the partial evaluation of the expression " x plinus y " .
The result of this partial evaluation was an expression depending on the variables " x " and " y " and suppose that we want to call this expression " z " .
For this purpose we write in the program :
" S E x P E y P E plinus E P E z :- E " .
When the last " E " of this string is going to be read the top of the stack will be as follows ( under the same assumption with respect to the value of " plinus " :
..... T x E y E + E z :-
and after the execution of this assignment the above words will have been removed from the stack , the word " T " inclusive .
Until further notice the evaluation of the variable " z " will imply the execution ( the " reading " ) of the string assigned to it .
Upon evaluation of the variable " z " the machine therefore must have access to the first word of this string ; when it starts reading this string , however , it must detect the last word of this string .
We propose that the assignment operator sees to this by adding again an end marker and for this purpose we can use the very same word " T " .
Upon evaluation of the variable " z " the string assigned to it will be read as a piece of program , from left to right until the end marker " T " is met .
The new situation resulting from the last assignment can conveniently be represented by :
" z → x E y E + E T " .
In exactly the same way our previous assignments
" 3 x := E " or " S E 3 x :- E "
will both give rise to the situation , represented by
" x → 3 T " .
One of the most illuminating aspects of this arrangement is that the usual distinction between " numbers " and " instructions " has completely vanished .
The value of a variable is defined as a piece of program , evaluation of this variable implies the execution of this piece of program .
Furthermore we should like to draw attention to a certain form of duality between the assignment on the one hand and reading a text on the other .
When the machine reads a piece of program text , the top of the stack is filled under control of this program text .
In the assignment " readable text " is created under control of the contents of the stack .
The duality can also be illustrated by taking into consideration the accessibility requirements .
The words in the stack need only be accessible in the direction from top to bottom .
If an assignment statement converts the top of the stack into readable text , however , the consecutive words thereby become accessible in the other direction .
Finally , the stack is reserved for " anonymous intermediate results " , whereas readable text in principle , at least is always " named " , for we create it by assigning it to a variable .
The attentive reader will have noticed that , along with the representation of the value of a variable , we have silently introduced two more complications in our machine .
The first one , the occurrence of the word " T " in program text and the machine 's " immediate reaction " to it is a relatively simple one .
As we have described the organization , the word " T " , when read in the text , is not copied on top of the stack !
Instead , it causes the machine to go on reading at the first word following in the string after the " E " that caused this evaluation of the variable in question .
In other words , it acts as a " Return " at the end of a closed subroutine .
But the evaluation of a variable may call for the evaluation of other variables ( even for the evaluation of itself ) : the pragmatic definition of the evaluation of a variable is basically a recursive one and the mechanisms one needs to follow a recursive definition is ..... another stack !
I call this second stack " the stack of activations " in contrast to the first which I call " the anonymous stack " .
One of the functions of the stack of activations is to control the reading process .
When the evaluation of a variable starts the stack of activations expands , when the corresponding word " T " is read , it shrinks to its previous size .
( In the usual terminology of machine structure : the stack of activations contains a stack of " order counter values " , its top element being , by definition , " the present order counter " ; in the same terminology its older elements act as a stack containing the " return addresses " . )
Note .
We could try to merge our two stacks into one .
This merging would present itself in a completely natural fashion if the two should expand and shrink " in phase " with one another .
In general , however , this is not the case and trying to merge the two stacks into a single one would give a highly unnatural construction .
We shall use the stack of activations for yet another purpose , to satisfy a very fundamental need , viz .
the creation of new variables .
In the above I have used special words ( " x " , " y " , " plinus " etc. ) to denote variables and I have carefully avoided to use the term " identifier " .
I have used the term " variable " in connection with a single , unique object , existing for some period of time and capable of taking on different values in succession .
This concept of a variable is to be distinguished carefully from the " identifier " as used in ALGOL 60 , because one and the same identifier may be used to point to a host of objects , to a great number of different variables
First of all we meet the fact that one and the same identifier may play different roles thanks to the fact that it occurs in more than one declaration .
A lexicographical rule then tells us which one of these declarations applies everywhere , where the identifier in question may be used .
This form of multiple use of one and the same identifier could be removed by a simple process of renaming .
But there is a much more subtle case of " multiple use of one and the same identifier " , viz .
as soon as a certain block occurs in one or more nested activations ( as in the case of a a recursive procedure ) .
In other words : one and the same identifier then refers sometimes to this variable , sometimes to another .
In actual fact : the identifier stands for a variable and in order to indicate clearly for which variable it stands I intend to denote explicitly the moment when a variable has to be substituted for an identifier .
For the sake of convenience to be more exact : convenience for the machine and not for the hypothetical user 
I intend to use the same identifiers for the local variables of every activation .
( What I call " an activation " is closely analogous to a block or procedure body , as known in ALGOL 60 . )
I use for this purpose the special identifier words " L0 " , " L1 " , " L2 " , etc . .
If the machine starts the evaluation of a variable , the stack of activations increases with one item .
At the start this item also contains a note that up till now no local variables have been introduced in this activation .
If the machine reads the word " E " at a moment that the top of the anonymous stack contains one of the identifier words ( say " L2 " ) then it investigates the top item of the stack of activations .
If it is the first time that this identifier has to be evaluated in the present activation the machine creates a new variable for it ( and may give this variable an empty value ) and makes in the youngest item of the stack of activations a note to this effect .
Then it replaces the top word of the anonymous stack by the variable just created for it .
At a next evaluation of the same identifier at a moment that the same activation is still ( or again ) the present one , the machine finds in the top item of the stack of activations the note left there at the first evaluation of this identifier and the top word of the stack is replaced by the same variable .
Now we can show a more complicated example .
Let the values of the variables " x " , " y " and " complus " be as represented by :
" x → 10 23 T "
" y → 5 2 T "
" complus → L0 E := E
L1 E := E
L2 E := E
L1 E E + E
L1 E E L0 E E + E
T " .
If we now read the text
" S E x E y E complus E z :- E "
the net effect will be that we can represent the new value of " z " by :
" z → 15 21 T "
and what we have done can be interpreted as the addition of two complex numbers .
In ALGOL terminology : " complus " is a procedure with four numerical parameters , all called by value .
The simple structure of the process allows the first of these to remain anonymous even in the procedure body .
Furthermore , it is a kind of " type procedure " , be it one that , syntactically speaking , takes the place of two primaries .
Let me end with a trivial example .
Suppose that we want to write " plus " instead of " + " .
After the assignment
" S E + P E plus :- E "
which gives rise to the situation
" plus → + E T "
the expressions
" x E y E plus E "
and
" x E y E + E "
are completely equivalent .
This example is included to show as clearly as possible the arbitrariness of our primitives .
Conclusion
I am fully aware that the sketch is definitely incomplete .
Particularly conditional reaction and some equivalent of the go to statement should be incorporated if one wishes to make a system out of this .
For the moment I leave these out and I do so for two reasons .
Firstly for the sake of brevity and secondly because I have not decided yet : for I know of several possible ways but none of them fully satisfies me .
With some versions of these facilities I have made slightly more elaborate programs .
They showed me both the power and the weakness of my Language , its power being its flexibility and its unambiguity , its weakness being the fact that using it intelligently proved to be far above at least my powers .
If nevertheless I claim attention for this project I do n't do so only because it charms me and may charm others as well .
This report is the condensation of my meditations after we had completed our implementation of ALGOL 60 .
This implementation was conceived at high speed and the main justification for the numerous decisions taken in those hectic months was the recognition that our conceived constructions would lead to our goal and would do the job , in some way or another .
The Machine described in this report , however , represents an extreme of the continuous spectrum of possible implementations of an algorithmic language which ( as is the case with ALGOL 60 ) caters for recursiveness .
In this quality it has been very clarifying for me personally : it has helped me a great deal in the appreciation of the various ( initially disconnected ) tricks we have incorporated intuitively and it has clearly shown us a number of alternative solutions .
Therefore the hope is justified that translator construction and machine design in the future will benefit from these considerations .
Furthermore , the Machine presented here is so ridiculously inefficient that every practical implementation of a practical algorithmic language in all probability can be regarded as an optimization of it , an optimization which is permissible thanks to certain restrictions in the language .
It may be useful to compare a proposed language with my language ; during the process of language construction it may be helpful in the timely detection of " expensive features " .
Whether such an expensive feature will be included or not is more or less a political question but quite apart from how such a question is answered it is nice to know what one is doing .
Finally the language described in this report ( or a language devised along similar lines ) may prove to be a suitable means for the formalization of the semantic definition of an algebraic language .
The lack of such a rigorous semantic definition is one of the recognized shortcomings of the official " Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60 " and having seen the tremendous amount of trouble caused by this defect , I most sincerely hope that this report will contribute to the effort to avoid this mistake the next time an algorithmic language will be devised .

AIG now stands for " Anonymous , Inescapable Guilt . "
That 's one possible interpretation of the insurance giant 's move to take its logo off one of its New York buildings .
Either that or they 're following their own advice .
AIG 's brand has become hopelessly tarnished after a government bailout and controversy over bonuses issued to executives in the financial - products group which wrecked AIG 's balance sheet .
But what will replace it ?
AIU , the name going up on AIG's Water Street building ?
AGLA , the name given to a Nashville - based subsidary ?
Company flacks are giving various reasons for the changes :
The lower Manhattan building housed an insurance subsidiary unrelated to the tarnished financial products group , yet drew many protests because of its prominent sign .
The Tennesee office is getting rebranded because insurance brokers are having trouble drumming up business under the AIG name .
But let 's be honest :
Who sees these nameplates more often than anyone else ?
The employees who walk under them every day .
The renaming is for their sake as much as anyone else's .
Here 's an AP video of a freshly unsigned AIG building :

SAN DIEGO , Nov. 14 ( UPI ) -- U.S. researchers suggest inflammation from a molecule introduced through consumption of red meat and dairy products could promote tumor growth .
Researchers at the University of California , San Diego School of Medicine , led by Dr. Ajit Varki , studied a non-human cellular molecule called N-glycolylneuraminic acid -- Neu5 Gc.
Neu5 Gc is a type of glycan , or sugar molecule , that humans do n't naturally produce , but that can be incorporated into human tissues as a result of eating red meat , Varki said .

The body then develops anti-Neu5 Gc antibodies -- an immune response that could potentially lead to chronic inflammation .
" We 've shown that tumor tissues contain much more Neu5 Gc than is usually found in normal human tissues , " Varki said in a statement .
" We therefore surmised that Neu5 Gc must somehow benefit tumors . "
Using specially bred mouse models that lacked the Neu5 Gc molecule -- mimicking humans before the molecule is absorbed into the body through ingesting red meat -- the researchers induced tumors containing Neu5 Gc , and then administered anti-Neu5 Gc antibodies to half of the mice .
In mice that were given antibodies , inflammation was induced and the tumors grew faster .
In mice that were not treated with antibodies , the tumors were less aggressive , Varki said .
The study is published online in advance of print publication in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

While traditional security software typically only inspects incoming communication and downloads for malware , a free security tool .
BotHunter instead correlates the two - way communication between vulnerable computers and hackers .
BotHunter " flips the security paradigm " by focusing on the egress , says Phillip Porras , a computer security expert at SRI International and one of its creators .
Botnets are shadowy networks of compromised computers .
Typically the PC gets infected with malware from e-mail or from visiting a compromised Web site .
The infection may linger for a while before it calls out to a command and control server which may download malware , or enlist the PC in a spam campaign or denial of service attack .
With BotHunter , a network administrator can see which system on a network is communicating with an unknown external server and quickly act to stop it .
BotHunter produces a report that lists all the relevant events and event sources that lead it to its conclusion of an infection .
There 's a score on the likelihood the match is malware .
BotHunter — an application that grew out of SRI International 's Cyber - Threat Analytics project -- differs from traditional Intrusion Detection Systems by keeping a log of the data exchanges that typically occur when a PC is infected with malware .
Simply specify the network you want to monitor , and BotHunter then listens passively , logging anonymous traffic , and occasionally sending an outbound messages to a database of adware , spyware , viruses and worms maintained by SRI International .
Currently the project is collecting 10,000 new malware data exchanges each day , according to Porras .
He said BotHunter started recognizing Conflicker data exchange patterns back in November 2008 , well before that threat was popularized by other security vendors .
Porras says both the threat database and BotHunter analysis engines are constantly checked for accuracy .
This is done by infecting SRI honeynets with known malware to see whether or not BotHunter accurately detects it .
BotHunter , which is free but not open source , works with Unix , Linux , Max OS , and Windows XP ( even on standalone desktop PCs ) .
A Windows Vista version is expected soon .
BotHunter is not intended to be a replacement for traditional security ( firewall and antivirus ) , says Porras , but a complement .
He says there have been 110,000 downloads worldwide since its release .
Porras admits there are a few Black Hats , even some White Hats , discussing online various ways to circumvent BotHunter .
For now , however , BotHunter remains a useful way to identify and therefore mitigate botware on your network or home system .

We have just released four additional AWS public data sets , and have updated another one .
In the Economics category , we have added a set of transportation databases from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics .
Data and statistics are provided for aviation , maritime , highway , transit , rail , pipeline , bike & pedestrian , and other modes of transportation , all in CSV format .
I was able to locate employment data for our hometown airline and found out that they employed 9,322 full - time and 1,122 part - time employees as of the end of 2007 .
In the Encyclopedic category , we have added access to the DBpedia Knowledge Base , the Freebase Data Dump , and the Wikipedia Extraction , or WEX .
The DBpedia Knowledge Base currently describes more than 2.6 million things including 213,000 people , 328,000 places , 57,000 music albums , 36,000 films , and 20,000 companies .
There are 274 million RDF triples in the 67 GB data set .
The 66 GB Freebase Data Dump is an open database of the world ’s information , covering millions of topics in hundreds of categories .
The Wikipedia Extraction ( WEX ) is a processed , machine - readable dump of the English - language section of the Wikipedia .
At nearly 67 GB , this is a handly and formidable data set .
The data is provided is the TSV format as exported by PostgreSQL .
Finally , we have updated the NCBI ’s Genbank data .
Weighing in at a hefty quarter of a petabyte terabyte , this public data set contains information on over 85 billion bases and 82 million sequence records .
Instantiating these data sets is basically trivial .
You create a new EBS volume of the appropriate size , basing it on the snapshot id of the data .
Next , you attach the volume to a running EC2 instance in the same availability zone .
Finally , you create a mount point and mount the EBS volume on the instance .
The last step can take a minute or two for a large volume ; the other steps are essentially instantaneous .
Instead of spending days or weeks downloading these data sets you can be up and running from a standing start in minutes .
Once again , cloud computing reduces the friction between “ I have a good idea ” and “ here ’s the realization of my idea . ”
You do n’t need loads of bandwidth , processing power , or local disk space in order to do interesting and significant work with these world - scale data sets .

The death toll in China 's coal mines last year was 91,172 , down 15.1 percent from 2007 , the State Administration of Work Safety ( SAWS ) said Tuesday .
It was the first time since 1995 the figure fell below 100,000 , the chief work safety regulator said .
The number of accidents fell 19.3 percent to 413,700 in 2008 .
The death rate in coal mine accidents , per 1 million tonnes of coal produced , dropped 20.4 percent year - on - year to 1.182 , SAWS also said .
The latter figure was previously disclosed by Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang in a teleconference earlier in January .
Zhao Tiechui , senior SAWF official in charge of coal mine supervision , attributed the improvements to government efforts to shut illegal mines and toughen enforcement .
China closed 1,054 illegal coal mines in 2008 , but government figures show almost 80 percent of the country 's 16,000 mines are illegal .
Zhao urged work safety supervisors nationwide to work harder on accident prevention this year .

Start counting the number of social media websites you have a profile with , right now .
Out of fingers yet ?
Facebook , Twitter , Flickr , and YouTube are just the start of it - for people active on social websites , you could have several dozen social media profiles , half of them using a really old picture of you .
Heck , some of them probably have inboxes filled with strange messages from some girl named " Leota " who wants you to visit her sexy singles website .
While inbox spam and old pictures may not be the end of the world , keeping up a consistent image across the web and keeping your content fresh is vital to good business and strong relationships .
With a little upfront effort , the task of maintaining multiple profiles can be less tedious , freeing up time to better connect with other people .
Step 1 . Understand your Current Position
The first step is to exactly know where you have a social media profile and where you do not .
Start by checking with Check User Names , which will search dozens of popular social media websites to see if your username is active .
Check any you normally use .
If any do n't ring any bells , see if it 's yours or if somebody already owns .
Tip : Always keep note of other people using your most common username .
Making sure people do n't confuse you for somebody else is important for friends and potential employers alike .
Step 2 . Choose Your Platforms Realistically
People may disagree with me , but I believe you should sign up for the most popular social networks regardless of whether you are going to use them all .
This prevents someone else being mistaken for you and protects an account that you may want to use later .
This does n't mean you should be active on all of these services .
Take a long , hard look at all of the services available and your time constraints and choose the ones that pique your interest the most .
Keep some focus when choosing platforms .
For the rest , place a note on your profile with contact information and links to your favorite social profiles .
Step 3 . Organize !
This is the most important step !
Do n't be satisfied with a disarray of bookmarks and email notifications .
Organize a bookmarks folder or two for the social media services you are using .
Filter your email so that all of your notifications fall into their own inbox / label .
Schedule time to log into these accounts and make sure they are in order .
Tip :
The most important thing to remember is to find a system and stick to it .
These are the profiles that need your attention consistently ; keep them free of spam and outdated information .
Step 4 . Automate and Combine Your Profiles
No , I am not suggesting using a bot or having autoresponders .
Instead , I am talking about grouping similar tasks together .
One of the most common actions on social media is sending an update that you have updated your blog .
Normally , you would have to copy and paste this type of message into Twitter , Facebook , and MySpace , not to mention Plurk , Brightkite , or FriendFeed .
However , with services such as Ping.fm and Twitterfeed , this can be done without any work on your end .
Find tools that can help you spread you reach without eating up your time .
Tip : Atomkeep is a cool tool for updating all of your social media profiles at once - it connects to your Twitter , LinkedIn , Facebook , and other accounts and allows you to change bios and profile pictures with one action .
Step 5 . Keep it Fresh
It 's easy to tell if someone has abandoned an account and left it to grow weeds .
If you intend to use a service , keep adding new content !
You can't expect to meet new people on Digg or Stumbleupon accounts without digging or stumbling .
And it can be confusing for other people if your profile has an old email address or says you 're still in a relationship with your high school sweetheart .
Tip : Use a Firefox extension like Shareaholic to help make adding new content to your profile easier .
Go Forth and Network !
Once you 're organized and understand where you really want to spend your time , managing multiple social media profiles becomes less of a chore and more about sharing experiences , discovering new content , and building new relationships .
That is why you made these profiles in the first place , right ?
Have more tips on managing multiple profiles ?
Be sure to share them in the comments .

ScrapBook to save stuff for later
For the times when you just can't blog , the next best thing to do is save what you wanted to post for later .
While a wealth of syncing or pseudo - social services like Evernote and Clipmarks offer various takes on clipping stuff to save for later , ScrapBook is one of the best simple , streamlined tools for simply getting the job done .
Implemented as a collapsible sidebar and a right - click context menu , ScrapBook allows you to drag content from a page to save for later , or simply right - click a selection for clipping as well .
A folder system allows for organization , and ScrapBook is smart about pulling down things like favicons , source URLs , and other metadata to help you identify what you got from where .
Comments can be attached to any clipped information , and everything is stored locally in a simple folder structure so you can grab it outside of Firefox if you ever need to .
Clipped stuff can be dragged from ScrapBook into a ScribeFire window for the ultimate in browser - based blogging , though the power - blogger in us is craving for a Smart Folder implementation for even more organization options .

Ads to make a buck or two
Many bloggers want the option of making money from their posts but do n't have a sales team primed to do the dirty work .
ScribeFire Quick
Ads is an advertising service built specifically for bloggers , and it allows users to place both banner ads on the site and in posts .
Using automated content analysis , Scibe Fire 's sales team works with a variety of networks to find the best ads for your site .
A solid set of reporting tools keeps you informed , and a low monthly payout minimum of $ 5 can show you the money much sooner than many of these ad networks will on their own .
We do n't recommend going hog - wild with ads scattered throughout your posts , but ScribeFire is one of the easiest services to get started with , and it 's integrated right into the Scribe Fire add -on .
Shareaholic to get the word out
For the times when you do n't have enough to say to warrant a blog post but you still want to share something , Shareaholic is probably the tool for you .
Part social sharing tool and part microblogging enabler , Shareaholic lets you easily share the current page you are looking at via social news and bookmarking sites like Digg and Delicious , but it can also post to blogging and microblogging services like Twitter , Tumblr , Facebook , and FriendFeed .
Shareaholic adds a button to both Firefox 's toolbar and context menu that makes all these social services accessible .
The add - on supports 30 services in all , and it allows you to customize which ones you actually want to use to save time .
Unfortunately , however , Shareaholic does not allow you to post to multiple services at once , though it does a good job of harnessing third - party services like URL shortening tools when necessary , such as posting a link to Twitter .
That 's it for this round of Pimp my Browser — you are now free to get blogging .
Be sure to check back for more software pimping articles in the future , as there is a lot more where this came from .

" That does n't bode well for us , boys , " Mike the horse guy says .
And I figure , Good .
All bets are off .
Clive Owen , however , is genuinely nonplussed .
He appears a kind of lookout , squinting over the top of his sunglasses , muttering a bit , lifting his lip , mouthing a single , silent word .
He 's mulling this fabulously ill - timed erection , which dips so far as to touch the ground .
There 's a Stella clamped in his left hand , racing form folded under his arm .
He 's got that Clive Owen stare going , a brooding glower , a sinister peek , the pointy end of the handsomeness spear .
And when Owen looks , when his gaze picks a subject , as it finally falls , all of its weight attaches to the moment , so it seems as though he 's gazing with the uncrowded appreciation of a junkie .
When he speaks , there 's a comma of realization before every turn of phrase , just at the mouth of every utterance , as if he were waking up in his own body just then .
This has the effect of making him seem genuinely stunned — a little hurt even — by the very circumvolutions of the human planet .
The guy studies the world before he speaks .
But just now , he seems delighted to be mute .
God help me , Clive Owen likes this horse , boner and all .
See , here 's the problem :
He 's betting with my money .
Having waited out the first four races without so much as a huff at the program , with all his handicapping acumen pent up for this , the fifth — a mile - long Group 1 tick featuring a bunch of bigwig winners from all over the continent —
Owen 's now eyeballing the even - money favorite .
And what 's worse is , he 's finger - flipping a lump of my very own cash — my cold roll , my bread and butter , my stake — in his flawless , handcrafted trouser pocket .
Eleven hundred euros for the day , which I 'd given him after the first race , figuring he'd treat it like his own — assuming he'd take a bite now and again , couple hundred here , couple hundred there , knock out a few winners , take the occasional heavy stab , box a couple of exactas , and call it a day .
No guarantees , he told me .
No problem , was my retort .
Except one .
Absolutely no payback , no reimbursement from the magazine .
My money here .
He could lose it just as well as I could , but , you know , a lot of ropes get pulled aside for a movie star — they get tips .
I had it figured as a kind of edge .
And he Chunneled his ass all the way from London with his very own wiseguy , Mike , a big , mustached equine mensch , who knew every jockey and trainer in the joint .
Clive Owen was the inside man .
How bad could the bleeding get ?
I 'd get nine races out of it , glom on to the tips he got from every trainer and jockey who wanted a howdy - do from a celebrity before a race , then — worst case — walk away with a couple hundred left over to buy some perfume for my girlfriend at the duty - free .
Best case , he turns out to be a savvy high roller , and I wakeboard his winnings , triple my money , and split the profits , even if I was just the pocket change of his action , a pop - gun echo of his betting success .
And now , here he was , Clive Owen , forty - four , the cagey doctor in Closer , the worn - out savior of the human race in Children of Men , and , now , the intrepid Interpol agent in The International , about to lay it all , every vile little euro- penny , on one race , on the horse with the hard - on : Henrythenavigator .
One bet .
It 's giving me the big - time willies .
Then Owen speaks , voice cold and sandy as a beach road in winter , tilting his head , asking his horse guy for a little heads - up : " How 's that , Mike ? "
" His mind 's not on the race , is it ? "
Mike says .
Owen is shoulder to shoulder with me , speaking out of the side of his mouth , not twenty yards from our horse .
Behind us ,
Mike the horse guy offers his gems , then murmurs into the guts of his cell phone , doing who knows what — pulling his bets on the other side of the Channel , raising the alarm for his slag buddies at the bookmaker 's shop in Dublin or wherever .
Everyone in the racing world gets the word .
The horse has a hard - on .
Kill the action .
But Owen does n't seem to register .
" A horse can't run on five legs , now can it ? "
Mike snorts .
Then we 're all laughing .
The jockey pads by , reaches a hand out to Owen .
" How are things , then ? "
Clive says .
The rider looks up — because Owen is long in the bone , light but not without heft — and grimaces , ekes out a smile , looking just a little sick .
The guy is blown up so tight , you could pop him with a pin .
" You know , " he says .
" It 's just comply or die . "
Now me , I 'm almost looking for bad signs , and this can't be good .
I 'm thinking Owen will see it too and drop this harebrained , all - or - nothing bet .
Even money , my ass .
Mike the horse guy picks up on the jockey 's anxiety .
He takes in a breath , holds up his phone as if it were an idea , and says , " Let me see what I can find out . "
But Owen laughs , the weightless , overloud delight of a guy who likes every detail of the world .
" Good luck , then , " he says , patting the jockey on the shoulder .
Good luck ?
Is n't it bad luck to say " good luck " to a jockey ?
It 's a jinx , I 'm thinking .
Rejinx .
Double jinx .
Owen stares at the little guy as he walks away and does an admiring headshake , as if staring at Jordan striding up the stadium tunnel for the last time .
He 's got this thing with sports , this deep bond with the spectacle , which brings out both the boy in him and the reflective citizen .
He does not mind showing awe .
" I had to ride a horse once , " he says .
" In King Arthur .
I said I could ride , but I had to call for lessons on the day the deal was signed .
I started out on this little chunky thing and slowly moved up .
It was months of work .
On the first day , the director chose a horse for me and it was this big Arabian , well bigger than anything I 'd ridden , with this clop , clop , clop walk .
Bigger than any horse I 've ever seen really .
Christ , it was intimidating .
First day I had to gallop across a field in full profile .
You do it .
You have to .
Big , big horse . "
Nine minutes to post now .
All eyes are on Henrythenavigator .
He 's a big horse , too .
The air is cool , but there is a shaft of sun cracking through the moldering French clouds .
The track is a little wet .
It seems that Clive Owen likes this horse , boner and all .
He says , " You want a drink then , Tom ? "
Marc Hom
I liked French Charm .
I really did .
In the first race .
But when Owen and I met , it was five minutes to post , and I could n't get him to pay attention to my prognostications as he ambled out of the VIP entrance and handed me my clubhouse badge .
Black suit and tie , undershaved , smiling .
He looked me up and down , noted that I carried no umbrella despite the threat of rain , saw my tip sheet peeking out from my coat pocket , my own wobbly translations scrabbled around the edges .
" Well , you 're all set , " he said , turning on his heels , smiling broadly , using his eyes like a line to pull me to shore .
There he was .
Three - thousand - dollar suit hanging on him like a curtain of God .
Clive put a hand on my shoulder immediately , and when I demurred , when I asked , " Do I need a tie ? " in the rarefied air of the owners ' box , he wrinkled his brow as if he were actually fond of me , this within thirty seconds of laying eyes on my corpulent , ragged form , and said , " No , but you might need a whisky , though .
Let 's have a go . "
This is what guys do at the track , vest themselves in one another 's company .
Inside the gate , I handed him my roll .
He introduced me to Mike the horse guy , a real operator , a guy in the know in the upper- echelon European racing scene .
Right away I urged Owen toward an 8 — 4 box in the first ( the bettor picks the first and second horses to finish the race , in either order ) , French Charm and Palme Royal .
Mike squinted and shook his head .
And Owen wanted nothing to do with it .
" I 'm not here to bet on a maiden race , " he said .
" None of these horses has ever won a thing .
That 'd be throwing your money to the wind .
I want to respect you .
I 've got to do you a service here , do n't I ? "
He tapped the cash in the middle of his palm .
" I 've got to respect the sum . "
When Palme Royal edged French Charm , after I spot - on called the race , I was not saying one damned thing .
Even a monkey can smoke out an exacta once in a while .
But I did want to meet his eyes , to register that I had called it .
The thing about looking at Clive Owen is this :
There is an immutable openheartedness to his face — fearless , not fawning — in the way he looks back at you .
He looks like he belongs .
He does n't screen out a thing ; he does n't fear .
I like foolish ego .
In the second .
And despite the fact that I make a case for the horse wearing beigeun losange et gros - bleu , Owen still wo n't bet .
He 's only interested in Mike getting us into the paddock to get an early look at Henrythenavigator .
We amble from one spot to the next , up into the broadly empty loge section of the grandstand , then back down into the splendid oasis of the dressing area .
I 'm strolling with a guy who has a serious amount of my money , while I 'm calling winners and knowing damned well he's not going to make a bet — which , of course , means Foolish Ego should be a lock .
She wins , too , going away .
" Nice , nice call , Tom , " Owen says .
No shit , Clive .
There were two options for a writer to see Clive Owen stripped to his passions : this or soccer .
But one of those would mean going to a soccer game , and really , that 's like visiting an oil refinery .
It 's loud , it 's big , and it smells .
Some people do think soccer is important , Clive Owen certainly being one .
He 's a straight nut for the Liverpool red-and - white ; it 's a condition of being him .
" It 's questionable , really .
A man caring so much about a team , " he says .
" It puzzles my wife , my stubbornness in this .
I think she wonders why men care so much about a game .
She wonders what the world would be like if they put their energy into something that means something . "
He raises his eyebrows on this last little couplet , rolling the weight of the words , considering the possibility .
" She makes room for it .
My whole family does .
I 'm at it in front of the television , on satellite , and I 'm very loud , thrashing about .
That 's a pure thing , that club .
Not really explainable , really .
My family endures .
They do n't understand it . "
He thinks about it a little , casts his gaze toward the parade of horses for the second race .
And it seems to occur to him that he does n't care .
He laughs .
" But my wife 's never even been to a soccer game , so who is she to say ? "
The French do n't seem to give a shit about horse racing .
The grandstands are still unpopulated , the betting lines short .
The only real mass of people is in the paddock , and Owen shoulders right in .
No one , save the occasional newspaper photographer , seems to pay him any mind .
He turns and says , " Outside of being home with my family , I prefer a crowd .
At a soccer match , the big crowd , the singing , rocking around , it 's urgent as hell .
There 's a ritual to it .
I want to be in that mess .
And no one bothers me .
At a soccer game , everyone 's eyes are on the pitch , are n't they ?
They do n't care about some fucking movie star .
They have their eyes on the right thing .
They watch the battle . "
Marc Hom
I like Battle Paint .
In the third .
But Owen and I sit this one out , too , nestling into the top of the owners ' box , while Mike goes to scout the late developments on Henrythenavigator .
I recall that I 've seen some of this before , some version of this version of Clive Owen .
There 's an otherwise forgettable scene in Alfonso Cuarón 's Children of Men in which Owen 's character ends up at the dog track .
Dogs make light progress around a track , and there is no sound except the great exaggerated pant of humanity , everyone pulling for a number .
Come on , come on , hold on .
And as the greyhounds near the finish line , the camera pans up the grandstand to Owen , eyes blank and receptive as a dinner plate , who grips his winning ticket in desperation 's fist .
He wins , but he looks for all the world like a loser .
I remember thinking , That 's not all acting .
He 's a track guy .
No wonder they always put him in a trench coat , set him on a half - beard , let him loose , out to wander the world in a haze of anger and defeat .
In Closer , the anomalously moral masterpiece , it 's a trench coat , the half - beard , and the simmering promise of ferocity .
In Shoot ' Em Up , an overstylized suckfest , it 's the trench coat , the half - beard , and a look of professional confusion .
Now in The International , we get the trench coat , the half - beard , and a dark steel cable of retribution stretching from New York to Istanbul .
All this might make him seem humorless and invulnerable .
But it 's just that he does n't access his feelings when you ask him about movies .
They 're tasks for him .
" I do a lot better if I sit around and think about a character for a couple of months , " he says .
" Before I climb into him for a run , I 've just sat on my ass thinking about him , just reading , plodding around my house , driving my girls to school , fixing eggs .
Like that .
There 's not a lot of transformation in it .
I 'm still just a driver to my children . "
Mike Nichols , who directed Closer , thinks of it as a sort of ruddy professionalism .
" Clive 's the best example of the actor stripped of the cum- Strasberg , cum - Actors - Studio torture of emotion , " he says .
" Here 's a guy who comes to work , gets his coffee , knows his lines .
Then someone will say ' Action , ' he 'll terrify everyone in the room , then we cut , and he picks up his coffee again .
It 's a job .
" Clive is full of feeling , do n't get me wrong .
But what you see onscreen , that rises out of the components of the job , and he does each of them superbly .
It just does n't occur to him to feel the part in advance of doing it .
British actors are utterly different animals .
You talk to a British actor and he 'll tell you about the night before very matter - of - factly : ' I fucked her three times . '
They do n't care about your reaction .
And you 'll say , ' Hmm , you fucked her three times .
How did it feel ? ' and they 'll be blank .
' Feel ?
Feel ?
What 's feeling got to do with it ? '
They do n't cart around their emotions about the job .
They have lives .
Clive has to go home at the end of the day , he has his family .
That 's where his feeling resides . "
This is how it works .
Ask Owen a fairly banal question — why did he choose The International ? , which I did during the third race , even as Battle Paint , my latest pick that Owen did n't bet on , bore down on the wire — and there 's a gear - and - tackle sensibility to his answer :
He wanted to work with the director , Tom Tykwer , who directed the frenetic Run Lola Run .
" That 's as plain as it is , " he says .
This seems like less than an answer , like maybe he 's begging off the movie in some way .
" It 's really the era of directors right now . "
The horses finish .
" I also like Berlin .
It 's a young city , despite everything .
A lot of artists .
I wanted to be there for a while . "
He points to the track .
Battle Paint has faded .
" Was that your horse ? "
" It would have been my horse if we'd bet it , " I say .
At a track , every minute between races is a chance for either knowledge or action .
You seek out a tip , scrub through the form for insight , or make your way to the window .
You do n't amble .
There are no breezy , carefree strolls at a track , unless , it seems , you are Clive Owen , who does n't even want a glance at the tip sheet as we return to the saddle ring .
I can't figure this guy .
I mean , we 're three races in .
I 'd rather he lose my money than sit on it .
Maybe he 's absorbing the undercharged atmosphere , the overly cool , enervated energy of the French .
He walks with his hands in his pockets , raising an eyebrow now and again , talking about the races in Ireland .
" It 's not one bit like this , " he says , scanning the sparse crowd .
" It 's packed out , for one thing .
Everyone there 's got a stake , everyone is pressing in for a look at the horses . "
Owen agrees to an interview with a French television crew that spots him .
He discusses the weather , looking elegantly dispossessed , as if he had just found himself at the track by accident .
It is a kind of style .
He is cool .
" George Clooney is obsessed with Clive , " says Julia Roberts , who stars with Owen in the upcoming Duplicity , as she did in Closer in 2004 .
" Every good - guy actor talks about Clive as one of their very favorites .
Because he 's English , because his successes have stood on the shoulders of his talents alone , because he has n't just been carried away by popular culture .
He 's almost the most free of all of those guys .
People just allow him to do what he does . "
Is he a little trapped by the brooding , the trench coat , the half - beard ?
A long , long pause .
" I do n't think there 's anything about Clive that seems trapped to me , " she says .
" The only surprise about Clive was how absolutely ferocious he could be on camera .
When we shot Closer , he used to make me cry .
He 's a kind of emotional terrorist , so vicious .
The thing about Clive is the happiness and security he has in real life is what allows him to go into a room and grab everyone 's attention effortlessly .
The secret is , everyone is really attracted to contentment . "
Marc Hom
I like Soul City .
In the fourth .
I want Owen to make this bet , so as soon as he breaks away from the television crew , I pile up the reasons :
This is Paris , a kind of soul city .
Soul City sounds like Sin City , a movie he was in .
He laughs that big loose - jawed laugh you see only once in a while in his movies .
He 's legitimately capable of showing happiness , even on a drizzly afternoon in a city far from his family .
" Here we are , " I say , " doing a little soul - searching at the track .
You have to show me a little soul . "
I feel like I 'm begging my dad for the keys to his Buick .
It 's cracking him up .
Going in , I 'd assumed he'd be a brooding , distant presence .
I 'd assumed Mike the horse guy was there to run interference ; movie stars do that with writers .
I 'd expected to find Clive Owen fixed in a glower .
But Owen is laughing openly at my tropes about the soul .
" You think I 'm showing you my soul ? " he says .
" That 's ugly business . "
He laughs .
" Not a chance you 'll see my soul .
Give that thought right up . "
" It 's an Irish horse , " I say , groping for some cross -Channel pride .
Owen is Welsh .
" I 'm hitting like mad , " I say .
" Just throw down a hundred . "
Owen looks over my shoulder at the racing form , this great wash of four - point - font French .
It 's clear to me that he 's looking at this as a job , too , this betting with the writer 's money .
He takes it seriously .
He 's prowling the paddock , pressing in , asking the horse 's owner , asking the trainer , asking Mike what 's the best plan .
He slides from one end to the other ; he belongs .
I 'm begging Clive Owen to pay attention to me .
I like Soul City .
" Hedge it , then ? " he says .
Yeah .
Sure .
Lose and you can put an even thousand on Henrythestinkingnavigator .
Either way it will be a large chunk .
" I do n't know , " he says .
" I do n't favor hedging much , " he says .
" I do n't want to take the focus off our task . "
He hooks a thumb over his shoulder , gesturing toward the paddock where we just left Henrythenavigator , glancing down at us all bug - eyed and scary .
" You are cracking the picks , " he says , mulling .
" Just a hundred , " I say .
" Soul City in the fourth . "
Mike the horse guy shrugs .
A hundred - euro bet is like a bug on the bus window to him .
" The owner said strong , " he says .
" That 's not so bad to me . "
Owen nods .
All right , then .
He tiptoes himself upward , looks for a window , then wades into the crowd .
When he returns , he 's got the ticket — a hundred euros on Soul City to win — between two fingers , wrapped around a beer for each of us .
Good guy .
Four minutes to post .
He 's smiling broadly , sipping his beer , looking upward , and the sun creeps in a bit .
" We should go have a look , Tom , " he says .
Minutes later , we 're in the loge , just the three of us .
As Soul City comes down the pipe , Clive and I start beating the seats in front of us — " Come on , come on " — until it hits the pole , and we start cheering , really whacking each other on the shoulders , and he 's a strong guy , and the horses press on , but Mike stays focused — Owen and I are looking at the wrong marker .
" Next pole , next pole ! "
Mike says to us .
Owen and I look to each other in an unwitnessed double take and chime in , shouting , " Next pole , next pole ! "
And Soul City hangs in there .
Pays 3 1/2 to 1 .
Owen shakes my hand , as if the whole thing were my doing .
" Well done .
You should have got a piece of that , Mike , " he says , nudging my shoulder .
Mike lifts his cell phone and shrugs , giving nothing away .
I do n't like Henrythenavigator .
Owen sure does .
I do n't like the deferential treatment , the cool buzz that runs through the heretofore somnambulant French gallery .
I like Goldikova , the Irish horse , who 's the other hot ride in the fifth .
Henrythenavigator is a Breeders ' Cup selection .
He 's won four straight Group 1 races .
Of course they 're all here to see him .
Of course they 'd come all that way to have a look .
I wonder if maybe they 're both going to bet a boatload of money on this horse , Clive and Mike , and that my thousand euros is mere pocket change to them .
Owen has n't once even looked at the money I gave him nor seemed to care about the tips I provided .
His face — shit , that could be happiness , that could be fear .
He 's either amused or feeling trapped .
He could be about to blow up or about to blow away home .
He 's giving nothing away .
Spike Lee , who directed him in Inside Man , told me about the power of that face : " I used Clive because he's one of the only actors that Denzel Washington can't mow down .
He just stood right up to him .
Clive 's number - one thing was , how long did he have to have the mask on ?
You know , I could n't blame him .
The face is his instrument .
And Denzel , he did n't much like the mask , either .
It was hard for him to do a scene where Clive 's face is covered .
Clive is a lot to react to , you know ? "
The trainer lays his saddle blanket over the horse 's back like a priest 's vestments , keeps his hands on the horse 's shoulder and hindquarter to calm it .
He holds that position for a minute until I realize I 'm watching some kind of Irish horse whisperer .
That 's when I have an epiphany : Owen 's money is already down .
Son of a bitch .
" Did you lay your own money on this race ? " I say .
" How big ? " Clive Owen looks at me with a flinty cast .
And the sentiment is cold and still somehow friendly ; it is obvious and at the same time startling .
" Now , " he says , " I 'm not ever going to tell you that , am I ? "
It 's then I see that his breeziness has been an act .
He was focused .
Even with my money .
Biding his time for only this .
" Christ , you have a big bet down , do n't you ? " I say .
Clive Owen 's smile is a brilliant camouflage .
It 's as if someone is shining a light in my eyes .
New version : the scary one .
The emotional terrorist .
" Mike made the bet already , " he says .
" He phoned it in for us . "
And my grand , well , that just went along for the ride .
Fair enough , I think .
Action is action .
Then the reaction ripples through the crowd at the sight of the troublesome horse joint .
Mike starts groaning at the sight of the weighty tumescence .
Owen bites down on a grin or a curse , looks at me , and raises his eyebrows comically high .
He is n't backing down .
" We 're all in , " he says .
" It 's the way we 've been going since we got here , is n't it ?
I mean , we came to bet on the horse . "
( This horse , incidentally , would come in fifth .
Fifth . )
The horse has a hard - on .
Twelve minutes from post , and I 'm thinking three words : can't be good .
There 's three of us , betting the horses at Longchamp .
" That does n't bode well for us , boys , " Mike the horse guy says .
And I figure , Good .
All bets are off .
But the bet , Owen tells me , is still on .

Easter is a fantastic time .
Not only is it the most important Christian religious festival , Spring brings such a feeling of hope and optimism .
The days are getting longer ( particularly important if you live in Northern climes where the days are very short and the nights very long and dark in the Winter ) and everything is just beginning to awaken .
The grass is beginning to grow again , birds are out and about , flowers are poking their heads through , new animals are being born , and the sun is beginning to have some actual warmth in it for the first time for months .
And it ’s some great time off to spend with the family .
In the UK , Good Friday and Easter Monday are both Bank Holidays or Public Holidays and Maundy Thursday is not a very serious work day – a lot of people either wo n’t work on that day or will only work a half day .
It just means it ’s a great chunk of time for a family to spend together .
In these tight financial times , we do n’t want to be spending too much money to have fun , and it's not necessary , either .
There are lots of great family activities which wo n't break the bank .
We are all responsible for the events that are shaping our destiny , and unfortunately , we have allowed tyranny , hate & conflict rule our lives .
This is surely not the right path , no matter what nationality or religion we have .
Goodness is at home ; it is we who have gone out for a walk .

Mobile County Circuit Judge Herman Thomas Allegation :
The judge would ask the young men to drop their pants and prepare to be spanked Authorities investigating paddling allegations against Judge Herman Thomas .
New accusations emerge as suspended jurist prepares to face ethics trial Authorities are investigating allegations that now - suspended Mobile County Circuit Judge Herman Thomas periodically removed prisoners from Mobile County Metro Jail and spanked them in a room at the courthouse , according to courthouse sources involved in the inquiry .
Once inside the room , according to the sources , the judge would ask the young men to drop their pants and prepare to be spanked with what they described as a wooden or fraternity - like paddle .
These new allegations arise as Thomas prepares for an Oct. 29 ethics trial in Montgomery that could permanently remove him from the bench .
When contacted by telephone Tuesday by the Press - Register and asked about the alleged spanking episodes , Thomas simply said , " This is news to me .
I do n't have any comment . "
According to sources , between a half - dozen and a dozen young men have shared their accounts with officials .
The Press - Register could not determine whether any of the young men knew each other or knew of the others ' allegations .
Judges , prosecutors and police officers are often favorite targets of defendants and convicted criminals who make accusations in order to try to get themselves out of legal trouble .
At least one young man has alleged that as a prelude to the paddling , Thomas told him that if he had been spanked when he was a child , he would not have found himself in jail later , according to one of the newspaper 's sources .
Investigating officials were able to reconcile jail logs noting when Thomas removed the young men from Metro Jail and when he returned them to custody later , sources said .
Not all of the young men making the allegations were in jail when they had their encounters with Thomas , according to the sources .
At least one of Thomas ' accusers told authorities he was out of Metro Jail when the judge summoned him to the courthouse on a Sunday night .
In August , according to sources , a room matching descriptions provided by some of the young men was located just off a corridor that leads to the jury room connected to Thomas ' courtroom .
Thomas ' official chambers and offices can be reached through a door behind his courtroom bench .
The Press - Register was shown the small room in late August .
When asked about it Tuesday by a reporter , Thomas had no comment .
The room is about 6 feet by 8 feet , appearing better suited for storage than for use as an office .
Some sections of the courthouse 's sixth and eighth floors in the north tower of Mobile Government Plaza were built in a layout similar to Thomas ' section .
And some of the corresponding small rooms in those other sections are used for storage , while others sit empty .
Some judges on the circuit bench have said they were not aware of these small rooms , and none said that the rooms in their own sections , or anywhere else at the courthouse , were used as extra offices .
But the small room in Thomas ' section appeared to be an office .
The walls were covered with framed pictures , awards and certificates received by the judge .
Family pictures also sat in a tall , narrow bookcase that held law books and other documents .
A huge desk dominated the room , and behind it was a well - worn leather chair with a high back .
Just to the right was an adjustable secretary 's chair , its seat cranked down low , about a foot from the floor .
According to sources , sometime after Thomas came aboard as a circuit judge , he changed the locks and occupied the room .
It was unclear how many others on Thomas ' staff may have known about it .
Thomas , on the circuit bench since 1999 and before that a District Court judge beginning in 1995 , became the subject of an investigation by Alabama 's Judicial Inquiry Commission last fall .
The first set of complaints against Thomas included allegations that he helped his cousin , former school board member David Thomas Jr. , substitute a week - long criminal sentence in the overcrowded Metro Jail for the less - crowded Prichard Jail .
After the change in jail venue was exposed , David Thomas was forced by Circuit Judge Joseph " Rusty " Johnston to spend another week in jail , this time at Metro .
Those complaints and others resulted in Judge Thomas ' suspension from the bench earlier this year .
A second wave of ethical questions against him appeared in the summer -- bringing the number of complaints to 30 .
The later allegations accused Thomas of usurping cases from his fellow judges on the circuit bench and , in some cases , changing sentences to less severe penalties .

What was Europe like , linguistically speaking , between the end of the last ice age and the coming of the Indo - European languages ?
This question has been in the background of many Language Log posts over the years .
Not long ago , in the hallway between our offices , I asked Don Ringe for a summary of the state of knowledge on this issue .
His response was so interesting — as conversations with Don generally are — that I asked him if he'd write something for Language Log on the topic .
The result is below .
[ Guest post by Don Ringe ]
How to solve the problem .
What the languages of prehistoric Europe might have been like has recently become a focus of renewed interest .
Most people seem to assume that we can do no better than speculate .
But we can do better , because all the historical sciences , including historical linguistics , have a basic tool for investigating the unobservable past : the Uniformitarian Principle ( UP ) .
The basic idea behind the UP is that the unobservable past must have been like the observable present , insofar as relevant conditions have not changed in the meantime .
( The proviso is very important ; see further below . )
For linguistics the UP can be stated more precisely as follows :
Unless we can demonstrate significant changes in the conditions of language acquisition and use between some time in the unobservable past and the present , we must assume that the same types and distributions of structures , variation , changes , etc. existed at that time in the past as in the present .
We use the UP to interpret the linguistic documents of the past , which are always less precise , detailed , and comprehensive than modern data , in terms of what we know about modern languages that have been described scientifically ; and we also use the UP to extrapolate from the documented past into prehistory , and across gaps in the historical record .
But the qualification in the UP — that conditions have to remain comparable — is crucial , and never more so than in the case of Europe .
Conditions in Europe have obviously changed radically over the past three millennia .
True , one ’s native language is still learned in the first few years of life , and is still learned from parents , caregivers , and older playmates ; that ’s clearly been true since language became a universal characteristic of our species , probably at least 100,000 years ago .
And it ’s still true that language is most often used to communicate with and express solidarity with one ’s family , friends , and neighbors .
But everything else has changed .
Most Europeans now live in powerful states that insist on the use of one or two languages throughout their territories ; that ’s the main reason why most local languages like Occitan and Breton are slowly dying out .
Moreover , most of those states officially recognize only one dialect of each of their official languages — a “ standard ” dialect .
Government ministers , people in the media , and other important people all speak the same dialect in public , and that is the one dialect that everyone is exposed to and taught to think of as “ correct ” .
Many Europeans talk regularly to people outside their own communities , and when they do , they typically use one of the standard dialects .
In some countries there are educated people whose native dialect is the standard dialect .
All these phenomena have contributed to a dramatic linguistic homogenization of the European continent .
None of these state - related conditions can possibly have existed in the pre-state societies of the European Iron Age and earlier .
It follows that modern Europe is not an appropriate model for applying the UP to prehistoric Europe ; we need a model that approximates prehistoric conditions in Europe much better .
In fact such a model already exists .
Johanna Nichols ’ groundbreaking article on linguistic diversity ( Nichols 1990 ) is based on an exhaustive worldwide survey of languages and families at the time of first sustained European contact during the colonial expansion of European empires .
At that time much of the world — most of the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa , Australasia , Oceania , the Southeast Asian highlands , Siberia — harbored only pre-state societies , or states which were too small or too weak to impose any significant linguistic homogenization on extensive populations .
Nichols ’ results , used with care , thus provide a suitable model from which to deduce the linguistic situation in prehistoric Europe by use of the UP .
Pre-state patterns of language diversity .
The basic fact of pre-state language distribution is that no single language can occupy , for more than a few centuries , an area too large for all its native speakers to communicate with each other regularly .
The reasons for that are simple and obvious .
All languages change , slowly but steadily , over time .
Each change originates in a small part of the speaking population and spreads outward through the speech community .
( See e.g . Labov 2001 for an in - depth discussion of this process as actually observed in contemporary language communities . )
Many changes either spread through the entire community over two or three generations or are suppressed by social “ stigmatization ” ; some are accepted by some parts of the community but not by others , creating “ dialect ” differences within the broader speech community .
But if parts of the speech community cease to communicate altogether , or communicate so rarely that they have no incentive to imitate each others ’ speech , changes cannot spread from one to another ; different changes will accumulate on either side of the linguistic barrier , and within a thousand years , at most , a single language will have become two or more .
( For a discussion of this process in detail see e.g. Ross 1997 . )
Thus in pre-state communities every language spread automatically results in language fragmentation .
Of course not all the fragments survive ; pre-state language communities sometimes gradually abandon their native language and adopt the language of another community with which they are in intimate contact , as linguists working in the highlands of New Guinea have observed ( Foley 1986:24 - 5 ) .
But the fragments that do survive continue to diverge , century after century , until the original connections between them can no longer be discovered with any certainty .
Extensive structural convergence of languages , as opposed to mere word - borrowing or the adoption of a few superficial traits , turns out to be rare , evidently because of the way native languages are learned ( see e.g . Fantini 1985 , Meisel 1989 with references , Bhatia and Ritchie 1999:574- 5 ) ; divergence or death is the normal fate of languages .
( By contrast , dialects that are mutually intelligible can and do merge ; but that does n’t decrease linguistic diversity very much . )
The result is a diversity not only of languages , but also of language families , within a pre-state geographical area of any significant size .
But not all pre-state areas are equally diverse linguistically ; that was one of the many interesting findings of Nichols 1990 .
Her discussion of the patterns and causes of linguistic diversity ( Nichols 1990:477-94 ) is worth reading in detail , but some of the basic principles underlying the patterns are most relevant here .
In the following discussion note that “ lineages ” refers to genetic units of any size — languages , obvious families ( such as Germanic or Romance or Slavic ) , or “ stocks ” ( differentiated families of the largest size discoverable by scientific methods , such as Indo - European ) ; it is assumed that comparisons will be made between comparable units in evaluating an area ’s linguistic diversity .
The following general principles hold :
“ Other things being equal , density of lineages is substantially greater at low latitudes than at high latitudes . ” ( Nichols 1990:484 )
“ Other things being equal , the coastal area of a continent will generally have substantially greater lineage density than the interior .
Not every coastal area is high in lineage density , but the extensive areas of high density are all on or near coastlines . …
[ Because of its richer resources , the ] seacoast offers the possibility of economic self - sufficiency for a small group occupying a small territory . ” ( ibid. pp. 484-5 )
“ The discrepancy in the lineage density of coastline and interior is most pronounced where the interior is relatively dry … . ( ibid. p. 485 )
“ The cause of high lineage density in mountain areas is generally attributed to the fact that mountainous geography naturally isolates populations , resists large - scale economic integration , and creates refuge zones . ” ( ibid. p. 485 )
“ Density of lineages is low in areas dominated by large - scale economies ,
higher in areas with smaller - scale economies .
…
Reduction of lineage
density in response to increased scale of economy is not immediate , as
shown by the ancient Near East . ” ( ibid. p. 486 )
As Nichols herself notes ( p. 488 ) , it all boils down to scale of economy : in areas where a small group can support itself in a small area , small groups do exactly that , and over time their languages steadily diverge ; in areas in which populations must range over a large area in order to survive , we find lineages occupying correspondingly larger areas — though the languages in question are not necessarily spoken by larger populations .
Not surprisingly , “ [ w ] hen a language or family is distributed over an area favoring high den­sity and one favoring low density , we can expect to see corresponding changes in the rate or geographical scale of differentiation ” ( Nichols 1990:488 - 9 ) , and Nichols adduces some examples of language families which are “ compressed ” near a coast but “ elon­gated ” in the interior ( ibid. p. 489 ) .
In prehistoric Europe , then , we should expect to find the following pattern of languages and families , roughly speaking :
numerous languages , belonging to many families not provably related to each other , in the Mediterranean coastal zone , including virtually all of Greece and Italy ;
somewhat less , but still notable , diversity along the cooler Atlantic coast , including the British isles ;
still less diversity in the interior of the continent ( though not markedly less , given the adequate rainfall that Europe enjoys ) — except probably for the Alps and the mountainous parts of the Balkan peninsula , which are likely to have been refugia for small and linguistically diverse populations , much like the modern Caucasus ;
fairly little diversity in Scandinavia — though probably not less than exists today , with two different language families belonging to different stocks (! ) .
How does this compare with what we actually know about the distribution of languages in Europe at the dawn of history ?
Attested languages in early Europe .
Most of the information that we possess about European languages before the Roman period comes from the Mediterranean area , simply because writing was adopted much earlier in the Mediterranean basin than elsewhere .
The following languages are securely attested ( see e.g . Vetter 1953 , Buck 1955 , Lejeune 1971 , 1974 , Prosdocimi 1978 , Poultney 1979 , Untermann 1980 , 2001 , Duval 1985 , Marinetti 1985 , Eska 1989 , Rix 1998 , Bonfante and Bonfante 2002 , Wallace 2007 , and many of the articles in Woodard 2004 ) .
Indo -European ( IE ) languages : Greek , splintered into about two dozen ( known ) dialects , in Greece , the Aegean islands , and areas further east ( the Asia Minor seaboard , Pamphylia , Cyprus ) ; clearly one language , very different from all others ;
Messapic , in southeastern Italy , largely uninterpretable but with proper names exhibiting IE nominal morphology ;
Venetic , in the lowlands of northeastern Italy ;
the Italic subfamily , divided into two divergent branches : Latino - Faliscan , including Latin , originally confined to Latium , and Faliscan , spoken at Falerii on the upper Tiber ( surrounded by Etruscan territory ) ; Sabellian , including South Picene , east of the Appennines , and a dialect continuum from Oscan in the south through the hill dialects east of Rome to Umbrian , as well as a poorly attested dialect spoken in Campania before the Samnite invasion which might or might not have been part of the same dialect continuum ; Sicel , poorly attested from Sicily , might also have been an Italic language ( Vetter 1953:359-60 ) ; it was clearly an IE language ;
the Celtic subfamily , represented by Hispano - Celtic ( Celtiberian ) in northeastern Spain ; Cisalpine Celtic ( Lepontic ) around the lakes of northern Italy , and Trans - alpine Celtic ( Gaulish ) in what is now France , which may or may not have been dialects of a single language .
The language of the Linear A script , uninterpretable but clearly neither IE nor Semitic ( Packard 1974 ) , sometimes called “ Minoan ” .
The language of some uninterpretable inscriptions in the Greek alphabet from eastern Crete ( Guarducci 1942:137-42 ) , sometimes called “ Eteocretan ” .
Elymian , known from some coins and epigraphical fragments from Sicily , with apparently non-IE nominal morphology .
Tyrrhenian languages ( Rix 1998 ) : Etruscan , which is fairly well attested but of which only some words and some points of grammar are understood ;
Lemnian , attested chiefly on a 6th - century BCE stele from Lemnos in the north - eastern Aegean , which resembles Etruscan in some detail ;
possibly Raetic , in the valley of the upper Adige in northeastern Italy , which bears a less obvious resemblance to Etruscan .
The language of the stele of Novilara ( east of San Marino ) and a few other fragments ( see Poultney 1979 , whose suggestion that the language is IE is not very convincing ) .
Iberian , attested in inscriptions throughout southern and eastern Spain ; attempts to link it with any other language , including Basque , have not succeeded ( cf. Untermann 2001:27 ) .
Tartessian , known from 78 stelae of unknown function found in southwestern Iberia ( see Untermann 2001:28 - 32 ) .
To these we must add Basque , which , though it happens not to have been written so early , must have occupied an area including that in which it is still spoken .
On the level of languages , and even on the level of obvious language families ( Italic , Celtic , Tyrrhenian ) , this is the kind of diversity we expect to have existed in the prehistoric Mediterranean : one substantial family ( Italic ) , two smaller ones , and nine or ten languages that do not belong to any of them .
The only other observation that needs to be made is that the record is certainly incomplete : we might reasonably expect there to have been quite a few other contemporary languages that were never recorded , for instance in the Alps , in Liguria , along the Dalmatian coast , and on Corsica , Sardinia , Malta , the Balearic islands , etc .
In one respect , however , the situation just described cannot be the same as it was in , say , 3000 BCE : far too many of the obvious families and more isolated languages belong to a single stock , IE .
The multiple branching structure of the IE family is very untypical .
Nichols ’ assessment of the structure of linguistic “ family trees ” worldwide is worth quoting at some length :
… most branchings are binary , and the usual result of branchings over time is the survival of one to three families per stock ; isolates and one - branch stocks are common , representing over half of the total lineages .
Groupings with three or more branchings are not uncommon , but for the most part they represent relatively recent splits at the family level or lower . …
[ M ] ore elaborate splits may be fairly common , but over time some consolidation and / or extinction takes place to reduce the survival rate . …
There are two conspicuous counterexamples in my database , ancient groups with elaborate first - order branchings : Indo -European and Afro-Asiatic . …
These are groups whose breakup and spread were precipitated by the development of nomadic or seminomadic stock breeding , which rapidly increased the scale of the economy .
( Nichols 1990:489 )
We will need to discuss the IE family at length below .
For the moment the important point is that the spread of IE languages cannot be expected to have any parallels in the older prehistory of Europe .
Before the arrival of speakers of IE languages in the Medi­terranean , the linguistic situation must have been even more diverse ; a reasonable estimate would be more than thirty languages — possibly many more — grouped into more than twenty families belonging to at least fifteen different stocks .
Of course the rest of the continent can be expected to have been somewhat less diverse linguistically , but only somewhat less .
Given the number of areas that should have promoted modest diversity — the Atlantic coast , the Alps , the Balkans — it would be no surprise if the rest of the continent together exhibited a linguistic diversity similar to that of the Mediterranean region , with little overlap of families or stocks between the Mediterranean and the rest of the continent : perhaps sixty languages in Europe altogether , representing some forty families and thirty stocks .
This is not an extreme estimate .
Note that the archaeologist David Anthony , who is willing to contemplate “ language communities ” ( isolated languages or families of closely related languages ) spread over territories the size of Yugoslavia or even France , estimates that there must have been between twenty and forty such communities in Europe in the late Neolithic period ( Anthony 1991:196-8 ) .
In the most general terms , aboriginal Europe should have exhibited a degree of linguistic diversity comparable to that of western North America , with the Mediterranean region comparable to aboriginal California , the Atlantic coast comparable to the northwest coast of North America , and the hinterlands very roughly comparable .
( Europe might be expected to show less diversity because it is less mountainous than the interior of western North America , but more diversity because it is much less dry ; proba­bly the two factors would more or less cancel each other out . )
Of course that is not what we find today , and that is not what Europe was like even two millennia ago ; already at that time large areas were occupied by people speaking Celtic and Germanic dialects that were not very diverse , showing that they had spread over the areas they occupied relatively recently .
We need to discuss how that happened .
The spread of Indo - European languages .
Proto - Indo - European ( PIE ) was a single language for which a complex grammar and an extensive vocabulary can be reconstructed ; for a sketch of PIE see e.g. Ringe 2008:4-66 .
It follows that the speakers of PIE must have occupied a comparatively small territory .
The idea that PIE might once have been spoken over most of Europe is n’t just unlikely ; it ’s impossible , because it ’s so extravagant a violation of the UP .
Exactly when and where PIE was spoken will probably be debated forever , but David Anthony presents an overwhelmingly strong case that it must have been somewhere in the steppes north of the Black and Caspian Seas around 4000 BCE ( Anthony 2007 ; see also Mallory 1989 ) .
Much of his case is based on incontrovertible linguistic evidence .
For instance , the fact that a word for ‘ horse ’ is solidly reconstructable for PIE ( with reflexes in all the earliest - attested branches of the family , including Anatolian ) rules out Mesopotamia , Anatolia , and any forested part of Europe as the area where PIE was spoken ; the fact that words for ‘ wool ’ , ‘ yoke ’ , and ‘ thill ’ are also reconstructable for PIE , and that a word for ‘ wheel ’ is reconstructable for the last common ancestor of all the non-Anatolian branches of the family , eliminates any date much earlier than 4000 BCE .
Later dates are eliminated by the fact that , by the time we have records of them , Hittite , Vedic Sanskrit , and Greek are so different from each other that they must have been diverging for two millennia or so .
It follows that the appearance of IE languages in much of Europe at an early date must reflect a considerable spread of IE languages from their point of origin .
Many commentators , for a great variety of reasons , would like to believe that that spread occurred without any significant population movements ; but that , too , violates the UP .
It has to be remembered that those IE languages spread not as trade languages for some specialized use , but as native languages ; and all our contemporary experience shows that a language can acquire new populations of native speakers only if already existing native speakers are in intimate contact with communities speaking other languages .
One can imagine an IE language spreading from village to village through intermarriage , but if that ’s what happened , the spread must have been slow ; the frontier of IE - speaking territory might have advanced , say , a depth of six villages per century by such a process — and in the mean­time the IE language that was spreading in that area would have been diversifying into dialects and eventually fragmenting into two or more languages ( see above ) .
In some areas that could be what happened .
But there is no way that such a process could have resulted in a few closely related Celtic dialects or languages being spoken over a large continuous territory from the Atlantic seaboard to Bohemia and beyond — a situation that clearly existed around 500 BCE ( cf. Mallory 1989:95 -107 ) .
We cannot avoid the inference that there were substantial migrations of people speaking IE languages into Europe in the prehistoric period .
On the other hand , it seems impossible that the populations speaking IE languages could suddenly have become large enough to overrun vast territories and crowd out the earlier inhabitants ; that scenario probably violates the UP too .
But we do not need to posit vast folk migrations to explain the spread of IE languages .
History shows that comparatively small groups of immigrants can induce their new neighbors to adopt their language — gradually over several generations , of course — if ( 1 ) they have enough economic or political power , and ( 2 ) they can offer some important advantage to those who are willing to adopt their language .
Anthony 2007:117- 9 gives some interesting examples of such “ elite recruitment ” from the historical record .
Though the details will have differed from case to case ( and of course are unrecoverable ) , it seems clear that that was how many prehistoric IE languages spread .
The result should be that , while most Europeans ’ linguistic ancestors were speakers of PIE , many or even most of their biological ancestors at the same time depth were speakers of non-IE languages already residing in Europe .
There is no point in reviewing the spread of IE languages in detail here .
Anthony 2007:123-457 reconstructs the early stages in detail on the basis of archaeological evi­dence ; Mallory 1989:24-109 summarizes the later stages , bringing evidence of several kinds to bear .
For those who are primarily interested in IE studies , Fortson 2004 ( which is about to appear in a second , revised and expanded edition ) is an excellent introduction , and specialist works on the subject constitute an entire library .
But if you ’re interested in what Europe was like six millennia ago , that ’s all irrelevant .
What it all means .
If you ’re not used to the kind of discussion that I ’ve posted , I ’d like to make sure you take away some very general messages ; that ’s far more important than any of the details .
In the first place , if you want “ reality - based ” answers , take a scientific approach .
Science may or may not reveal the existence of an objectively real world out there , but it does give results that can be replicated and answers that can be proved by anyone who knows how the system works .
That ’s good enough for me because I think it ’s the best we can hope for .
If people find specific scientific conclusions ideologically inconvenient , that ’s their problem .
Secondly , keep constantly in mind that all human society and all human language are single phenomena with multiple instantiations that are only superficially different .
In the present context , this means that there is nothing special about Europe , and there is nothing special about IE either .
I ’ve adduced parallels for aboriginal Europe from elsewhere in the world because they are genuinely comparable .
I attribute the spread of IE languages not to any innate superiority of the languages or their speakers , but to the fact that they had more cattle , better horses , and probably better weapons .
( It ’s the same with the European colonial expansion of the 15th and 16th centuries .
Forget the supposed superiority of European ideas ; Europeans had better ships and better artillery , and some of the people they encountered did n’t have immunity to Eurasian diseases .
No other explanation for European success is necessary . )
I find it hard to see what relevance anything much earlier than the Roman Empire can have for modern Europe ; but if you ’re a European and you see things differently , maybe you should think about the following .
Unless you speak Basque , your native language was brought to where you live by immigrants — and unless you speak Greek or Irish Gaelic or Welsh , or are a native of one of a few selected provinces of Italy ( such as Tuscany or Lazio ) , they were n’t the first known immigrants , either .
Your ancestry is almost certainly mixed , possibly as mixed as mine .
( I have known ancestors from Ireland , Spain , France , the Kingdom of Hannover , the Rhineland , southern Germany , the Italian Alps , Croatia , and Serbia .
God only knows what mixture lies behind each of those lines of ancestry )
You are the product of diversity because Europe has always been diverse .

Actually that ’s a little harsh .
The Gaza ceasefire Israel just declared will last beyond January 20th .
Maybe till January 21st or even January 30th .
I call it the truce that is n’t .
Israel has announced that it will cease hostilities against Gaza .
But it wo n’t withdraw its troops until it sees that Hamas ends its rocket fire .
Hamas in turn wants nothing to do with the ceasefire though it may ratchet down its rocket fire in a tacit acceptance of the arrangement .
But if Hamas does not honor the ceasefire then we have a recipe for an open - ended Israeli occupation of Gaza .
This , in effect would mark a renunciation of Ariel Sharon ’s Gaza withdrawal and a stunning retreat from former policy .
Further , if Israel does n’t withdraw , then as occupier it will become responsible for Gaza ’s welfare as it was before it withdrew in 2005 .
If Israel occupies Gaza but ignores this responsibility then it will be further violating international law ( which has n’t seemed to make the Israeli leadership lose any sleep so far regarding other massacres that were blatant violations ) .
Even if Israel DOES withdraw from Gaza , it has made no promise to end its siege , which was the sticking point over which Hamas refused to renew the six month ceasefire .
As I ’ve said repeatedly over the past few weeks , everyone is obsessed with Israel ’s needs but very few people are giving any consideration of Gaza ’s needs .
Without this , any ceasefire is hopeless , as I fear this one is .
So it become just a matter of time before hostilities break out again .
Israel ’s chief governmental PR flack , Mark Regev did allude to the nation ’s willingness to entirely lift the Gaza siege and his conditions were interesting :
Israel said on Sunday it will be prepared to sharply increase the flow of food and medicine to Gaza if the unilateral cease - fire holds , but it ruled out fully lifting a blockade until captured Israel Defense Forces soldier Gilad Shalit is freed .
“ If the quiet holds , there will not be any problem dramatically increasing aid like food and medicine .
If this quiet holds , we will work with the international community for reconstruction , ” said Mark Regev , a spokesman for Olmert .
“ But you ca n’t have anything close to full normalization of the crossings as long as Gilad Shalit remains a hostage , ” Regev added .
If Regev was n’t just freelancing , he ’s just radically altered Israeli government policy toward Hamas , which decreed that the siege would continue as long as Hamas was in power in Gaza or it recognized Israel and ceased terror operations .
By invoking Shalit ’s release as the trigger that will lift the blockade he ’s implied the other conditions are no longer operative .
If I were Hamas I would be testing Israel ’s sincerity and Regev ’s bullshit meter to determine whether this is legitimate or not .
As for reconstruction …sure .
Israel will “ cooperate ” as much on Gaza reconstruction as it did on Lebanese reconstruction after the 2006 war .
Give me a break .
Does he really think anyone believes Israel will lift a finger for Gaza after the holy mess it ’s made ?
If you read Steven Erlanger ’s NY Times piece carefully , it adds to one ’s doubts about the efficacy of this negotiation process .
He writes about the agreement Livni and Rice signed in Washington two days ago :
… The United States and Israel signed a “ memorandum of understanding ” on Friday in Washington that calls for expanded cooperation to prevent Hamas from rearming through Egypt .
The agreement , which is vague , promises increased American technical assistance and international monitors , presumably to be based in Egypt , to crack down on the smuggling .
Erlanger notes that Egypt , on whose territory the observers are supposed to be based , has rejected the notion of foreigners monitoring its territory .
So precisely how is this supposed to work ?
The answer the reporter provides is that the Egyptians have supposedly impressed on the U.S. that they feel a “ new seriousness ” about monitoring their border with Gaza .
That and three bucks will get you a cappuccino at Starbucks .
Interestingly , the article attempts to exploe long - term strategic issues emanating from the Gaza invasion .
What has Israel accomplished , if anything ?
… A critical long - term issue is whether the Gaza operation restores Israel ’s deterrent .
Israel wants Hamas , Hezbollah , Iran and the Arab world to view it as a nation too strong and powerful to seriously threaten or attack .
That motivation is one reason , Israeli officials say , for going into Gaza so hard , using such firepower , and fighting Hamas as an enemy army .
“ Deterrence ” is one of those chimeras of Israeli strategic thinking .
The idea is that Israel is so vulnerable that it must strike quaking fear into its Arab enemies .
Otherwise , they will gang up on it and massacre the living daylights out of Israel .
The concept is one of those useless terms like the “ domino effect ” that influenced U.S. thinking in combating Russian geopolitical ambitions .
“ Deterrence ” is just another word for scaring the living daylights out of Arab states and believing that the only way for Israel to exist in the Middle East is to dominate militarily .
This , of course , is at best a short term strategy and will not work in terms of guaranteeing Israel ’s long - term security .
But do n’t tell that to the “ geniuses ” who conceive Israel ’s strategic vision .
“ Short term ” is the only concept they know or trust .
Erlanger continues by invoking that former JDL activist , current Likudist neocon , Yossi Klein Halevi :
The answer will not be known for many months , but the key to the Muslim world ’s reaction is actually that of the Israeli public , said Yossi Klein Halevi , of the Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies in Jerusalem .
“ The Arabs take their cue from Israeli responses , ” he said .
“ Deterrence is about how Israelis feel , whether they feel they ’ve won or lost . ”
Mr. Halevi cited the 1973 war — which Egyptians celebrate and Israelis mourn , though it ended with a spectacular Israel counterattack — and the 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon .
Hezbollah ’s leader , Hassan Nasrallah , apologized for the 2006 war on television , “ but he quickly reversed himself to declare a wonderful victory when he saw the Israeli public declaring defeat , ” Mr. Halevi said .
This is utter narischkeit .
Nasrallah declared victory in the middle of the war and after it .
But he , like many Israelis conceded that they had each underestimated the enemy ’s response .
No Arab nation takes any cues from Israel on how the latter views its own military adventures .
But the truth is that after this disaster , hate for Israel is at a fever pitch .
The Klein - Halevis of this world do n’t give a crap about that because they do n’t believe Israelis can ever live at peace with Arabs nor that they can ever trust them .
So the fact that most Arabs will despise Israel for generations does n’t phase him .
He ’s prepared to rely on a military solution alone to Israel ’s problems with Arabs .
This , of course , is a bankrupt solution , but the only one that people of his ilk in Israel can conceive .
Erlanger and Klein Halevi attempt to extrapolate from Gaza to the West Bank in an entirely ill - conceived analogy :
Even more important , perhaps , this Gazan war is a test case for any potential Israeli withdrawal from the occupied West Bank .
If Israelis feel that the West Bank will turn into another kind of chaotic , Hamas - run Gaza , they will be unwilling to withdraw — especially if they believe that once they withdrew , and if they were attacked from the West Bank , they would not be allowed to respond with force .
“ Gaza is an important test of whether we can defend ourselves within the 1967 boundaries , ” Mr. Halevi said , noting that Hamas had been attacking Israel proper , not settlements .
“ Will we be able to defend ourselves if we need to from the West Bank ?
Will the international community let us ? ”
The falsity of this conception is that an international guarantee of the peace between Israel and Palestine will make it unnecessary for Israel to attack the latter .
The presence of international forces with a sufficiently robust mandate and rules of engagement will force both sides to accept that there is no point in using violence to make any political statement .
So why WOULD Israel need its military or “ deterrence ” if there was a solid peace with Palestine ?
In the following passage , Klein Halevi attempts a witticism at Nasrallah ’s expense :
Hamas has modeled itself on Hezbollah , calling on Iranian support .
Mr. Nasrallah once spoke of Israeli power as a spider web — impressive from afar , but easily brushed aside .
This war against Hamas , Mr. Halevi said , “ is the revenge of the spider . ”
But the truth of the matter is that the Arabs are not afraid of this spider .
The only thing that they and the world have learned from this catastrophe is that the IDF is quite capable of killing women , children and knocking down UN facilities with tank shells .
Is this truly “ deterrence ? ”
The entire world saw what Israel faced in a badly outnumbered and outgunned Hezbollah , which nevertheless had a modicum of effective weapons at its disposal .
Israel lost .
Does anyone doubt that Hamas , with half the weaponry at Hezbollah ’s disposal would have struck some serious blows against Israel ’s vaunted “ deterrence ? ”
The final purpose of this fig leaf ceasefire is that Obama ’s inauguration is fast approaching .
No doubt , both Rice and Obama have lobbied for this ceasefire .
But what happens after the inauguration ?
How long before it begins again ?

Luoton tarjoajien kilpailu helpottaa sinua
Suomen lakimuutosten valossa monet pikaluoton tarjoajat yhdistyivät keskenään ja näin ollen muuttuivat yhdeksi firmaksi joka tarjoaa luottoa asiakkaille .
Tämä ei koskaan ollut pois asiakkaalta vaan näin ollen parempia tarjouksia alkoi tulemaan nopeammin ja monet aloittivat tarjoamaan ilmaista kulutusluottoa asiakkailleen .
Ilmaista pikaluottoa tarjotaan monelta taholta päivittäin .
Korkokatto toi mukanaan uusia tuulia luotto markkinoille ja mahdollisti näin ollen komeat luottotarjoukset asiakkaille .
Luottokelpoisuuden arvioi aina itse luoton hakija ja päättää onko kyvykäs maksamaan haettua luottoa pois .
Yhä harvemmin perintään menee kulutusluotto tai pikaluotto ongelmaiset , suurimmat perintään joutuvat ovat pankeista lainaa hakeneet koska korot ja vaatimukset ovat kasvaneet liian suuriksi .
Pikaluottojen maine on aivan turhaan pilattu ja tosiassa kulutusluottoa ottavat asiakkaat ovat täysin maksukykyisiä ja tiedostavat luoton ottamisen ehdot ja maksuajat .
Ei kannata turhaan pelätä luoton ottamista varsinkaan korkokatto uudistuksen jälkeen , pikaluoton ottaminen on täysin turvallista kun tietää oman talouden maksukyvyn eikä ota liian lyhyitä maksuaikoija luotoilleen .
Maksuaika täytyy valita pikaluotolle oman kyvykkyyde mukaan eikä laskea sitä liian alhaiseksi , näin välttää turhat ongelmat mitä voi syntyä kun ottaa pikaluottoa luotontarjoajalta .
Luotonantajan täytyy myös kohtuullisin toiminpiteiden pyrkiä varmistamaan luotonhakijan tietojen oikeellisuus , eikä siis voi myöntää olemattomalle henkilölle pikaluottoa .
Suomen rekisterissä oleva pankki johon asiakkaalla on nettipankki tunnukset , toimiva internet yhteys riittävät itsessään luoton hakemiseen .
Onko mahdollista saada luottoa keskellä yötä ?
Pikaluoton hakeminen yöllä ei ole mahdollista lakimuutosten myötä .
Periatteessa luottoa saa 24h johtuen siitä että kun haet pikaluoton tai kulutusluoton päiväsaikaan niin silloin luotto on myönnetty sinulle ja voit itse valita milloin nostat pikaluoton tilillesi .
Tämä tarkoittaa sitä että pikaluoton ottaminen on mahdollista milloin tahansa päivästä .
Kannatta hakea pikaluottoa päiväs aikaan jos tietää että sille on tarvetta vielä yönä , esimerkiksi viikonloppuna .
Kun luoton tarve yllättää voit nostaa sen nettipankkiisi milloin tahansa ja mistä tahansa , säästät tällä tapaa turhia pettymyksiä kuin jos yrittäisit hakea luottoa keskellä yötä .
Tarkista aina luotontarpeen ajankohtasi ja hoida kulutusluotto valmiiksi haettuna ennen haluttua ajankohtaa , jolloin saat nostettua sen tilillesi silloin kun tarvitset sitä .
Ja muista aina kilpailuttaa luottosi luottovertailu sivulla .
Kulutusluotto heti palvelutkin tarkoittavat samaa eli saat luoton heti haettua ja voit itse päätää milloin nostat sen pankkitilillesi .
Pikaluotto netistä kaikista helpoin ja nopein tapa hakea rahaa lainaan – tiedätkö nämä metodit ?

On olemassa myös palveluita missä saat luottoa puhelimella , monet pikaluoton tarjoajat tarjoavat applikaatioita puhelimeen johon rekisteröidyt ensimmäisen kerran jonka jälkeen palvelu muistaa sinut käyttäjänään , tämän jälkeen pystyt jatkossa hommaaman luotot itsellesi helposti yhdellä sormen painalluksella .
Luotto applikaatiot ovat todella suosittuja eikä ihmekään niiden hyvän käytettävyyden takia .
Nykyäaikana internet löytyy melkein jokaisesta laitteesta mitä ihminen kantaa mukanaan , luoton hakeminen on käytännössä mahdollista mistä tahansa tämän ansioista , ei turhia jonotus aikoja pankissa ja oma vapaus kulutusluoton valinnassa .
Laina oman maksukyvyn mukaan – muistathan olla lainaamatta liikaa ?
Muista aina kulutusluottoa ottaessa harkita oma maksukykysi ettet joudu ongelmiin .
Kulutusluotto on hyvä ja nopea vaihtoehto yllättävässä rahantarpeessa kun muistaa säätää maksuajan sekä luoton suuruuden omaan talouteen sopivaksi .
Maksuaikoja on tarjolla jopa 1 - 12 vuodeksi monella luoton myöntäjällä , korot pysyvät silti näin suurissa maksuajoissa sopivissa suhteissa .
Kulutusluoton määrän pystyy säätämään eurolleen eikä näin tarvitse ottaa ylivelkaa josta ei välttämättä pystyisi selviytymään .
Monet tarjoukset takaavat sen että saat ilmaista kulutusluottoa kun otat ensimmäistä kertaa uutena asiakkaan tietyltä tarjoajalta .
Kampanjat muuttuvat jatkuvasti ja niitä kannattaa tarkkailla luottovertailu sivun avulla jotta hyötyisit rahallisesti mahdollisimman paljon ja saisit napattua itsellesi parhaan sen hetkisen luottotarjouksen .

Sivustolla on turvallisimmat ja edullisimmat luoton myöntäjät joiden asiakapalvelu myös pelaa kun haluat vaikka siirtää laskusi eräpäivää tai kasvattaa luottosummaa .
Asiakaspalvelu on monelle asiakkaalle tärkeä ominaisuus luottoa hakiessa , joten älä pelkää kaikki kumppanit jotka ovat vertailussa mukana omaavat todella hyvän ja toimivan asiakapalvelun .
GAZA ( Reuters ) - Israel launched a series of air strikes in the Gaza Strip Sunday , targeting a Hamas security complex and tunnels used to smuggle weapons after vowing a “ disproportionate ” response to cross - border fire .
The aircraft carried out half a dozen strikes after three Israelis were injured by a mortar salvo , including two soldiers and the first Israeli civilian hurt since a January 18 truce ended Israel ’s 22 - day offensive in the coastal enclave .
There were no reported casualties in the air attacks .
Five of the strikes targeted tunnels along Gaza ’s border with Egypt , used to smuggle weapons into the coastal enclave , in a zone known as the Philadelphi corridor .
A further Israeli attack was on a security headquarters in a village in central Gaza that residents said had been vacated after Israel telephoned warnings to Palestinians to leave buildings that housed any weapons .
An Israeli military statement said that “ in response to rocket and mortar fire today , the air force has attacked a number of targets in the ( Gaza ) Strip , including six tunnels and a Hamas position . ”
Hamas said five tunnels had been bombed .
Egypt , with U.S. backing , has been trying to broker a long - term ceasefire that would end Hamas weapons smuggling into Gaza and also lead to a reopening of Gaza border crossings , one of Hamas ’s main demands .
Israel ’s blockade of Gaza , since Hamas Islamists seized the coastal territory from Western - back Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007 , has led to shortages of crucial supplies for many of the 1.5 million Palestinians living there .
Israel ’s renewed air strikes came as its leaders took a hard line against rocket fire from Gaza ahead of a February 10 national election , which opinion polls predict right - wing leader Benjamin Netanyahu , who favors a tougher stance toward Hamas , will win .
About a dozen rockets and mortar bombs were fired from Gaza Sunday , the Israeli military said .
A wing of al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigades , a group belonging to Abbas ’s Fatah faction , said it fired some of the rockets , but not all were claimed .
THREATS OF A “ HARSH ” RESPONSE
“ The government ’s position was from the outset that if there is shooting at the residents of the south , there will be a harsh Israeli response that will be disproportionate , ” Olmert , who is not an election candidate , said at the weekly cabinet meeting .
“ We will act according to new rules which will ensure that we will not be drawn into a war of incessant shooting on the southern border , which would deprive the residents of the south of a normal life , ” he said .

Israeli radios quoted Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , a candidate for prime minister as head of the centrist Kadima party , as saying Israel would mount a new offensive in Gaza if necessary to halt rocket fire from Gaza .
Olmert is not running , as he quit during a corruption probe in September and has stayed on as caretaker premier .
A spokesman for the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip condemned what he described as Olmert ’s “ aggressive statement . ”
But the spokesman , Taher al - Nono , also urged all Palestinian factions to “ respect the national consensus ” on the ceasefire the Islamist group declared two weeks ago after Israel announced it was halting the Gaza offensive .
Israel was criticized internationally for the deaths , according to the Hamas - run Health Ministry in Gaza , of more than 1,300 Palestinians , including at least 700 civilians in the offensive it launched on December 27 .
Critics said Israel had responded disproportionately , in its air and ground offensive in heavily populated areas , to cross - border rocket attacks over eight years that killed 18 people .
Ten Israeli soldiers and three civilians were killed in the Gaza campaign .
Israel said Hamas militants bore responsibility for civilian deaths in Gaza by operating inside its towns and refugee camps .
Since the two - week - old truce , in addition to Sunday ’s injuries , an Israeli soldier was killed and three others were wounded when a bomb exploded next to their patrol .
Israeli air strikes have killed three Palestinians and wounded 10 .

A team of undergraduate students at MIT have developed a shock absorber that actually generates electricity from bumps in the road .
This results in up to a 10 percent improvement in overall vehicle fuel efficiency .
Their prototype shock absorbers use a hydraulic system that forces fluid through a turbine attached to a generator .
The system is controlled by an active electronic system that optimizes the damping , providing a smoother ride than conventional shocks while generating electricity to recharge the batteries or operate electrical equipment .
" GenShock " technology is ideal for heavier vehicles , as added weight equates to better performance .
Naturally , the military and the trucking industry has expressed a lot of interest in the idea , but those involved with the project have even bigger plans .
They " want this technology on every heavy - truck , military vehicle and consumer hybrid on the road " — and by the looks of things , they just might get their wish .
More power from bumps in the road
— MIT students develop energy - harvesting shock absorbers
CAMBRIDGE , Mass .
—A team of MIT undergraduate students has invented a shock absorber that harnesses energy from small bumps in the road , generating electricity while it smoothes the ride more effectively than conventional shocks .
The students hope to initially find customers among companies that operate large fleets of heavy vehicles .
They have already drawn interest from the U.S. military and several truck manufacturers .
Senior Shakeel Avadhany and his teammates say they can produce up to a 10 percent improvement in overall vehicle fuel efficiency by using the regenerative shock absorbers .
The company that produces Humvees for the army , and is currently working on development of the next - generation version of the all - purpose vehicle , is interested enough to have loaned them a vehicle for testing purposes .
The project came about because " we wanted to figure out where energy is being wasted in a vehicle , " senior Zack Anderson explains .
Some hybrid cars already do a good job of recovering the energy from braking , so the team looked elsewhere , and quickly homed in on the suspension .
They began by renting a variety of different car models , outfitting the suspension with sensors to determine the energy potential , and driving around with a laptop computer recording the sensor data .
Their tests showed " a significant amount of energy " was being wasted in conventional suspension systems , Anderson says , " especially for heavy vehicles . "
Once they realized the possibilities , the students set about building a prototype system to harness the wasted power .
Their prototype shock absorbers use a hydraulic system that forces fluid through a turbine attached to a generator .
The system is controlled by an active electronic system that optimizes the damping , providing a smoother ride than conventional shocks while generating electricity to recharge the batteries or operate electrical equipment .
In their testing so far , the students found that in a 6 - shock heavy truck , each shock absorber could generate up to an average of 1 kW on a standard road - enough power to completely displace the large alternator load in heavy trucks and military vehicles , and in some cases even run accessory devices such as hybrid trailer refrigeration units .
They filed for a patent last year and formed a company , called Levant Power Corp. , to develop and commercialize the product .
They are currently doing a series of tests with their converted Humvee to optimize the system 's efficiency .
They hope their technology will help give an edge to the military vehicle company in securing the expected $ 40 billion contract for the new army vehicle called the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle , or JLTV .
" They see it as something that 's going to be a differentiator " in the quest for that lucrative contract , says Avadhany .
He adds , " it is a completely new paradigm of damping . "
" This is a disruptive technology , " Anderson says .
" It 's a game - changer . "
" Simply put - we want this technology on every heavy - truck , military vehicle and consumer hybrid on the road , " Avadhany says .
The team has received help from MIT 's Venture Mentoring Service , and has been advised by Yet - Ming Chiang , the Kyocera Professor of Ceramics in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and founder of A123 Systems , a supplier of high - power lithium - ion batteries .
Not only would improved fuel efficiency be a big plus for the army by requiring less stockpiling and transportation of fuel into the war zone , but the better ride produced by the actively controlled shock absorbers makes for safer handling , the students say .
" If it 's a smoother ride , you can go over the terrain faster , " says Anderson .
The new shocks also have a fail - safe feature :
If the electronics fail for any reason , the system simply acts like a regular shock absorber .
The group , which also includes senior Zachary Jackowski and alumni Paul Abel ' 08 , Ryan Bavetta '07 and Vladimir Tarasov ' 08 , plans to have a final , fine - tuned version of the device ready this summer .
Then they will start talking to potential big customers .
For example , they have calculated that a company such as Wal - Mart could save $ 13 million a year in fuel costs by converting its fleet of trucks .
For many years doctors said there was no recovery from schizophrenia and the best that could be hoped for was reducing symptoms .
No more .
The March issue of Schizophrenia Bulletin is devoted to " Functional Recovery in Schizophrenia . "
Four articles , written by authors from different academic centers , discuss the theme of " multiple elements of recovery " including how to measure functional recovery , how it differs from remission of clinical symptoms , and implications for early detection of psychosis .
The Schizophrenia Bulleting is free one year after publication .

In addition to the 17,000 troops President Obama has already committed to add to the war effort in Afghanistan , his new “ comprehensive strategy ” will include another 4,000 troops and hundreds of “ civilian advisers , ” bringing the US military presence in Afghanistan to nearly 60,000 .
Defending the escalation , Obama declared that the Taliban “ must be stopped , ” and that Americans must also accept that Pakistan “ needs our help . ”
Just days ago in a high profile interview , Obama said the plan would have to include some sort of “ exit strategy . ”
So far there has been no indication that this is the case , and if anything , the latest plan and comments seem designed to further entrench US forces in the nation and escalate the conflict even further .
The Afghan war is also the “ most important operational priority ” for NATO , and the British military intends to send 2,000 additional soldiers .
Despite repeated talks of new strategies and growing commitments , the situation continues to worsen , leaving open the question of how throwing more troops and money at the situation , after 7 plus years of doing that , could possibly constitute a “ new ” course of action .
Emotional memories can be nearly indelible and directly influence our identities .
One of the strongest emotions we have is fear .
Fear can be a helpful survival mechanism that prevents us from jumping recklessly into dangerous situations , but it can also be a debilitating emotion that makes it impossible for some people to live without constant anxiety .
It is a major component of many psychiatric illnesses , including post - traumatic stress disorder .
Once fear takes hold , it is extremely difficult to erase .
Psychiatrists and psychologists have found ways to help patients control their responses to fear , but the root fear memory appears to be immune to treatment , making relapses common .
Recently , a new therapeutic possibility has emerged : neuroscientists discovered a drug ( propranolol ) that lessened indications of fear in rats on a long - term basis .
This naturally led scientists to determine how propranolol will affect fear memory in humans .
University of Amsterdam scientists Merel Kindt , Marieke Soeter , and Bram Vervliet tested propranolol on volunteers in three phases .
In the first phase , they conditioned volunteers to fear pictures of spiders by associating them with an uncomfortable electric shock to the wrist .
In phase two , which took place 24 hours later , the researchers gave participants either propranolol or a placebo .
They then reinforced what the participants had learned on the first day by showing the fear stimulus again .
After another 24 hours , they commenced the final phase of the experiment , which included what are called fear extinction and reinstatement .
In fear extinction , the participants were shown the pictures of spiders without any shock 10 times in a row .
Then , the scientists reinstated the fear by accompanying the pictures again with electric shock .
Throughout this process , they measured the participants ’ fear responses using electromyography of the right orbicularis oculi muscle , the muscle that closes the right eyelid .
Fear responses were dramatically different between the participants who took propranolol and those who took the placebo .
Even before the fear extinction procedure , the propranolol group showed almost no observable responses to the spider pictures , while the placebo group continued to display elevated fear .
The fear extinction procedure was also less effective on the placebo group , who still showed higher levels of fear responses than the propranolol group .
In addition , the placebo group was significantly more susceptible to the fear reinstatement process , while the propranolol treated participants experienced almost no relapse in fear .
Propranolol seems to be effective both in lowering fear responses and preventing their reoccurrence .
Since propranolol prevented the reinstatement of fear , the authors suggest that " the fear memory may either be erased or may be unavailable as a result of retrieval failure . ”
However , there is no way to tell which of these two types of amnesia is produced by propranolol with current neuroscience technology .
What they do know is that propranolol selectively targets receptors in the amygdala that are involved in emotional information processing .
The authors hypothesize that propranolol may interfere with protein synthesis in neurons , which is important for memory consolidation .
Further research is necessary to pin down propranolol 's exact mechanism of action and to determine how permanent its effects are .
Kindt , Soeter , and Verliet hope that their current and future studies will lead to better treatments for the “ millions of people who suffer from emotional disorders and the relapse of fear , even after successful treatment . ”

Leaked post - beta versions of Windows 7 and watchful bloggers let an interesting cat out of the bag late last week : Microsoft is allowing users to remove Internet Explorer 8 and other applications from Windows 7 .
Initially , Microsoft refused to discuss the Windows 7 " kill switch " , saying only that it could not comment on unreleased products .
But the company followed the next day with a post on its Engineering Windows 7 blog listing the applications that can be switched off .
These include Internet Explorer 8 , Windows Media Player , Windows Media Center and Windows Search .
Hovering over Microsoft 's decision is a January filing by the European Union 's antitrust agency stating that Microsoft protects Internet Explorer from head - to - head competition by bundling it with Windows .
Microsoft wrote in a filing with the SEC that it may become " a requirement that OEMs distribute multiple browsers on new Windows - based PCs . "
With antitrust fines from the EU piling up and more on the way for previous Windows sales dating back to the mid 1990's , Microsoft may be extending an olive branch to the EU by enabling the removal of IE8 , analysts say .
Microsoft has made no official comment on whether there is a correlation between shutting off IE8 and the EU charges .
Veteran tech analyst Rob Enderle , president of research firm The Enderle Group , says that Microsoft should be credited for giving users more choice , but " it also serves to get EU regulators off their back ... and there 's no indication that Microsoft would have gone down this path had this not been part of the EU requests . "
Microsoft bloggers and columnists are calling the option to remove applications in Windows 7 a long - overdue compromise from Microsoft , regardless of its true motivations .
Microsoft Watch blogger Joe Wilcox recently wrote that although the permission to remove more applications is a reaction to the EU charges , it 's also in keeping with Microsoft 's vow to keep Windows 7 more flexible .
" Microsoft has done right by expanding the list [ of applications that can be removed ] and including some resource - hogging programs in the process .
There are many businesses that wo n't need all these features on their PCs , so why have binaries and services running and consuming valuable system resources ? "
Enderle adds : " It forces Microsoft to keep their eye on assuring all of the components are competitive and not to simply rely on the bundle dragging along increasingly inferior offerings .
Better parts lead to a better solution and a better solution is always better PR . "
The only potential downside : by giving users more flexibility to remove applications you are adding complexity and the chance for problems that cause the PC to misbehave .
" And on Windows , Microsoft takes the heat for breakage regardless of who is really at fault , " Enderle says .
But overall , he says , the decision to give users more choice " is a positive for Microsoft , however they got there . "
It 's been nearly 5 years sincehit the store shelves and raised the bar once again for first person shooters , at least in terms of single player action and storyline that is .
It 's hard to believe that it has been that long .
It 's also been nearly 4 years sincecame out as well .
With that said , was finally announced last summer and we 're still salivating for any news on the game and its development .
Our ownleads us to believe that something will be said at ( See this recent MTV Q&A with John Carmack ) in the summer with most likely some kind of teaser trailer being shown .
But will any screen shots be leaked before that time ?
Some nice fake screen shots have come out since the official announcement but they 're no more satisfying than being teased by your girlfriend with no hand relief .
lol * Fake or real ? ;-)
So with all of that said , we decided to put together a small list of what we 'd like Doom 4 to have .
From the storyline to monsters to the dynamic level of game play that we gamers demand of games that " claim " to set new standards even before they debut .
Below is a pretty concise list but if you have an ideas or suggestions , be sure to leave a comment .
It would seem only logical to have Hell invade Earth just as was done in Doom 2 to some extent but you never really felt as if you were on Earth .
Of course this was due to the limited graphical and computer capabilities at the time but this time around , the limit is simply ID 's imagination in how they portray the Earth .
Just imagine gunning your way through a neighborhood filled with Imps !
lolWhile Doom 3 brought many innovations , it also brought modified hellions .
While most were good , some key ones were either missing or unrecognizable .
We do believe that most should stay but we do feel that we should list the few that should make a glorious return .
There was nothing more freighting than playing late at night by yourself with no lights on and turning around and having this guy bite your head off in the original game .
He was heavily modified to be more modern .
Keeping the new age Pinky is fine but there should be different breeds of pinky demon which would lead to the return of the original that stood more upright and had a more menacing devilish look .
The new Hell Knight is one scary sight to behold but the original is unforgettable with his long horns and screaming howl that made you want to go hide under your Mom 's bed !
Again , maybe a breed or even class structure could be used to return the original Hell Knight .
Perhaps even making him one of the final bosses that is in charge of all the " new age " Hell Knights .
This would send chills through any hardcore Doom gamer .
As is the case with many high end games these days , the environment plays a huge role in its success .
Since Doom 4 will be using the ID Tech 5 game engine which will look like a heavily enhanced Cyrsis engine , one can only expect to see one hell of an environment .
Hopefully the creators are making most everything destructible to a certain extent .
It would be great to be able to use certain tricks or techniques besides running and gunning your way through the game such as setting traps for the demons or using your environment as a weapon itself , that and making it so you can combine a great number of methods in raining destruction down upon the hellions .
One thing that made Doom 3's replay value greater was the tips and clues you found on the way through the game and the overall engaging storyline .
Adding a destructible game environment along with having that great game storyline would truly add a unique layer to the game and increase its replay value by many factors .
Flashlight mounted on gun , grenades , flame thrower , motion sensor .
To sum it all up , gamers have been clamoring for more than a decade to see a true .
It would be great if they showed the actual battles taking place in a broader scope as well but for all we know the next Doom could take place on another Moon !
We hope not .

Indian and Bangladeshi crew still on board hijacked ship , but three British security guards jump into sea to be rescued
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Three British security guards on board a chemical tanker hijacked today by Somali pirates have been rescued by helicopter , after jumping into the sea to escape .
Diplomats who would not be identified said a warship on patrol nearby had sent helicopters to intervene in the attack , but they arrived after the pirates had taken control of the Liberian - flagged ship .
The diplomats – who did not specify which country the warship came from – said that 25 Indian and two Bangladeshi crew members remain on board the vessel .
The ship was being operated out of Singapore , according to Noel Choong , head of the International Maritime Bureau 's piracy reporting centre in Malaysia .
The ship 's master had sent a distress call to the centre , which relayed the alert to international forces that have been policing Somali waters this year , Choong said .
There were no immediate details about how the pirates attacked or the condition of the crew .
The hijack is the latest in a string of pirate attacks off the Somali coast in recent months .
Somalia 's lawlessness has allowed its shoreline to become a haven for pirates .
The country has been caught up in an Islamic insurgency and has had no functioning government since 1991 .
There have been 96 pirate attacks and 39 ships hijacked in Somali waters this year , including Sirius Star , a Saudi supertanker earlier this month loaded with $ 100 m ( £ 65 m ) of crude oil .
The latest hijack means that 16 ships and more than 300 seafarers are in the hands of Somali pirates , who dock the hijacked vessels near the eastern and southern coasts as they negotiate for their ransom .
Warships from Denmark , India , Malaysia , Russia , the US and Nato patrol the international maritime corridor off Somalia , escorting some merchant ships and responding to distress calls .

Barack Obama shows he 's game by kicking back with a beer and some basketball
After a week of plunging shares , job cuts and news that his economy is shrinking faster than wool in a washing machine , it 's no wonder Barack Obama fancied a little downtime this weekend .
The U.S. president headed to his local stadium in Washington last night to watch a game of his beloved basketball .
The leader of the free world joined his Chicago - based friend Martin Nesbitt to watch the Washington Wizards and Chicago Bulls at the Verizon Centre .
Big draw : U.S. President Barack Obama attracts the attention of his fellow basketball fans at the Verizon Centre in Washington last night
The two men sat courtside and with Mr Obama dressed down in a black jacket and dark sweater he looked like any other fan enjoying a game - apart from the swarm of photographers at his feet and the scores of people who wanted to say hello and shake his hand .
Face to face : Mr Obama greets fan Miles Rawls who is wearing a commemorative Barack Obama shirt
Good sport :
The president , a Bulls fan , high - fives five - year - old Wizards fan Nick Aiello
The president , who plays basketball himself , chatted with fans of all ages and even put up with the jibes and banter from surrounding Wizards fans .
R&R :
The president watches the action and sips on a beer
And , like any other man enjoying the game on a Friday night , he took some time out to sup on a beer .
And it must have been a welcome drink after the week that he has had .
Fun and games : Mr Obama gets a high - five from Mr Rawls during the game
Yesterday , shares across the world plummeted after news the U.S. economy contracted 6.2 per cent at the end of last year .
The Commerce Department report showed the biggest GDP drop in 25 years and far worse than previous government estimates of 3.8 per cent .
To jolt the economy , Mr Obama recently signed a recovery package of increased government spending and tax cuts but admitted it would plunge America into £ 1.2 trillion worth of debt - its biggest national debt since the Second World War .
Plus he pledged to bring all troops home from Iraq by August 2010 .
And if that was n't enough - the Wizards beat the Bulls 113-90 .

President Obama is rethinking the unpopular $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program , said Jeremy Warner in Britain ’s The Independent .
The $ 350 billion given to prop up banks before he took office appears to have “ found its way straight into bankers ’ back pockets in the form of hefty bonuses , ” so Obama ’s team is considering at least a partial return to the original plan : creating a “ bad bank ” to buy the toxic assets poisoning banks ’ balance sheets .
The “ bad bank ” strategy “ is aptly named , because it ’s a bad idea , ” said the Los Angeles Times in an editorial .
First , it ’s “ well - nigh impossible to determine the right price ” for the toxic debt .
If the government overpays , using the banks ’ valuations , taxpayers eat the loss .
But the assets are worth more than what they ’d fetch in today ’s market .
Rather than buying the assets , the U.S. should guarantee a portion of the their value , for a fee .
Such “ guarantees would represent a big gift to bank stockholders , ” said Paul Krugman in The New York Times , and why should taxpayers “ bear the cost ” if the assets never recover , while “ stockholders and executives get the benefits if things go right ” ?
That ’s called “ lemon socialism . ”
Let ’s be capitalists : rather than preserving “ the illusion of private ownership , ” we taxpayers should reap any rewards from the banks we invest in .
That kind of “ populism may feel good , ” said Charlie Gasparino in The Daily Beast , but it wo n’t get us out of this mess .
Obama ’s team will probably opt for a “ kitchen sink ” approach to the new TARP , and for it to have any chance of success , they ’ll need Wall Street ’s help .
Yes , these bankers created this crisis , but that means “ they know where the bodies are buried . ”
If we want to avoid “ breadlines , ” we may have to tone down the “ Wall Street bashing . ”
Curious what the much - anticipated Star Trek Online will contain ?
We were there to get all the answers at the Cryptic Studios panel at NYCC , and those answers may be very pleasing indeed .

During yesterday 's Cryptic panel , we got a sneak peak at the highly - anticipated Star Trek Online MMO game .
This absolutely gorgeous - looking game is set in the year 2409 , 30 years past the events of the ST : TNG film " Nemesis . "
Klingon compromises have fallen apart , with the Klingon Empire on the verge of all - out war .
There will also be " an ancient threat from the past . "
You 'll be able to play as either a Starfleet officer or as a member of the Klingon Defense , with both choices at Captain rank .
Yes , you will be a Captain of your own starship .
You 'll be able to select your bridge crew and command them , as well as pilot the ship yourself .
Early on you 'll choose your career path — either tactical , engineering or science - based .
But the game seeks to bring to the fore what the creators feel to be the fundamentals of Star Trek : space , shipboard and ground exploration .
Gameplay will be focused on beaming down to planets for a variety of missions , mastering shipboard concerns and , of course , exploring the final frontier .

You 'll be able to have " total customization " of your own alien races , with the ability to modify characters down to the slightest skin- textures and features .
While you 'll also be able to choose from all of the " known and loved Trek races " to play , if you 've ever wanted to father your own alien species , this will be your chance .
The brief glimpses and stills we were given of the actual game look extraordinary .
The graphics are detailed , rich and look better than the space scenes in most movies .
We got to see the character - design elements in action , and the level of detail will please even the most exacting of fans .
After the panel , I asked game producer Craig Zinkievich whether we could expect a high level of social interaction to be available between players along with missions and character - building .
He confirmed that character interaction would be very present in the game — just as it is in the Star Trek universe — with sites like space stations offering places to congregate .
" And pleasure planets ? " I suggested , to which he laughed and skirted the issue — but implied that it could be a possibility , and definitely is n't ruled out .
See you all on Risa ?
All over Europe Islamic banks are establishing branches , Western banks are offering Sharia - compliant financial services , and European governments are trying to outcompete each other in welcoming them .
Proponents of banking along the lines of Sharia ( Islamic law ) claim that the Islamic banking system is “ more ethical ” than the West ’s capitalist system .
This is not true .
Unfortunately , however , in our age of crashing financial markets , many Westerners – not just the traditional anti-capitalist European left – seem very eager to buy that argument .
Early this month , even the Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano voiced its approval of Sharia banking .
“ The ethical principles on which Islamic finance is based may bring banks closer to their clients and to the true spirit which should mark every financial service , ” the paper said in a downright stupid and “ unethical ” article published on March , 4 .
The article , entitled “ Islamic finance proposals and ideas for the West in crisis ” [ pdf ] suggests that the basic rules of Islamic finance could relieve suffering markets and particularly international financial systems .
It says that in the current atmosphere of crisis banks should take Muslims as an example and that the Islamic finance system may pave the way for the establishment of new rules in the Western world .
Islamic or Sharia banks differ from regular banks in two major ways .
As commanded in the Koran , the charging of interest is prohibited in all monetary transactions .
The other defining feature of Islamic banks is that they are supervised by a board of Islamic scholars and clerics whose job it is to ensure that the banks ’ activities comply with Sharia law .
Its proponents argue that Islamic banking is “ ethically superior ” to the capitalist principles of the “ materialistic ”
West because , as Giovanni Maria Vian , the editor of Osservatore Romano says , Sharia banks take “ the human dimension of the economy ” into account .
The two dirty secrets of Islamic banking , however , are that , like all banks , Sharia banks do charge interest – they just give it another name – and that the clerics supervising the banks have ties to extremist , even terrorist , groups which work towards the Islamization of Europe and world dominance .
Helena Christofi , an expert on Sharia banking , explains that Islamic banks extend a type of Islamic “ credit , ” called murabaha , that shifts risk to the borrower in a manner similar to interest .
“ An Islamic bank granting murabaha credit to a customer for an automobile , for example , would purchase the automobile for the customer for $ 15,000 and the customer would owe the bank $ 20,000 in a year ’s time .
Similarly , under the ‘ diminishing musharaka ’ credit , the Islamic version of a mortgage , the bank and the customer purchase the property together .
The customer must make monthly payments to the bank and pay a monthly rental fee , both based on the portion of the purchase price the bank still owns .
Ironically , the interest this amounts to ranges between one and two percent higher than the interest on a conventional mortgage .
Although the resale price of the vehicle and the rent paid on the house are akin to simple interest charges , the banks ’ sharia boards legitimate the charges by renaming them ‘ commissions ’ or ‘ profits . ’ ”
The Sharia boards supervising the Islamic banks and Sharia - compliant financial services offered by regular European banks are composed of members of the European Council for Fatwa and Research .
This Council is headed by Sheik Yousef Al - Qaradawi , a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and instigator and financier of terrorism in Europe and the Middle East .
Both Al - Qaradawi and the Council have expressed their hope that “ Islam will return to Europe as a conqueror . ”
With ever larger Muslim populations there is a growing internal demand for an “ ethical alternative ” to conventional banking for Muslims .
A 2006 poll by Lloyds Trustee Savings Bank in Britain found that over 75 % of British Muslims want Sharia - compliant banking products , while in 2005 Mufti Abdul Barkatullah , Sharia adviser to Lloyds TSB and an imam at a North London mosque reported that 20 % of inquiries into Islamic products at Lloyds TSB came from non-Muslims who have bought the argument that conventional capitalist banking is somehow unethical .
Alun Williams , marketing director of the Islamic Bank of Britain , established in 2004 and one of the first Sharia banks in Europe , told The Guardian ( April 2 , 2005 ) :
“ Our biggest appeal outside the Muslim community will be to those who feel disenfranchised by , and bitter about , mainstream banks . [ … ]
Non-Muslims are fascinated by us , the more so because we intend offering [ … ] an ethical dimension . ”
That was four years ago .
Meanwhile , Islamic banking has boomed all over Europe and interest from non-Muslims has grown in the wake of the financial crisis , which some , such as the Vatican paper , claim is due to the free - market model having “ grown too much and badly in the past two decades . ”
Sharia principles , however , not only prohibit the collection and payment of interest and investing in companies involved in gambling , alcohol , tobacco , pornography and the production of pork , but also forbid women from opening bank accounts without their husband ’s approval .
How “ ethical ” the latter is for the non-Muslims “ fascinated ” by Sharia banking is unclear .
However , Western banks offering Sharia - compliant services to non-Muslims do not seem to insist on barring women .
According to Christofi ,
“ The justification for replacing capitalism with the Islamic model is based on an intentional corruption of Sharia law , but the banks ’ clerics do n’t seem to mind undermining their theological philosophy , since the ethical image their misrepresentation has created for Islamic banking has managed to spread Islamic ideology to non-Muslims in Britain .
According to Al - Qaradawi , Islam ’s ideological infiltration into the West will be the vehicle through which it will establish an Islamic government over the entire globe . ”
Although Al - Qaradawi and other members of the European Council for Fatwa and Research are connected to Islamist circles , the British government continues to promote the UK as a hub for Islamic banking .
Western governments welcome Sharia - compliant banking because of the huge sums this attracts from Muslim immigrants , “ ethically ” - driven non-Muslims , and investors from Muslim countries .
In December 2008 , the French Senate looked at ways to eliminate legal hurdles for Islamic financial services and products in France .
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde announced France ’s intention to make Paris “ the capital of Islamic finance ” and said several Islamic banks would open branches in the French capital in 2009 .
French sources estimate this area of the financial market is worth from 500 to 600 billion dollars and could grow by an average 11 percent a year .
In July 2007 , Wouter Bos , the Dutch Finance Minister ( and leader of the Dutch Labour Party ) , said the Dutch government actively encourages Islamic banking , despite the risk that this acts as a Trojan horse in the Western banking system for groups linked to terrorists .
“ In the first place because Islamic banking meets a demand from the Muslims living in the Netherlands .
In the second place because we see an opportunity here for the Dutch financial sector .
A third reason is that banning Islamic banking from the perspective of fighting terrorism will have a counter - productive effect .
Denial of an actual need can lead to money - flows running via alternative channels out of the sight of the government . ”
Switzerland , too , wants its share of Sharia banking .
Years ago , Swiss banks already opened branches in the Middle East , offering worldwide Sharia - compliant financial products to wealthy Arabs .
In October 2006 , the Swiss authorities granted a banking license to the first Switzerland - based bank that operates according to Sharia principles .
Others have followed .
“ There are simply not enough financial products being created in the West for Muslim clients , ” says John Sandwick , managing director of Swiss asset management firm Encore Management .
“ If no effort is made whatsoever , I am afraid the world will pass Switzerland by in the race to control the rich prize : which today is worth hundreds of billions , but in the future will be trillions of dollars of Islamic wealth . ”
Michael Fouad Chahine of Credit Suisse says
“ The development of Islamic banking has so far been limited to countries with a higher percentage of Muslims .
But this is changing as more international regulators accept the importance of Sharia .
It is now also accepted as socially responsible banking . ”
How “ socially responsible ” and “ ethical ” is it to try to grab a share of the billions of dollars amassed by rich Arabs , while turning a blind eye to the fact that a substantial part of the money is used to promote terrorism and the establishment of an Islamic government over the entire globe ?
In one of his sermons , Sheikh Al - Qaradhawi , one of the supervisors of the Sharia - compliant financial services offered in Britain , speaks of “ the conquest of Rome . ”
In view of the recent article of the Osservatore Romano , Al - Qaradhawi ’s words sound rather ominous :
“ The city of Hirqil [ Constantinople ] was conquered by the young 23 - year - old Ottoman Muhammad bin Morad , known in history as Muhammad the Conqueror , in 1453 .
The other city , Romiyya [ Rome ] , remains , and we hope and believe [ that it too will be conquered ] .
This means that Islam will return to Europe as a conqueror and victor , after being expelled from it twice [… ] .
In one of my previous programs , I said that I think that this conquest [ of Rome ] would not be by the sword or armies , but by preaching and ideology .
Europe will see that it suffers from materialistic culture , and will seek an alternative , it will seek a way out , it will seek a lifeboat .
It will find no lifesaver but the message of Islam . ”
Will the Vatican Bank be the next to go Sharia ?
Toyota announced yesterday it will freeze pay and management bonuses in the UK for 2009 .
The Japanese car maker will also introduce a voluntary severance programme at its sites in Derby and North Wales .
The company is expected to post an loss in excess of £ 3.3 bn this year .
I thought Matt Millen did a fine job during NBC 's broadcast , but that 's not to say that some people are happy that he 's employed anywhere .
Take for example NBC affiliate , WDIV in Detroit , which decided that every time Millen appeared on the screen , a disclaimer was needed .
From the Detroit Free - Press via Shutdown Corner ....
Every time a certain familiar face showed up on camera Sunday during NBC's Super Bowl pregame show , Channel 4 ran a scroll at the bottom of the screen :
" Matt Millen was president of the Lions for the worst eight - year run in the history of the NFL .
Knowing his history with the team , is there a credibility issue as he now serves as an analyst for NBC Sports ? ... "
Hilarious .
But good for Channel 4 , not toeing the company line as it sought online comments from viewers on Millen 's gig .
Or maybe it was just trying to distance itself from NBC 's brilliant move .
No surprise , the response was completely , utterly anti-Matt matter .
Personally , speaking to the credibility of the pregame personalities , I have Millen ranked , oh , a couple spots after Hayden Panettiere .
Hilarious !
They do n't seem to be holding a grudge much , do they ?
I 'm sure NBC is n't going to be thrilled to hear about it , but you can't blame the city for not being big fans of the guy , and at least the disclaimer was n't profane in any way .
Here 's your video evidence as well ....
Matt Millen 's NBC commentary comes with a warning label ( Shutdown Corner ) Warning !

The " state secrets privilege " has been around for over half a century , but has never enjoyed the level of public prominence it enjoyed in recent years , thanks to the Bush administration 's record - shattering reliance on it to block litigation targeting controverisal programs of warrantless surveillance and " enhanced " interrogation .
The Obama administration has committed itself to a narrower view of the privilege , but — to the consternation of progressives — has thus far declined to walk back from the previous administration 's broad assertions of privilege in any pending court cases .
Now , Congress is proposing to take matters into its own hands with the reintroduction of the State Secrets Protection Act .
The aggressive invocation of state secrecy during the Bush era was raised during confirmation hearings for Attorney General Eric Holder , who has since made good on his pledge to order a review of cases in which the privilege has been asserted .
But civil libertarians were incensed when Justice Department lawyers announced that the new administration would endorse their predecessors ' argument that state secrecy foreclosed litigation in the case of Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan , a suit brought against the company alleged to have flights for the CIA 's " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects to countries where they were subject to torture .
Members of Congress are n't waiting to see which way the new attorney general will jump in other pending cases .
The State Secrets Protection
Act , which stalled after being reported out of committee in 2008 , has been reintroduced in both the House and Senate , and would provide guidelines for judges considering claims of state secrets designed to introduce heightened judicial scrutiny in an area where courts have traditionally been highly deferential to executive branch determinations .
Though the language in the House bill seems slightly more restrictive on its face , the two versions are broadly parallel .
They urge courts to directly review in camera any material asserted to be shielded by national security and make its own determination of whether the privilege is validly invoked with respect to that material .
When appropriate , courts are directed to request redacted versions of sensitive material that would enable a suit to proceed when full disclosure is not possible .
Judges are also encouraged to require the government to process security clearances for litigants ' attorneys in order to enable them to participate in closed hearings .
The traditional deference afforded the executive in national security cases is often justified by the argument that courts lack the competence to properly evaluate national security claims .
The rejoinder of civil libertarians has long been :
Then make them competent .
Both bills suggest that courts " may appoint " ( in the Senate version ) or " shall consider " whether to appoint ( in the House version ) a " special master " qualified to determine the potential harm that would flow from the disclosure of information .
The Supreme Court first recognized the state secrets privilege in a 1953 case , United States v. Reynolds , in which the widows of military personnel sought infromation about the plane crash in which their husbands were killed .
When the crash reports were finally declassified and released almost 50 years later , they appeared to contain precious little truly sensitive information .
Had the Court then exercised the sort of review contemplated in the State Secrets Protection Act , the legal landscape of the past eight years might have looked very different indeed .
Nicholas Hughes , the son of the poets Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes , has hanged himself at the age of 47 .
The former fisheries scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks had carved out a successful scientific career in one of the remotest parts of the western world , but ultimately he could not escape the legacy of being the offspring of one of the most famous and tragic literary relationships of the 20th century .
Those who know little else about his mother know that she was the American - born poet who gassed herself in the kitchen of her north London home in February 1963 while her one - year - old son and his two - year - old sister , Frieda , slept in their cots in a nearby room .
Plath had placed towels around the kitchen door to make sure the fumes did not reach her children .
She had been distraught at the break - up of her relationship with Hughes , following her discovery of his infidelity .
Six years after their mother 's death , in 1969 , their father 's then partner , Assia Wevill , also killed herself , killing her four - year - old daughter Shura in the process .
Plath 's relationship with the future poet laureate has been the subject of numerous literary and personal memoirs and biographies , and even a film , as well as long - running attacks on her husband 's reputation and behaviour by some feminists .
She addressed one of her last poems , Nick and the Candlestick , to her baby son : " O love , how did you get here ?
O embryo …
In you , ruby /
The pain you wake to is not yours …
You are the one . "
Although Nicholas Hughes 's father maintained an anguished public silence about the tragedy , poems written at the time , published in the last year of his life , also spoke of his relationship with his son .
In a statement issued late on Sunday evening , Frieda Hughes reported : " It is with profound sorrow that I must announce the death of my brother Nicholas Hughes , who died by his own hand on Monday 16 March 2009 at his home in Alaska .
He had been battling depression for some time .
" His lifelong fascination with fish and fishing was a strong and shared bond with our father ( many of whose poems were about the natural world ) .
He was a loving brother , a loyal friend to those who knew him and despite the vagaries that life threw at him , he maintained an almost childlike innocence for the next project or plan . "
A report in the Fairbanks Daily News - Miner today by its columnist Dermot Cole understandably celebrates Hughes 's academic and personal qualities rather than his literary associations .
Noting that his initial scientific training had been at Oxford , Cole says he earned a doctorate at the University of Alaska in 1991 : " He made lasting friendships in Fairbanks with those who shared his inventive interests in such varied pursuits as stream ecology , pottery , woodworking , boating , bicycling , gardening and cooking the perfect pecan pie …
He spent countless summer hours in his research of grayling and salmon in the Chena river , exhibiting all the patience and wonder that defines a great fisherman .
One of his innovations was rigging underwater cameras to get a three - dimensional view of the fish feeding in the passing current . "
That interest may seem to pop psychologists an altogether more positive inherited legacy , of Ted Hughes 's passionate interest in fishing , and indeed his father made several visits to Alaska before his death in 1998 .
Nicholas 's particular academic specialism was in the behaviour of fish in currents .
A 2004 paper explored why larger fish swim upstream in the turbulence of midstream rather than in the quieter waters near the banks : " Large fish swim further from the bank to avoid wave drag , the resistance associated with the generation of surface waves when swimming close to the surface , " he wrote .
Hughes gave up his professorship two years ago to concentrate on pottery , although the paper said he continued his research with his partner , Christine Hunter , also a biologist .
Cole wrote : " A few times I called to let him know I would like to write about his life and his family connections whenever a news story about his parents appeared , but he did not think it was a good idea , so it never happened .
He deserved his privacy .
By and large , people in Fairbanks respected that , which is a good comment on our part of the world .
In Alaska he had the freedom and the opportunity to live on his own terms and be recognised for his own accomplishments .
Here he was not a literary figure forever defined by the lives of his parents . "
In Plath 's poems , he was her saviour
The shock and sadness of the news of Nicholas Hughes 's death is almost unbearable .
In his mother 's poetry , he was saviour and life force - at his birth , she wrote , " this great bluish , glistening boy shot out onto the bed in a wave of tidal water that drenched all four of us to the skin , howling lustily " , and he was for her the baby in the barn , " the one solid the spaces lean on " .
She loved her children , but not even loving them could save her , or , it now seems , him .
Her son tried to survive her , escaping to Alaska , pursuing the wild fish through the icy rivers , but in the end he swam back up stream to the terrible birth and death place .
Plath was heroic , in her struggles to create light and art from darkness , and so , I must and need to feel , was he .

Over the past year or so numerous wooden cars , some far more successful than others , have been appearing on the intertubes and seeing as i’m a sucker for wooden vehicles in general i thought it my duty to bring you a collection of the best that i’ve seen .
I come away from the Barcelona test feeling that this is going to be a great season of racing , but in a very different way from the McLaren vs Ferrari battles of the last two years .
The testing performances we have seen so far suggest that McLaren has , if not a mountain , then certainly a big hill to climb , while Ferrari , BMW and Toyota look very strong , one might almost say equally strong .
If the performance we ’ve seen here is carried over to the early part of the season , as it has been in recent years , then you could see Kubica , Heidfeld , Raikkonen , Massa , Trulli and Glock fighting for wins and podiums early on .
I do n’t think it will be too long before Alonso joins in either , as the Renault team made a big step forward this week thanks to a new front wing and underfloor parts .
They started behind and are still a bit behind , but closing in fast .
Kimi Raikkonen said that the Ferrari team has not yet pushed for the ultimate lap times , implying that there is more to come , but from what I saw in Barcelona there is little to choose between the top three teams on pace .
Certainly when the BMW does similar runs to the Ferrari , it sets similar lap times .
When it comes to racing , Toyota may have a slight disadvantage from not running KERS at some tracks early on , but they are adamant that the decision , taken early , not to start the season with KERS was the right one .
Their car is very driveable , predicatable and consistent .
Jarno
Trulli thinks he can do great work with it .
The car is still not as comfortable as some of its rivals over the kerbs , but it ’s a vast improvement on last year ’s model .
The new rules have cut the maximum downforce level available on the cars to below the level they used to have on low downforce tracks .
This has meant many things , but one of them is that braking stability is now harder to find , as downforce is an important part of getting the car slowed down .
I stood at the heavy braking zone at Turn 10 for a few hours this morning and studied this closely .
Everyone is more jittery than they were there last year , but if I had to pick a winner under braking I would say that it ’s the Ferrari .
The Brawn car is giving a little bit away there compared to the Toyotas and BMWs , and so is the Renault .

Council uses spy plane with thermal imaging camera to snoop on homes wasting energy
Our movements are already tracked by CCTV , speed cameras and even spies in dustbins .
Now snooping on the public has reached new heights with local authorities putting spy planes in the air to snoop on homeowners who are wasting too much energy .
Thermal imaging cameras are being used to create colour - coded maps which will enable council officers to identify offenders and pay them a visit to educate them about the harm to the environment and measures they can take .
A council has spent £ 30,000 using a spy plane carrying a thermal camera to determine which homes are wasting energy .
( File photo )
A scheme is already under way in Broadland District Council in Norfolk , which has spent £ 30,000 hiring a plane with a thermal imaging camera .
It said the exercise has been so successful other local authorities are planning to follow suit .
But critics have warned the crackdown was another example of local authorities extending their charter to poke their noses into every aspect of people 's lives .
Broadland , which covers towns including Aylsham , Reepham and Acle , hired the plane from a Leicestershire - based company for five days at the end of January .
The aircraft took images of homes and businesses , with those losing the most heat showing up as red , while better insulated properties appear blue .
The council 's head of environmental services , Andy Jarvis , said the original plan was to target businesses but it was realised the scope could be extended to include residental properties .
' The project we put together was for a plane to go up on various nights flying strips of the district and taking pictures , ' he said .
' Through those images , a thermal image photograph can be created in which you can pick out individual properties which are losing a lot of heat .
' We do a lot on domestic energy conservation already and realised it would be useful to see if any of the homes which were particularly hot were properties where people had not insulated their lofts .
' We were also able to look at very cold properties and think we might have picked up people on low incomes who are not heating their homes because they cannot afford to . '
More than half the UK 's carbon dioxide emissions come from the domestic sector , which includes property and transport .
Almost 60 per cent of a household 's heat is lost through uninsulated walls , lofts and windows , costing the average home £ 380 a year .
Insulation is estimated to reduce each home 's carbon emissions by around two tonnes annually .
The first city in the UK to make a heat - loss map was Aberdeen , while the first local authority in England was Haringey Council , in London - although environmental groups at that time said they viewed the practice as a ' gimmick ' of little real value .
The TaxPayers ' Alliance has added concerns about the issue of privacy .
Chief executive Matthew Elliott said : ' People are sick and tired of being heckled and spied on by local government and this council has shown an utter disregard for the man on the street . '
He added : ' We 're in a recession and you would have thought this council had better ways to spend £ 30,000 .
' Taxpayers are already footing the bill for innumerable advertising campaigns at a time when families are struggling to make ends meet . '
But Conservative - led Broadlands insisted the heat - loss map would allow officers to pinpoint offenders and point out how to get help and grants to improve insulation to cut carbon emissions .
Council leader Simon Woodbridge said the project would ' effectively pay for itself within a few weeks in terms of the amounts of money we can help people to save ' .
Lib Dem group leader Stuart Beadle added : ' Cameras are in place all over today and we have to accept them .
So long as the right guidelines are in place and it will bring benefits , I think the scheme is a good thing . '
Britain now has more than four million CCTV cameras - a fifth of those in use around the world - and around 8,000 speed cameras .
Almost 500 local authorities have been using anti-terrorism powers brought in under the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act to launch a string of bizarre investigations .
These have included checks on dog fouling , putting bins out on the wrong day and people trying to cheat school catchment area rules .
The Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , angered critics of the Iraq war yesterday when he indicated that a long - awaited inquiry into the planning and execution of the conflict , promised by the Prime Minister , would be held behind closed doors .
He told MPs that the inquiry would be approved " as soon as practicable " once most British combat troops had returned home at the end of July .
He admitted there were " important lessons to be learnt " from how the campaign was planned and carried out .
But Mr Miliband also suggested its proceedings should be held in secret , similar to the Franks inquiry into the Falklands War .
He said a private inquiry – proposed by the Conservatives – would prevent leaks , preserve the privacy of troops involved and enable those overseeing the investigation to see confidential Cabinet papers .
" It would preserve confidentiality that 's very , very important for all of our troops , " he said .
" The fact that [ Franks ] was conducted in private meant it had access to all the relevant papers .
Franks was not a judicial inquiry so it did not require its witnesses to have lawyers .
There were no leaks or interim findings to distract from the final conclusions and recommendations of the inquiry . "

The Tory motion stating there was " no reasonable impediment " to announcing a Privy Council inquiry ( over a judicial one ) was rejected 303 to 265 , a Government majority of 38 .
Mr Miliband 's statement came as relatives of some of those killed in the conflict delivered a letter to Downing Street demanding a full public inquiry .
A senior government source said a final decision over the type and scope of the inquiry was yet to be made but secret hearings could make the published findings far more comprehensive .
The Liberal Democrats said parts of the inquiry would have to be heard in camera for national security and privacy reasons but holding all proceedings in private would undermine public confidence in the process .
" The Labour Government and Conservative Party must not be allowed to stitch up the British public with the kind of narrow and secretive inquiry which would suit them both , " said Ed Davey , the Liberal Democrats ' foreign affairs spokesman .
" To be effective , this inquiry cannot sit in private and must be as open and transparent as possible .
" We cannot afford another whitewash like the Hutton report if we are to have any hope of restoring British democracy 's reputation at home and across the world . "
The Labour backbencher Jeremy Corbyn , who opposed the Iraq invasion , said the case for an inquiry had become " overwhelming " and called for it be " more open " than the one envisaged by the Conservatives .
Mr Miliband promised the inquiry would be " comprehensive " and focus on " both the conduct of the war and the conduct of the peace - building afterwards " .
But he would not confirm whether it would cover the Government 's use of intelligence in the run-up to the war , or whether Tony Blair misled Parliament over the threat posed by Saddam Hussein .
The Tories accused Mr Miliband of delaying the inquiry so that its potentially damaging findings would not be published before the next general election .
Mr Miliband said it would be approved as soon as possible after 31 July , when British forces in Iraq are reduced to a rump of under 400 personnel .
But since MPs head home for the summer recess from 22 July , a formal announcement of the inquiry could not be made before October .
The shadow Foreign Secretary , William Hague , said there was no " reasonable impediment " to beginning the inquiry straight away .
He called on Mr Miliband to make an announcement before Parliament breaks up for the summer .
" This should have been done long ago , " he said .
" It is alarming that by setting a date of 31 July , when Parliament will have adjourned for the summer , the Government are now dragging out at the setting up of an inquiry until the autumn .
This is unacceptable . "
Our entertainment , and it's hit - or - miss portrayal of interesting futures that " may yet come to pass " has set us up for and provided a colorful backdrop for the future of moral debates on sentience ; they provide a firm basis for us to objectively analyze the paradox that lies herein : would we see our own creations , albiet sentient ones , as deserving of our recognition ?
Should we believe they are as aware and applicable to the afterlife as we are simply because they learn , think , and grow as any other human being does , or are they merely dolls , mechanical puppets that exist to serve and amuse us , no matter how aware or human they may seem ?
Would it even be moral to create such a being , and if so , what rights should it be guaranteed ?
Children are " created " by a form of biochemical construction , and are therefore guaranteed rights that increase as they mature ; should the mechanical children of science applied by human hands be given the same rights , or should they be denied simply because the creation was " manufactured " in a different form , was born fully functional , and has ( we might assume ) a period of usefulness before planned obsolescence ?
Here that age - old adage that continues to encourage ignorance rears it 's ugly head : " Perhaps some things are better left unknown . "
Never before has the wild ( and granted , old ) notion of AI been possible , but rest assured , it is incredibly close , on the horizon even , so to speak .
True , we 've had computers and cloned organisms for years now , each being seen as a manner of creating a new intelligence , though the former cannot " learn " in the truest sense , and the latter is simply a form of copying a design of evolution or the divine , ( or both . )
( Though consider this : do cloned organisms have souls ?
Are they granted the same kind of consciousness and spiritual awareness their non-cloned relatives do ? )
Would a cloned human be an automaton , or as ordinary as any other child ?
Never before have we had the technology to even fathom how we might create an entirely new form of life , one outside the blueprint of the divine , with all the mental faculties we hold so dear , until now .
It 's right in there with nanotechnology ; with the ability to stack atoms just out of reach , we 're literally just a few short decades from realizing the medical boon of synthetic neurons and nervous tissue in general .
Imagine , if you will , the uses for such a wondrous technology !
With synthetic nervous tissues , extensive bodily damage that results in a loss of feeling in say , a limb or a section of skin can be restored , and more importantly , new types of brains and brain - like neural networks can be built .
Think about it : with the capability to build structures capable of functioning like the human brain , structures that are built of synthetic materials and to the specifications we set , the debates will heat up immediately .
Should we use this technology simply because we can ?
Is it moral to create a machine that can think better than any human in the history of the species , or a simple worker specifically designed to follow directions coded into it 's mind as a child , limited by undying obedience ?
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel ’s national election is likely to be a cliff - hanger , pollsters said on Monday , on the eve of a vote right - winger Benjamin Netanyahu ’s Likud party had been forecast to win .
“ The trend we ’ve seen the last few days indicates a very close battle , ” said pollster Rafi Smith of the Smith Research Center .
“ No one has jumped ahead and it ’s tough to call . ”
Likud has been the front - runner since November , after Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni of the ruling , centrist Kadima party forced a new election by failing to form a new government following Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’s resignation in a corruption scandal .
Smith said the gap between Likud and its closest rival , Kadima , has narrowed , with Avigdor Lieberman of the far - right Yisrael Beiteinu party drawing support from traditional Likud backers .
“ At least 10 percent of voters are still undecided , and they will determine the outcome , ” Smith said .
Pollster Dori Shadmon of the TNS Israel institute said with about a dozen parties in serious contention for seats in the 120 - member parliament , predicting a result was difficult .
“ It ’s a close fight and it ’s still open , ” Shadmon said .
The election race has focused on security issues in the wake of Israel ’s 22 - day Gaza offensive .
“ There has n’t been much excitement about this election .
They have n’t really been talking about the issues people care about , ” said Alex Mayorenko , 22 , a Jerusalem resident .
“ There are only small distinctions between the candidates , not enough to really make a difference . ”
In the occupied West Bank , Palestinians said they harbored few hopes the Israeli election heralded a change for the better .
“ We have tried the Likud , Kadima and Labor parties , and each one of them obstructs the peace process in its own way , ” said Imad Saify , 38 , from Ramallah .

STRATEGY CHANGE
Leading candidates have stepped up efforts to try to woo those still on the fence , mostly by attacking rivals .
Netanyahu ’s camp , which has watched its numbers steadily drop , reversed its strategy of laying low by describing the popular Lieberman and his fiery rhetoric as a passing phenomenon and a wasted vote .
Lieberman , who immigrated from the Soviet Union in 1978 , wants to trade land on which many of Israel ’s 1.5 million Arab citizens live for West Bank Jewish settlements in any peace deal with the Palestinians .

Critics have described that policy as anti-Arab , along with his demand that all Israelis be required to swear allegiance to the Jewish state in order to vote or hold elected office .
Livni , who hopes to become the first female prime minister since Golda Meir in the 1970s , has painted Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak of Labor , both former prime ministers , as failures .
Israeli President Shimon
Peres chided candidates for focusing on personality issues rather than on matters at the core of the Israeli - Arab conflict .
“ The country ’s burning issues were n’t properly addressed or fully given voice in the election campaign , ” Peres told Israel Radio .
“ There is always a personal side to elections ... what has surprised me is the proportion between the two . ”
In Tuesday ’s election , the Knesset ’s seats are allocated by proportional representation to national party lists .
Once the results are in , Peres consults with party leaders and picks a legislator to try to form a government .
Traditionally , the task goes to the leader of the party that wins the most votes and he or she has 42 days to put together an administration .
In a last - minute move , Olmert , who remains caretaker prime minister until a new government is formed , endorsed Livni on camera for the first time .
Livni had called for Olmert ’s resignation after the 2006 Lebanon war that many Israelis saw as a failure .
Political sources said their relationship has been rocky since .

As you can figure from up above , I 've had a good run through my Final Fantasy 7 game at least three times .
And as you 've also likely figured out by now , FF7 is a rather popular game .
In fact , it may be THE game of this entire generation -- every time a general video game website opens a survey or poll for " best game , " about 60 percent of the people who come shout , " FF7 !!
IT 'S FF7 !! "
Then come the ones who scream " NO NO YOU IDIOTS DIDN'T YOU EVER HAVE A SUPER NES ? ? "
" But FF7 rocked ! " " FF6 WAS BETTER THAN FF7 , YOU WERE JUST BLINDED BY THE CINEMAS !!
GET LOST , YOU IGNORANT PEONS !! "
" But FF7 ROCKED !! "
" SHUT UP !! "
The SNES may have been the better system all - around , but more people rediscovered their love of gaming through the PS1 , technically the first " hip for adults " console .
And what 's the first game most of them picked up ?
FF7 .
Add to that , FF7 had one of the best stories I 've ever seen anywhere , and it did n't have a lame sequel one year later that killed all interest in the original .
You can't claim " shallow graphics appeal " anymore either -- I had to revisit the game to make this page and it has n't gotten any younger .
When you jump from Star Ocean 3 to this , it really looks like it could join all those SNES titles .
It 's only a matter of time before Hot Topic starts selling Cloud T - shirts .
Yet even if you 're the biggest FF7 freak in the world , you still have n't seen the entire game .
At least I hope you have n't -- if you 're already familiar with everything in this article , it 'll be a lot less surprising and hold less entertainment value .
But to really see ALL of FF7 , you must get ahold of a save in the DEBUG ROOM .
This is a raw series of rooms which the testers used to play the game and find glitches and errors .
Square left it in , figuring no one would ever find it there .
In the Information Age , nothing remains " unfound " .... so it 's time for the tour !
When you first enter the DEBUG ROOM , either through a specially - made save ( like mine ) or through a Gameshark hack , you 're in the main hub , which looks like this .
To get elsewhere and do something , just walk on any button , or any direction except left .
Takashi Tokita and Masato Kato are ... two people whose names are nowhere in the credits of the actual game .
The weird mark by one of the buttons is actually Yuffie seen from the top down .
Talking to her lets you block all the battles or movies , or both , or unblock them , or whatever .
I wonder what FULL NAME does .
I guess that is pretty full .
I first guided MMMMMMMMMMMM to room # 1 .
Its position is actually three o'clock on the map , but judging by the message you get from entering and the early places you can go , I 'd say it 's the first room .... and it has Aeris , Sephiroth , a green intoxicated Barret on the floor , a small dolphin , and that old man who was hidden in the mountains and would n't tell you anything until you gave him Chocobo food .
From here you can get to many places on the first disc , although you 'll have to deal with Cloud being named " ster " and Barret being named " Ballet . "
Here 's the real treat : if you talk to the green Barret and select " Before Memory , " you get the scene in Tifa 's hideout .... BUT , it 's DIFFERENT !
You get ... A DELETED SCENE !!
To recap :
In the original , when Cloud went down here , Tifa said a few things ... then Barret said a few things , then Barret threw Wedge right at the camera and started boxing while his daughter watched him .
Cloud talked to everyone in the room , and went back up to the main floor .... at which point Tifa followed him and told him not to bail out on her because they made a promise at a well when they were children .
Here 's what happens in this version of that part of the story , and it has no words since they scrapped it before translation time .
Cloud goes down here again , but this time , everyone cares about what he has to say .
" What 's that , Cloud ? " " A glowing rock I picked up back at the Mako Reactor .
I bet you wish you had one .
It 's neato torpedo ! "
" And I .... URGGG ... GAAAK ...NO !
It 's making me FREAK OUT and SHAKE MY HEAD A LOT !! "
" I knew it !
He 's vulnerable to Kryptonite !
That proves Cloud is from another planet !
Ha ha , Cloud is from another planet ! ! "
" NO IT'S NOT !
It 's just Materia .
He 's probably allergic or something . "
" WHATCHOO TALKIN ' BOUT , FOO ??
YOU DUNNO BOUT MATERIA ??
AW , I PITY DA FOO !
DOOD , YOU SO DENSE !!
HERE'S HOW TO DO IT RIGHT .... "
So apparently this was the original spot where the Materia tutorial was placed .
The difference between this and the final version is , since Cloud himself does n't know , there 's no way to skip the tutorial .
In the final , as they 're about to board the train Barret suddenly says , " Hey Cloud , uh , uh , I dunno how to use Materia ! "
I always thought that sounded rather awkward , and here 's the reason why ... it was added later .
Since Cloud became the one giving the tutorial , he could refuse Barret and the player could then skip it .
" So now you know how to use Materia !
But I 'm still angry , ' cuz we out of donuts !
So I gonna BLOW HOLES IN YOU ALL !!
RAAAAAAAA !!! "
* RATATATATATATAT *
Yes , Barret shoots at his teammates ... several rounds .
They must be blanks because nobody even moves .
( ( Jessie gets in the middle ) ) " COOL IT , YOU TWO !
We have to prepare for tomorrow night ! "
" Why , Jessie ?
What are we going to do tomorrow night ? "
" The same thing we do EVERY night .... TRY TO TAKE OVER SHINRA ! "
Tifa : " Let 's just get some sleep , okay ? "
The screen fades to black and the " sleep " music plays , then Cloud wakes up in the empty hideout room and things seem back to usual .
Until he walks outside .... the deleted scene is n't over yet !
As Cloud walks out the door , he 's called back by Tifa .
" Where are you going ?
Would you just walk out on your childhood friend ? "
Hey , it 's the well scene !
But it 's outside instead !
It looks like in the original , Cloud was allowed to walk all the way out the door before Tifa called him back .
We 're back to the previous night again , since the other deleted scene would n't let Cloud go back to the first floor .
But if it would n't , then when was he supposed to do this ?
Maybe it was unfinished ...
This is the best part ... as Cloud and Tifa talk , the neighbors who were outside hear them bickering and then crawl on their hands and knees and hide behind the lamppost to secretly watch them fight .
When Brijmohan and Ruchi Gupta 's baby was born , the young couple were nothing less than stunned .
Their joy over the arrival of their first - born , Dimpy , was tempered by anguish over their son's twisted snarl of a mouth .
" We were shocked to see it .
We had never seen anything like it before , either in our family or elsewhere , " said Mr Gupta , sitting today at Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram hospital .

In India , an estimated 35,000 children are born with cleft deficiencies every year .
In the past those children may have been condemned to lives of ridicule , hardship and discrimination , but because of the efforts of a charity , those children now have a second chance .
And it does n't cost them a rupee .
The work of the global charity Smile Train was featured in the 39 - minute film Smile Pinki , which netted the best short documentary award at this year 's Oscars .
Directed by American filmmaker Megan Mylan , the film tells the story of Pinki Devi , an eight - year - old girl from the state of Uttar Pradesh who underwent surgery to repair a cleft lip for which she was once mocked as " hothkati " - the girl with the torn lip .
" Thank you Pinki .
Thank you for letting me tell your incredible story , " said Ms Mylan during her acceptance speech .
Watch a trailer for ' Smile Pinki '
Like Pinki's parents , Mr and Mrs Gupta had no idea that their child 's problem could be solved by straight - forward surgery .
At the hospital , staff explained to them that the operation could take as little as an hour .
Three month - old Dimpy will undergo surgery in a couple of days .
" We 're much more relaxed now that we 've had it explained .
Now we 've no worries .
We 've seen other people in the same situation , " said Mrs Gupta .
Dr Rakesh Khazanchi is the head of the hospital 's department of plastic surgery .
He said that all parents are shocked until they discover that the problem of a cleft lip or palate can be repaired simply .
While a cleft lip was largely a problem of appearance , a cleft palate meant someone could suffer from problems with speaking , eating , facial development and dental set - backs .
" If it is just a lip problem then one operation may be enough , " he said .
" If it is a palate they may need three or four [ until after puberty ] . "
In the past 10 years , Smile Train has funded around 400,000 operations to repair cleft palates .
Of those 150,000 have been in India .
This year , the charity expects to pay for 50,000 such operations here , a figure which means they are slowly starting to tackle India 's backlog of cases .
" We always say that cleft palates are not a medical problem but an economic problem , " said Satish Kalra , the charity 's South Asia director .
" The incidence of clefts is as high in the UK as it is in the [ impoverished Indian state of ]
Bihar - around one in seven hundred .
It 's an economic problem , so let 's solve it .
You can treat someone for as little as $ 250 ( 150 STERLING ) . "
Mr Kalra said that in rural India there was still a huge amount of superstition and myth attached to clefts .
The most common , he said , was that if a pregnant woman used a knife or scissors during a solar eclipse her child would suffer the defect .
Such has been the spread of this belief that in the southern Indian language of Telugu , the phrase for a cleft is " lip of the eclipse " .
Elsewhere , where a child 's pre-maxilla protrudes through the gap created by the cleft , they are often likened to Ganesh , the elephant God .
" Invariably if these children are boys they will be called Viniyaka , one of the names of Ganesh , " said Mr Kalra .
At Sir Ganga Ram hospital , Kelsang Choetso and her 16 - month - old daughter Dolma had also been seeing the staff .
When her daughter was born with a cleft lip and palate , Mrs Kelsang said she had fainted .
" This was the first time I had seen anything like it .
I thought I must have eaten something wrong during the pregnancy , " she said .

But now , following two operations , her daughter ' face has been largely repaired .
In a couple of months , specialists will operate again to build up her nose .
When they have finished , there will be no trace of the problem that once disfigured her .
That has also been the case of Pinki , the beaming star of the Oscar - winning movie .
But while she was flown to Los Angeles to enjoy the ceremony , fatigue got the better of her before the award was announced .
Dr Subodh Kumar Singh , the Varanasi - based surgeon who performed her operation , told the BBC : " Before the awards , she was very good on the red carpet and posed for pictures with the rest of the team .
But she got tired and fell asleep . "
The man who revealed his plot to shoot up the Super Bowl was sentenced to just over one year in prison Monday .
Kurt William Havelock , 36 , received the sentence from U.S. District Judge Roslyn Silver .
She estimated that with the time Havelock has already served , the Tempe resident will be home with his family in about five weeks .
A jury convicted Havelock in June of six counts of mailing threatening communications related to the incident that occurred on Feb. 3 , the same day Super Bowl XLII was played in Glendale .
That afternoon , Havelock mailed an eight - page manifesto to media outlets and drove to University of Phoenix Stadium with an AR - 15 rifle and six magazine clips containing 30 bullets each .
But he had a change of heart near the stadium and turned himself in to Tempe police later that night .
Havelock 's parents were with him that evening , and his mother , Jan , recalled the scene in a tearful plea for mercy before Silver on Monday .
Jan Havelock thought her son was going to receive psychological counseling for his offenses until FBI agents showed up and arrested him , she said .
" They said ' He 's not going to the hospital , he 's going to jail , ' " Jan Havelock recalled .
Judge Silver was clearly concerned with Havelock 's treatment options once he is released from prison , noting on multiple occasions during the hearing that Havelock will be required to receive treatment through probation officials .
Silver sealed the courtroom for more than 30 minutes while attorneys discussed findings from Havelock 's mental - health evaluation with the judge .
She said Havelock had shown remorse for the situation from the time he set foot in the Tempe police station , calling it " an unusual situation when Mr. Havelock created a danger to the community but from the outset accepted responsibility . "
" I am not going to punish Mr. Havelock any more under the law , " Silver said .
Havelock , who wept at the defense table while his mother and father read their statements , told Silver he knew he was doing wrong from the moment he dropped the letters in the mailbox .
" I 'll never do anything like this again , " he said .
" I just want to take care of my children and my family . "
Havelock told authorities he was under pressure and struggling with debt as a result of the floundering Tempe bar and grill he spent $ 200,000 on .
He said he was upset with the Tempe City Council , whose members in October 2007 would not recommend him to the state board for a particular liquor license .
Havelock blamed the council for his not being able to provide for his fiancee and their three young children .
According to the manifesto , his response was to " slay your children .
I will shed the blood of the inno- cent . "
The Iraqi Prisoner February 18 , 2009
I ’ve already noted how closely the actions of the Bush administration , and conservative fiscal policies in general , correspond to a venerable con game called the “ Bust - out , ” in which fraudsters pretending to take an interest in running a business use a down payment to gain access to the company ’s credit lines and assets , then max out all the credit lines , sell off assets at fire sale prices , then clear out just before the deposit check bounces , leaving a bankrupted company hollowed out by unpayable debt .
Readings new stories of how U.S. contractors and military personnel appear to have siphoned off billions of dollars supposedly targeted for Iraq reconstruction projects , an even more venerable con game comes to mind : “ The Spanish Prisoner , ” in which the mark is induced to pay out large sums of money to secure the release of some unidentified prince being held overseas , in some vaguely defined location , with the understanding that the contribution will be returned tenfold when the grateful prisoner wins his freedom and showers his supporters with royal largesse .
A variation of this con , known to police as “ 419 Fraud ” or “ Advance Fee Fraud , ” has probably turned up in your e-mail — instead of liberating a prisoner , the pigeon is asked to help broker the release of a big pot of money in a West African bank .
The target usually expects to get a phat return on the initial investment , but sometimes the con men are also milking the target ’s idealism or charitable impulses .
To get a picture of how it works , watch House of Games , David Mamet ’s first and best film , in which the psychologist heroine is drawn into a long con with the promise of helping her patient get free of his gambling debts .
( Though Mamet went on to make another film called The Spanish Prisoner , that con actually does n’t figure in the plot , curiously enough . )
Michael Caine ’s character in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is also running a similar scam by convincing rich widows he ’s a deposed prince trying to raise money for freedom fighters back home .
The designation of Bush ’s little Middle East killing spree as “ Operation Iraqi Freedom ” was already a museum - quality specimen of Orwellian Newspeak when he rolled it out , but it becomes even more richly ironic when we consider how the American people were gulled into thinking that by throwing open their coffers to the Bush banditos , they could secure the liberation of the Iraqi people from a cruel dictator in a place many of them could n’t have found on a map if they had a three - day head start .
In return for pretending the whole thing was a John Wayne movie with extra sand on the sets , they would get cheap oil and a nice friendly regime that would recognize Israel and provide us with free military bases , along with the promised cascades of candy and flowers .
Remember how we were told the whole thing would pay for itself once the good guys got their hands on all those oil wells ?
Those were the days , huh ?
Meanwhile , while Bush ’s cronies went on looting with both hands here in the States , another team of con-men ( maybe even some freelancers — who could tell , with so much money flying around ? ) tapped into the tsunami — one might even call it the surge — of unmonitored cash flowing into the country .
In return , we got a taxpayer - funded training ground for aspiring Islamist terrorists , a pseudo - government composed of crooks , religious fanatics and terrorist sympathizers ( kind of like the GOP , when you think about it ) and a host of brand - new regional worries that will plague the world long after Bush has strutted off to that great gated community in the sky .
The only upside I can see to any of this is that political science students attempting to grasp the nature of conservatism need no longer waste any more time studying Friedman , Oakeshott or any of the other great minds of wingerdom .
They need only read the latest e-mails from Nigeria , and everything they need to know about conservatism will become crystal - clear .
Maggots ' Taste For Flesh May Cure Leg Ulcers
An ancient but uncommon therapy may help avoid amputation .
March 20 , 2009  --
With a worsening ulcer and the threat of losing a foot , Pam Mitchell was willing to try something drastic ; she had live maggots put in her wound .
" I did n't have a choice , I did n't have any options , I had to have [ it ] amputated , " she recalled .
But she heard about maggot therapy from a friend who had seen it on The Learning Channel .
While it took some convincing of her doctors , Mitchell said they agreed to try it before amputation .
Her dermatologist , she recalled , said , " Why not , let 's try it . "
The doctors sent off to a lab in California to have specially bred maggots shipped in , although Mitchell believes they probably did it to show her it would n't work .
But in Mitchell 's case , it did .
Consuming the dead tissue , the maggots , it seems , were able to help the wound heal and prevent the foot from being amputated .
In the course of 10 treatments with maggots , the ulcer in her foot , which had become a gaping hole before therapy , began to get better .
Mitchell also took antibiotics to help avoid further infection .
" Every time we used them , my foot filled in a little bit more , each time , " said Mitchell , 56 , of Akron , Ohio , who now speaks about the therapy as a representative of the BioTherapeutics , Education & Research Foundation in Irvine , Calif .
The company is headed by Dr. Ronald Sherman , a now - retired professor at the University of California - Irvine who studied maggot therapy for more than 20 years in healing wounds that other therapies were n't repairing .
Now a new study in the British Medical Journal , headed by researchers at the University of York in England , reports that maggot therapy is about as effective as conventional therapies at healing leg ulcers .
The fly maggots cleaned the wound slightly faster , but did not increase the overall rate of healing .
Also , the maggot treatment was much more painful in the early stages .
" In people with leg ulcers , we did n't find that larval therapy increased healing rates , " said Nicky Cullum , head of the Department of Health Sciences at the University of York .
" It cleans it more quickly , but it did n't heal it more quickly . "
Maggots Not a Turn - Off for Patients
But , like Mitchell , she found that patients were not averse to treatment with the maggots .
" One thing we did find is that patients were not put off .
... The patients were very enthusiastic , " she said .
Cullum noted that the procedure , which had been used since ancient Rome , was likely without much hazard .
It has been approved by both the United Kingdom 's National Health Service and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
" There 's no reason to suspect they 're not safe , " Cullum said .
Researchers used maggots from a species of fly known variably as the sheep blowfly or the green bottlefly , which is probably known to most people for its gathering around deceased humans and animals , although it can congregate around live ones as well .
But some questions remain .
While he declined to speak about the medical effectiveness of the therapy , Richard Wall , a zoologist at the University of Bristol , noted that there is no guarantee that the flies will not eat live flesh as well as the dead tissue .
" They will try to do so , if they are overcrowded , " Wall said .
" The key thing is that the number of maggots needs to be kept fairly low to prevent this ; then they will feed happily on the [ dead ] tissue .
So , working out the correct numbers is critical .
When these maggots kill sheep , it 's because you get very high numbers on a single animal . "
Sherman , who has done a number of trials on maggot therapy during the years , said that he had not observed anything similar in humans .
Although he noted that he tries to avoid having too many maggots on a wound , recommending five to eight maggots per square centimeter .
During her treatment , Mitchell said , there were too many maggots in her foot , which caused some pain when they swelled up after eating the dead tissue .
" When they come out , they 're fat , like puffed rice , " Mitchell said .
Not Very Controversial but Not Very Well Known
Dermatologists contacted by ABCNews.com said the therapy appeared to be effective overall , but was clearly not well known .
No Maggot Therapy in Medical School
" If it works , what 's wrong with it ? " said Dr. Eliot Ghatan , a dermatologist in Brooklyn , N.Y .
" If you have a fancy medication here , it does n't mean you can throw out effective therapeutic methods of the past . "
He added , however , that , " It 's not very well known .
When you go to medical school , they do n't teach you about maggot therapy . "
Dr. Conway Huang , director of dermatologic surgery and cutaneous laser surgery at the University of Alabama , echoed those statements .
" It 's not something that is taught to doctors in training .
Residency programs ... we do n't teach our residents this , " he said .
" Current methods of wound healing are probably more convenient and nearly as effective , if not as effective . "
Despite their familiarity with the therapy , neither Ghatan nor Huang have performed it on a patient or had it requested by a patient .
For his part , Sherman said that while his own experience has been different , he was pleased that a maggot study was published .
" I think it 's great news that they finally did a study of maggot therapy that follows patients all the way to wound closure , " he said .
The therapy was researched heavily in the 1930s by Dr. William Baer at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , but was ultimately replaced by antibiotics , which remain the standard of care .
Considering All Options
The British study , commissioned by the National Health Service , was done , in part , to determine the cost effectiveness of maggot therapy versus regular therapy .
The researchers concluded that there was not a significant difference in cost effectiveness .
Sherman attributes that to the fact that the form of maggot therapy examined in the British study used more conventional drugs than his own version of the treatment .
While Sherman does not believe conventional treatments should be abandoned as the first line of treatment against skin ulcers , he hopes that maggot therapy will be recognized as an alternative when conventional therapies do not heal patients .
No One Product Works for Everybody
" Neither maggot therapy nor the standard of care is 100 percent effective , or else there would n't be 2,000 wound - care products on the market , " he said .
" The reason there are so many wound - care products is there is n't a single product that works for everybody , so what you want to do is pick something that has the best chance of efficacy .
" If that does n't work , then you need an alternative , and you want that alternative to have the best chance . "

The government decided Sunday not to limit the entry of food product to the Gaza Strip , following criticism voiced by the United States and Europe over Israel 's crossings policy .
According to the new decision , " The Israeli government is instructing the elements engaged in the matter to allow the free transfer of food products to Gaza 's residents from all relevant sources , after ensuring that they are indeed food products – as part of the humanitarian efforts .

The decision was made alongside another government decision related to its policy regarding Hamas and Islamic Jihad prisoners jailed in Israel , following the failure to reach an agreement on kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit 's release .
In this second decision , the government instructed all the relevant bodies not to grant the prisoners any privilege which is not required by law and according to the treaties the State of Israel is committed to .
This decision was made after Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann briefed the ministers on the recommendations of a ministerial committee appointed to discuss the imprisonment conditions of Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel .
The government also approved the appointment of a professional team headed by the prisons commissioner and comprised of representatives of the attorney general , the Israel Prison Service , the Israel Defense Forces and the Shin Bet security services , which will act to restrict the privileges given to security prisoners affiliated with Hamas and the Islamic Jihad .
The team will issue instructions to the relevant bodies within two weeks .

CHIGAGO — The rough draft of the Neanderthal genome is complete .
Using 38,000 - year - old bone fragments and new shotgun sequencing technology , researchers have sequenced 3.7 billion base pairs of Neanderthal DNA .
That 's more than the 3 billion base pairs expected in the final draft of the genome , but many of the snippets of genetic code are repeats .
At this stage scientists have just 63 percent of the hominid genome completely sequenced .
Still , even with a rough draft , scientists can begin to isolate the genetic variations that are uniquely , irreducibly human .
" The first big goal of this project , which is really about understanding our evolution , is this catalog of [ evolutionary ] changes , " said the project leader , Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany .
" The second goal is finding evidence of positive selection , of where something changed in our ancestors that really made a difference in how we reproduce and survive . "
Neanderthals are our closest relatives on the hominid family tree .
We split from them about 500,000 years ago and for the next 475,000 years or so , modern humans and Neanderthals coexisted on the planet and sometimes even in the same region .
The relationship between humans and our cousins has inspired lots of ideas about sex and war .
Recently scientists have speculated that Neanderthals and humans in Europe could have interbred , while others have speculated that humans killed off the Neanderthals .
The draft genome does not yet provide enough evidence to answer some of the big questions about the relationship between humans and our cousins , but already little details are emerging .
For example , last year the team revealed that a gene known to be important in the development of speech was present in the Neanderthal genome .
" There 's no reason to think they [ could n't ] articulate as we do , although there are many more genes related to speech , " Pääbo told reporters at the AAAS annual meeting in Chicago , which runs through Monday .
We also know that Neanderthals were sophisticated toolmakers and were highly intelligent , although that remains a subject of debate .
The question becomes , then , what switch was thrown that allowed modern humans to surpass all previous hominid species and become the world - dominating predator that we are ?
" Why are Neanderthals so important to us and why do we want to know about their genome ?
Because the Neanderthals represent the last divergent branch of the human evolutionary bush , " said Jean - Jacques
Hublin , who studies evolution at the Planck Institute .
" Studying the
Neanderthal genome tells us what makes modern humans really modern and really human . "
In small ways , studying the Neanderthal genome tells us something about Neanderthals , too .
For example , Pääbo revealed that Neanderthals did n't possess a mutation often found in humans that allows us to metabolize lactose , which lets cow 's milk do a body good .
" We can start looking at interesting genes to start seeing what Neanderthals might have been like , " he said .
With the draft completed , the researchers will try to collect more
DNA and sequence it faster to get a " deeper " read on the genome , increasing its accuracy and filling in the gaps .
They now have five archaeological sites from which they can recover genetic fragments , including a new excavation in Spain that is taking precautions to prevent destroying or contaminating the fragile genes .
The more complete and redundant sequencing effort will allow the scientists to isolate genes unique to the Neanderthals , not just variations on human genes .
By sequencing 15 or 20 times as many base pairs as exist in the Neanderthal genome , the researchers will be able to separate mistakes from unique genes .
" We 're going to sequence things much deeper , get 15 to 20 times coverage , " Pääbo said .
" Then , we 'll be able to believe things that are
Neanderthal - specific . "
But do n't get your hopes up for creating a Neanderthal clone , a real - life Encino Man meets Jurassic Park .
Researchers say that will remain technically impossible .

DATE : March 1994
* POSITION : prescriptive access and research
* SUPPORTING STATEMENTS : " First , there is good evidence that THC is an effective anti-emetic agent for patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy .
...
Second , there is reasonable evidence for the potential efficacy of THC and marijuana in the tre atment of glaucoma , especially in cases which have proved resistant to existing anti-glaucoma agents .
Further research is ... required , but this should not prevent its use under medical supervision in poorly controlled cases .
...
Third , there is suffici ent suggestive evidence of the potential usefulness of various cannabinoids as analgesic , anti asthmatic , anti-spasmodic , and anti-convulsant agents to warrant basic pharmacological and experimental investigation and ... clinical research into their effectiveness .
" ...
Despite the positive appraisal of the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids ... , they have not been widely used .
...
Part of the reason for this is that research on the therapeutic use of these compounds has become a casualty of the debate in th e United States about the legal status of cannabis .
...
As a community we do not allow this type of thinking to deny the use of opiates for analgesia .
Nor should it be used to deny access to any therapeutic uses of cannabinoid derivatives that may be re vealed by pharmacological research . "

Increasingly , Gov. Bobby Jindal is being likened to Kenneth , the dweeby page on ' 30 Rock . ' | Composite image by POLITICO Jindal 's Kenneth problem
Bobby Jindal has a wunderkind resume : a Rhodes Scholar appointed assistant secretary of Health and Human Services at age 29 , elected to the U.S. House at 33 and governor of Louisiana at 36 .
Increasingly , though , he ’s being likened to Kenneth , the dweeby page on “ 30 Rock . ”
Advertisement
The politically devastating comparisons started popping right up after Jindal delivered the Republican response to President Barack Obama ’s address a joint session of Congress .
And they ’ve spread like wildfire on the Internet .
“ Close your eyes and think of Kenneth from ‘ 30 Rock . ’
I can barely count the number of e-mails making that observation , ” Andrew Sullivan wrote on his blog minutes after Jindal ’s speech .
The comparison was also made that night by Talking Points Memo , The Huffington Post and Gawker .
Now the wunderkind governor , who ’s often mentioned as a GOP presidential prospect , is struggling to overcome his association with this generation 's version of Gomer Pyle .
And his predicament is organic , as opposed to the biting parodies of Sarah Palin on “ Saturday Night Live . ”
Several Facebook groups dedicated to the comparison have sprung up .
The latest , “ Bobby Jindal is Kenneth the Page , ” had more than 20,000 members on Friday .
In comparison , nearly 34,000 people list themselves as fans of Jindal on the social networking site .
Nine YouTube videos splicing the governor ’s speech with clips of Kenneth the Page have been viewed by at least 10,000 people and the video of the Kenneth responding to Jindal on “ Late Night ” in which he calls Jindal a “ goober ” was featured prominently on The Huffington Post and other sites .
“ These parodies take hold very , very quickly , ” said Michael W. Robinson , a senior vice president at Levick Strategic Communications and former communications director for the Justice Department in the last Bush administration .
“ If [ Jindal ] does n’t address this quickly the caricature will become the character . ”
In Louisiana , the governor ’s communications director sought to play down the comparisons .
“ Being compared to Kenneth the Page is a whole lot better than what past Louisiana governors have been compared to , ” Melissa Sellers said .
“ Kenneth sounds like Clark Gable . ”
The content of Jindal ’s speech was not the major issue , though it was also panned by some .
It was his appearance and awkward delivery from the Louisiana Governor ’s Mansion in Baton Rouge .
“ The Internet is abuzz with comparisons of Jindal to ‘ Kenneth the Page , ’ the naive , irretrievably nerdy bumpkin from the NBC comedy ‘ 30 Rock , ’ ” wrote Mary Katherine Ham on the Weekly Standard ’s blog .
“ The comparison is unfortunate for several reasons , not least of all because it signals the undue influence of Tina Fey on national politics may continue unabated .
It 's also catchy , and was not terribly unfair after last night 's speech , ” she said .
“ But on any other day of his career , it would have been a total mischaracterization of his skills , which are considerable . ”
Appearing on CNN amid all the speech fuss , Jindal told Larry King that he hoped people would “ look at the content of the speech , not just the delivery . ”
“ You know , for years , I 've been told I speak too quickly , ” Jindal said .
“ Now , I 'm told I speak too slowly . ”
Jindal is certainly not the first politician to be caught up in parody .
On “ Saturday Night Live , ” Dana Carvey ’s impressions of George H.W. Bush and Ross Perot became entrenched in their public persona , as did Chevy Chase ’s parody of Gerald Ford and Will Ferrell ’s impression of George W. Bush .
“ Gerald Ford played football at Michigan , but everyone remembers the Chevy Chase character , ” Robinson said .
While these past political parodies were most often dismissed as distractions , getting known as “ that politician that reminds me of Kenneth ” may prove to be problematically for Jindal .
The governor may be hot talk in the insider political circles , but he ’s not yet a household name in Iowa or New Hampshire .
According to a recent NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll , 57 percent of Americans either have never heard of Jindal or had no opinion about him .
Only 15 percent of the 1,007 surveyed people said they held a favorable view of him .
“ Often times for candidates , the best things they can do for themselves is to let their image grow positively in an organic way , and that ’s what Bobby Jindal had .
But some overreach and try to get in the spotlight with some big speech , ” said Ben Porritt , a public relations consultant who was as a spokesman on the McCain - Palin campaign .
“ Political figures try to do too much to build an image that they think people want , and it ’s not always necessary , ” Porritt said .
Already , Jindal ’s public image may have been shaped outside of his control , a precarious situation for any politician .
“ Those kinds of popular conceptions grab hold , ” Robinson said .
“ People do n’t have time to think ‘ What did he do on health care ? ’
It ’s easier to think ‘ Oh , that ’s the guy who reminds me of blank . ’ ”
Jindal , though , still has plenty of time to recoup .
“ Political figures have an ability to really remake their image over a long or short period of time , ” Porritt said .
“ Two decades ago , Joe Biden was the laughing stock of presidential politics .
and now he is vice president . ”
In 1992 , Porritt noted , Bill Clinton , looking to polish his image as a Democratic presidential candidate , played the saxophone on Arsenio Hall ’s show .
And just last year , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was able to counter Tina Fey ’s damaging parody by appearing with Fey on “ Saturday Night Live . ”
She was widely applauded for it and was able to ease some of the most harmful public sentiments about her candidacy .
Jindal has not yet hit the late - night circuit , but Robinson suggested he might consider it .
“ He ’s gotta move this off the agenda so people can remember that he was a Rhodes scholar and one of the youngest members of Congress , ” Robinson said .
“ It ’s not like this is some obscure Showtime show , we ’re talking about a major primetime show . ”
“ He needs to find a high - profile venue to address this , and it ’s got to be done quickly , ” Robinson added .
“ If you let it lay , then people ’s impressions will harden . ”
What 's new pussycat ?
The dolphin who made friends with a curious tiger
By Sarah Titterton
Like a cat peering into a goldfish bowl , Akaasha the tiger cub is transfixed by a dolphin staring back at her .
Curiosity got the better of both Akaasha and Mavrick , a 14 - month - old dolphin who 's probably more used to a crowd of human faces gazing into his glass tank at a Californian theme park .
Staff were taking six - month - old Akaasha on her daily walk around the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom when she saw Mavrick , a 14 - month - old Atlantic bottlenose dolphin .
Paws for thought : Mavrick and Akaasha have a close encounter as another dolphin looks on
The pair examined each other from all angles possible - then the dolphin blew an approving bout of bubbles towards the tiger .
Staff were taking Akaasha , who is a six - month - old female tiger cub , on her daily walk around the theme park when she noticed Mavrick , who is a 14 - month - old Atlantic bottlenose dolphin yesterday .
Snout to whiskers :
Their shared curiousity meant Mavrick dipped down to get a better view and Akaasha strained to get closer to the glass
Mavrick cocked his head as Akaasha strained to get closer to the glass , perhaps bewildered as to why she could not catch the scent of this strange new creature grinning at her from another world .
It may be the start of a beautiful friendship .
Nice to meet you : Mavrick blows an approving bunch of bubbles at the entranced tiger cub

 WHS ) Standing committee on Justice and Social Policy 1st session , 37th Parliament | 1re session , 37e législature
Tue 31 Oct 2000 / Mar 31 oct 2000
Senator Anne Cools .
Honourable members , I come here to ask for fairness , balance and equilibrium in this law .
I do this because the legal and social condition around domestic violence is one that I can only describe as a heart of darkness .
This condition is rendered more difficult by official government disinclination to accept the obvious fact that violence and aggression are human problems , not gender problems .
I shall ask you to examine the proposition that men and women are equally capable of vice and equally capable of virtue , and that virtue is a human characteristic , not a gender one .
The committee , as a committee , must seek in legislation to reject any notion of the moral superiority of women and the moral inferiority of men , or that men are somehow morally defective .
The proposition of women 's inherent virtue and men's inherent vice has dominated family and criminal law for the past decade .
It has wreaked havoc and has bequeathed tragedy .
I ask committee members to examine the data , to examine the empirical evidence in respect of violence within intimate relationships , and to consider the possibility that the issue of domestic violence has been falsely framed or wrongly framed as violence against women .
Bill 117 tells us that it is about the protection of the life and limb of persons who are described as victims of domestic violence .
On September 27 , Attorney General Flaherty told the assembly that Bill 117 is " to support and protect people , primarily women and children , who are at risk of domestic violence . "
He said , " We are committed to ensuring that abusers are held accountable for their crimes . "
Mr Flaherty has clearly thought about crimes .
Mr Flaherty has used the term " crimes . "
I note that the term " crime " is very clear here .
Bill 117 is entering into a foray in criminal legislation .
[ 1 ]
This bill is about the strength of allegations .
I assert that this new proposed intervention order is not a strengthened restraining order as suggested but is a totally new form of order .
It is a new constitutional creature unknown to our constitutional order and it is innocently titled an " intervention order . "
I would submit to you that there is no such legal entity .
This intervention order confers exceptional , drastic and unprecedented powers on a judge , without clear statutory enactments to found , enable and create the power .
This new intervention order will marry existing restraining orders under the powers of the obligation of citizens to keep the peace and observe the law in respect of life and limb , that is , the Queen 's peace , to an unknown constitutional power to expropriate a person 's property rights and to attribute those rights to another .
In particular , I speak of the contents of the intervention order section , subsection 3 ( 2 ) , paragraphs 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 .
Paragraph 8 provides for intervention orders to grant exclusive possession , stating , " Granting the applicant exclusive possession of the residence shared by the applicant and the respondent , regardless of ownership . "
Bill 117 will circumvent the Family Law Act and give applicants a shortcut to the acquisition of family law property rights .
It will vest a legal estate , a property interest , in the applicant to the exclusive possession of the residence .
And they say " residence " in the bill , in sharp distinction from the language " matrimonial home " in the Family Law Act .
The Family Law Act vests a joint legal estate in the matrimonial home in both spouses and allows either spouse to obtain exclusive possession of the matrimonial home by virtue of its provisions of limiting the other spouse 's exercise of their right to possession of the matrimonial home .
The authority for that exclusive possession is based in the joint legal estate of both the parties .
This bill has no such joint legal estate and further supersedes the concept of the matrimonial home .
This is totally new .
The effect of this bill , I will propose , is a modern revival of the ancient power named the law of forfeiture .
I would ask honourable members to wrap their minds around that particular proposition .
In 1971 , Erin Pizzey started the first shelter in the world for women affected by domestic violence in Chiswick , England .
In 1974 , she wrote the very first book on domestic violence , called Scream Quietly or the Neighbours Will Hear .
Erin Pizzey , in a 1998 article in the UK's Observer newspaper , wrote the following , talking about her first experiences at her refuge .
She said , " Of the first 100 women coming into the refuge , 62 were as violent as the partners they had left .
Not only did they admit their violence in the mutual abuse that took place in their homes , but the women were abusive to their children . "
Erin Pizzey has written about women , and also men , who are prone to violence , or violence - prone .
Many are disinclined to receive the evidence that women are violent , yet we all know that infanticide is an exclusively female crime , as the Criminal Code in section 233 tells us .
This disinclination shields female violence from treatment and therapy , from correction and prosecution .
The effect is to cloak women in innocence -- a successful strategy for claims in courts of law .
The American scholars on domestic violence , including Drs Murray Straus , Richard Gelles , Suzanne Steinmetz and Jan Stets , all tell us that the domestic assault rates of men and women are equal and that mutuality , symmetry and reciprocity are the norm .
Men and women hit each other at equal rates .
Men and women initiate violence against each other at roughly equal rates .
These studies have been replicated in Canada by the Canadian scholars Drs Kim Bartholomew , Merlin Brinkerhoff , Donald Dutton , Eugen Lupri and Reena Sommer . [*]
Dr Dutton appeared before the special joint Senate - Commons committee on child custody and access on May 19 , 1998 , and he testified at page 25:53 , " I wrote a paper in 1994 called Patriarchy and Wife Assault : The Ecological Fallacy .
In that paper I essentially criticized sociological and feminist views of wife assault and of family violence . "
Dr Dutton further told the committee , " I also called attention to the fact that in research that had been done on homosexual relationships , and particularly on lesbian relationships , the abuse rates for physical assault , sexual violence , sexual abuse and psychological abuse were all higher than those reported in heterosexual relationships , and that this was a difficult finding to reconcile with a feminist point of view , since we 're dealing obviously here with relationships between women . "
I would like to place a case before you for your consideration .
This is a 1998 case of Regina v Ghanem in the Provincial Court of Alberta .
Mr Ghanem had been charged with assaulting his wife - - a domestic assault .
He was tried and acquitted of this particular charge .
This case is very relevant because under Bill 117 he would find himself back in court after an acquittal .
Mr Ghanem 's wife charged him in an effort to imperil him in the divorce proceeding ; this is very well documented in the judgment .
About the defendant 's alibi , because he was elsewhere when the assault was supposed to have taken place , Judge Fraser stated at paragraph 2 , " It was also disclosed to the police officer immediately upon being told of the allegations .
The officer chose not to investigate the alibi and instead just laid the charge .
Apparently he did n't feel he had any responsibility to do so . "
Judge Fraser stated his reasons for acquitting Mr Ghanem .
He said , " I find the evidence of the complainant and her mother to be contradictory , confusing , contrary , conflicting , irreconcilable and quite frankly , false . "
About the zero tolerance policy , Judge Fraser stated at paragraph 21 , " I want to make two further comments because one is curious as to how a man could be falsely accused in these circumstances right up to and including a trial .
The reasons are quite clear to me and disturbing .
First , the police apparently have a policy of zero tolerance in domestic assault cases .
Any zero tolerance policy is dangerous .
It is especially dangerous when it is not properly applied . "
I have copies of that judgment if honourable members would be interested .
1730 Honourable members of the committee , I have done a lot of work on the question of false accusation .
The particular issue around false accusation that has preoccupied my mind , and it deeply disturbs me because it is such a painful and terrible thing , has been the fact that within child custody and access disputes , quite often , as a strategy for obtaining sole custody , there has been a plethora over the last 10 years of the use of false accusation as a strategy .
I submit to you that exclusive possession of the home , custody of the children , spousal and child support are sufficiently desirable and profitable to sometimes found deceit , deception and deviance .
I would like to offer the committee the findings of the 1995 Ontario Civil Justice Review and also the Manitoba Civil Justice Review of 1996 in respect of their findings on family law .
I have this material here before me if the committee is interested .
In Manitoba , for example , the task force report stated : " The task force heard horror stories about the traumatic impact on the accused person , on the immediate family and children affected by malicious false allegations designed to achieve sole custody , prohibit or restrict visiting privileges , and to punish the other parent . "
Here at home , we had the Ontario Civil Justice Review , co-chaired by Mr Justice Robert Blair .
These same sorts of concerns are flagged and raised .
As a matter of fact , Mr Justice Blair at one point said that civil justice in Ontario is in a crisis .
I have studied this matter and I have reviewed some 52 cases , which I will be quite happy to share with you .
I have here in my hands a list of 52 judgments from across the country of confirmed false allegations -- not false allegations that were made , but false allegations that were found .
These accusations are of mostly child sexual and physical abuse , mostly made by mothers , mostly against fathers , and the context , again , is mostly child custody and access proceedings . [**]
Honourable Senators -- honourable members -- Mr Kormos :
We have elections .
Senator Cools :
Do you ?
I want you to know that we do too .
Mr Kormos : Mr Gallaway does .
Senator Cools : I know who loves an election .
Mr Guzzo :
It 's just a matter of time for you , Mr Kormos .
Senator Cools : Very good .
Mr Guzzo is -- Interjections .
The Chair : Order , please .
That was a caution to committee members , not to you , Senator Cools .
Senator Cools :
Thank you .
Mr Guzzo :
She just does n't look at us when she scolds us .
Senator Cools : I think she only scolds you when you need to be scolded .
Anyway , these are 52 cases .
I have listed the cases , case by case , by court , by judge , and even by date of the judgment .
I tell you , some of these judgments are chilling .
I would like to read a statement from one of the judges because it is at home here in Ontario .
The judge is Judge Fisher .
In the 1995 case of A.L.J.R. v. H.C.G.R. , Judge Fisher stated at paragraph 17 : " I find that the father committed no physical or sexual abuse and the mother programmed her child to give fictitious complaints . "
At paragraph 23 , the judge confessed : " When , in the past , I have read evidence of alleged abuse , I have decided to err on the side of caution and order supervised access .
Judges often do this .
I confess to have been taken in by the mother 's evidence . "
Honourable members , I think that 's quite a staggering admission and a confession for a judge to make .
The condition that I spoke about around these accusations is essentially the condition that women must always be believed and that men must always be doubted , because women are virtuous truth tellers and men are liars of dubious character , all lurking to hurt , maim , rape and kill their wives and their children .
In a decade , we moved from " father knows best " to " fathers molest . "
[ In the US , there are an estimated 520,000 false rape allegations a year  98.1 % of all reported cases .
 Eeva Sodhi , Debunking Domestic Violence Statistics ; Rape ]
Honourable members , I would like to conclude by saying that Bill 117 seeks to deny women 's violence .
It cloaks women in innocence , and vests mere allegations of domestic violence with aspects of criminal findings , while it stealthily vests the accuser with new property entitlements and also new child custody and access entitlements .
It then attempts , under the disguise of a prohibition , to vest the accuser with a potential immunity , by section 16 , from prosecution for perjury .
This extraordinary power is legislatively achieved by virtue of a novel judicial order call[ed ] an intervention order , sometimes obtained without notice , which can then oust -- the bill says " prevail , " but in parliamentary language the term is " oust " -- orders made under the Divorce Act , the Family Law Act and the Children 's Law Reform Act .
As I said before , such a judicial order , such a power , is unknown to the law in Canada .
Further , no provincial statute can oust the Divorce Act .
That is a jurisdictional question that was raised earlier .
This bill is a monumental foray into criminal law .
Simultaneously , it lacks the protection of due process and the higher standard of the burden of proof required by criminal law .
It lacks the protection owed to one accused of violence .
Violence is clearly an offence in criminal law , not civil .
In addition , by subsection 1 ( 2 ) , the definition of " domestic violence " is so broad , contrary to our constitutional framework , which usually requires that offences be defined precisely and narrowly .
Further , subsection 1 ( 3 ) tells us that on a balance of probabilities , a finding of domestic violence can be made without a criminal investigation , without a criminal finding or without a criminal test of credibility , and even sometimes without a police investigation .
Bill 117 is about criminal law and the consequential forfeiture of and the creation of new property rights .
As a consequence of allegations of crime made and found without criminal due process , the ancient law of forfeiture is revived .
An accused forfeits property rights and cedes them to an accuser .
This legal scheme , as I said before , is unknown to constitutional governance in Canada .
I think the committee and the Attorney General should exercise some pause and some caution and slow this bill down , receive counsel and find out exactly what is going on in this bill .
My worry about this bill is that it will not do very much to protect genuine victims who are in pain and anguish and who are suffering , and will do a lot to strengthen opportunities for what I would call unscrupulous individuals who will want to use the law in some unscrupulous way .
The heart of darkness , as I said before , that results in the twin tragedies of murder and suicide -- and let us remember that suicide , after all , is self - murder - - needs light .
It really needs very serious study and needs a lot of light .
I would submit to you that it needs no additional darkness .
I have spent my life working on this subject matter .
I know a lot about domestic violence and I know a lot about human beings when they are wrapped in these conflicts , buttressed quite often by hosts of other entanglements and pathologies .
I would also submit to you that there are many different forms of domestic violence .
The most frightening and the most terrifying form of domestic violence is the one where , unfortunately , within all of these other conflicts , homicidal or suicidal impulses also come into play .
I tell you , I mean it when I say this is the heart of darkness .
I thank you .
The Chair : We have about eight minutes for questions .
1740 Mr Tilson :
You 've indicated that this legislation is an encroachment upon the Criminal Code , although I draw to your attention that there are other provincial jurisdictions and provincial - type jurisdictions around the world that have similar legislation to that being proposed under Bill 117 , namely , Manitoba , Alberta , Prince Edward Island , Saskatchewan and the Yukon , many American states , New Zealand and Australia .
I do n't know whether you 're aware of those , but you might want to check those out .
Both of you have said that you 've spent a considerable number of years reviewing the topic of domestic violence .
Can you tell me what new recent legislation the federal government has undertaken with respect to the topic of domestic violence ?
Senator Cools :
What new legislation ?
Mr Tilson : Yes .
Mr Gallaway : I think the basic question you 're asking begs the question , is the present legislation adequate ?
I cited one example , and I do n't want to be anecdotal about it , but I would say to you that the present legislation is adequate , provided the resources are given to police and crown attorneys to get on with these allegations , which I would suggest to you , Mr Tilson , are in fact criminal offences .
Just because a new law is put forward , whether it be in Ottawa or in a provincial capital , does not by definition say it is in fact an improvement .
It 's just yet another law .
Mr Tilson : Senator Cools has spent a great deal of time talking about domestic violence .
I agree ; I believe we do have a problem with domestic violence , and it 's not just men against women .
It 's men against women ; it 's women against men ; it 's date rape ; it 's the issue of elder abuse .
Very few people in these hearings have referred to the topic of elder abuse .
There 's all kinds of it .
I just asked a simple question : with your experience -- and I appreciate that -- what draft legislation is being proposed by the federal government to deal with any of these issues ?[***]
Mr Gallaway :
As you know , the House is dissolved .
There is no draft legislation .
Mr Tilson : I understand that .
Mr Kormos : Gentlemen , will you both lower your hind legs ?
Senator Cools :
Mine are in pretty good shape .
Mr Tilson : Am I still on the air ?
Senator Cools :
The real question is that the current position of the federal government obviously is that the Criminal Code is alive and well and working quite adequately .
That would be the position .
I do not speak for the government , so I do not feel that I have to excuse or apologize .
But that would be the position of the federal government .
The question that is hidden in yours is , why is there a need for a new amendment to the Criminal Code ?
You have not satisfied me that there is .
This particular bill does not satisfy me that there 's any need for a new addition to the Criminal Code .
You inform me that there 's similar legislation to this in other provinces .
I am here to speak about this particular legislation .
Yes , I am pretty well informed on legislation in the other provinces , but I was speaking to this one , and I say to you that this particular one is insufficient because it has clearly trenched on federal territory .
Mr Bryant : You 've raised an empirical question .
You can't be expected to have been here for it , but earlier one of the submissions , by the Metropolitan Action Committee on Violence Against Women and Children , cited a Stats Canada study to the effect that 86 % to 93 % of victims of violence are women and 90 % of the perpetrators are men .
We can ask legislative research to find the year of the StatsCan study .
Stats Canada is hardly -- Senator Cools :
Are you speaking about the 1993 so - called violence against women survey ?
Is that the particular study ?
Stats Canada puts out these studies quite frequently .
Which one are you referring to ?
Mr Bryant : I 'm sorry .
The study was referred to in a previous submission .
Let me put this to you :
What do you say to those numbers ?
Senator Cools : I do n't know .
You would have to cite for me the particular study -- Mr Bryant : Fair enough .[****]
Senator Cools :
What I would say to you is that domestic violence is a problem that affects a small minority of couples in this country .
What I would also say to you is that the strongest predictors of domestic violence are usually youth and common - law relationships , chronic unemployment and usually other sets of social and emotional problems .
I would also say to you that at least 75 % of men are not violent in their intimate relationships .
When we are looking at deviance , I think we have to be crystal clear that we are looking at deviance and focus in on deviance .
I guess that is what I 'm trying to say .
If one wants to deal with deviance -- and there is very real deviance .
I was on the National Parole Board .
I tell you , I 've read a lot of cases on deviance .
Let us make sure that we draw the law narrowly enough and brilliantly enough to capture in that net the deviance we 're wanting to capture and to leave out the rest of the majority of ordinary citizens .
I would submit to you that the majority of men and women involved in divorce and custody and access disputes are not in that small group of people whom we would call violent couples .
The Chair : You have one more minute .
Mr Bryant :
You 're obviously familiar with the bill .
Senator Cools :
Yes , I read it quite carefully .
Mr Kormos : Mr Bryant can have my time .
Mr Bryant :
There 's no section in the bill that 's gender - specific , is there ?
Senator Cools :
That is the interesting thing .
It does n't have to be , because the Attorney General has said it is and all the witnesses have been saying it .
It is very clear that what has happened in Alberta and what has happened in the other provinces where similar legislation has been introduced is that the weight of the law will be felt by the male in the relationship .
Mr Bryant : I heard that submission -- Senator Cools : I think we can all agree -- Mr Bryant : -- but there is no gender - specific reference in the bill , is there ?
Senator Cools :
It is unnecessary to do it because there 's a culture , which is the point I was trying to make .
Mr Bryant : I 'll take that as a " no . "
Senator Cools : I was trying to appeal to you to say that this bill is being administered on those grounds and there 's a culture that is going on .
Believe you me , if you 've ever counselled or sat between one of those couples , it is very frightening .
The Chair : Thank you , Ms Cools .
Mr Guzzo : Madam Chair , may I just say on behalf of the committee , we thank you both very much for being here .
I know you 're both busy .
Mr Gallaway , I 'm sure you have other things on your mind that you could be handling today and it's very much appreciated that you would take the time to be here .
Mr Gallaway : Thank you , Mr Guzzo .
I want to say how pleased I am that this all occurred on Halloween evening .
It would be very difficult to campaign tonight .
Senator Cools : I would like to close by saying that one lauds every effort to correct social problems , but I think we have to be crystal clear that we 're defining the problems adequately .
I notice nobody responded to the question that I raised -- but that 's all right -- about the exceptional power , invoking the old powers under the law of forfeiture , because , for those of you who may be setting out to try to correct or amend it , what is really wrong with this bill is the marriage between the criminal powers and the civil powers .
If the restraining orders had been strengthened in respect of protecting life and limb , it would be an entirely different matter , but the real problem with this bill is throwing in the additional property considerations .
Thank you very much .
The Chair : Thank you both , Senator Cools and Mr Gallaway , for being here .
Ladies and gentlemen , that does conclude the public delegation portion of the committee deliberations .
I would ask committee members to please remember that November 7 at noon is the deadline for amendments and there will be clause - by - clause consideration on November 14 at 3:30 in this room .
Thank you for your patience .
The committee adjourned 1749 .
The Pew Internet and American Life Project has finally discovered Twitter , and points out that its users are young , mobile , and new media savvy — surprise !
These are Pew 's latest findings , part of its first look at the Twitter phenomenon and online status updating as a whole .
Though many of the findings are n't particularly shocking ( especially to those of us who , well , use Twitter ) , Pew profiles the demographics of the average Twitter users and how they compare to the general Internet - using population .
Pew conducted its survey by doing phone interviews with 2,253 adults between November and December of 2008 and found that 11 percent of adults in the US who use the Internet claim to have used Twitter or a similar microblogging service .
The trend seems to be picking up at a quicker pace , too ; the firm notes that , just a few weeks earlier , only nine percent of Internet users said they did so , and in May , only six percent .
When narrowing down to younger users — those who typically are the first to adopt these kinds of services — the number is much higher .
19 percent of online adults between the ages of 18 and 24 reported having used Twitter , as well as 20 percent of those between 25 and 34 .
Unsurprisingly , the number drops off with the 35 - and - up age groups .
These more " seasoned " users are still likely trying to understand what the kids are even doing these days to begin with .
Pew says that the average Twitter user is " overwhelmingly young , " though the average age of a Twitter user is slightly higher than most other social networking services .
Twitter 's median age is 31 , while Facebook 's is 26 and MySpace 's is 27 .
Because of their youth , however , Twitter users are more likely to come from lower - income households ( older Internet users tend to make more than younger users ) , and they 're more likely to live in urban areas than the general Internet population .
Data source : Pew Internet & American Life Project
Since Twitter is pushed as a service that can ( and should ) be used from mobile phones , it also comes as no surprise that Twitter users are more likely ( by fairly significant margins ) to use their cell phones to go online and send text messages than the overall online population .
In fact , Twitter users tend to use and consume all sorts of media more than the rest of the population ; they 're more likely to read a newspaper on a smartphone , regular cell phone , and even online than everyone else , while " regular " Internet users are more likely to read a print newspaper .
Twitter users are more engaged in blogging and reading other people 's blogs as well .
Pew Internet & American Life Project
Overall ,
Pew observes that Twitter users engage news and technology at roughly the same rates as everyone else , " but the ways in which they use the technology — to communicate , gather and share information — reveals their affinity for mobile , untethered and social opportunities for interaction . "
Given another few years , it wo n't be surprising to see widespread Twitter use spread to older and more general Internet users in the same way text messaging has spread to parents and families .
In fact , Twitter often only involves sending an SMS in the first place — maybe some of those parents can keep the momentum going after texting their kids and start sending updates to Twitter while they 're at it .

You will be asked to provide a password for the MySQL root user - this password is valid for the user [ email protected ] as well as [ email protected ] , so we do n't have to specify a MySQL root password manually later on :
New password for the MySQL " root " user : <-- yourrootsqlpassword
Repeat password for the MySQL " root " user : <-- yourrootsqlpassword
3 Installing Nginx
Nginx is available as a package for Ubuntu 8.10 which we can install as follows :
apt - get install nginx
Start nginx afterwards :
/etc/init.d/nginx start
Type in your web server 's IP address or hostname into a browser ( e.g. http://192.168.0.100), and you should see the nginx welcome page :
To make nginx start at boot time , run
update - rc.d nginx defaults
4 Installing PHP5
We can make PHP5 work in nginx through FastCGI .
Fortunately , Ubuntu provides a FastCGI - enabled PHP5 package which we install like this ( together with some PHP5 modules like php5 - mysql which you need if you want to use MySQL from your PHP scripts ) :
apt - get install php5 - cgi php5 - mysql php5 - curl php5 - gd php5 - idn php- pear php5 - imagick php5 - imap php5 - mcrypt php5 - memcache php5 - mhash php5-ming php5 - pspell php5 - recode php5 - snmp php5- sqlite php5 - tidy php5-xmlrpc php5-xsl
Then open
/etc/php5/cgi/php.ini and add the line cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1 right at the end of the file :
vi /etc/php5/cgi/php.ini
[...] cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1
There 's no standalone FastCGI daemon package for Ubuntu , therefore we use the spawn - fcgi program from lighttpd .
We install lighttpd as follows :
apt - get install lighttpd
You will see an error message saying that lighttpd could n't start because port 80 is already in use .
That 's how it 's supposed to be because nginx is already listening on port 80 .
Run
update - rc.d -f lighttpd remove
so that lighttpd will not start at boot time .
We 've installed lighttpd because we need just one program that comes with the package , / usr / bin / spawn - fcgi , which we can use to start FastCGI processes .
Take a look atAdvertisement
spawn - fcgi -- help
to learn more about it .
To start a PHP FastCGI daemon listening on port 9000 on localhost and running as the user and group www - data , we run the following command :
/usr/bin/spawn-fcgi -a 127.0.0.1 -p 9000 -u www-data -g www-data -f /usr/bin/php5-cgi -P /var/run/fastcgi-php.pid
Of course , you do n't want to type in that command manually whenever you boot the system , so to have the system execute the command automatically at boot time , open /etc/rc.local ...
vi /etc/rc.local
... and add the command at the end of the file ( before the exit line ) :
[...]
/usr/bin/spawn-fcgi -a 127.0.0.1 -p 9000 -u www-data -g www-data -f /usr/bin/php5-cgi -P /var/run/fastcgi-php.pid [...]

5 Configuring nginx
The nginx configuration is in /etc / nginx / nginx .conf which we open now :
vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
The configuration is easy to understand ( you can learn more about it here : http://wiki.codemongers.com/NginxFullExample and here : http://wiki.codemongers.com/NginxFullExample2)
First ( this is optional ) increase the number of worker processes and set the keepalive_timeout to a reasonable value :
[...] worker_processes 5 ; [...] keepalive_timeout 2 ; [...]
The virtual hosts are defined in server {} containers .
The default vhost is defined in the file / etc / nginx / sites - available / default - let 's modify it as follows :
vi /etc/nginx/sites-available / default
[...] server { listen 80 ; server_name _ ; access_log /var/ log/nginx/localhost.access.log ; location / { root / var/www/nginx - default ; index index.php index.html index.htm ; } location / doc { root /usr / share ; autoindex on ; allow 127.0.0.1 ; deny all ; } location / images { root /usr / share ; autoindex on ; } #error_page 404 /404.html ; # redirect server error pages to the static page / 50x. html # error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html ; location = /50 x. html { root / var / www / nginx - default ; } # proxy the PHP scripts to Apache listening on 127.0.0.1:80 # #location ~ \.php$ { # proxy_pass
http://127.0.0.1; #} # pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server listening on 127.0.0.1:9000 # location ~ \.php$ { try_files $ uri =404 ; fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000 ; fastcgi_index index.php ; fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME
/var/www/nginx-default$fastcgi_script_name ; include fastcgi_params ; } # deny access to .htaccess files , if Apache 's document root # concurs with nginx 's one # location ~ / \.ht { deny all ; } } [... ]
server_name _ ; makes this a default catchall vhost ( of course , you can as well specify a hostname here like www.example.com).
In the location / part , I 've added index. php to the index line .
root / var / www / nginx - default ; means that the document root is the directory / var / www / nginx - default .
The important part for PHP is the location ~ \.php$ {} stanza .
Uncomment it to enable it .
Please make sure that you change the fastcgi_param line to fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/nginx-default$fastcgi_script_name ; ( replace / var / www / nginx - default with your vhost 's document root ) because otherwise the PHP interpreter wo n't find the PHP script that you call in your browser .
Make sure that there are some spaces between include and fastcgi_params ; - in the default file this is written as one word which is a bug .
Now save the file and restart nginx :
/etc/init.d/nginx restart
Now create the following PHP file in the document root / var/www/nginx-default: AdvertisementAdvertisement
vi /var/www/nginx-default/info.php
<?php phpinfo( ) ; ?>
Now we call that file in a browser ( e.g. http://192.168.0.100/info.php):
As you see , PHP5 is working , and it 's working through FastCGI , as shown in the Server API line .
If you scroll further down , you will see all modules that are already enabled in PHP5 , including the MySQL module :
I 'm glad to hear this investigation is widening , because you just do n't steal that much money without someone else knowing about it :
Two days before Bernard Madoff enters an 11 - count guilty plea in Manhattan federal court , the investigation into his giant Ponzi scheme has broadened to include a number of suspected co-conspirators , according to federal officials involved in the case .
Madoff ’s lawyer told a judge today that there was no “ deal ” connected to Madoff ’s confessing to money laundering , mail fraud , and other counts that will likely result in a life sentence .
Ruth Madoff , who was considered “ innocent at first , ” is believed to have received at least $ 70 million from her husband and is now therefore an object of the investigation .
That tallies with the revelation , from another source involved in the probe , that Madoff has not been cooperating in good faith with investigators .
“ He is not reliable .
He ’s jerking everyone around , ” said the source .
“ Every day he changes his tune about where the money went and where it is .
He ’s trying to protect his family . ”
A source close to the Madoff defense team agreed that Madoff ’s main concern was to preserve as much assets as possible for his wife and children and to keep them from legal entanglements .
“ The US attorney ’s office is still trying to resolve what is tainted or clean money , what real property in the US is appropriate for the Madofffs to keep , ” the source said .
That may prove difficult .
Sources say new information has surfaced that suggests several members of Madoff ’s inner circle transferred assets to their wives , transactions thought to be laundered through an English bank .
Ruth Madoff , who was considered “ innocent at first , ” according to this source , is believed to have received at least $ 70 million from her husband and is now therefore an object of the investigation .
That is one reason why she recently decided to retain her own lawyer , leaving Ira Sorkin , who has represented both of the Madoffs since December , when the Ponzi scheme was revealed .
Investigators are focusing their attention on three groups of possible co-conspirators .
“ There should be at least 20 indictments , between the three groups , if the feds are doing their jobs , ” said one highly placed lawyer involved in the case .
“ Some will be conspiracy , the ones who were deep into it with Madoff , and others will be civil cases sent to the SEC for prosecution . ”
( Lawyers and prosecutors who spoke to The Daily Beast for this article declined to go on the record , citing their legal involvement in the case . )
Key To Job Creation : New Ideas
Economic downturns force people to become more creative , with Carl Schramm , Kauffman Foundation president & CEO ; Daniel Kivatinos , Dr. Chorno co-founder ; and CNBC's Erin Burnett .
A new report from the NPD Group shows that online gaming is up , PC gaming is slightly down , and the Xbox 360 is sitting on top of the console heap for online play .
Of the 20,000 people polled for the report , 25 percent played games online , versus 19 percent the year before .
That 's quite a leap , and one the NPD Group calls " statistically significant . "
But what is everyone playing on ?
The PC is the most popular online platform by a large margin , as last year 90 percent of online gamers were playing on the PC .
This year ?
Down to 87 percent .
The Xbox 360 is surging , with 50 percent of online players using Microsoft 's system — and Xbox Live — to play games with friends .
The number three slot is where we go into the twilight zone : last year 18 percent of online gamers played on the Wii , and this year it 's 29 percent .
That 's quite the leap , and it puts the Nintendo Wii above the PlayStation 3 for online play .
With numbers like this , it 's time for publishers to start taking the Wii much more seriously as an online platform , as gamers are already comfortable bringing the system online .
The report also points out that online gamers represent a much wider variety of gamers than traditional retail games .
" Online gaming is enjoyed by a diverse group of players , " said Anita Frazier , industry analyst , The NPD Group .
" The sheer variety of content and ease of access makes online gaming attractive to a much larger demographic than what we typically see in retail . "
This is why the online space is such a good excuse for experimentation ; a diverse audience brings variant tastes .
Is it any wonder many of the truly exciting games in the past few years were smaller , digitally distributed games ?
Online gaming has also become more popular among younger gamers : online gaming increased five percent in gamers aged 13 to 17 , while it decreased slightly among older gamers .
" These shifts indicate that online gaming may have become more appealing to 13 to 17 year olds compared to last year , a theme that is echoed by the growth in teens using a console system for online gaming , and a relatively proportional decline among adults , especially ages 25 - 34 , across several systems , " The NPD Group explains .
While the PC still sits far above its console competition , the Xbox 360 and Wii show just how powerful gaming consoles can be in the world of online gaming .
While none of these numbers show anything approaching a large shift — the biggest surprise is the large jump in Wii online gaming — there are several trends at work here : console online gaming is likely get bigger by eating at the PC 's share of online time .
They 're easy to bring online and may be bringing a younger market to online gaming .
Given Secretary Clinton ’s working lunch with Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner today and speculation that both want to take over the China file , I asked Minxin Pei , a noted China expert at the Carnegie Endowment for Interntional Peace , for his thoughts on who should spearhead the China brief – Clinton or Geithner ?
The right answer is neither .
In the past , the most successful handler of U.S. - China relations was either the president himself ( both Bush Sr. and W , for example ) or the National Security Advisor ( Kissinger , Brzezinski , and Berger ) who has the ear of the president .
The reason is quite simple : Given the complexity of the relationship and the conflicting interests among various bureaucracies , the only person who can manage this relationship and balance competing interests would be the president or his national security advisor .
Hillary Clinton might want to be spearhead this relationship , but she might want to think twice .
She would be treading on many toes — the Pentagon , the Treasury , USTR , and , needless to say , Congress .
And for what ?
The relationship is not in deep trouble .
There are some problems to be ironed out .
She would be spending a lot of energy but getting very little in return .
As for Geithner , I doubt whether he wants to repeat what Paulson did .
Geithner has neither the personal interest in China nor the political backing from the very top to handle the U.S. - China brief .
Paulson supposedly got a commitment of support from W as a condition of signing on as the Treasury Secretary .
In any case , Geithner will be spending most of his time on rescuing the U.S. economy .
If I were him , I would do anything to avoid 14 - hour flights to Beijing and the jetlag .
That leaves one possible choice — Joe Biden .
The Chinese press is already floating unconfirmed rumors — out of Japan — that Biden will be heading the Strategic Economic Dialogue between the U.S. and China .
That could be wishful thinking on Beijing ’s part because this would give him even more face than what Paulson has done .
" Computer chess " and human chess
Jurg Nievergelt mentioned in a lecture the following famous study by Richard Reti 1929 ( ? )
White : Kh8 Pc6 ; Black : Ka6 Ph5
White is to move and draw .
__ __ __ __ __ __ __ WK
__ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
bk __ WP __ __ __ __ __
__ __ __ __ __ __ __ bp
__ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
__ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
__ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
__ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
With just the kings and two pawns on the board , any modern chess program will find the correct move quickly .
However , to a human , at first white 's situation looks hopeless .
White can't prevent the black pawn from queening and he can't defend his own pawn from capture by the black king .
We give credit to a chess player who can get a draw for white .
Note that Reti's idea can be implemented on a 100 by 100 board , and humans will still solve the problem , but present programs will not .
I 'll bet that the problem could be solved honestly by a program on a computer of the 1960s once chess programs can reason better .
Click here for the idea of the a solution .
Conversely , AI will not advance to human level if AI researchers remain satisfied with brute force as a substitute for intelligence .
What motivated this example was the following .
The author is omitted to protect the guilty .
One reason why games like chess and checkers were so attractive initially is surely that they were , at that time , seen as requiring ( human ) intelligence , perhaps even paradigmatic examples of tasks requiring intelligence .
Grandmasters were right up there with Nobel prizewinners in the general cultural pantheon .
It was thought that one had to be very clever in order to play chess well .
Only a very small percentage of humans could do it , it required a lifetime 's dedication and hard work , and it was clearly an intellectual skill .
Now that machines can do it so well , being able to play chess at master and grandmaster levels is no longer seen as quite so indicative of " intelligence " ( that elusive concept ! ) .

Richard Grant continues his theological experiment :
Creationists ( and I include proponents of so - called  Intelligent Design ’ in that ) do n’t understand science , obviously : but they also fail to understand faith .
Creationism is used as a proof , as evidence for the existence of ( a ) God ... This is not a philosophical objection : I ’m not saying that faith fails to be faith if there ’s proof .
I ’m saying that if your  proof ’ is shown to be false then you ’re utterly screwed .
So if you tie your faith to a  proof ’ you actually end up trying to prove that your proof is true , rather than seeking out  truth ’ .
Which is the cleft stick Creationists find themselves in .
Web content creators and site operators , upset over a controversial feature in Microsofts upcoming Windows XP operating system , won a temporary reprieve last week when Microsoft said it would pull the Smart Tag feature — at least for this year .
The feature would enable the company to insert its own links into Web content viewed through its Internet Explorer browser .
The company decided to kill the feature after being overwhelmed by negative reaction to the technology , said Jim Allchin , Microsofts group vice president in charge of Windows and Internet Explorer .
" We hadnt balanced the legitimate concerns of the content providers with the benefits we think Smart Tags can bring to users , " Allchin told The Wall Street Journal .
Smart Tags turn any word on any Web site viewed through Internet Explorer into a link of Microsofts choosing .
That link — which appears as a squiggly purple underline — could take users to a Microsoft property or any other site or Web page of the companys choosing .
Content creators criticized the feature because the new links would have been added without their permission , effectively giving Microsoft editorial oversight of their content .
Allchin said he remained supportive of the technology , adding that the decision had as much to do with Microsofts reluctance to see the feature undermine the rollout of Windows XP , which is due Oct. 25 .
With some Swiss legal experts arguing that banning nudity in public would be unconstitutional , the government has been hamstrung in responding to the hikers .
It has drafted legislation that , if enacted , would outlaw “ abusive behavior that offends against custom and decency , ” but it seems likely to be challenged .
Daniel Kettiger , a legal expert , published a six - page paper last month titled , predictably enough , “ The Bare Facts : On the Criminal Prosecution of Nude Hiking , ” pointing out that in 1991 Switzerland struck a law from its books that banned nudity in public .
“ Simply being naked without any sexual connotation is no longer illegal , ” Mr. Kettiger said by telephone , adding , “ at the time there was a wave of nudism . ”
Was he himself a hiker ?
“ Yes , but never nude , ” he replied .
“ First there is the danger of sunburn , and then there are ticks all over the place in the Alps , which carry Boreliosa , ” or Lyme disease .
The Appenzeller justice minister , Melchior Looser , is sure he can frame a law that will force the naked to cover up .
“ I think the measure will work the way we have fashioned it , ” said Mr. Looser , 63 , noting that offenders would be fined the equivalent of $ 170 .
He would like to have the law in place by springtime , when hikers again take to the hills .
But he concedes that it must be approved by the grand assembly of the people , a gathering of all citizens of voting age once a year on the town ’s main square , which is scheduled to convene April 26 .
Passage is by no means assured .
Hans Eggimann believes it will be enacted .
“ I hike around the house naked , but outside I put my pants on , ” said Mr. Eggimann , 57 , a large man who sells more than 60 types of cheese in his shop in the town center .
Others are not so sure .
“ Many Appenzellers I know say it does n’t bother them , ” said Alessandra Maselli , who works in a dry goods store not far from Mr. Eggimann ’s cheese emporium .
“ I ’d say it ’s about half and half , with a slight majority for the law , ” she said .

Bay Area bicycle advocates stepped up their campaign Thursday to make it easier to commute on two wheels , winning one battle to get more space for bikes on Caltrain but losing their latest skirmish with the state to allow cycling across the Richmond - San Rafael Bridge .
Caltrain directors approved a plan Thursday to increase onboard bicycle capacity on its trains .
Meanwhile , at a meeting of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission , Caltrans officials rejected a test program to allow bikes and pedestrians on the Richmond - San Rafael Bridge .
The vote by the Caltrain board came after heavy lobbying by commuters who are fed up with the increasing risk of getting bumped off of trains when all the bike racks on the rail cars are full .
" It 's very hard to plan your day when you do n't know whether you 'll get on the train .
If I liked to gamble , I 'd go to Vegas , " said Paul Schreiber , a software developer who commutes between the 22nd Street Station in San Francisco and both the Sunnyvale and Mountain View stations on the Peninsula .
He said he gets bumped every week or two .
Caltrain reports space problems on about 1 out of 10 runs , according to Chuck Harvey , Caltrain 's chief operating officer .
The trains now can handle 16 , 32 or 64 bicycles .
Cyclists are n't sure until the trains pull into the stations how many bikes will be allowed on board .
Under the new policy , the Bombardier cars , which now have rack space for 16 bikes , will be re-outfitted to carry 24 .
The older gallery cars , which now hold 32 bikes , will be reconfigured for 40 .
With the change , the total available bike slots in the peak commute period will increase from the current average of 2,300 to 2,900 , said Caltrain spokeswoman Christine Dunn .
A total of 272 seats will be removed .
The retrofit would cost about $ 200,000 and take eight to 12 weeks to complete .
Harvey said he hopes work can start in April .
The board also set a goal of having two bike cars per train during the morning and evening commutes .
For bicyclists who have been battling for three decades for the right to pedal across the 4 - mile Richmond - San Rafael Bridge , Caltrans ' refusal was just the latest defeat .
Last February , a consultant recommended a movable barrier that would allow the shoulder of the bridge to carry cars during commute hours then convert to a bike lane .
But Caltrans officials refused , saying it would create unsafe conditions for drivers .
The Bay Area Toll Authority , which oversees operation of the state toll bridges , tried to broker a compromise .
With traffic across the bridge down , there 's no longer a need for a third lane of traffic , so they suggested installing temporary concrete barriers on the upper deck of the bridge for a couple of years to test its safety and popularity .
" We would be increasing the chance of accidents and decreasing the level of safety for thousands of travelers on this bridge , " said Richard Land Caltrans ' chief engineer .
Bike and trail advocates said a lane across the span would be a vital link in the Bay Trail and the regional bicycle lane network .
Caltrans , they argued , is favoring cars while ignoring the growing interest in bicycling .
Since Caltrans gave up plans to add a third lane of traffic to the bridge , it no longer needs a permit from the commission .
So the commission cannot compel Caltrans to give bicyclists access .
Robert Raburn , director of the East Bay Bicycle Coalition , said after the meeting that he was frustrated by Caltrans ' intransigence , but would keep fighting .
" We 've met our match , " he said , " but we 'll be back .
We 're not going to drop this .
We 're going to keep pushing . "
Contrary to popular belief , Franken is not explicitly seeking to dismiss Coleman 's election contest .
Based upon the actual court filings ( there are two ) , Franken appears to have an alternative motive .
Franken has presented , along with a motion to dismiss the entire contest , three other arguments explicitly opposing Coleman 's desire to re-review all 12,000 rejected absentee ballots .
Franken 's motion to dismiss the entire contest contains two arguments and is likely to fail :
[ Note : The arguments appear to be misnumbered . ]
ARGUMENT I : THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION TO HEAR COLEMAN'S CLAIMS BECAUSE THE NOTICE OF CONTEST FALLS OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTIONAL LIMITS SET BY MINN .
STAT . § 209.12 .
ARGUMENT III : COLEMAN'S OPPOSITION ERASES ANY DOUBT AS TO THE INSUFFICIENCY OF HIS CLAIMS .
Source : MNCourts.org [ PDF ]
I 'm not really going to go into detail about Franken 's motion to dismiss the contest because there appear to be actual anomalies within the recount process .
The very purpose of an election contest is to ensure that each and every stage of the counting process occurred lawfully .
Any indication of malfeasance warrants an audience of the court .
The actual purpose of Franken 's motion appears to be information gathering ; the last 12 pages of the motion contain documents from the Coleman campaign that were previously not available .
Franken 's other motion regarding the 12,000 rejected absentee ballots , appears to be a valid attempt at preempting Coleman 's already slim chances :
ARGUMENT I : COLEMAN'S REQUEST FOR THE PRODUCTION OF 12,000 ABSENTEE BALLOTS MUST BE DENIED BECAUSE HIS VAGUE AND NON - SPECIFIED CLAIMS REGARDING THOSE BALLOTS LIE BEYOND THE JURISDICTION OF THIS COURT .
ARGUMENT II : AT MOST , ONLY THE BALLOTS PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED BY COLEMAN AND THE ADDITIONAL BALLOTS IDENTIFIED BY FRANKEN ARE RELEVANT TO THIS COURT'S PROCEEDINGS .
ARGUMENT III : TRANSPORT AND DEPOSIT OF 12,000 ORIGINAL BALLOTS IS UNNECESSARY AND WASTEFUL WHERE ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION IS GENERALLY ALREADY AVAILABLE TO THE PARTIES .

Laos is rapidly developing as China and other Asian nations exploit its resources .
One of the first casualties has been the wildlife , now being rapidly depleted by a thriving black - market trade , writes Rhett Butler from Yale Environment 360 , part of the Guardian Environment Network
Deep in the rugged mountains of Nam Et - Phou Louey National Protected Area on the Laos–Vietnam border , Laotian game wardens came upon the following scene : pieces of the pelt of a recently killed tiger , its bones removed , with rifle shells scattered in the trampled vegetation .
The wardens knew precisely what had happened .
Poachers had trapped a tiger in a baited snare that had encircled one of its front feet with a cable and lifted the animal into the air .
Coming upon the snarling tiger , the poachers had shot it , then proceeded to carve out its 22 to 26 pounds of bones , which — when ground up — would be sold to middlemen for the Chinese medicinal market .
The poachers then cut off the tiger 's penis , which would eventually be soaked in wine and the wine drunk as an aphrodisiac .
Middlemen paid the poachers up to $ 15,000 for the bones and other parts of the tiger , an astronomical sum in a country where per capita income is around $ 400 a year .
In China today , the remains of a tiger may fetch $ 70,000 , with the ground bones highly valued as a cure for rheumatism , according to Arlyne Johnson , co-director of the Wildlife Conservation Society 's Laos Program , which is trying to stem the flow of the illegal wildlife trade .
Twenty - five years ago , hundreds of tigers roamed large swaths of relatively untouched jungle in Laos .
But in recent years — particularly in the last decade — development , deforestation , and a booming traffic in wildlife have reduced Laos 's tiger population to 50 or fewer individuals , according to Johnson and other scientists .
The main driver of the rapid depletion of tigers and scores of other species of birds , animals , and reptiles is the growing affluence of neighboring Thailand , Vietnam , and especially China , where a vast new market for wildlife products has arisen .
Nothing symbolizes this market more vividly than the so - called " north - south economic corridor , " a recently completed road that now connects once - sleepy Laos — and its timber and other raw materials — to China .
With its booming economy , China is also the world 's largest — and fastest - growing — market for wildlife .
Laos is the latest front in the struggle to rein in an underground global trade that every year kills tens of millions of wild birds , mammals , and reptiles to supply multi-billion dollar markets around the world .
The U.S. and Europe rank among the largest buyers of elephant ivory and tiger parts and also feed this illicit business with their demand for exotic pets .
But as I learned on a trip to Laos earlier this year , it is the Asian market — particularly in China — that powers this trade .
A major source of demand is traditional Chinese medicine , which is based on the belief that the parts of certain animals have curative properties — river otter tails for labor pains , bear bile for fever , shark fins for cancer .
This trade is taking a heavy toll on wildlife not just in Laos , but around the world — in Southeast Asia , the Russian Far East , Africa , and even North America .
The reasons for the rise of commercial hunting and trapping are not complex — rapid development and growing affluence that create demand ; an increase in international trade ; the emergence of increasingly sophisticated smuggling networks ; an influx of weapons and technology ; and easier access to wilderness areas because of road building by extractive industries .
All drive overexploitation of wildlife , but addressing the trade in a manner that is effective but also fair to local people is a huge challenge .
Until 1986 , Laos was ruled by a communist government and was largely isolated from the outside world .
But a change of government and an economic liberalization program began a trickle of investment in the country that has recently become a flood .
Like other forest - dependent people , rural Lao long relied on hunting to supplement their rice - dominated diet with protein .
But the opening of the economy put a price on the heads of virtually all animals , ranging from river insects to tigers .
This , combined with an abundance of weapons from years of war and insurgency , gave hunters the incentive and the tools to convert Laos ' rich biodiversity into cash .
Now the very resources upon which rural people have long depended are at risk .
The situation is particularly grim along the recently completed north - south economic corridor — an 1,150 - mile road that runs from Bangkok , Thailand to Kunming , China , passing through the heart of Laos .
The corridor has spurred widespread deforestation and wildlife poaching .
Vast tracts of forest along the corridor have been logged for timber and converted for teak or rubber plantations , while hillsides have been burned for sticky rice cultivation .
The money comes from Chinese business owners who not only provide finance , but sell snares and traps and place orders for fresh wildlife , guaranteeing a market for hunters and smugglers .
The situation deteriorated to such an extent that in 2005 the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) scaled back its project in Nam Ha National Protected Area , the largest nature reserve in the country at the time .
Wildlife is commonly sold along the corridor , especially near the Chinese border .
But other than dead animals in markets , I saw little evidence of animals and birds along the corridor — or , for that matter , in most of Laos .
In eastern Laos , the Vietnamese are the main financiers of new roads intended to facilitate access to Laos ' resources ; wildlife comes as a bonus .
In Laos , like other countries , there is a strong synergism between road building and the wildlife trade .
Loggers supplement their income with hunting and use logging trucks to transport bushmeat to traders and urban markets .
Extractive industries like logging and mining also actively encourage human settlement , boosting demand for game as a source of protein .
Cash - rich workers can afford to buy weapons , snares , headlamps , and outboard motors to speed wildlife depletion , especially in regions where arms are widely available .
A study , soon to be published in the journal Conservation Letters , found pervasiveness of firearms to be a key contributing factor to Laos ' precipitous drop in wildlife .
For poachers , the tiger is the crown jewel .
But tigers in Laos and other countries also face a secondary threat — depletion of prey populations from unsustainable hunting , making it difficult for tigers to survive in what would otherwise be suitable habitat and pushing them into conflict with humans .
Hunters are using livestock to bait tigers ; the loss of a cow is a small price to pay for catching a big cat .
Sometimes a cow or a pig is slaughtered , dragged into the forest , and wired with snares or explosives so that a tiger lured by an easy meal is quickly converted into a pharmacological product .
Pangolins — scaly anteaters believed to cure blood circulation problems and skin conditions — are also highly prized .
While commercial international trade in pangolins is banned under CITES ( the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ) , pangolins have been extinguished from much of Laos by poachers .
The extent of the pangolin trade in Southeast Asia remains enormous .
TRAFFIC , a wildlife trade - monitoring network , recently estimated that at least 100,000 pangolins — mostly from Malaysia and Indonesia — are killed each year to meet Chinese demand .
More than 25 tons of pangolin parts have been seized in Vietnam in the last year alone , but the enforcement action demonstrated one of the major challenges facing those working to control the trade .
Instead of destroying the pangolins , the Vietnamese government auctioned off the contraband , thus allowing the wildlife products to ultimately reach their intended destination .
" Selling off the seized pangolins sent out entirely the wrong message , " said Sulma Warne , TRAFFIC 's Greater Mekong program coordinator .
Mixed signals from the government are not unusual .
Reports from the Environmental Investigation Agency , TRAFFIC , and WildAid have cited complicity of authorities across Southeast Asia in the wildlife trade .
Cross - border trade of large volumes of wildlife necessitates collaboration between traffickers and officials .
Border agents in Laos and Thailand are known to impose a " tax " on wildlife products , regardless of their origin or legality .
Those who run the trade tend to be influential , often with ties to corrupt government officials or the military , and do n't limit themselves to wildlife ; investigations have turned up links to other illicit trade , including weapons , drugs , and people .
Some charged with carrying out the law act with impunity ; forest rangers sometimes cite access to fresh meat as a chief benefit of a field assignment , according to Sarinda Singh , a University of Queensland researcher who conducted an assessment of wildlife trade in Laos .
In many parts of Southeast Asia , depletion of rare species has only increased their value , encouraging hunting down to every last individual in some cases .
The result : Many areas now suffer from " empty forest syndrome , " where wildlife densities are too low to support people or predators like tigers .
Addressing the wildlife trade means attacking on two fronts : supply and demand .
Reducing demand for wildlife products in consuming countries is a critical component to this effort .
" Wildlife trade wo n't end until people stop buying , " said Troy Hansel , who works in wildlife trade monitoring for the WCS in Laos .
The supply side is more complex .
Trade restrictions eliminate a source of income for the rural poor .
So in Laos WCS is taking a multi- pronged approach to dealing with the wildlife trade .
In addition to working with the government to clarify laws and strengthen enforcement through training of wildlife authorities and customs agents , WCS has established a comprehensive program in local communities to explain which animals can be legally hunted and emphasize the consequences of wildlife depletion .
The program includes registration of firearms , an informant network funded through collection of fines , and a system of forest stations from which rangers launch patrols into protected areas .
Still , beyond enforcement and education , WCS 's Johnson and Hansel believe it is critical to prove to the Lao people that wildlife is valuable as a living entity .
The conservationists are planning to launch a small ecotourism project to help create a strong link between wildlife protection and well being of locals around Nam Et - Phou Louey .
To date , WCS 's efforts seem to be paying off .
In parts of Nam Et - Phou Louey where it has conducted its outreach project and has a strong presence , WCS sees changes in wildlife behavior that indicate less hunting pressure , including more birds in villages and wildlife along rivers .
A short foray into the park showed hopeful signs .
During a single evening boat trip in Nam Et - Phou Louey , I spotted owls , civets , a pair of otters , and an East Asian porcupine .
The day before , rangers even came across tiger tracks .
" Lots of good habitat remains , " said Johnson .
" The recovery of wildlife populations is possible with proper management . "

Reports say that about 10 middle and elementary schools in Osaka will start handing out Nintendo DS consoles to students next January .
Nintendo's plan to control the world : 80 % complete .

The Osaka Board of Education signed off on the measure , according to Japanator , potentially restoring my faith in public education systems .
Students will use " education software " to further their school studies ; and by " education software , " I assume they mean Brain Age and not Cooking Mama .
The DS 's appearance in Japanese classrooms is nothing new .
Back in 2006 , Kyoto Prefecture 's Yawata City had students spend the first ten minutes of class , studying vocab on their Nintendo portables .
As of 2009 , the prefecture was still using the DS for study .

I can't imagine taxpayers are too happy about this , especially if their kids do n't go to these schools .
Or they do n't even have any kids .
But then , Nintendo makes up a pretty serious part of Japan 's economy ; it could pay off .
Maybe every DS taxes buy for a school child will be 100 yen Nintendo puts toward making games that do n't suck .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Retail sales unexpectedly rose in January , after six straight months of declines , according to a government report Thursday that raised skepticism among economists .
The Commerce Department said total retail sales rose 1 % last month versus a revised drop of 3 % in sales in December .
December sales were originally reported to have declined 2.7 % .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com on average had forecast a decrease of 0.8 % for January .
Sales excluding autos and auto parts rose 0.9 % compared to a revised 3.2 % drop in the measure in December .
December sales minus auto purchases were originally reported to have declined 3.1 % .
Economists had forecast a decrease of 0.4 % in the measure for January , according to Briefing.com .
Has retail rebounded ?
Retail experts were quick to dismiss the rebound .
" These numbers are a little puzzling to me , " said Scott Hoyt , senior director of consumer economics with Moody's Economy.com
" The gains in apparel purchases is a bit of a surprise given the numbers we 've seen from retailers , " he added .
To his point , many specialty clothing chains reported big declines last month in their January same - store sales , a key measure of retail performance that tracks sales at stores open at least a year .
" It 's very difficult to interpret this report because it is only one data point .
And the [ positive ] numbers are incongruous with everything else that we know is hurting retailing , " Hoyt said .
Hoyt said he would n't put " too much faith " into last month 's sales increases unless he sees other data supporting the Commerce Department 's report .
Also , he said he would n't be surprised if January 's sales increases were revised lower next month .
Others had a similar reaction as Hoyt to the government 's report .
" I talk to retailers every day .
There 's no way these numbers could be as positive as they were , " said Bob Duffy , senior managing director with global advisory firm FTI Consulting .
Duffy said he looks at retailers ' monthly same - store sales numbers " to get a better pulse of what is actually happening in the industry . "
" I think was happened last month was retailers were trying to generate additional cash .
So a lot of merchandise was on clearance , " Duffy said .
" The 50 % , 60 % discounts were driving some consumers to spend , but this can't go on long term .
I am not saying something turned [ for retailers ] last month , " he said .
Even the National Retail Federation ( NRF ) , the industry 's largest trade group , tempered expectations that retail sales could be recovering after a brutal 2008 .
" While 2009 got off to a surprising start , it 's going to be difficult for retailers to maintain this momentum , " NRF chief economist Rosalind Wells , said in a statement Thursday .
While seasonal increases " were encouraging for retailers , budget - conscious consumers still spent much less this year compared to last January , " the group said .
" We expect the first half of the year to present challenges while giving way to sustained growth in the fourth quarter , " said Wells .
But Jeff Feinberg , managing director Alvarez & Marsal , a turnaround and restructuring firm , offered a somewhat different perspective .
" Elements of these [ numbers ] make perfect sense , " Feinberg said .
" First , Wal - Mart and other discounters are clearly benefiting from their new consumer base , " said Feinberg , referring to more upper income shoppers trading down to Wal - Mart 's low - priced goods .
" While department store sales were sluggish , they were not as sluggish as forecasted .
Extreme discounting has enabled [ more ] people to make purchases , " he added .
Also , Feinberg said he 's noticed that both commercial banks and auto dealers have been loosening up loans to car buyers over the past month .
This he feels has helped lift auto sales in January .
The government report showed sales rose across retail categories , including purchases at 2.6 % gain electronics sales , a 1.6 % increases in clothing sales and a 1.1 % increase in purchases at general merchandise stores .
Elsewhere , food and beverage stores logged a 2,1 % gain last month , and purchases at gasoline stations rose 2.6 % , auto purchases rose 1.6 % .
" It is impossible to square these numbers with the unit auto sales data , " Ian Shepherdson , chief U.S. economist with High Frequency Economics , wrote in a report Thursday .
The few weak spots , according to the report , included a 1.3 % decline in furniture purchases , a 3.2 % decline in sales of building materials and a 0.5 % drop in sporting goods and hobby stores .
" The underlying trend in core retail sales is still clearly downwards , " Shepherdson said .
" There is no reason to expect any recovery soon .
The headline relief today is welcome but it is unlikely to last . "
It used to be that when I saw Russian words like this – компьютер , студент , пасспорт — my eyes skipped over them like yours probably just did .
But the Cyrillic alphabet , which is used in Slavic languages like Russian as well as non-Slavic languages like Kazakh and Mongolian , is easy to learn .
Given the number of English cognates in Russian ( the language we ’ll focus on here ) , learning the Cyrillic alphabet allows you to read and understand dozens of words in Russian , including the three above ( computer , student , and passport , respectively ) .
Here ’s a short five - minute lesson on how to read Russian ’s Cyrillic alphabet …
1 . Some letters are virtually the same as in English .
The Cyrillic letters A , K , M , O , and T are close relatives of their English counterparts .
The Cyrillic letter Б ( which looks like a lowercase “ b ” ) also makes a “ b ” sound .
The letter “ C ” always makes the “ s ” sound , like in the English word “ cite . ”
2. Others are closely related to Greek .
Frat guys and sorority girls already know the letters Г ( gamma ) , P ( rho ) , П ( pi ) , and Ф ( phi ) , which are the English equivalents of “ G ” , “ R ” , “ P ” , and “ F ” , respectively .
Easy so far , right ?
Check out a few examples :
a. кафе = ?
b. бар = ?
c. опера = ?
d. робот = ?
Look below the fold for the answers …
Answers :
a. кафе́ = cafе ́
b. бар = bar
c. о́пера = opera
d. ро́бот = robot
See ?
Easy .
On to the next lesson …
3 . Some letters are imposters .
They look familiar but do n’t sound like their English counterparts .
The Russian letter “ H ” makes the “ N ” sound , “ y ” makes the English “ oo ” sound , and “ B ” sounds like the English “ V . ” This letter , И , which looks like a backwards “ N ” , makes the “ short i ” sound , as in the English word “ pin . ”
The Russian letter “ Я ” sounds nothing like it ’s mirror image in English .
Instead , it makes a “ ya ” sound , as in “ yacht . ”
Wth me so far ?
Here are a few more Russian words you already know .
a. Интерне́т = internet
b. CпyTHИK = Sputnik
c. POCCИЯ = Russia
d. PECTOPAH = restauran(t )
4 . The rest of the letters , well , they ’re just jerks .
You ’ve never seen ’em , and you just have to memorize how they sound .
Here ’s a quick run-down .
Ц = “ ts ” as in “ pizza ”
Ш = “ sh ” as in “ shoe ”
Л = “ l ” as in “ lam b ”
ж = “ zh ” as in “ measure ”
Д = “ d ” as in “ door ”
З = “ z ” as in “ zebra ”
Ю = “ oo ” or “ yu ”
Ч = “ ch ” Since the letter looks like a “ 4 ” and makes the “ ch ” sound , think of the word “ fortune . ”
Four -chun .
Get it ?
There are a few more subtleties and even a couple more letters in the alphabet , but we ’ve only got five minutes here , and I think you ’ve got the gist of it .
Time for your final exam .
Candy will be e-mailed to the top scorers .
a . You ’re in St. Petersburg and you see a restaurant with this written on it : MAKДOHAЛД’C .
Where are you ?
b. You ’re in a Moscow bar and would like to drink something authentically Russian .
Someone suggests Bо́ДKA .
What are you having ?
c. You ’re applying for your Russian visa and a form asks whether you ’ve ever criticized the Russian президе́нт .
What ’s it asking ?
Hope you ’ve enjoyed the lesson …

Anyone with information is urged to contact the police A reward of $ 250,000 ( £ 172,000 ) has been offered by Microsoft to find who is behind the Downadup / Conficker virus .
Since it started circulating in October 2008 the Conficker worm has managed to infect millions of Windows computers .
The software giant is offering the cash reward because it views the Conficker worm as a criminal attack .
" People who write this malware have to be held accountable , " said George Stathakopulos , of Microsoft 's Trustworthy Computing Group .
He told BBC News the company was " not prepared to sit back and let this kind of activity go unchecked " .
" Our message is very clear - whoever wrote this caused significant pain to our customers and we are sending a message that we will do everything we can to help with your arrest , " said Mr Stathakopulos .
Arbor Networks said as many as 12 million computers could be affected globally by Conficker / Downadup since it began prowling the web looking for vulnerable machines to infect in October .
Malicious payload
The Conficker worm is a self - replicating program that takes advantage of networks or computers that have not kept up to date with Windows security patches .
It can infect machines via a net connection or by hiding on USB memory drives used to ferry data from one computer to another .
Once in a computer it digs deep , setting up defences that make it hard to extract .
The worm can also spread via USB flash drives .
The worm slithers through networks by guessing usernames and passwords .
Security specialists recommend hardening passwords by mixing in numbers , punctuation marks and capital letters .
The virus reports in to its creators for updates by visiting a web domain .
It generates the name of the domain itself using a complicated code which security firms have cracked to track the growth of the worm and block its progress .
Malware such as Downadup can be triggered to steal data or turn control of infected computers over to malicious hackers which pool them into larger armies of so - called botnets .
These networks of compromised machines can be used to send spam , as dead drops for stolen or pirated data and to launch attacks on other machines .
Although Downadup is widespread its creators have yet to activate its payload to steal data or launch other attacks .
It has caused costly headaches for network administrators dealing with users locked out of their accounts when the worm correctly guesses a password .
While Microsoft says it does not know the intention of the worm 's creator , it wants to ensure it does not wreak any more havoc .
Experts say users should have up - to - date anti-virus software and install Microsoft 's MS08 - 067 patch - also known as KB958644 .
Global response Microsoft has also partnered with security companies , domain name providers , academia , internet companies such as AOL and others on a co-ordinated global response to the worm .
Millions of computers have been hit by Conficker Also included is the US Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security .
" The best way to defeat potential botnets like Conficker / Downadup is by the security and Domain Name System communities working together , " said Greg Rattray , chief internet security adviser at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( Icann ) .
" Icann represents a community that 's all about co-ordinating those kinds of efforts to keep the internet globally secure and stable . "
Sasser worm
In 2003 Microsoft created its reward programme with $ 5 m ( £ 3.4 m ) in funding to help law enforcement agencies bring computer virus and worm authors to justice .
This reward for help in tracking the creators of Downadup is the first time in four years that the company has put up some cash in response to a worm outbreak .
Microsoft hopes its bounty has started the countdown to finding its creator " We have not seen this type of worm or one of its class since 2004 , " said Mr Stathakopulos .
In 2005 Microsoft paid out $ 250,000 ( £ 171,000 ) to two individuals who helped identify the creator of the notorious Sasser worm .
The author was arrested and sentenced by the German authorities .
Rewards of $ 250,000 were offered over three other major computer worm threats known as Blaster , MyDoom and Sobig worms .
Those perpetrators have never been caught .

Along with Russia , Venezuela , Iran and the Dubai property market , add another name to the list of bubble economies hurt by the falling price of oil : the ethanol industry .
And naturally , the ethanol lobby is looking for a bailout on top of its regular taxpayer subsidies .
The commodity bust has clobbered corn ethanol , whose energy inefficiencies require high oil prices to be competitive .
The price of ethanol at the pump has fallen nearly in half in recent months to $ 1.60 from $ 2.90 per gallon due to lower commodity prices , and ...
Never believe that polls do n't matter .
They are like the lighting and soundtrack for Westminster drama .
They set the mood , throw the shadows and change the meaning of words .
And once more that atmosphere is changing .
The Tories are up again .
Labour people are despairing again .
The prime minister is struggling to maintain authority and status .
In a small way , the change is reflected in the number of commentators who are once more discussing the prospect of a spring poll , perhaps coinciding with the English local and European elections .
Mostly talk of a snap election reflects ministerial confidence .
This time it reflects the opposite .
It is being discussed because the alternative , hanging on until spring 2010 , through a year of corporate failures , mass bankruptcies , fast - rising unemployment , a shrinking pound and growing political protest looks too grim to contemplate .
Better amputation now than certain death later .
These days , anything 's possible .
Certainly the public mood is swinging from scared to vengeful .
The bankers may have said sorry but it does n't wash .
After watching their Commons evidence sessions , I heard a story that sums up their problem .
They did indeed have media coaching before the MPs ' grilling .
One coach asked one of them how much he earned .
" I 'm afraid I do n't know , " came the reply .
Oh dear .
But I also watched Gordon Brown 's evidence to the liaison committee this week and found myself squirming as he refused , again and again , to apologise for any failings on his part .
This has become embarrassing .
Yes , I know , it 's the game being played by Cameron - get him to say sorry , then call on him to go .
But among the many who failed , the chancellor , now prime minister , cannot step aside and blame someone else .
He was there throughout .
He took credit for the good times .
He made friends with the same Scottish bankers now in disgrace .
The failed regulatory system was the one he set up .
The Tories also went along for the ride .
So did much of the media .
So did many more , here and around the world .
But an honest reflection on what he got wrong , and why , would perhaps be the only thing that could restore some of his reputation right now .
People are very angry .
They want plain speaking .
This assumes , of course , that Brown is going to stay on .
But let me pass on a story doing the rounds among a few senior Labour people at Westminster .
I can't say it will happen and I am sure Downing Street would deny it , with a hearty , but not necessarily convincing , laugh .
But it comes from quite close to the inner core .
It 's worth bearing in mind .
It starts with the 2 April London G20 summit .
This will be an important moment , with lots of red carpet , as leaders queue to be photographed with President Obama .
But as the world stares at full - blown depression , with countries such as China and Germany under huge pressure to do more to revive the global economy , it 's a lot more important than that .
What will actually come out of it ?
Well , there 's one near - certainty : agreement about the need for a new global financial regulator , whether based inside or outside the IMF .
I 'm told the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , has a favourite candidate to head this new body - Gordon Brown .
She is said to be quietly pushing the idea behind the scenes and getting quite a good reaction from other leaders .
Obama can be won over , says my source , and even Sarkozy would be pleased to see the man he 's been tussling with off the European stage .
My immediate reaction was that this was daft , not least because Brown would want to soldier on and take his case through an election , even if he thought he would be beaten .
There is an almost illogical doggedness about the man and he has spent his life waiting for this time in No 10 .
Wo n't his every instinct say : soldier on and hope for vindication ?
Yes , goes the argument , but he is n't stupid .
He reads the polls .
He knows he faces a catastrophic defeat .
Now it 's only a matter of when .
If there is a lifeboat - jump .
My second reaction was : what about Labour ?
Does n't the party want Brown to take them through the election , go down fighting - if that 's what happens - and then start again with a new leader ?
Not necessarily .
If Brown stepped aside and was replaced by , say , Alan Johnson , then Labour might do better in that election .
The one quality Johnson does have is authenticity - and that is what is needed right now .
Labour people are n't saying they would actually win it , but think that they could limit a Tory majority , or hold them to a hung parliament .
Other cabinet ministers are again taking very private soundings about their own standing , and what needs to be done .
This brings us to my third reaction - and perhaps biggest objection .
After the events of the past few weeks , culminating in the Lloyds - HBOS fiasco , Brown 's CV as financial regulator is - how shall we put it ?
- looking a little tarnished .
It was meant to be a brilliant coup , keeping both banks in the private sector , limiting taxpayer exposure and showing Brown 's deft use of private contacts .
That is n't how it looks now .
It all adds a layer of extra sensitivity to the government 's battle to defend its reputation .
Brown and his ministers still insist that the economic crisis was mainly an imported problem and that , though the bail - outs have been expensive , they have so far saved the banks and prevented complete melt - down .
Lessons are being learned , with changes to bank regulation , but after all , nobody else spotted the dangers either .
Up to now Labour has had the benefit of the doubt .
Perhaps that should be benefit of the ignorance , because the vast majority of people struggle to understand the financial system , and therefore struggle to apportion blame .
But this may be changing .
There seems to be a quite dramatic slide downwards in the opinion polls and for the first time David Cameron 's message that it's the fault of Brown and Labour , for not regulating better , is getting through .
The personal involvement of Brown in the Lloyds - HBOS deal - and if it had to be fully rescued by the taxpayer we would be talking about one of the greatest corporate disasters in British history - comes at the worst possible time .
So there we are - a possible lurch in the plot in the final act of the drama .
I stress , only possible .
But Brown must be feeling dreadfully battered .
Even his reserves of self - belief are n't limitless .
The Labour party is asking whether it would save a few score seats with a different leader .
And remember , the lighting and mood music have changed .
It 's a wild thought .
But these are wild times .

Scaling Rails -
A free 13 - part series of screencasts
New Relic - the Rails app performance monitoring folks - has launched RailsLab , a free resource for Rails developers who want to learn about things relating to Rails application performance .
They 've kicked it off with a free 13 part screencast series by Gregg Pollack ( of EnvyCasts fame ) called Scaling Rails .
There are seven episodes live so far and you can download all of them in MPEG4 format for free .
The episodes so far cover page responsiveness , page caching , cache expiration , New Relic 's RPM service , advanced page caching , action caching , and fragment caching respectively .
There 's a lot to learn here , and for free it's , well , excellent value for money ;-)
It 's interesting to see a company like New Relic sponsoring screencasting efforts ( and , I 'm told , there 's more of this sort of thing to come ) rather than them being released commercially .
Do you think this is a good way forward ?
Since everyone gets the content for free and there appears to be no conflict of interest here or in the content , I 'm all for it , but I 'd love to hear your opinions in the comments here .

A random , innocent tweet by Gunnar Peterson ( @oneraindrop ) got me emoting about whether or not Information Security should be viewed / pitched as a business enabler .
This is the tweet that got me going :
Please remember that security is a business enabler kthxbye
And I disagree (d ) .
Security is n’t an “ enabler ” ; that line can hurt us .
Security is about NOT doing things wrong , as part of overall quality .
To “ enable ” business is to add value above and beyond simply not sucking .
So if security is an enabler then so is an oven mit .
At that point my friend Ken ( @kenotic ) got involved and said that the oven mit WAS an enabler because without it you ’d hurt yourself and not be able to cook .
He essentially argued that security is necessary for business , and it enables business to take place , so it ( by definition ) IS a business enabler .
That ’s hard to argue from a technical standpoint ; I mean the word is right there in the definition .
My problem with that approach is that it widens the definition so much as to make it useless .
If a word means everything then it means nothing .
And if everything a company does , including having fire extinguishers and a parking lot , is going to be called a “ business enabler ” , then there ’s no point in pitching infosec as one as well .
But let ’s not get too caught up with definitions .
Business “ enabler ” might mean different things to different people , and I agree that it CAN mean everything including free coffee and hand sanitizer .
But that ’s not what matters .
What matters is what it means to those we ’re selling it to , i.e. the business .
So if you say to a business person , in an attempt to promote information security , that information security “ enables ” business , I think you should have a more direct link in your claim than one to general supporting infrastructure .
And that ’s where Gunnar added to the conversation again with a simple yet powerful quote :
“ Because we have brakes in our cars we can drive fast . ” – Robert Garigue
The beauty of the brakes - to - speed analogy is that it transfers nicely to business .
So a company could be agile in that they are able to forge new partnerships quickly ( speed ) , but they could be bad at securing their assets when doing so ( no brakes ) , which makes them more likely to crash .
As a result , the business will be less likely to move quickly ( speed / agility ) because they do n’t have the brakes ( security ) to do so safely .
I ’ve always liked this analogy , and I ’ve used it before when flirting with the whole concept of “ business enabling ” and “ security ROI ” in the past .
But I no longer believe in such things .
The reason this analogy fails is that it is looking at the speed of the car WITHOUT brakes as a comparison to the speed of the car WITH brakes .
This is wrong .
The speed of the car is the speed WITH brakes , and improvements to the brakes are improvements to the car .
The car as a whole is all that matters .
It ’s infrastructure .
It ’s plumbing .
In a CEO ’s big picture , there ’s no difference between a web application firewall and a fire alarm and sprinkler system .
Ultimately they both reduce to one thing : an operating expense .
I think IT in general can be an enabler , say through a new VPN system that lets a CEO quickly spin up a workforce , but even then it ’s not likely to be perceived , by the business , as the same type of “ enabler ” as an ad campaign , for example .
I have more to say on this , but the ideas are still brewing .
I ’d love to hear thoughts in the interim . ::
FOR the past 15 years Canada and Mexico have been joined with the United States in the three - way North American Free - Trade Agreement .
But both still set much more store by their bilateral relationship with their superpower neighbour .
This has led to sometimes farcical rivalry .
To the joy of Canadian officials , Barack Obama is making his first , albeit brief , foreign visit as American president to Ottawa on February 19th .
But Mexican officials whisper that their president , Felipe Calderón , got in first with a lunch with Mr Obama days before his inauguration .
More seriously , a growing number of Canadians , including politicians , trade negotiators and former ambassadors , have called for their government to turn its back on NAFTA and put all its efforts into improving bilateral ties with Washington .
Canada was always a reluctant member of NAFTA , joining the talks mostly to safeguard gains made in a bilateral free - trade deal with the United States concluded five years earlier .
Politicians chafe when Canada is lumped together with Mexico , as happened last year during Mr Obama 's campaign when he vowed to renegotiate NAFTA to protect Americans from weak environmental and labour standards .
Even more woundingly , Janet Napolitano , the new secretary of homeland security , who is a former governor of Arizona , ordered a review of the northern border , saying that it presented a greater terrorist threat than the southern one .
Peter Harder , a former Canadian deputy foreign minister , argues that NAFTA holds back bilateral ties .
“ It is not in our interests to allow the speed of three to define the relationship of two , ” says Mr Harder .
“ We have trilateralised for too long . ”
That view has been echoed by John Manley , a former Liberal deputy prime minister .
In fact many cross - border problems differ only in degree .
That applies to the drug trade , gun smuggling , border security , the environment and illegal immigration .
All three countries have a stake in the floundering car industry , which is organised on a North American basis .
Canada and Mexico are the United States ' top two suppliers of imported energy , giving them both an interest in Mr Obama 's plans for energy and environmental measures .
Few Canadians speak up for enhancing ties with Mexico .
But before leaving Ottawa this month , Emilio Goicoechea , Mexico 's ambassador , wrote a rebuttal urging Canada to stay the trilateral course .
Trade between the two has grown fivefold since 1994 to $ 21 billion in 2007 — though that is dwarfed by the United States ' two - way trade with Mexico , worth $ 349 billion , and with Canada ( $ 566 billion ) .
Some Canadian companies have invested in Mexico : Bombardier has factories making aircraft parts and trains , while Scotiabank is Mexico 's seventh - biggest bank .
In questioning NAFTA , Canadians do not just risk playing to protectionists in America 's Democratic Party .
Their belief that on its own Canada would get more attention than Mexico also looks misplaced .
Canada 's economy may be 40 % bigger , but its population is much smaller .
Mr Obama has recognised that he owes his electoral victory in part to Hispanic voters ( most of whom are of Mexican descent ) .
More than half a million Americans live in Mexico .
And the security problems in Mexico caused by the American demand for cocaine are a growing worry to policymakers in both countries .
“ By working together with Mexico we remain on the radar screen , ” says Carlo Dade of the Canadian Foundation for the Americas , a think - tank .
Canada 's prime minister , Stephen Harper , has made no comment on trilateral relations , except to oppose reopening NAFTA .
He has made Latin America a foreign - policy priority , and gets on well with Mr Calderón .
When the Buy America provisions of the American Congress 's economic stimulus plan hit the news , Mr Harper called Mr Calderón to confer on how to fight protectionism .
The Democrats in Congress may have unwittingly handed Canada and Mexico something big their relationship has lacked in the past — a common cause .
Layered rocks in Terby Crater
Terby Crater is a 174 - kilometre ( 108 - mile ) wide crater that sinks some 5 km ( 3 miles ) into the Martian crust .
It 's located on the northern rim of the large Hellas impact basin in the southern hemisphere of Mars and holds a wide range of landforms .
The mesa of layered deposits imaged here is located in the north - central part of the crater 's interior .
Hydrated minerals , including hydrated sulphates and clays , have been detected in these layers , providing evidence that Terby and Hellas may once have held an enormous lake up to 3.6 km ( 2.2 miles ) deep .

Pollack Crater 's White Rock
First imaged by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1972 , this enigmatic group of wind - eroded ridges covers 15 by 18 km ( 9 by 11 miles ) of Pollack Crater 's floor .
The feature 's higher reflectivity , or albedo - compared with the darker material on the crater 's floor - makes it appear white .
In reality , White Rock has a dull , reddish colour and is likely composed of accumulated dust and sand with some fine - grained olivine ( a volcanic mineral that degrades easily in water ) , surrounded by basaltic sand .

Herschel Crater 's dark dunes
These dark - toned , crescent - shaped dunes are located on the floor of Herschel Crater - a 300 - km ( 186 - mile ) wide impact basin in the ancient , cratered southern highlands of Mars .
Barchan , or crescent - shaped , dunes are formed by winds that blow mostly in one direction - the dunes ' " horns " point downwind .
In this case , the strongest winds blow roughly north to south .
Herschel 's basaltic sand dunes appear to have a pitted and grooved texture , indicating that the dune sands may be cemented together , or lithified .

Swirls of Rock in Candor Chasma
Candor Chasma is a deep , elongated , steep - sided depression some 813 km ( 505 miles ) long .
It is one of two large canyons that make up the northern end of the Valles Marineris canyon system - the solar system 's grandest canyon .
Horizontal layers of sand - and dust - sized particles have been folded to form intricate swirls and curves .
The layers may have originally been laid down as sediments that accumulated in shallow lakes , since MRO 's CRISM spectrometer has found hydrated sulphates in Candor .
The sedimentary layers were probably deformed later and eroded , exposing the elaborate patterns we see today .

Large earthquakes have rumbled along a southern section of the San Andreas fault more frequently than previously believed , suggesting that Southern California could be overdue for a strong temblor on the notorious fault line , a new study has found .
The Carrizo Plain section of the San Andreas has not seen a massive quake since the much - researched Fort Tejon temblor of 1857 , which at an estimated magnitude of 7.9 is considered the most powerful earthquake to hit Southern California in modern times .
But the new research by UC Irvine scientists , to be published next week , found that major quakes occurred there roughly every 137 years over the last 700 years .
Until now , scientists believed big quakes occurred along the fault roughly every 200 years .
The findings are significant because seismologists have long believed this portion of the fault is capable of sparking the so - called Big One that officials have for decades warned will eventually occur in Southern California .

“ It ’s been long enough since 1857 that we should be concerned about another great earthquake that ruptures through this part of the fault , ” said Ken Hudnut , a geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena who was not involved in the study .
Many scientists thought the Carrizo area produced relatively infrequent but large - scale earthquakes such as the Fort Tejon temblor .
The new work suggests the area produces more quakes but also ones of a smaller magnitude than Fort Tejon , said Ray Weldon , a University of Oregon geologist who was not involved in the research but reviewed the paper for the Journal of Geophysical Research .
Such temblors , experts warned , would likely be at least as big as the 1994 Northridge quake , which had a magnitude of 6.7 .
“ Even moderate earthquakes on the San Andreas can cause considerable damage , so the overall hazard and risk has gone up , ” Weldon said .

The section of the San Andreas fault threading through the dry Carrizo Plain is one of the most famous and photographed parts of the fault because creek beds and other features on one side of the fault have clearly shifted away from matching features on the other side .
About 100 miles northwest of Los Angeles , the Carrizo area was one of the main sections that ruptured in the 1857 quake .
That rupture , roaring southwest into the Los Angeles Basin , rocked parts of the region so hard that men were thrown to the ground .
Lisa Grant Ludwig , a principal investigator on the study , first visited the Carrizo Plain about 20 years ago , digging trenches in an area west of the Panorama Hills known as the Bidart Fan .
By looking at the pattern of soils and using radiocarbon dating on charcoal deposits , she found evidence of five large earthquakes dating back to the early 1200s .
She found a gap of some 400 years between the 1857 earthquake and the one before , but only about 100 years separating the three preceding quakes .
Back then , the earthquake age estimates were very rough and the samples had to be fairly large , about the size of a jelly bean .
Ludwig saved field notes and hundreds of soil samples in glass vials in her garage for more than 15 years , hoping that radiocarbon dating techniques would improve .

Once the technology improved , Ludwig and her colleagues could date samples with much higher precision and analyze charcoal flakes as small as the tip of a pencil .
They went back to her archive , and the redating effort , led by scholar Sinan Akciz , found that the four big earthquakes before the 1857 temblor probably occurred around 1310 , 1393 , 1585 and 1640 .
“ We were better able to constrain the dates and show that actually these five earthquakes were pretty evenly spaced , ” Ludwig said .
Because they are looking at only a handful of earthquakes , scientists ca n’t be sure that the pattern will hold , Ludwig said .
Advertisement
“ But we know it increases the probability of an earthquake , ” she said .
“ There ’s not any way I can look at the data and be comforted by it . ”
Ludwig ’s team has dug some new trenches in the area to supplement the redating project , hoping to find new soil samples that show the increased frequency of large earthquakes .
Results wo n’t be finalized for a few months , Ludwig said , but preliminary analysis suggests that the time interval between earthquakes may be even shorter , something on the order of 100 years .

* Nvidia seeks termination of Intel ’s right to its patents
* Nvidia says
Intel trying to undermine licensing rights ( Adds details from lawsuit , Intel comments )
SAN FRANCISCO , March 26 ( Reuters ) - Graphics chipmaker Nvidia Corp NVDA.O countersued Intel Corp INTC.O for breach of contract on Thursday , alleging that Intel made misleading statements designed to undermine Nvidia 's licensing rights .
The suit seeks to terminate Intel ’s license to Nvidia ’s patents related to graphics processing and three - dimensional computing and comes in response to a related suit by Intel last month .
Nvidia believes that without a licensing agreement , Intel ’s line of integrated graphics chips violate Nvidia ’s patent portfolio , according to Nvidia spokesman Hector Marinez .
The complaint represents the latest salvo in an escalating feud between the two chipmakers that has moved from the marketplace to the courtroom .
Intel asked a Delaware court in February to rule that its new generation of microprocessors , such as the Nehalem chip , are not covered under a 2004 cross-licensing agreement between the two companies .
That would prevent Nvidia from selling its chipsets that function alongside Intel ’s new microprocessors .
Intel is the world ’s No. 1 maker of PC microprocessors , with a more than 80 percent market share , according to IDC .
In its countersuit , Nvidia said that Intel has “ manufactured ” the licensing dispute as part of a “ calculated strategy to eliminate Nvidia as a competitive threat , ” and says it is fully licensed to continue making products that interact with Intel microprocessors .
The disagreement stems from the fact that Intel ’s new generation of Nehalem microprocessors feature an integrated memory controller .
According to Intel , the 2004 licensing agreement only covers its previous generation of products , in which the memory controller was separate from the microprocessor .
“ There is a substantial disagreement between Intel and Nvidia about their licensing rights under the agreement , ” said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy .
“ We ’ve been trying multiple times , multiple ways to find a way to settle the argument , ” Mulloy said .
The suit simply asks the court to interpret the agreement , he said .
In its counterclaim , filed on Thursday , Nvidia said Intel has attempted to steer customers away from Nvidia products for months by claiming there was a licensing dispute .
By officially disavowing the licensing pact through its lawsuit , Intel has breached the contract , Nvidia said .
“ Having breached the contract and irreparably injured Nvidia , Intel has lost the right to continue to enjoy the considerable benefit of its license to Nvidia ’s patent portfolio . ”

The female journalist was snatched by members of a secret society , forcibly stripped and made to parade naked through the streets .
It might sound like an atrocity from the time when Sierra Leone was ripped apart by a bloody civil war , but in fact the public humiliation was exacted in the diamond - rich eastern town of Kenema just this month .
The woman 's alleged crime was reporting on female genital mutilation .
While the attack was condemned by media watchdogs as " disgraceful behaviour worthy of a bygone age " , one woman who was not surprised was Rugiatu Turay .
When she was 12 Ms Turay was stolen away by family members and underwent what some politely refer to as " circumcision " .
She calls it " torture " .
For the past six years , she has been waging a war against the practice , which many in Sierra Leone , including senior politicians , see as an initiation rite .
Her organisation , the Amazonian Initiative Movement , tries to protect young girls from the knife .
" I picked the name because I am trying to talk about strong , powerful women , " she says Ms Turay , who works with her 20 - strong staff in and around the northern town of Lunsar .
So far , she has persuaded about 400 practitioners of female genital mutiliation ( FGM ) , who are often called soweis , to lay down their blades and stop their role in the traditional bondo ceremony .
" Silence means consent .
But if you say the truth people listen ...
We go to the schools , mosques , everywhere . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
As reward for her tenacious efforts , she has received death threats and been attacked by juju men , sometimes armed with magic , sometimes with machetes .
She describes a time when more than a hundred people paraded a symbolic corpse outside her home to suggest her own death : " They came right in front of me sharpening their cutlasses . "
But so many times has she failed to die , that locals now think she is immune .
" Now they believe I have special powers .
They do nothing to me . "
Ms Turay was mutilated at her aunt 's house where she was staying with her three sisters and her cousin .
" We did n't even know that we were going to be initiated , " she says .
" They called me to get water and then outside they just grabbed me . "
She was blindfolded , stripped , and laid on the ground .
Heavy women sat on her arms , her chest , her legs .
Her mouth was stuffed with a rag .
Her clitoris was cut off with a crude knife .
Despite profuse bleeding she was forced to walk , was beaten and had hot pepper water poured into her eyes .
" My mother had always told me never to let anyone touch me there .
I was scared and I tried to fight them off .
Nobody talked to me but there was all this clapping , singing , shouting , " recalls Ms Turay .
" When I tried to walk on the seventh day I could not walk .
All they could say is ' Today you have become a woman ' . "
Ms Turay is among the estimated 94 per cent of girls who undergo FGM in Sierra Leone .
The practice – which forms part of a ceremony of initiation rites overseen by women - only secret societies such as bondo and sande – can cause severe bleeding , infection , cysts and sometimes death , but is largely ignored .
Reasons for the process vary , but many people cite tradition and culture , saying it is essential preparation for marriage and womanhood ; binds communities to each other and to their ancestors ; and restricts women 's sexual behaviour .

Last year , UN agencies came out strongly against the practice , labelling it " painful and traumatic " , a violation of human rights and demanding it be abandoned within a generation .
" It has no health benefits and harms girls and women in many ways , " said the UN's World Health Organisation ( WHO ) .
" The practice causes severe pain and has several immediate and long - term health consequences , including difficulties in childbirth . "
Yet many international aid organisations are too scared to do anything about it in public for fear of being labelled cultural imperialists .
A recent Sierra Leone child rights bill dropped any mention of FGM at the last minute , and politicians – including President Ernest Bai Koroma – baulk at the mention of the subject .
A decade ago , a female politician who later became the minister for social welfare said : " We will sew the mouths up of those preaching against bondo . "
More recently , politicians are rumoured to have sponsored mass cutting ceremonies , which can be relatively costly affairs in one of the world 's poorest countries , in an effort to secure votes in elections .
" Secret societies have become intertwined with modern political life in Sierra Leone and retain considerable power and influence , " wrote the anthropologist Dr Richard Fanthorpe in a paper commissioned by the UN .
When I asked President Koroma – whose country receives more aid per person from Britain than any other donor recipient – about his position on the practice , it was the first time I saw the usually affable leader lost for words .
Unable to reach for his usually ubiquitous wide toothy smile , he meandered awkwardly through an answer : " Let people in civil society deal with this issue . "
That leaves the fight against FGM , which the WHO says has been conducted on 92 million African girls – and rising by up to three million a year – to the odd brave soul such as Ms Turay .
The 26 - year - old is among a number of anti-FGM campaigners slowly achieving results .
In her effort to keep some safe from cutting , Ms Turay has even adopted 14 children from Sierra Leone and Guinea .
Girls under 15 regularly undergo the cutting and for the newly initiated , it remains a frightening process shrouded in secrecy .
" You should not tell anybody about circumcision or else your stomach will swell and you 'll die , " one young girl who did n't know her age told me quietly in her local Temne language .
Ms Turay hopes her struggle will help break such taboos of talking about the cutting in public , although it may also spur more reactionary moves , such as this month 's punishment meted out to the journalist in Kenema .
And it is no easy task persuading the practitioners to abandon what they see as a rite of passage .
Girls as young as five are trained to become circumcisers and it is an income - generator in a poverty - stricken country , still struggling to shrug off the legacy of the 1991 - 2002 civil war .
" I did n't like it when it happened to me and I worry about the pain of the girl , but I do it because they pay me , and because we met our ancestors doing it , " says practitioner Marion Kanu , 35 , whose two children are also practitioners .
Others have seen the error of their ways .
" I regret it now , " says another sowei who has vowed to stop .
But it is not always easy to hang up the knife .
One woman practitioner who said she would stop the cutting was kidnapped by members of the bundu society .
Both her and her baby were beaten and taken to the bush for three days without food or water ; the mother was raped .
Her life was saved only by Ms Turay 's intervention .
Q : What do proteins , snowflakes , and these figures have in common ?
A : They ’re all instances of “ minimum inventory / maximum diversity ” systems , a term coined by Peter Pearce in his book , Structure in Nature Is a Strategy for Design ( MIT Press , 1978 ) .
A minimum inventory / maximum diversity system is a kit of modular parts and rules of assembly that gives you maximal design bang for your design - component buck .
It ’s a system that achieves a wide variety of effects from a small variety of parts .
Nature excels at this game : every one of the many millions of natural proteins is assembled from an inventory of just 20 amino acids .
Snowflakes are all just arrangements of the humble water molecule , H 2 O .
The same idea applies to the forms in the figure above , which are all constructed from semicircles joined at connection points evenly distributed along a vertical line .
I stumbled onto this minimum inventory / maximum diversity system while playing with logo designs for a previous blog post , Exploring Logo Designs with Mathematica .
The idea came from a logo for a concert hall by Peter Andermatt , approximated here :
In my previous post , I was exploring parametric variations of logo designs in Mathematica .
Although this concert - hall logo is trivially easy to parameterize and get into Mathematica , I nearly did n’t try doing so because I did n’t think that the exploration would lead anywhere interesting .
So much for my intuition .
Relative to its simplicity , the idea of joining semicircles at fixed points along a line is one of the richest and most expressive component systems that I ’ve run across .
That becomes apparent once you build a widget to explore the concept .
Not wanting to invest much effort in something that I thought would n’t be productive , I dashed off a widget that hooked up sliders to the y - coordinate values of the endpoints of the semicircles :
This is what I saw as I began to twiddle the sliders :
Nothing astounding here , but at this early point two things became apparent : ( 1 ) there was more out there to explore than I had expected , and ( 2 ) it would be worth my while to invest effort in a better widget to explore it with .
My quick - and - dirty widget had done its job : it pointed the way toward something more interesting .
If it had n’t been so easy to construct , I probably would n’t have made it , and I would have passed right by the elegantly simple system I ’m about to describe .
This is one of the strengths of Mathematica : you can do things on a whim that with other systems would require so much effort that they would n’t be worth your while .
And so you miss opportunities to discover new things .
I designed a more usable widget ( using the Locator function ) that let me drag the semicircles directly and add and remove semicircles by command - clicking on a Mac ( alt - clicking for Windows ) .
I also gave myself more control over the details of how the forms are rendered .
This took more thought than my initial attempt , particularly in understanding how to constrain the locators so that the endpoints of the semicircles land on the connection points .
Nevertheless , I had the new exploration widget refined and running in about 20 minutes .
I think it has an impressively high ratio of functionality to volume of code .
Now I was off and running through this space of designs , and discovering all sorts of intriguing forms .
The more I explored , the more I wanted to explore :
I began to notice recurring themes — the idioms of this design language — such as spirals , wormy forms , and the comma-shaped Fischblase or mouchette found in Gothic window traceries :
To get a better overview of the material I had to work with , I decided to do some exhaustive generation of forms .
For that , I needed a representation of forms and a function for rendering it .
I settled on an ArcForm expression whose arguments are the list of y - coordinate values of the connection points , and lists of endpoint indices for the left and right arcs .
Here is an example :
With this representation , writing a function that generates all of the forms with a given number of connection points is straightforward and concise .
The function forms all pairs of connection points , then all subsets of the pairs , then all pairs of the subsets .
Every possible arc form is contained in those combinations .
Now I could begin to see in a systematic way what ’s out there .
With two connection points , there are four possible forms ( one of which , with 0 left arcs and 0 right arcs , is empty ) :
With three connection points , that number goes up to 64 .
This figure is the beginning of a useful catalog of the basic vocabulary of this design language :
From there the number of forms grows so quickly that after three connection points it is no longer practical to render them all .
A back - of - the - envelope Mathematica calculation shows just how quickly .
There are Binomial [ n , 2 ] possible two - element subsets of n objects — the number of different arcs available for each side of a form with n connection points .
There are 2 ^ Binomial [ n , 2 ] ways of taking subsets of that set — the number of arc combinations available for each side .
And the square of that number gives the total number of distinct forms , as each form combines one member of that set on the left side with one member on the right side .
Thus the total number of forms with n connection points is
How quickly that number rises is graphically evident in this table :
With a modest eight connection points , a figure showing all possible forms drawn at the scale of the figure above would almost exactly cover North America .
Imagine crisscrossing the continent from Panama to Alaska to Greenland on your hands and knees , nose to the ground , searching for forms !
No , really try to imagine that !
Think about how huge a task exploring a figure the size of a mere soccer field would be .
Now think about crawling around your entire city .
Extrapolate to your continent .
Such is the magnitude of the search task , an immensity that you ’re hardly aware of when such large numbers are hidden behind the buttons and sliders of an exploration widget .
From here on out , this was the central problem I grappled with : how to grasp the possibilities within this ungraspably large space of designs .
Now my adventure became both exploration and meta-exploration .
At the same time I was exploring the design space , I was exploring how best to explore the design space .
Mathematica ‘s trivially - easy - to - use interface constructs made it possible for me to try out and discard a number of widget possibilities before I arrived at a combination that worked well for the amount of effort I was willing to invest .
I tried “ scrubbing ” through entire design spaces using sliders , random sampling of various sorts , and several methods of presenting samples .
What I arrived at is a pair of widgets that work together : a “ discovery ” widget for sampling the design space , and a “ design ” widget for developing particular forms that I picked out of the design space .
This is the discovery widget ( click for an enlarged view ) :
The discovery widget implements a “ generate - and - test ” paradigm : it randomly generates forms with a given number of connection points and left and right arcs , and selects those that meet given criteria .
Each press of the “ more ” button gives a new sample , whose size I can control .
By displaying many forms at once , I get an aerial view of the design space and can cover territory more quickly .
The selection criteria are implemented as filter functions that given an ArcForm return True ( retain ) or False ( reject ) .
Here is the filter for forms that contain at least one circle .
It tests that there is some member of the left arcs that also occurs in the right arcs .
Such a pair forms a circle .
I wrote additional filters for rotational symmetry , forms that are enclosed in an outer circle , forms with limited arc radii , and so on .
I designed the filter portion of the widget so that I could easily drop in new filters as they occurred to me .
The last section of controls in the widget let me choose how the forms are rendered .
Depending on what graphical phenomenon I ’m interested in , I may want to see thick or thin lines , butt or round end caps , black - on - white or white - on - black .
With this widget , I sampled spaces of increasingly complex forms , pulling out some that I thought gave the illusion of design intention ; that is , that appeared to show evidence of a human hand .
This is what I found :
5 connection points , 1 left arc , 2 right arcs :
5 connection points , 2 left arcs , 2 right arcs :
6 connection points , 1 left arc , 2 right arcs :
6 connection points , 2 left arcs , 2 right arcs :
6 connection points , 3 left arcs , 2 right arcs :
8 connection points , 3 left arcs , 4 right arcs :
One of the more interesting filters is the one for rotational symmetry .
Turning it on yields forms that remind me of traditional printer ’s embellishments …
… as well as some non-traditional candidates .
Rotational symmetry also yields a practically inexhaustible supply of “ S ” logos .
Most are unlikely to win a beauty contest , and they tend to have a forties or fifties design vibe .
But each is interesting in its own right , and together they are a reminder of how very many variations there can be on a single theme .
Some of the generate - and - test filters are fantastically inefficient .
A rotational - symmetry - with - maximum - arc - diameter - 2 filter that I used while exploring the printer ’s embellishments rejects upwards of 2000 forms for every one that it accepts .
But who cares !
It ’s fantastically efficient for me .
The scheme was easy to implement , and I was able to get down to the real work of exploring quickly .
The typical laptop is capable of generating and testing half a million forms in the amount of time I ’m willing to wait after clicking the “ more ” button .
The second component of my exploration tools — the “ design ” widget — pops up when you click one of the forms in the discovery widget .
It provides a way of exploring a single form in detail .
The design widget has the same rendering controls as the discovery widget , but also lets you drag arcs and connection points in order to fine - tune or improvise on forms .
I also added a “ negate ” setting that renders the negative spaces between the arcs rather than the arcs themselves .
The shapes of those forms had intrigued me while I was exploring the design space .
Here ’s a snapshot of the complete design widget :
Using the discovery and design widgets together is a little like beachcombing .
You wander around the design space looking for interesting forms or something that sparks an idea .
When you find one , you toss it into the design widget for tweaking or exploration of related forms .
Here is a snapshot of some informal exploration I did .
Each row of forms begins with a form picked from the discovery widget , and proceeds through an exploration in the design widget .
You can try out the discovery and design widgets yourself by downloading the Demonstrations Arc Form Discovery Widget and Arc Form Design Widget .
You may discover , as I have , that in design , constraint is freedom .
Picasso put it this way : “ Forcing yourself to use restricted means is the sort of restraint that liberates invention .
It obliges you to make a kind of progress that you ca n’t even imagine in advance . ”
I wholeheartedly agree .

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has made the rounds of national television news shows in recent months , met with President - elect Barack Obama and convened conferences , discussing the world economic crisis , the pitfalls of partisanship and the virtues of clean energy .
Now , in the new year , he has returned to Sacramento with a narrower , and much more painful , task .
He must address Californians on Thursday about the state of their state , with the government he was elected to repair five years ago in a crisis worse than the one he inherited -- one that has left the state ’s coffers short of cash , services sputtering to a halt and negotiations in the Capitol at a standstill .
The first California governor elected in a recall election will leave office in two years , giving Schwarzenegger a limited window to determine which narrative becomes his legacy .
Will he be remembered as a leader who leveraged his star power to promote visionary ideas ?
Or as the action - movie hero who unseated a sitting governor with a vow to make government function again , but was unable to deliver a happy ending ?
Although Schwarzenegger and others say his good intentions have been foiled by extremist state lawmakers , an unstable tax structure , a broken budget system and a global recession , none of that may matter when history is written , some analysts believe .

“ So far , he has n’t solved the problem that he was elected to solve , ” said Gary Jacobson , a political scientist at UC San Diego .
“ In crisis you have opportunity to be great , if you can pull it off somehow .
If you can ’t , it ’s hard to be perceived as a success . ”
Schwarzenegger and his aides have been searching for ways to broaden his focus to ideas for which he would like to be known , such as improving healthcare and education , even as he proposes to slash billions of dollars from services in those areas .
The governor , who takes pride in a lifetime of achievements in bodybuilding , Hollywood and business , would like to replicate what he considers some of his best political moments .
He signed a landmark bill to reduce global warming and advanced other policies to increase the use of clean energy ; teamed with lawmakers on a successful campaign for $ 42 billion in voter - approved public works construction bonds ; and issued a call for post - partisanship that reverberated across the nation .

“ What he ’s been able to do is to take leadership on national issues , and really ahead of everybody else , and I think he ’ll continue to do that , ” said Duf Sundheim , who was state Republican Party chairman through Schwarzenegger ’s first term .
“ He was talking about infrastructure well before anyone , ” Sundheim said .
“ Now that is a key part of what Obama is talking about .
He was talking about green technologies .
. . .
Last night , I went from CNN to NBC to Fox , and all of them were talking about post - partisanship with respect to Obama .
That was a term that Schwarzenegger came up with . ”
The governor ’s initial vision for the state has not turned out as well .
He took office in November 2003 with a commitment to “ saving California . ”
In his first State of the State speech , he boldly told constituents : “ Never again will government be allowed to spend money it does n’t have . ”
He championed a last - ditch borrowing plan , a Constitutional amendment for a balanced budget and a rainy day fund he said would take care of the problem .
Five years later , the governor is describing the future as fiscal Armageddon .
His administration has been struggling to align expenses and income for the last year and a half , laying off employees and canceling contracts .

Today , Schwarzenegger presides over a California that could run out of cash to pay bills by Feb. 1 , forcing officials to halt tax refunds and issue IOUs .
He has repeatedly criticized lawmakers as ideologues and slaves to interest groups .
His fellow Republicans abandoned budget negotiations in December .
And the populist who destroyed a car to symbolize what he would do to a hike in the vehicle license fee and who swore never to raise taxes , now proposes raising $ 14 billion mostly with new taxes , fees and a reduction of the child tax credit .
Instead of introducing his next proposed budget with a speech , as governors normally do in early January , he had his aides release it quietly on New Year ’s Eve while he was on vacation in Idaho .
Among Californians , Schwarzenegger ’s approval ratings have dropped from 60 % to 42 % between November 2006 and last month , according to polls by the Public Policy Institute of California .

Outside the state , though , Schwarzenegger has remained a highly touted expert on national affairs , receiving generally fawning coverage .
A December segment on “ 60 Minutes ” touched on the state ’s financial crisis , but mostly focused on how Schwarzenegger would “ revolutionize ” energy policy .
The CBS correspondent showed off by lifting weights in front of the governor and took a ride in Schwarzenegger ’s vegetable - oil - powered Hummer .
“ The national media has yet to really figure out that things are a mess out here , ” said a former Schwarzenegger advisor who asked for anonymity out of concern for offending the governor .
“ Here in the state , the voters have grown tired of it . ”
Schwarzenegger has continued to focus beyond California .
On Wednesday , a day after saying that the state would go off a “ cliff ” if it runs out of money at the end of the month , he joined New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Pennsylvania Gov .
Ed Rendell in a conference call with reporters about the importance of building infrastructure .
Obama had just included the idea in his economic stimulus plan .
“ We have been dealing . . . with this issue for many , many years here in California , ” Schwarzenegger said .

He did not mention that only a few weeks ago , his state ’s fiscal morass forced an abrupt halt to construction on some of those projects that were in progress to build roads , schools and stronger levees .
Bill Hauck , a California State University trustee and president of the California Business Roundtable , said the school system shut down $ 1 billion in projects that had workers on the job and materials purchased .
Hauck is close to the governor , who he says is “ making every proposal he can reasonably make ” to stabilize state finances .
“ I think that is clearly the mandate that he had coming into office , and I know that he feels strongly that he needs to accomplish that objective before he leaves office , ” Hauck said .
Schwarzenegger pushed successfully last year for Proposition 11 , an initiative to create more competitive legislative districts .
He is expected to campaign this year for voters to create an improved rainy day fund , is backing a commission to reexamine the state tax structure and is flirting with supporting an initiative to create open primaries and elect more moderate candidates .

But others say that he does not have enough time left for significant progress .
Fred Keeley , a former Democratic assemblyman and now a leader of California Forward , a government reform group , said Schwarzenegger wasted his early popularity taking on unions in 2005 instead of seeking meaningful solutions to flaws in state term limits , the budget process and the tax system .
“ Gov. Schwarzenegger will leave a very , very positive legacy with regard to the environment , ” Keeley said .
“ Almost all of the rest of his efforts will underscore how broken California ’s governance structure is , and how there ’s a crying need for dramatic change . ”

The 12 - million - computer strong Conficker botnet will fall under human control on April 1 , leading some to speculate feverishly about what horror awaits an unsuspecting internet on what may be our last April Fools '
Day ever .
Will Conficker become an evil twin to Google that lets criminals easily search for the valuable secrets of people running unpatched , pirated copies of Windows in China and Brazil ?
Or is it a censorship - busting peer - to - peer network erected by lawless but well - meaning cypherpunks ?
Most disturbing , will it learn at an exponential rate until it becomes self - aware and decides humanity 's fate in a microsecond ?
The imagination reels at the possibilities of a botnet that contains 20 percent more computers than the last doomsday worm , which , as you know , killed us all .
With the April 1 deadline approaching , I thought I 'd better get my own apocalyptic prediction on the record now :
Conficker , like all the other botnets , will mostly send spam .
But tell us what you think .
What would you do with a 12 - million - node botnet ?

When we 're all dead , when people are looking back at our time from a distance of 100 years , they 're going to say that we lived in the age of dark matter .
That 's the fancy name physicists have given to the nearly 95 percent of stuff in the universe that they simply do n't understand .
It 's also a good description of credit - default swaps and the other intricate financial instruments that caused the economic crash — " financial weapons of mass destruction , " as Warren Buffett called them , explaining away risk by means of algorithms that no one , not even Warren Buffett , could understand .
And how else to explain the niche following of a critically maligned show like Fringe , which is n't just about freaky paranormal stuff , flesh - eating poisons , babies born as old men , engineered parasites , and so on .
No :
All these fears are tied together into " the Pattern , " a mysterious dark power evident everywhere but present nowhere .
We 're not entering a Great Depression so much as a Great Incomprehension :
We just have no idea what 's happening and no clue how bad things are going to get .
Therefore we fear .
Our spiritual condition of the moment , in our intellectual confusion , our down - spiraling economy , our various wars against we do n't know who , is a fearful lack of understanding : Something is out there .
We know it must be logical , but that 's all we know .
Just look at our current slate of horror films .
Scary movies serve the same function in the 20th and 21st centuries that fairy tales served the children of an earlier age — to make our broadest and vaguest terrors into something concrete and therefore confrontable .
In the 1950s , radioactive mutation and the threat of nuclear annihilation became Godzilla , The Blob , the gigantic ants of " Them ! "
The McCarthy hearings gave rise to Invasion of the Body Snatchers , the mindless consumerism of the 1970s to the zombies outside the mall in Dawn of the Dead .
The 1990s saw Natasha Henstridge in Species become the cipher for brand - new anxieties about genetic manipulation .
Horror movies purge us of the fears we inhale every day off the front pages of the newspapers .
That 's their job .
So it should come as no surprise that this year 's frights stem from knowing without understanding .
And boxes .
Stay with me here :
In the new Nicolas Cage thriller , Knowing , the hero uncovers a time capsule , a container , in which he finds predictions of all the world 's catastrophes .
He knows but he does n't understand :
That 's his and our terror .
In The Box , out later this year from Donnie Darko director Richard Kelly , a married couple receives a plain wooden machine that provides them with $ 1 million every time they push a button , with the stipulation that every time they use it , someone they do n't know , somewhere in the world , will die .
These plain boxes , which in simpler times could 've simply been sources of mystery or intrigue , become instruments of terror , but it 's better our heroes confront fantasy boxes than the boxes that real people actually have to deal with , on the New York subway , on the beaches in Tel Aviv , hidden under a seat in a train station in Mumbai , which are much more terrifying : a nihilism that roars , a ferocious and empty hatred of the fullness of the world , unknowable but also unignorable .
Not unlike the terrorists themselves .
In June 2008 , the Newseum in Washington opened " G - Men and Journalists , " an exhibit of FBI artifacts that includes the Unabomber 's cabin .
Ted Kaczynski's hideout was a modest affair , a 10 - by - 12 - foot plywood cabin in Montana where he lived as a hunter - gatherer without running water or electricity .
He objected strenuously to the exhibit .
A legal brief that Kaczynski wrote himself and presented to the court claimed that the display violated the " victims ' objection to publicity connected with the Unabom case . "
Kaczynski did not , however , object to Robert Kusmirowski's sculpture " Unicabine , " which the New Museum in New York was showing at the same time , even though it was an exact replica of his cabin .
The difference between the artifact and the artwork ?
You could n't see inside Kusmirowski's sculpture ; the cabin was entirely enclosed .
He had made the Unabomber 's house a box .
Brilliant .
Because that 's what Kaczynski and the other terrorists are and would prefer to remain — dark matter , impenetrable and incomprehensible .
The funny thing is that we 're supposed to be living in the golden age of information , when anyone can find any name , any date , any historical detail , any formula , with a click of the mouse .
But unlike Socrates , who claimed to be the wisest man in Athens because he was the only one who knew what he did n't know , we choose to be freaked out by what we do n't know .
Doris Salcedo's " Shibboleth , " a 548 - foot gash created in the concrete floor of the Tate Modern in London last winter , was a huge hit with both audiences and critics because it reflected so precisely the feeling we 're all having : a chasm opening up below us .
Part of the attraction of the work was that the artist refused to say how it had been done .
It ran through the building like a river of unknowing , and viewers let themselves be swept away in its currents .
Maybe that 's the solution to all this .
Maybe we need to lose our fear of the unknown and show a little humility about the limitations of knowledge .
Because if nothing else , that might point us to the fragility and glory of the world we live in .
After each bombing , we worry about the vulnerability of our cities , but we 're also shown just how magnificent they are .
One of the most exclusive Manhattan nightclubs in recent years has been the Box — $ 1,000 table service , celebrities , bizarre cabaret shows featuring acts of sexual daring , an attempt at maximum hedonism .
The place chose its name well .
The fleetingness of beauty and the ephemerality of materialism glitter more brightly in contrast with approaching darkness .

Falling exports have hurt US economic growth
The US economy shrank at an annual rate of 6.2 % in the last three months of 2008 official figures show , a far sharper fall than previously reported .
Plunging exports and the biggest fall in consumer spending in 28 years dragged the annualised figure down from an earlier estimate of 3.8 % .
The decline was much worse than analysts had expected , sending US stocks spiralling lower .
In 2008 as a whole , the economy grew by 1.1 % , the slowest pace since 2001 .
The blue - chip Dow Jones industrial average dropped 119.15 points , or 1.66 % , to 7,062.93 .
The broader Standard & Poor 's 500 Index fell 2.36 % to 735.09 - a 12 - year low .
Recession warning Consumer spending , which accounts for about two - thirds of domestic economic activity , fell by a rate of 4.3 % in the final quarter - the biggest fall since the second quarter of 1980 .
This was a revision of the earlier figure of 3.5 % .
It shows the weak state of the world 's largest economy
Matt Esteve
Tempus Consulting
With rising unemployment , sliding home values , increasing numbers of repossessions and the slumping value of investments , observers say many US consumers are hanging on to whatever disposable cash they have .
Meanwhile , exports - which had until recently been supporting the economy - fell at the sharpest rate since 1970 at an annual rate of 23.6 % , down from 19.7 % .
Earlier this week , Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke warned Congress that without the right policies from the government , the US recession could last into 2010 .
But he said if the Obama administration and the central bank can restore some measure of financial stability , 2010 could be a year of recovery .
President Obama recently signed a $ 787bn ( £ 556 m ) recovery package of increased government spending and tax cuts , and unveiled a $ 75 bn scheme to stem repossessions .
No good news
The latest GDP figures were " just awful " said Matt Esteve , a currency trader at Tempus Consulting in Washington DC .
" It shows the weak state of the world 's largest economy . "
And Boris Schlossberg , director of currency research at GFT Forex said there was " doom all over " .
He predicted that the dollar would not weaken too much against the euro because " there 's no good news on the other side of the Atlantic , either " .

NEW YORK ( AP ) — General Motors Corp.’s “ jobs bank ” program will end Monday , following a similar move at Chrysler LLC that helps satisfy the conditions the government imposed when it lent the automakers $ 17.4 billion late last year .
The program gives union workers at the Detroit Three most of their pay and benefits while they are laid off — sometimes for years .
It was the target of much ire during the companies ’ requests for a federal bailout .
GM spokesman Tony Sapienza said Wednesday that the 1,600 GM workers in the jobs bank will be placed on layoff and will need to file for unemployment .
They will receive about 72 percent of their salaries , paid by state unemployment benefits and GM subsidies .
The workers also will get medical and other benefits from the company .
The length of time workers can receive unemployment benefits varies from state to state but usually amounts to about 48 weeks , Sapienza said .
After that , they will no longer get paid .
Christine Moroski , a spokeswoman for the United Auto Workers union , declined to comment .
Sapienza said the move will allow cash - strapped GM to use state unemployment benefits to help cover some of the costs of paying the workers .
“ We really appreciate the union ’s willingness to work with us as we continue to restructure for long - term viability , ” Sapienza said .
UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said in early December that the union would suspend the jobs bank , after members of Congress criticized the money - seeking automakers for paying workers who are not on the job .
Some Republicans sought more concessions from the union , and a bill to provide loans to GM and Chrysler died in the Senate before the Bush administration stepped in to grant aid .
Each automaker ’s jobs bank varies , but at GM , laid - off workers could get 85 percent of their base pay , plus benefits , without reporting to work while the company tried to find them jobs elsewhere .
Or workers could get full pay by reporting to a factory or union hall , where they could be called upon to perform community service or tasks around the plant .
Union officials said late last week that Chrysler was eliminating its jobs bank effective Jan. 26 .
Like at Detroit - based GM , Chrysler ’s affected workers will continue to receive supplemental pay to make up much of their wages after unemployment compensation .
Auburn Hills , Michigan - based Chrysler was also required to eliminate its jobs bank as a condition of its $ 4 billion in Treasury Department loans .
GM was granted $ 13.4 billion and already has received $ 9.4 billion of those funds .
The terms of the loans call for GM and Chrysler to eliminate “ the payment of any compensation or benefits to U.S. employees of the company or any subsidiary who have been fired , laid - off , furloughed , or idled , other than customary severance pay . ”
It has been unclear whether this provision also requires the companies to eliminate the supplemental pay they provide while workers collect unemployment benefits .
Both automakers must submit plans by Feb. 17 showing that they can become viable .
If the Treasury is n’t satisfied with the plans , the government could call in the loans at the end of March .
Ford Motor Co. did n’t take any government money , but company officials and Gettelfinger have said they expect the Dearborn , Mich. , automaker to get the same concessions as the other companies so it is not disadvantaged .
Ford spokeswoman Marcey Evans said Wednesday that talks continue between the automaker and the union about the future of the jobs bank , which included about 1,400 Ford workers as of November .

When Xcode is running , Interface Builder seems to magically know which classes , methods and variables are available .
Where does Interface Builder get this information ?
How can you recreate this effect when editing source files in an external editor without Xcode running ?
This is the story of how I investigated the communication between Xcode and Interface Builder , so that I could recreate it for myself .
Xcode and Interface Builder , sitting in a tree ...
Prior to Mac OS X 10.5 ( Snowless Leopard ) , if you made a change to your classes , IBActions or IBOutlets , you needed to manually instruct Interface Builder to re-read the relevant header files before these changes were visible in Interface Builder .
With Xcode 3 and Interface Builder this has changed .
If you add a new class to a project in Xcode , it is immediately available in class lists when you switch to Interface Builder .
Similarly , change an IBAction or IBOutlet in Xcode , save the header file and switch to Interface Builder : your changes are immediately visible .
And yet , if you quit Xcode and edit the same files in an external editor , Interface Builder does n't automatically detect the changes .
Clearly , Interface Builder is using something other than basic file monitoring to detect the changes .
NSDistributedNotificationCenter
The simplest way for applications in Mac OS X to communicate is through the distributed notification center , NSDistributedNotificationCenter in Foundation or CFNotificationCenterRef ( initialized with CFNotificationCenterGetDistributedCenter ) in CoreFoundation .
This allows applications to broadcast dictionaries of objects to any application interested in listening .
To see if Xcode is communicating to Interface Builder using a NSDistributedNotificationCenter , I needed to configure the process " distnoted " ( the daemon which manages the NSDistributedNotificationCenter ) to log notifications so I could see if anything relevant is broadcast .
Apple 's Technical Note TN2124 : Mac OS X Debugging Magic explains some of what 's needed .
On the command line :
sudo touch / var / log / do_dnserver_log
Apple 's documentation leaves out the next ( required ) steps :
sudo touch / var / log / dnserver .
log sudo chown daemon / var / log / dnserver .
log
and then restart .
Sadly for my investigation , this is n't how Xcode communicates to Interface Builder .
Looking at the log when Xcode and Interface Builder are started , reveals nothing relevant from either program .
NSPortNameServer
I observed the next clue to how Xcode and Interface Builder communicate by starting two copies of each .
In this setup , a new class created in the first instance of Xcode will be visible in both instances of Interface Builder but a new class created in the second instance of Xcode will not be detected by either copy of Interface Builder .
This type of behavior is typical of named port connections .
A quick Mac OS X lesson : almost all inter-process communication on the Mac is built on Mach Ports underneath .
Mach Ports are a way to pass messages ( blocks of data ) between processes .
The easiest way to for a process advertise a Mach Port so that other processes may connect to it , is to give it a name .
Network names are registered using NSNetService ( Bonjour ) but on a single host ( as is far more likely in this case ) network names are registered through NSPortNameServer .
NSPortNameServer is , in turn , handled by " launchd " ( the daemon that Apple created to replace init , cron , inetd and others ) .
So to see if the NSPortNameServer supposition was correct , I needed to get " launchd " to output log information about Port Names .
Again , I followed Technical Note TN2124 : Mac OS X Debugging Magic to learn how to do this :
sudo launchctl log level debug
And once again , the information contained in the Tech Note turned out to be insufficient .
Apple really need to update this Tech Note .
I wrote a program to send thousands of port name lookups on random names but no logging was output .
However , I could see that the " syslog " process ( the process that records logging information ) was very busy but it was n't recording any information anywhere .
This is a typical " syslog.conf " problem : you must direct " syslog " information for the relevant " facility " and " level " to a destination .
Unfortunately , the " facility " name that Apple gives for " launchd " in Tech Note TN2124 is wrong .
Instead , I appended a " *. debug " line to my " syslog.conf " file and sent the output to / var / log / debug.log instead .
This finally worked : " launchd " information ( and debug information from other processes ) found its way to the debug log file .
Finding the correct piece of information in this haystack looked like an impossible task until I started Interface Builder without Xcode running :
Mach service lookup failed : PBXProjectWatcherServerConnection - 3.1.2
It does n't follow Apple 's own naming policy for Port Names ( which would be something more like " com.apple.Xcode.projectwatcherserverconnection.3.1.2 " ) but at least it is clear about its function .
NSConnection
At this point , the data sent over the Mach Port could be anything .
How do you work out the format ?
I hoped that Apple used an NSConnection since the Cocoa libraries will handle this automatically for me .
Fortunately , running the following line of Cocoa Objective-C :
id rootObject = [ NSConnection rootProxyForConnectionWithRegisteredName : @ " PBXProjectWatcherServerConnection - 3.1.2 " host : nil ] ;
cleanly returned an object of type PBXProjectWatcherManager , revealing that yes , this is a regular NSConnection served over the Mach Port .
Recreating PBXProjectWatcherManager
The final step in replacing Xcode 's role in keeping Interface Builder up - to - date with changes was to recreate PBXProjectWatcherManager .
The easiest way to get this working , is to use class - dump to tell us what methods PBXProjectWatcher Manager implements .
Running class - dump directly on Xcode.app was no real help ( Xcode.app does n't directly contain most of Xcode 's functionality — it's in shared libraries ) .
Using Activity Monitor ( or lsof on the command - line ) to inspect the Open Files of Xcode reveals all the shared libraries that Xcode uses .
Most of these libraries live in / Developer / Library / PrivateFrameworks , so I ran the following script in that directory :
foreach f ( * . framework ) class - dump $ f > ~/
Desktop / ` basename $ f . framework ` . h end
to generate header file descriptions of each framework on the desktop .
" DevToolsInterface.h " turned out to contain the description of the PBXProjectWatcher Manager class .
Then it was a matter of working out which methods of PBXProjectWatcher Manager are invoked and what they needed to return .
So I created two projects : one to advertise its own PBXProjectWatcher Manager under the name " PBXProjectWatcherServerConnection - 3.1.2 " and listen as Interface Builder connected and one to connect to Xcode 's version of the same and work out the correct responses .
Final solution
The result is that Interface Builder invokes the following :
Method invoked Required response openProjectsContaining
File : An NSString containing a URI to any Projects that contain a file with the specified path .
pathOfProject : An NSString containing the file path for the specified Project URI .
nameOfProject : An NSString containing the project name for the specified Project URI .
targetsInProject : An NSArray of NSString containing the UUIDs for all targets in the specified Project URI .
nameOfTarget : inProject : An NSString containing the target name for the specified target UUID .
filesOfTypes:inTarget :ofProject : Types is normally nil so the response is an NSArray of NSString containing file paths to all files contained in the target .
Apparently , Interface Builder gets all the header file paths for all targets that use a given XIB file and monitors these files itself for changes .
Experimental testing indicates that all that is required to replace Xcode 's role in this case is to return these Project , Target and File values and Interface Builder will handle the rest ( parsing the header files for information it requires ) .
Interface Builder re-requests these values every time it is brought to the front , so it polls the " PBXProjectWatcherServerConnection - 3.1.2 " server , rather than implementing any automated form of observation ( despite observation methods on PBXProjectWatcherManager ) .
My guess is that this is more robust if either end of the NSConnection crashes .
Conclusion
I hope I 've been informative about interprocess communication on the Mac and techniques for monitoring and intercepting these communications .
These techniques presented in this post are only useful for intercepting standard Cocoa communication techniques .

Using motion - triggered cameras developed for surveillance , a team of researchers in Algeria has captured the first photographs of a nearly - legendary variety of cheetah , believed to be one of only 250 Saharan cheetahs left on Earth .

Sarah Durant , a zoologist based in London , worked with the Office du Parc National de l'Ahaggar ( OPNA ) to track the endangered creatures .
The group placed cameras throughout a 2800 - square kilometer area in the Sahara which snap photos when they detect motion .
It 's a technique called a " camera trap survey , " and it 's been used quite frequently in recent years to track human - shy creatures such as the Saharan cheetah .

Because these cheetahs have distinctive spot patterns , Durant and her group were able to say that they 'd gotten images of four separate Saharan cheetahs .
Like other cheetahs , these big cats are lanky , fast runners who tend to live alone .
Durant told New Scientist , " Virtually nothing is known about the population . "
The camera trap survey may reveal more in coming months .

Iowa Sen .
Charles Grassley suggested that AIG executives should accept responsibility for the collapse of the insurance giant by resigning or killing themselves .
The Republican lawmaker 's harsh comments came during an interview Monday with Cedar Rapids , Iowa , radio station WMT .
They echo remarks he has made in the past about corporate executives and public apologies , but went further in suggesting suicide .
" I suggest , you know , obviously , maybe they ought to be removed , " Grassley said .
" But I would suggest the first thing that would make me feel a little bit better toward them if they 'd follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say , I 'm sorry , and then either do one of two things : resign or go commit suicide .
" And in the case of the Japanese , they usually commit suicide before they make any apology . "
Japanese executives often take responsibility for scandals within their companies by issuing public apologies on camera and stepping down .
It is rare , however , that business executives have gone so far as to take their lives .
In feudal Japan , ritual suicide was considered an honorable death under the samurai warrior ethic .
In response to the comment , AIG spokesman Nick Ashooh said , " The remark is very disappointing , but AIG 's employees continue to work with poise and professionalism to take of policyholders and repay taxpayers . "

Moonlight , the open source implementation of Silverlight for Unix systems has officially reached its 1.0 level .
We are feature complete , we pass all the Microsoft regression test suites and we shipped support for Microsoft 's Media Pack for x86 and x86 - 64 architectures .
Moonlight is available as a Firefox plugin that can be installed with a single click from the moonlight download page .
What is in Moonlight 1.0
Moonlight 1.0 contains our plugin that can be used in Firefox 2 and 3 on Unix systems using the X11 windowing system .
Moonlight 1.0 ( and Silverlight 1.0 ) both come with a graphics pipeline , video and audio frameworks and a javascript bridge and neither one of them contains an actual execution environment .
The execution environment is the browser 's own Javascript engine .
When developers build 1.0 - based plugins they script all of the functionality using the browser 's own Javascript engine .
The browser Javascript engine communicates with Silverlight ( or Moonlight ) through the Javascript API exposed by the plugin .
With Silverlight 2.0 and Moonlight 2.0 in addition to this model where the browser 's Javascript drives the interaction a new model is available : the ECMA CLI execution system powers the actual execution of the code and will deliver performance anywhere between 20 to 300 times faster execution speed than even the most modern Javascript implementation if you use a strongly typed language like C# or Boo .
It is worth pointing out that Moonlight is provided both for 32 bit systems and 64 bit systems on the launch date .
We are also hoping to expand our reach to other Unix variants that use X11 like the various BSD systems and Solaris and make codecs available for those .
How we got here
The development of Moonlight has been a fascinating adventure .
It all started at the Mix conference in May 2007 when Scott Guthrie introduced Silverlight 1.1 .
It was a bold move for Microsoft to embed the ECMA CLI into their Silverlight 1.0 plugin .
In my blog post called " Mix 07 , Silverlight , Dynamic Languages Runtime and OpenSource " .
From that post you can see that I was already excited about the technology , and I could not wait to get this technology to Linux .
The talk on the DLR at Mix 07 was also fascinating and got me interested in bringing this to Linux .
A few weeks after the DLR had been announced and open sourced , our team had it working on Linux with Mono and by the end of May I had cooked up enough to render a spinning video on the screen .
IronPython 3D visualization on Moonlight
It was during the dynamic language workshop at Microsoft that I had a chance to have dinner with Jason Zander and Scott Guthrie in an Indian restaurant in downtown Redmond .
In this dinner they discussed some of the design tradeoffs in Silverlight and these would become part of our own implementation a few days later .
At Mix 2007 I had the chance to meet Marc Jalabert from Microsoft France .
Marc invited me to the Remix event in Paris but did not take the invitation seriously until he offered us to demo Moonlight on Jun 21st .
Other than a spinning video and the DLR we did not really have much code so on May 31st I sent an email to the team and asked them to work on an intense 21 - day hackaton to bring Silverlight 1.1 to life on Linux .
By Jun 21st we had a demo working and we showed Silverlight 1.1 applications ( with the CLR ) running on Linux .
A few weeks passed by , and Jeff Jaffe from Novell asked me to present our Moonlight to Bob Muglia as part of the regular Microsoft / Novell interoperability meetings .
After struggling with the video projector for what seemed like an eternity the Silverlight Chess and the Silverlight Airlines demo came up on the screen on Linux .
In the meantime , we were in love with our Moonlight engine , and we used to build desktop applications in addition to web applications .
After this meeting , I do not remember exactly how things happened as too much happened too quickly , but Microsoft and Novell agreed to collaborate on bringing Silverlight to Linux .
We announced the collaboration on September 5th .
It was early on , at that dinner with Jason and Scott that the issue of how to properly license codecs for MP3 , WMV and VC - 1 had been discussed .
We knew that we could implement the engine , but the question remained : how to get codecs to end - users in a fully licensed way .
This and other problems had been already discussed and agreed on the collaboration agreement .
Microsoft would develop , distribute and maintain their own Media Pack for Linux users and other Unix operating systems .
The entire media work involved hard work at every level , but it was worth the effort .
We now have one of the best open source media pipelines implemented .
And it will only get better with all the new features in Silverlight 2 for adaptive streaming .
The Immediate Future
We are now hard at work on Moonlight 2 , and those of you interested in trying it out can do so by following the build instructions on our web site .
Silverlight 2.0 was a major upgrade from its original announcement Silverlight 1.1 .
It is more complete , more polished and has been future - proofed .
Microsoft has continued to help us all along in creating an open source implementation of Silverlight .
They have open sourced the Microsoft DLR , the Microsoft MEF framework and the crown jewels : the Microsoft Silverlight Control Library and the Control Toolkit under the OSI - approved MS - PL licenses .
Without this it would have taken years for us to catch up .
Up until two weeks ago we could not see much in the screen as a lot of Moonlight had inter- dependencies between various subsystems .
But once Larry Ewing 's layout system landed in our tree , magically many things started to come together .
You can try out yourself Moonlight with some very hot demos including CNN's The Moment , the Photosynth - based 3D browsing engine for Obama 's Inauguration and of course the always amazing DLR demostrations .
Silverlight 3
Silverlight 2 is incredibly exciting , it is delicious and mindblowing .
There is a lot of excitement about it , my favorite three sites on Silverlight 2 include :
Microsoft will be announcing the details about Silverlight 3 at their Mix conference in March in Las Vegas .
My wish list
I love Silverlight and the use of the CLR for building web applications .
That is just how I am wired up .
I still personally wish that Silverlight 2.0 had a JSon interface to XAML , like the prototype that Chris Toshok did , or that Silverlight had a more fluent model for application deployment .
I would like the XAP model to be entirely optional or non-existent for IronRuby or IronPython .
Today marks the bicentennial of two notable birthdays , Abraham Lincoln ’s and Charles Darwin‘s .
Lincoln is a hero to many Americans , but an international campaign is now under way to declare Feb.
12 Darwin Day .
According to many of his modern followers , Darwin is the world ’s greatest scientist , and his theory is the cornerstone of modern biology - if not the whole of modern science .
What , exactly , is Darwin ’s theory ?
It is not just “ evolution . ”
Evolution can mean “ change over time , ” which no sane person denies .
Or it can mean life on Earth has a long history , documented by the fossil record .
Yet the general outlines of the fossil record were established before “ The Origin of Species ” appeared in 1859 .
And biblical chronology did not play a major role in the 19th - century Darwinian controversies , because by 1859 most educated Christians had accepted geological evidence for an old Earth .
Darwin ’s theory is that all living things are descendants of a common ancestor , modified by unguided processes such as random variation and natural selection .
Although nobody doubts that variation and selection can produce minor changes within existing species ( “ microevolution ” ) , Darwin claimed that microevolution leads to the origin of new species , organs and body plans ( “ macroevolution ” ) .
Eighty years after “ The Origin of Species , ” evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky acknowledged there was still no hard evidence connecting microevolution and macroevolution .
Unfortunately , since only microevolution can be observed within a human lifetime , Mr. Dobzhansky wrote , “ We are compelled at the present level of knowledge reluctantly to put a sign of equality between the mechanisms of macro - and microevolution , and proceeding on this assumption , to push our investigations as far ahead as this working hypothesis will permit . ”
This assumption is still an assumption .
No one has ever observed the origin of a new species by variation and selection - much less the origin of new organs and body plans .
Not even modern genetics has solved the problem .
No matter what we do to the DNA of a fruit fly embryo , there are only three possible outcomes : a normal fruit fly , a defective fruit fly or a dead fruit fly .
Although Darwin ’s modern followers claim there is “ overwhelming evidence ” for his theory , nothing could be further from the truth .
Nor is Darwin ’s theory the cornerstone of modern biology .
Most of the basic disciplines in biology were founded before Darwin ’s birth - including anatomy , physiology , botany , zoology , microbiology , systematics , embryology and paleontology .
During Darwin ’s lifetime , Gregor Mendel founded genetics and Louis Agassiz and Richard Owen pioneered comparative biology .
But none of these scientists accepted Darwinism .
Actually , Darwinism has always been more philosophy than science .
Darwin called “ The Origin of Species ” “ one long argument , ” and it took the following form :
The features of living things are “ inexplicable on the theory of creation ” but fully explicable as products of unguided natural forces .
Darwin lacked sufficient evidence for the latter , however , so he ruled out the former by simply declaring that only natural explanations are “ scientific . ”
For most people , science means testing hypotheses by comparing them with the evidence .
For Darwin and his followers , however , “ science ” became the search for natural explanations .
According to historian Neal C. Gillespie , “ it is sometimes said that Darwin converted the scientific world to evolution by showing them the process by which it had occurred , ” but “ it was more Darwin ’s insistence on totally natural explanations than on natural selection that won their adherence . ”
The Darwinian revolution was primarily philosophical , and Darwin ’s philosophy limited science to “ the discovery of laws which reflected the operation of purely natural or ‘ secondary ’ causes . ”
Furthermore , “ there could be no out - of - bounds signs . …
When sufficient natural or physical causes were not known they must nonetheless be assumed to exist to the exclusion of other causes . ”
The assumption that everything is explicable by natural causes follows from materialistic philosophy .
Darwin did not propose a hypothesis that was then confirmed by evidence - as truly great scientists have done .
Instead , like Marx and Freud , Darwin provided what evolutionary biologist Douglas Futuyma has called “ a crucial plank to the platform of mechanism and materialism ” that now dominates Western thought .
This explains why Darwin Day in the United States is a project of the Institute for Humanist Studies , which is dedicated to promoting “ a nonreligious philosophy . ”
It explains why some atheists want to establish Darwin Day as a secular alternative to Christmas .
Unfortunately , once in power Darwinism ( like Marxism ) tolerates no dissent .
As the 2008 movie “ Expelled ” documented , scientists and teachers who criticize Darwinism risk ostracism , character assassination and termination of their employment .
School boards that encourage students to learn the “ strengths and weaknesses ” of evolutionary theory are besieged by militant atheists who do not want students to question Darwinism .
That ’s why some people are now proposing that instead of “ Darwin Day , ” Feb. 12 should be designated “ Academic Freedom Day . ”
And let ’s not forget Lincoln ’s birthday .

Rolex Time Sand is packed in 30 kg bags .
I guess it makes sense that if an hourglass were to have any chance of accurately providing some measure of time , the sand would have to be of a uniform size , consistency and texture .
And if any company on Earth were qualified to produce a sand used for timekeeping , it would be Rolex .
A single bag of Time Sand flowing through a standard hourglass is the equivalent of 30 days , and the pallets and pallets of sand you see below represent a generous estimation of an average human lifespan .
( 81 years )
( PICS )
The pallets of Rolex Time Sand were part of an art installation created by Michael Marcovici who ’s also known for an installation where he stacked 10 million $ 100 US bills on 12 pallets to visually represent what $ 1,000,000,000 looks like .
On the 18 pallets pictured there are 972 bags with a total weight of 29.160 kg .
They last for 81 years – our generous estimation of an average lifetime .
This image pictures the artist ’s lifetime already consumed : 39 years

Man jailed after harrassing elderly neighbours by whistling Addams Family theme each time he saw them
A nuisance neighbour who taunted an elderly couple by whistling the theme from the Addams Family whenever he saw them has been jailed .
Leopold Wrobel harassed the pensioners for more than four years , making them feel like prisoners in their home .
His victims , Michael and Kathleen Sharpe , said Wrobel had ' nearly succeeded ' in destroying their lives .
Michael and Kathleen Sharpe were harrassed by their neighbour for four years
Wrobel , 51 , had been handed an anti-social behaviour order last December for harassing the couple .
But a court heard his nuisance behaviour , which had already lasted for four years , continued on the day the order was imposed .
The court was shown CCTV footage from cameras on the Sharpes ' property , which picked up Wrobel 's repeated whistling when they arrived at or left the house .
Michael Treharne , prosecuting , said each incident taken in isolation would probably seem silly or almost pathetic .
Leopold Wrobel :
He taunted the couple
But he added : ' If something happens on an ongoing basis and goes on and on and on , eventually it reaches the stage of being absolutely intolerable . '
Mr Sharpe , from Wingerworth in Derbyshire , told the court Wrobel 's behaviour had made his wife ill and she had started losing her hair .
' It 's been devastating and it 's done what he wanted to do , to try to destroy our lives , ' the 68 - year - old said .
' He very nearly succeeded . '
His wife told magistrates they could not leave the house without Wrobel being there .
The 66 - year - old added : ' He frightens me , I 've not been able to live a normal life .
I was a prisoner in my own home . '
Wrobel denied breaching the Asbo and two further counts of harassment , including watching the couple and their family and whistling the theme from the 1960s horror comedy .
But he was found guilty by magistrates and sentenced to 20 weeks in prison .
Julia Bosworth , defending , told Chesterfield Magistrates '
Court her client disputed he was the perpetrator of all the whistling , and said his whistles were directed at his dog , not the Sharpe family .
Wrobel told the court : ' I could n't care less what they do , it 's of no interest to me at all . '
But John Warren , chairman of the magistrates ' bench , said Wrobel 's version of events was not credible .
Passing sentence , he said : ' You pursued a course of conduct that caused great distress to the Sharpe family and have shown no recognition of the impact on that family . '
Speaking after Wrobel was sentenced , Mrs Sharpe said : ' I 'm so relieved , it 's been an absolute nightmare .
It 's affected our health and all the family . '

Human emissions are accepted by most to be changing the climate ( Image : Chad Ehlers / Stock Connection / Rex Features )
THREE hundred and eighty - five parts per million : that ’s how much carbon dioxide there is in the atmosphere now .
Just 100 parts per million more than before we started mucking things up , yet the Arctic ice cap is already melting , weather patterns are changing , and plants and animals are migrating towards the poles to find their comfort zones .
We ca n’t go on like this .
In fact , some climate scientists , notably James Hansen of NASA , say that 385 parts per million is too high and that we need not just to slow the increase in CO 2 but to clean up the mess we ’ve already made .
Three hundred and eighty - five invisible , colourless needles for every million stalks in the haystack .
What are the chances that we can find and remove them ?
Slim to none , according to many scientists and engineers .
They say that removing CO 2 from the air is a complete non-starter because it takes far too much energy .
That has n’t stopped a handful of researchers from trying .
They argue that air capture is not only theoretically feasible , it will soon be a practical weapon against global warming .
Above all , they argue , we ca n’t afford not to develop ways to scrub carbon from the atmosphere as a vital last line of defence .
If Hansen is right and we ’ve already gone past the point of no return , no amount of solar power or energy efficiency will save us .
We need to take CO 2 directly out of the atmosphere , and fast .
The tincture is part of the Prince 's ' Duchy Herbals ' range Prince Charles has been accused of exploiting the public in times of hardship by launching what a leading scientist calls a " dodgy " detox mix .
Edzard Ernst , the UK's first professor of complementary medicine , said the Duchy Originals detox tincture was based on " outright quackery " .
There was no scientific evidence to show that detox products work , he said .
Duchy Originals says the product is a " natural aid to digestion and supports the body 's elimination processes " .
But Professor Ernst of Peninsula Medical School said Prince Charles and his advisers appeared to be deliberately ignoring science , preferring " to rely on ' make - believe ' and superstition " .
He added : " Prince Charles thus financially exploits a gullible public in a time of financial hardship . "
Marketed as Duchy Herbals ' Detox Tincture , the artichoke and dandelion mix is described as " a food supplement to help eliminate toxins and aid digestion " .
It costs £ 10 for a 50 ml bottle .
Andrew Baker , the head of Duchy Originals , said the tincture " is not  and has never been described as  a medicine , remedy or cure for any disease .
" There is no " quackery " , no " make believe " and no " superstition " in any of the Duchy Originals herbal tinctures .
We find it unfortunate that Professor Ernst should chase sensationalist headlines in this way rather than concentrating on accuracy and objectivity . "
Detox doubts Professor Ernst said the suggestion that such products remove toxins from the body was " implausible , unproven and dangerous " .
Prince Charles and his advisors seem to deliberately ignore science and prefer to rely on  make believe ' and superstition
Professor Edzard Ernst " Nothing would , of course , be easier than to demonstrate that detox products work .
All one needed to do is to take a few blood samples from volunteers and test whether this or that toxin is eliminated from the body faster than normal , " he said .
" But where are the studies that demonstrate efficacy ?
They do not exist , and the reason is simple : these products have no real detoxification effects . "
Earlier this year the charitable trust Sense About Science produced a report seeking to debunk claims made about detox products .
Its researchers reviewed a series of products , from bottled water to face scrub , and found the detox assertions to be overwhelmingly meaningless .
" It seems outrageous for companies to be making money selling meaningless products but for the heir to the throne to be doing so , at £ 10 a pop , is even more inappropriate , " said Tom Wells , who helped carry out the original research .
" We 'd like to see an end to detox products on the British high street , starting with Prince Charles ' detox tincture . "
It is not the first time Professor Ernst has criticised Prince Charles .
His 2008 book Trick or treatment ?
Alternative Medicine on Trial is dedicated with irony to the prince , who has long been a supporter of complementary medicine - and particularly homeopathy .

Of course , the carmakers might bet that they can get President - Elect Barack Obama to loosen the terms of the loans , given his backing from organised labour .
Obama should make clear right up front that he 's willing to force the companies into bankruptcy , and that their best option for survival is to prepare for that moment .

The New Deal is widely perceived to have ended the Great Depression , and this has led many to support a " new " New Deal to address the current crisis .
But the facts do not support the perception that FDR 's policies shortened the Depression , or that similar policies will pull our nation out of its current economic downturn .
The goal of the New Deal was to get Americans back to work .
But the New Deal did n't restore employment .
In fact , there was even less work on average during the New Deal than before FDR took office .

In an interview with France 24 from Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania where African politicians are attempting to draft a common position on the global economic downturn in anticipation of the G20 meeting next month , Former UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan describes the international community 's frustration at the ramifications of the current financial crisis on the developing world .

As rescue teams continue to pull bodies from the wreckage that two weeks ago was the Gaza Strip , the death toll now sits at 765 , and is expected to rise even further in the days to come .
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak told reservists that despite multiple international efforts to bring the Israeli offensive to a halt , the operation in Gaza will continue .
Meanwhile , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said “ the decision about how we make sure that the quiet in the South remains is still before us , and the Israel Defense Forces has still not been asked to carry out everything that is necessary to achieve this , ” suggesting the attacks may not only continue , but actually expand in the coming days .
The rising death toll , as well as criticism from the United Nations and the Red Cross about Israel ’s overall conduct during the war , are adding to the growing calls for Israel to wrap up its attacks as soon as possible .
The Red Cross is accusing Israel of violating international law , while the United Nations announced earlier that they would suspend aid shipments to the Gaza Strip until the Israeli military promised to stop attacking their aid workers .
SALEM -- Cyclists would be able to ride -- slowly -- through stop signs with impunity under a bill up for discussion Wednesday at the Legislature .
And you 're scratching your head wondering when was the last time you saw one actually stop .
The proposal , which is certain to boil some serious blood among the car drivers , comes courtesy of Rep. Jules Bailey , a Democratic newbie from Southeast Portland who rides his bike to work when he 's not passing laws in Salem .
" My intent is not to allow cyclists to blow through stop signs , " Bailey said .
Just roll -- cautiously , safely and preferably on side streets .
Also supporting the measure are Sens. Jason Atkinson , R - Central Point , and Floyd Prozanski , D - Eugene , both serious cyclists .
The bill would allow bike riders to cross or turn at an intersection controlled by a stop sign without stopping as long as they slow to a " safe speed . "
The bill " recognizes that bikes operate fundamentally differently " from cars , Bailey said .
That is , they can see if cars and coming and stop quickly as needed .
Also , frequent stopping and starting slows the momentum that makes for a smooth commute on the city 's less - traveled back streets , he says .
Mary Wheat , spokeswoman for the Portland Police Bureau , sounded a tad incredulous when she first heard about the proposed law change from a reporter .
" That would most likely be unsafe for bicyclists , pedestrians and motor vehicles , " Wheat said .
" There 's a reason why those traffic control devices were put in place .
We need everyone to obey those laws . "
It 's the second time this year the Legislature has aroused the bike - vs. - car debate .
Earlier this month , Rep. Wayne Krieger , R - Gold Beach , offered up a bill to charge a $ 54 registration fee for bikes .
After some gnashing of gears -- and teeth -- by Portland 's robust cycling community , the air appears to have leaked out of that proposal .
The Legislature also is looking at increasing the amount of transportation dollars set aside for bicycle and pedestrian facilities , from 1 percent to 2 percent .

Out of Steam German Model Train Maker Märklin Goes Bankrupt
The credit crisis has reached Germany 's legendary model train manufacturer : Märklin filed for insolvency on Wednesday , citing a breakdown in talks for a loan .
But it hopes to chug along under the umbrella of German insolvency law .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush , winding up eight years in office , expressed regrets on Monday over policies blocked by Congress , weapons of mass destruction not found in Iraq and the harsh political tone in Washington .
But he defended his actions during one of the biggest debacles of his presidency -- Hurricane Katrina of 2005 -- and said history would be his judge after he leaves the White House on January 20 .
“ You know , presidents can try to avoid hard decisions and therefore avoid controversy .
That ’s just not my nature , ” Bush said in his final press conference before turning power to his Democratic successor Barack Obama .
Bush , by turn wistful , reflective and defiant , conceded that mistakes had been made .
The “ Mission Accomplished ” banner as the backdrop for a speech on an aircraft carrier in May 2003 , less than two months after the invasion of Iraq , was “ clearly ” a mistake , he said .
“ It sent the wrong message .
We were trying to say something differently , ” Bush said .
The Abu Ghraib scandal of U.S. soldiers mistreating prisoners in Iraq that shocked the world “ obviously was a huge disappointment during the presidency , ” Bush said .
In recent years an increasingly unpopular Iraq war weighed down Bush ’s public approval ratings , which took a further hit from the economic downturn .
The main U.S. justification for the war was that Iraq possessed stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and posed a threat , but no such weapons were found after the U.S. - led invasion in March 2003 .

“ Not having weapons of mass destruction was a significant disappointment , ” Bush said .
KATRINA HITS
He also addressed the heavy criticism for a slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina that struck New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in August 2005 .
“ I ’ve thought long and hard about Katrina , ” Bush said .
“ Could I have done something differently , like land Air Force One either in New Orleans or Baton Rouge ? ”
But that action would have pulled law enforcement away from helping in the crisis to handle his visit , he said .
Pushing for Social Security reform shortly after re-election in 2004 was a mistake because Congress was unwilling to take on a tough issue that it did not see as an imminent crisis , Bush said .
Instead he should have argued for immigration reform , he said .
“ I think historians will look back and they ’ll be able to have a better look at mistakes after some time has passed , ” Bush said .
“ There is no such thing as short - term history . ”
Bush said he had been disappointed by the tone in Washington and had tried to avoid engaging in “ needless name - calling . ”
Obama will also face harsh critics , “ and he ’ll be disappointed at times by the tone of the rhetoric .
And he ’s going to have to do what he thinks is right , ” Bush said .
“ And if you do n’t , then I do n’t see how you can live with yourself , ” he said .
“ I do n’t see how I can get back home in Texas and look in the mirror and be proud of what I see if I allowed the loud voices , the loud critics , to prevent me from doing what I thought was necessary to protect this country . ”
Former Vancouver city manager Judy Rogers was handed a $ 570,000 severance package when she left the city in December 2008 .
Incoming mayor Gregor Robertson replaced Rogers , who had worked at City Hall for 21 years , with Dr. Penny Ballem , a former deputy minister of health for the B.C. government from 2001 to 2006 .
Rogers had held the position of city manager since 1999 .
Her base salary at the time she left her position was $ 309,144 .
The severance package amount was made public following a Freedom of Information request by The Globe and Mail .
The documents released are from an in - camera meeting held on December 12th .
Rogers was the highest paid employee at city hall , with a base salary of $ 309,144 at the time she left her position .
" The amount was the right amount for someone with her professional background and achievements , " City councillor Geoff Meggs told ctvbc.ca .
He said Robertson wanted to replace Rogers with Ballem because of the latter 's financial background , and likened the staff change to what large corporations or other professional bodies do from time to time .
" We wanted someone who could look at finance , " said Meggs .
" There is no suggestion that Judy Rogers has done anything more than give her absolute best .
She is a top professional . "
He cited the refinancing of the 2010 Athletes Village construction project , which he said saved the city $ 90 million in interest payments , as an example of Ballem 's and the council 's successes since Rogers left .
A 50 - foot wave of molasses 2,300,000 gallons of it released in some manner yet unexplained , from a giant tank , swept over Commercial street and its waterfront from Charter street to the southerly end of North End park yesterday afternoon .
Ensnaring in its sticky flood more than 100 men , women , and children ; crushing buildings , teams , automobiles , and street carseverything in its path the black , reeking mass slapped against the side of the buildings footing Copp 's Hill and then swished back toward the harbor .
Eleven persons a woman , a girl , and nine menwere the known dead at midnight .
More than 50 injured were in hospitals and at their homes .
Some of them may die .
Dead horses , cats , and dogs have been carted away in team after team … .
A rumble , a hiss some say a boom and a swish and the wave of molasses swept out .
It smote the huge steel girders of the " L " structure and bent , twisted , and snapped them , as if by the smash of a giant 's fist .
Across the street , down the street , it rolled like a two - sided breaker at the seashore .
Thirty feet high , it smashed against tenements on the edge of Copp 's Hill .
Swirling back it sucked a modest frame dwelling from where it nestled beside the three - story brick tenements and threw it , a mass of wreckage , under the " L " structure .
Then , balked by the staunch brick walls of the houses at the foot of the hill , the death - dealing mass swept back towards the water .
Like eggshells it crushed the buildings of the North End yard of the city 's paving division …
To the north it swirled and wiped out practically all of Boston 's only electric freight terminal .
Big steel trolley freight cars were crushed as if eggshells , and their piled - up cargo of boxes and merchandise minced like so much sandwich meat .

UPDATE
Back in May 2009 , the Australian government put Wikileaks on its banned list .
As of 29 November , according to ZDnet , this is no longer the case .
" Currently , the ACMA list of prohibited URLs that is notified to accredited filter providers does not contain any URLs within the Wikileaks website , " said the ACMA .
" Since April 2010 , the ACMA has investigated two complaints about specific pages of content on the Wikileaks website , which both resolved to content found to be not prohibited . "
Wikileaks hit the front pages this month , with a new release of government documents that show the inside goings - on of diplomacy in the US .
In the dosuments our very own Prince Andrew is namechecked , as is the Governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King .
ORIGINAL STORY
The Australian communications regulator has issued a stark warning that websites who link out to ' banned ' hyperlinks are liable to fines of up to Aus $ 11,000 a day .
The news comes after web forum Whirlpool was threatened with the fine for posting a hyperlink to a blacklisted anti-abortion website
Wikileaks blacklisted
One of the newest additions to Australia 's ' blacklisted hyperlinks ' list is Wikileaks ; the website that publishes anonymous submissions of sensitive info on everything from corporations , religion and governments .
The blacklisting of certain pages of the site has come about after Wikileaks posted a list of websites at the tail end of 2008 that comprised the ' secret internet censorship ' list for Denmark .
On this list were over 3,500 sites that were censored or banned in the country .
Disturbing picture
While Australia 's list of blacklisted sites currently stands at 1,370 , the Sydney Morning Herald is reporting that that list could increase to around 10,000 sites – most of which are of illegal pornographic content , but could also includes sites that house incendiary political discussions .
" The Government is embarking on a deeply unpopular and troubling experiment to fine - tune its ability to censor the internet , " said communications spokesman Senator Scott Ludlam of Australian opposition party Greens .
" If you consider this kind of net censorship in the context of Australia 's anti-terror laws , it paints a disturbing picture indeed . "
On its website , Wikileaks , which leaked the news that the government had banned it for leaking information , simply said : " The first rule of censorship is that you cannot talk about censorship . "
Currently , it is not illegal for internet users in Australia to click on the sites found on the web blacklist .
The people targeted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) are webmasters linking out to the sites that the government have flagged up as inappropriate .
This could all change , however , if a mandatory internet filtering censorship scheme is implemented – something that is being debated at the moment .

Now that we 've figured out which one is Pink , allow me to welcome you to the machine ...
In the late 80s , I kind of knew a bunch of people who were involved in what we called The Computer Underground .
They were n't my friends , and I could n't even tell you what their handles were ( well , I could , but I won't ) but I learned a ton of stuff about technology and other mysterious subjects by dialing into BBSes and reading the textfiles they left behind .
By 1990 , I was spending less and less time online , while I continued to struggle with my existential acting crisis .
I read books about acting , and all of them left me cold .
I read books about filmmaking , and I just did n't care about them .
Then , in 1992 , I saw this book called The Hacker Crackdown on the front table at a book shop .
I was intrigued , and I started reading .
After standing at the table for a long time and getting deeper into the book than someone who is standing at a table near the front of a bookshop should reasonably get , I bought the damn thing .
I finished it within a day , and before a week had elapsed I had read The Cuckoo 's Egg and Cyberpunk , the only other books on the subject that I could get my hands on at the time .
On one level , The Hacker Crackdown is about how the US Department of Justice launched a nationwide operation to bring down a bunch of hackers in something called Operation Sundevil , but it's also about a subculture and its people who remain misunderstood to this day .
Most importantly , introduced me to a world where information and intellect were incredibly valuable , and it inspired me to learn all that I could about the online world I 'd eventually call my home .
On the way from there to here , I met a lot of the people who are in the book , and formed some friendships that lasted for years .
Cory Doctorow said that The Hacker Crackdown changed his life and it " inspired me politically , artistically and socially . "
He 's not the only one .
I can draw a very short and very straight line between reading this book and learning how to navigate the World Wide Web , which is what we called the Internet before you damn kids today were born .
In 1994 , Bruce Sterling released the book online , and in 2007 , Cory Doctorow recorded the entire book as a series of podcasts .
If you want to understand how we got here , I 'd say The Hacker Crackdown is required reading .

The award for the best car built in 2008 came down to a single vote , as industry journalists were torn between a stunningly refined GM midsize car and a fuel - efficient but exciting small car from Ford .
Both were worthy , but GM 's effort came away with the prize .
Is this an alternate universe ?
No .
It 's Europe .
As the Big Three Detroit automakers beg for a federal government bailout and face predictions of bankruptcy within weeks in the United States , their European branches are churning out award - winning cars we never see - or wo n't see for several years .
Edmunds Inside Line explains , " The new Opel Insignia has been named 2009 Car of the Year in Europe , edging the runner - up Ford Fiesta by a single point . "
The Insignia is the new midsize car built by Opel and Vauxhall , GM 's branches in mainland Europe and the British Isles .
The Fiesta is a sporty subcompact Ford 's European division released late this year .
Its quality is said to rival the fit-and - finish that made Honda and Toyota such mainstays in the United States , and in one form , it gets 61 mpg .
The New York Times notes that voters found the sharp - looking Insignia 's driving dynamics to be " second only to the Ford Mondeo ( another car we do n't get over here ) . "
In fact , American automakers make a number of the best European cars - but they never reach U.S. showrooms .
If the Big Three do go under , the eulogies may well say they simply made good cars too late .
The current Chevy Malibu sits atop our midsize car rankings , and GM does plan to bring the Insignia stateside , according to the Detroit Free Press , " as the Saturn Aura ... in two or three years . "
Kicking Tires adds that Ford " has plans to bring the Fiesta to the U.S. by 2010 . "
The U.S. debut of both cars , however , does " hinge upon important details : Ford and GM not going down in a catastrophic economic fireball , for starters . "
But since they are facing such troubles , automakers are trying to sell cars as fast as possible with deep discounts .

Did you know that for ten years now it has been possible to transplant a donated hand ( or a pair of them ) to a person who has lost one or both of their hands ?
Earlier the hub reported on the amazing fact that re-attaching severed limbs such as arms and legs has been commonplace for decades .
Today we reveal that not only is hand re-attachment possible , but in the last ten years hand transplantation has seen significant success in roughly 40 patients worldwide .
The source for most of this story comes from handtransplant.com , a website showcasing the success Jewish Hospital and its partners have achieved with hand transplants since they pioneered the world ’s first long term hand transplant in January 1999 .
As with all organ transplants ( hearts , livers , and even hands ) one of the greatest challenges a patient faces is organ rejection , a process where the immune system attacks the new organ as a foreign invader .
For decades now we have had the medical means to fight organ rejection , although the treatment is error prone , requires the patient to stick to a rigourous regiment of drugs , and is plagued with several negative side effects .
Even assuming the problem of organ rejection can be contained , the problem of properly attaching the tiny veins , arteries , and other parts of the body to the new organ is quite a challenge .
New advances in microsurgery have greatly enhanced our ability to overcome this challenge , paving the way for the hand transplants of today .
Here is a crude outline of the procedure :
The surgeon will progress with tissue repair in the following order : bone fixation , tendon repair , artery repair , nerve repair , then vein repair .
The surgery can last from 12 - 16 hours .
In comparison , a typical heart transplant takes six to eight hours and a liver transplant , eight to twelve hours .
Typical post - operative complications include blockage of the blood supply , infections and rejection .

When I traveled to Gaza last week , everywhere I went , a photo haunted me .
I saw it in a brochure called “ Gaza will not die ” that Hamas gives out to visitors at the border crossing .
A poster - sized version was posted outside a makeshift memorial at the Shifa Hospital in Gaza City .
And now that I am back home , the image comes to me when I look at children playing in the park , when I glance at the school across the street , when I go to sleep at night .
It is a photo of a young Palestinian girl who is literally buried alive in the rubble from a bomb blast , with just her head protruding from the ruins .
Her eyes are closed , her mouth partially open , as if she were in a deep sleep .
Dried blood covers her lips , her cheeks , her hair .
Someone with a glove is reaching down to touch her forehead , showing one final gesture of kindness in the midst of such inhumanity .
What was this little girl ’s name , I wonder .
How old was she ?
Was she sleeping when the bomb hit her home ?
Did she die a quick death or a slow , agonizing one ?
Where are her parents , her siblings ?
How are they faring ?
Of the 1,330 Palestinians killed by the Israeli military during the 22 - day invasion of Gaza , 437 were children .
Let me repeat that : 437 children — each as beautiful and precious as our own .
As a Jew , an American and a mother , I felt compelled to witness , firsthand , what my people and my taxdollars had done during this invasion .
Visiting Gaza filled me with unbearable sadness .
Unlike the primitive weapons of Hamas , the Israelis had so many sophisticated ways to murder , maim and destroy - unmanned drones , F - 16s dropping “ smart bombs ” that miss , Apache helicopters launching missiles , tanks firing from the ground , ships shelling Gaza from the sea .
So many horrific weapons stamped with Made in the USA .
While Hamas ’ attacks on Israeli villages are deplorable , Israel ’s disproportionate response is unconscionable , with 1,330 Palestinians dead vs. 13 Israelis .
If the invasion was designed to destroy Hamas , it failed miserably .
Not only is Hamas still in control , but it retains much popular support .
If the invasion was designed as a form of collective punishment , it succeeded , leaving behind a trail of grieving mothers , angry fathers and traumatized children .
To get a sense of the devastation , check out a slide show circulating on the internet called Gaza : Massacre of Children ( www.aztlan.net/gaza/gaza_massacre_of_children.php).
It should be required viewing for all who supported this invasion of Gaza .
Babies charred like shish - kebabs .
Limbs chopped off .
Features melted from white phosphorus .
Faces crying out in pain , gripped by fear , overcome by grief .
Anyone who can view the slides and still repeat the mantra that “ Israel has the right to self - defense ” or “ Hamas brought this upon its own people , ” or worse yet , “ the Israeli military did n’t go far enough , ” does a horrible disservice not only to the Palestinian people , but to humanity .
Compassion , the greatest virtue in all major religions , is the basic human emotion prompted by the suffering of others , and it triggers a desire to alleviate that suffering .
True compassion is not circumscribed by one ’s faith or the nationality of those suffering .
It crosses borders ; it speaks a universal language ; it shares a common spirituality .
Those who have suffered themselves , such as Holocaust victims , are supposed to have the deepest well of compassion .
The Israeli election was in full swing while was I visiting Gaza .
As I looked out on the ruins of schools , playgrounds , homes , mosques and clinics , I recalled the words of Benjamin Netanyahu , “ No matter how strong the blows that Hamas received from Israel , it ’s not enough . ”
As I talked to distraught mothers whose children were on life support in a bombed hospital , I thought of the “ moderate ” woman in the race , Tzipi Livni , who vowed that she would not negotiate with Hamas , insisted that “ terror must be fought with force and lots of force ” and warned that “ if by ending the operation we have yet to achieve deterrence , we will continue until they get the message . ”
“ The message , ” I can report , has been received .
It is a message that Israel is run by war criminals , that the lives of Palestinians mean nothing to them .
Even more chilling is the pro-war message sent by the Israeli people with their votes for Netanyahu , Livni and anti-Arab racist Avigdor Lieberman .
How tragic that nation born out of the unspeakable horrors of the Holocaust has become a nation that supports the slaughter of Palestinians .
Here in the U.S. , Congress ignored the suffering of the Palestinians and pledged its unwavering support for the Israeli state .
All but five members out of 535 voted for a resolution justifying the invasion , falsely holding Hamas solely responsible for breaking the ceasefire and praising Israel for facilitating humanitarian aid to Gaza at a time when food supplies were rotting at the closed borders .
One glimmer of hope we found among people in Gaza was the Obama administration .
Many were upset that Obama did not speak out during the invasion and that peace envoy George Mitchell , on his first trip to the Middle East , did not visit Gaza or even Syria .
But they felt that Mitchell was a good choice and Obama , if given the space by the American people , could play a positive role .
Who can provide that space for Obama ?
Who can respond to the call for justice from the Palestinian people ?
Who can counter AIPAC , the powerful lobby that supports Israeli aggression ?
An organized , mobilized , coordinated grassroots movement is the critical counterforce , and within that movement , those who have a particularly powerful voice are American Jews .
We have the beginnings of a such a counterforce within the American Jewish community .
Across the United States , Jews joined marches , sit-ins , die-ins , even chained themselves to Israeli consulates in protest .
Jewish groups like J Street and Brit Tzedek v’Shalom lobby for a diplomatic solution .
Tikkun organizes for a Jewish spiritual renewal grounded in social justice .
The Middle East Children ’s Alliance and Madre send humanitarian aid to Palestine .
Women in Black hold compelling weekly vigils .
American Jews for a Just Peace plants olive trees on the West Bank .
Jewish Voice for Peace promotes divestment from corporations that profit from occupation .
Jews Against the Occupation calls for an end to U.S. aid to Israel .
We need greater coordination among these groups and within the broader movement .
And we need more people and more sustained involvement , especially Jewish Americans .
In loving memory of our ancestors and for the future of our - and Palestinian - children , more American Jews should speak out and reach out .
As Sholom Schwartzbard , a member of Jews Against the Occupation , explained at a New York City protest , “ We know from our own history what being sealed behind barbed wire and checkpoints is like , and we know that ‘ Never Again ’ means not anyone , not anywhere — or it means nothing at all . ”
On March 7 , I will return to Gaza with a large international delegation , bringing aid but more importantly , pressuring the Israeli , U.S. and Egyptian governments to open the borders and lift the siege .
Many members of the delegation are Jews .
We will travel in the spirit of tikkun olam , repairing the world , but with a heavy sense of responsibility , shame and yes , compassion .
We will never be able to bring back to life the little girl buried in the rubble .
But we can - and will –hold her in our hearts as we bring a message from America and a growing number of American Jews : To Gaza , With Love .

Capturing content in Django templates
28 February 2009 —
As a template designer there are times when you have structural code surrounding a block which is waiting on content from a child template .
It may look something like :
< div class=" content_title " > { % block content_title %}{ % endblock %} </div >
Sometimes this block is never filled so ideally I want the DIV element in this case gone .
This is n’t easy because there ’s no way to know whether content is headed towards the block so one solution that I ’ve used is :
{ % block content_title_wrapper %} < div class= " content_title " > { % block content_title %}{ % endblock %} </div > { % endblock %}
This requires me to make an empty call to a wrapper block in a child template to clear out the div element .
It ’s obviously gross because I end up with empty block calls all over child templates .
Yuk !
Django community to the rescue !
After asking around and some help from Alex , Eric , and Travis we stumbled upon Django Capture , a django snippet created by kcarnold ( Kenneth Arnold ) .
Capture essentially takes a blob of content and makes it into a variable for you like so :
{ % capture as content_title %} { % block content_title % }{ % endblock %} { % endcapture %} { % if content_title %} < div class= " content_title " >{{ content_title }}</div > { % endif %}
This eliminates the need for all those crufty wrappers in child templates .
I ’m sure there are other uses for this too , one being the ability to print content multiple times on the page like pagination before and after lists .
Kenneth originally used the example of capturing content for translations .
I recall this anecdote whenever someone is rude .
The simplicity and clarity Imam ’s response is a practical example for us on how we should respond in similar situations .

Reader Javier Campos is in the market for a new Apple laptop but has concerns about e-mail on his current Mac .
He writes :
I ’m in the process of deciding which MacBook Pro I ’ll purchase to replace my current one .
How do I correctly archive ( back - up ) my e-mail and restore it to my new laptop ?
There are a couple of ways to go about this .
When setting up your new MacBook Pro you can simply connect your old Mac to your new MacBook Pro via a FireWire cable and let Migration Assistant do the dirty work .
When it migrates your user data from the old Mac to the new one , it will bring along your e-mail .
You can also do the job by archiving your messages within Mail and then transferring those archives to your new MacBook Pro .
You do it this way :
Control - ( Right ) click on the Inbox in Mail and choose Archive Mailbox from the contextual menu .
In the sheet that appears you ’ll be asked for a destination for saving the exported mailbox files ( called “ mbox ” files ) .
Choose a location and click the Choose button .
Mail will create as many mbox files as you have accounts listed under Inbox .
So , for example , if you have Gmail , AOL , MobileMe , and AT&T accounts and inboxes for each , Mail will export four mail archives , called INBOX.mbox .
INBOX - 1.mbox , INBOX - 2.mbox , and INBOX - 3.mbox .
Repeat this procedure for any other mailboxes you ’d like to archive —
Sent , smart mailboxes , and mailboxes that appear under the On My Mac heading , for example .
Transfer these files to you new MacBook Pro. On that MacBook Pro choose File -> Import Mailboxes in the Mail application .
In the Import window that appears , choose Mail for Mac OS X and click the Continue button .
In the resulting sheet , select the folder that contains your mailbox archives and click Choose .
A list of all the mailbox archives Mail is able to import then appears in the window .
Uncheck those you do n’t want to import and click Continue .
Mail will go about its business of importing the archives and will place them in an Import folder under the On My Mac heading in Mail ’s Mailboxes list .
At this point you ’ll want to click on each mailbox to see what it contains and then rename the mailboxes to accurately reflect the account they ’re linked to —AOL Archive , for example .
The summary of our latest project client - side development brought to conclusion that there ’re are really just a few essential Internet Explorer hacks .
By careful structure planning , I managed to stripe down all hackery to a much less additional rules .
Since they are promising IE7 some time soon , more and more I think about secure CSS hacking .
We surely do n’t want our sites to be a mess in IE7 for it ’s quite possibly half - repaired CSS support .
Conditional Comments
The alpha and the omega of IE hacking are IE ’s conditional comments .
They are IE - only feature and they ’re not supported by any other browser .
For other browsers they are just an ordinary comments and therefor , they are safe to use .
The typical usage is as follows :
<!--[ if IE ] > do something <![ endif ] -->
Untill now I used to write something like above , which applies to all versions of Internet Explorer , i.e. 5.01 , 5.5 and 6.0 , but since the latest announcements , I started applying the following condition :
<!--[ if lte IE 6 ] > do something <![ endif ] -->
which means : “ if this is Internet Explorer less than or equal to version 6 , do something ” .
My thoughts are –if they keep conditional comments feature in IE7 , then the browser will ignore this , since it ’s version designation number is 7 .
On the other hand , if they abandon that feature , the browser will assume that this is just another HTML comment .
When I work on a layout I usually place all hacks for some selector immediately after its ’ default rule .
This way , changes can be done quickly and without searching for the corresponding hack in other places .
After I ’m done with layout , I like to go through all of the CSS files once again and optimize everything from short - hand properties to assigning the same rule for multiple selectors .
At that point all hacks are removed to separate file (s ) , so the main CSS is clean and tidy .
This separate file is then called in the header section of a file within conditional comments .
<!--[ if lte IE 6 ] > < link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href= " ie_hacks.css " /> <![ endif ] -->
While still in main CSS file , hacked selectors start with * html .
This is known as the ‘ star - HTML ’ hack .
Standard compliant browsers ignore this selector , because there ’s actually no elements above html in a document tree .
Luckily , IE does n’t know that and we ’re safe to use this flaw when applying IE specific hacks .
Once we move hacks to a separate file and call it in a document with conditional comments , it ’s safe to remove the * html part .
Further on in the text , assume that we are dealing with separate file with IE hacks only .
Backslash hack for IE 5.x broken box model
A combination of width and padding on the same element is very well known to produce broken layouts in IE 5.x .
Box model hack is widely used and can be stripped down to a few lines .
someselector { padding : 10 px ; width : 200 px ; w\idth : 180 px ; height : 200 px ; heigh\t : 180 px ; }
This will give as an element which is 200 px wide , 200 px high and with 10 px paddings in both IE 5.x and IE 6 .
If floated and with margin , display : inline
Everything that is floated and has any margin larger than zero , should have additional rule display : inline ; .
Simple as that .
More about the ‘ Holly hacks ’ read at P.I.E..
Overflow problems
Italic font style in any IE version will enlarge parent element horizontally .
It ’s usually just a few pixels , but it could be nasty and ugly few pixels .
Simple solution is in the following rule :
someselector { overflow -x : hidden ; }
I tend to apply that rule to every major column in a layout , especially in the period right after site launch .
For the first week or two , when the large amounts of content are added and removed day and night by the site ’s editors , it ’s better to prevent content slips out of it ’s boxes .
A small digression–editors are sometimes inexperienced , but it ’s not their job to know every HTML element and that ’s why adequate support in their few first attempts is essential .
There ’s no worst for the guy who manage the content on his company ’s brand new , ultra - modern and expensive web site , than the massive layout breakage when the site is still fresh and under the eyes of CEO .
It ’s our responsibility to keep his confidence intact .
Font size in tables in IE 5.x
Font rules set in html or body element are ignored in tables in case of IE 5.x .
Again , simple addition will take care of it .
body { font - size : 62.5 % ; } table { font - size : 1em ; }
Later in a process , you can change rules according to a particular table ’s needs .
To conclude …
CSS hacks are necessary evil , but with defensive approach , we can make sure they safely co-exist with default CSS rules , even in future browsers .

* Cablevision plans to charge for Newsday website
* Writes down Newsday value by $ 402 mln
NEW YORK , Feb 26 ( Reuters ) - Cablevision Systems Corp CVC.N plans to charge online readers of its Newsday newspaper , a move that would make it one of the first large U.S. papers to reverse a trend toward free Web readership .
Newsday , which covers the New York suburb of Long Island , was bought by Cablevision in a $ 650 million deal last May that was widely criticized on Wall Street as a puzzling move into a troubled newspaper market .
Cablevision had to write down Newsday ’s value by $ 402 million on Thursday , pushing its fourth - quarter results to a loss , as U.S. print advertising sales and circulation have dropped with more readers seeking free news on the Web .
But Cablevision Chief Operating officer Tom Rutledge said the cable TV company was aware of the difficulties faced by the traditional newspaper business .
“ Our goal was and is to use our electronic network assets and subscriber relationships to transform the way news is distributed , ” he said on a conference call with analysts .
“ We plan to end the distribution of free Web content , ” he added .
Several large U.S. newspaper groups have had to lay off staff , slash dividends and scramble for debt refinancing .
Others have filed for bankruptcy protection , including Newsday 's former parent Tribune Co , Journal Register Co JRCOQ.PK and Philadelphia Newspapers LLC .
In the past , several major newspapers including The New York Times charged readers for full or partial access to stories on their websites .
But in recent years , news content has become widely available for free , forcing many papers to give up small subscription revenue in the hope of gaining better ad sales by attracting more readers .
Such moves , however , have not made up for the loss of print advertising and circulation revenue .
Some major business papers like the Financial Times and News Corp 's NWSA .O Wall Street Journal have been able to maintain subscription fees .
Cablevision has been seeking operational partnerships with Newsday .
Last August , it set up Newsday TV , an interactive television channel that allowed digital cable subscribers in Long Island to subscribe to the paper through their TV sets .
Aside from the financial pressures of owning a newspaper , Cablevision management has also clashed with the editors of Newsday , according to reports in the New York Times and other media sources last month .
The dispute arose over Newsday ’s coverage of allegations against a player on the New York Knicks basketball team , which Cablevision also owns .
A spokeswoman was not immediately available to give more details of plans for Newsday ’s website .

I first heard of Warren Buffett 10 years ago , in an article written by Dominic Lawson .
At the time , I did know the difference between a repayment mortgage and an interest - only mortgage , but that was about the extent of my interest in financial affairs .
Bankers and investors were people you gave a wide berth to at parties , on the grounds that they were certainly immoral and probably criminal .
( Or both , as it turns out . )
Anyway , there was an intriguing nugget in this article .
It said that in spite of being richer than God , Buffett has always lived in the house that he bought for $ 31,500 in 1958 .
A Master of the Universe who does not live in a lateral duplex penthouse shrine to his own fabulous ego ?
What the hell was going on here ?
The publication of the thousand - page official biography of Warren Buffett , The Snowball by Alice Schroeder , could n't have come at a better time .
It is surely the book of the moment , because a history of Warren Buffett is a history of high finance from the 1930s to the present day .
To know Warren – and I think of him as Warren now – is to love him .
He looks like George Burns , and he plays the ukulele ; plus , he is not a crook .
You just want to pick him up and take him home .
The hardback was published towards the end of last year .
It is an extremely heavy book , very difficult to prop up in bed .
You have to wedge it against a pillow to read one side , and then turn around and wedge it the other way to see the next page .
It took me more than two months to finish , and I had to read many parts of it over and over again to make sure I 'd understood everything correctly .
I 'd go to sleep thinking I 'd finally cracked the finer points of arbitrage only to find out that , no , the next night it was all gone again .
I took to underlining and writing notes and prompts .
I also attempted to engage anyone I spoke to on the subject .
And I mean anyone .

The whole secret of his success can be reduced to this : invest your money in good companies that you think are well run .
Reinvest the profits in other good companies .
Never borrow money .
Do all this , and your money will compound in value .
There .
Sounds simple , does n't it ?
Nonetheless , it took someone special to make it all sound so simple in the first place .
Warren 's infatuation with numbers began very early in life , when he started to calculate the odds on which of his marbles would go down the plughole first , in a game of his own devising .
His interests quickly spread to collecting – stamps , coins , bottle tops , licence - plate numbers – and , of course , reading .
He could memorise whole books of numbers , and when he was six he ran his own business selling chewing gum door to door .
It was n't long before he had diversified into Coca - Cola ( a brand he would , many years later , own a large chunk of ) and used golf balls , which he spent hours collecting .
He often used to involve friends in these small enterprises , realising that because he was somewhat socially awkward and emotionally withdrawn himself , it was essential to network within a group of trusted peers .
This would become the template of how he would always do business , and the foundation of the investment partnership that eventually become Berkshire Hathaway .
By the time he was 10 , Warren had pretty much figured out what he was going to do with his life .
He wanted money .
" It could make me independent .
Then I could do what I wanted with my life .
And the biggest thing I wanted was to work for myself .
The idea of doing what I wanted to do every day was important to me . "
The funny thing is that what he wanted to do every day was always exactly the same .
Unless travelling to board meetings on his private jet ( the famously named Indefensible ) , his days always follow the same pattern : he drives one and a half miles from the house he bought in 1958 to the modest office he 's always occupied in downtown Omaha , Nebraska , in the Midwest , and sits down at the desk that had belonged to his father Howard , at exactly 8.30 am .
He then spends his day trading and reading every single scrap of financial information he can acquire , including daily reports on the performance of each of the thousands of companies he owns ; reports detailing everything down to how many pounds of Peanut Butter Hearts were sold by See 's Candies the day before .
He goes home at 5.30 pm .
He is a creature of habit in most respects .
" I like eating the same thing over and over again .
I could eat a ham sandwich every day for 50 days in a row . "
He eats his food in sequence , one item at a time , and does not like the individual elements of a meal to touch .
His favourite foods are chocolate - chip ice cream , popcorn , hamburgers and Cherry Coke .
His work is his obsession , but his other big interest is bridge .
He plays on the internet every night if he is at home , or with his regular partner and friend of many years , Sharon Osberg , a world champion .
In 1993 , they entered the mixed pairs at the World Bridge Championship and unexpectedly qualified for the finals .
It was Warren 's debut in a serious tournament and , finding it all rather stressful , he withdrew .
Playing bridge is the only thing he knows how to do on his computer , which is funny , considering that his best friend and mini-me is Bill Gates .

It was love at first sight when Warren met Bill in 1991 , and it was n't a huge surprise when , in 2006 , he announced that he would give most of his fortune to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
After much consideration , he concluded that they were the only people who knew how to deal with such a fantastic amount of money – about $ 60 bn .
He was never going to bequeath it to his children ( he has three ) as he does n't believe that to be a morally sound act , but he has been increasingly generous to them in recent years , when he appears to have mellowed on the subject .
Interestingly , when his own father was dying in 1964 , he had himself removed from the will to increase the share left to his two sisters .
He felt that the amount – $ 180,000 – would be pretty easy for him to earn himself .
And so it turned out .
So , what can we learn from the Sage of Omaha ?
Should we all be reprogramming our minds to work the Warren way ?
Well , we can try .
After all , this Master of the Universe has a philosophy for every part of life , not just arbitrage .
There are lessons to be learnt about , say , dieting ...
On dieting
Warren diets by numbers – how else ?
He would sometimes limit himself to as little as 1,000 calories a day , but he 's managed the budget however he liked .
The central idea behind his strategy is to get the pain of dieting over with fast .
" I reckon I can eat about a million calories a year and maintain my weight .
I can spend those calories how I want . "
When his children were young , he'd write them cheques for $ 10,000 , payable on a certain date if he weighed more than an agreed amount .
They never got to cash those cheques .
He preferred to lose weight rather than money .
On financial derivatives
" Derivatives are like sex , " he said in 1998 .
" It 's not who we 're sleeping with , it 's who they 're sleeping with that 's the problem . "
In 2002 , he famously predicted that derivatives would destroy our financial institutions .
Warren 's predictions have been so accurate in recent years that he has been upgraded from the Sage to the Oracle of Omaha .
On success
Reassuringly , in these straitened times , even a multibillionaire like Warren knows that not everything comes down to money .
" Basically , when you get to my age , you 'll measure your success in life by how many of the people you want to love you actually do love you .
If you get to my age in life and nobody thinks well of you , I do n't care how big your bank balance is , your life is a disaster . "
On love
Likewise , there are some things that all that filthy lucre wo n't get you : " The trouble with love is that you can't buy it .
You can buy sex .
You can buy testimonial dinners .
You can buy pamphlets that say how wonderful you are .
But the only way to get love is to be lovable .
It 's very irritating if you have a lot of money .
You 'd like to think you could write a cheque . "
On ' the circle of competence '
Warren believes in operating within his own limitations in what he called the circle of competence .
He has , in effect , drawn a line around himself and stays within the subjects on which he is an absolute expert .
He has never bought technology stocks , for example , because he does n't understand the business .
This caused him to be written off in the 1990s dotcom boom , which he said would n't last ( and which , of course , did n't ) .
Only twice has he bought stock outside the US .
On positive thinking
Even the greatest achievers have to take the occasional step backwards .
Even Warren .
His message : do n't get your less glorious moments out of proportion .
" If you go from the first floor to the 100th floor of a building and then go back to the 98th , you 'll feel worse than if you 've just gone from the first to the second , you know .
But you 've got to fight that feeling , because you 're still on the 98th floor . "
On ideas
Light - bulb moments of genius are n't the only route to life - changing success .
In fact , you 're sometimes better off with a less impressive idea .
" You can get in more trouble with a good idea than a bad idea , " Warren 's mentor Ben Graham taught him , " because you forget the good idea has limits . "
The ' Inner Scorecard '
There are two kinds of people in life , according to Warren : those who care what people think of them , and those who care how good they really are .
Which are you ?
" The big question about how people behave is whether they 've got an Inner Scorecard or an Outer Scorecard .
It helps if you can be satisfied with an Inner Scorecard .
I always look at it this way .
I say , ' Lookit .
Would you rather be the world 's greatest lover , but have everyone think you 're the world 's worst lover ?
Or would you rather be the world 's worst lover but have everyone think you 're the world 's greatest lover ? '
Now , that 's an interesting question . "
On looking after yourself
Warren has never smoked or drunk alcohol .
He is , at 78 , extremely healthy .
One of his homilies to college students is about imagining that a genie appears to you at 16 and offers you a car of your choice .
There 's only one catch ; this is the last car you 're ever going to get .
" I would read the manual about five times .
I would always keep it garaged .
If there was the least little dent or scratch , I 'd get it fixed right away because I would n't want it rusting .
I would baby that car because it would have to last a lifetime .
That 's exactly the position you are in concerning your mind and body . "
On culture
The Sage of Omaha has excluded culture from his life because it would interfere with his focus on business .
For 30 years , he did n't notice a Picasso hanging in a bathroom at the house of his best friend Kay Graham , former publisher of The Washington Post , until it was pointed out to him .
Dealing with your deficiencies
Warren was very influenced by the book How To Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie , first published in the 1930s .
The book lists 30 rules of behaviour .
The first is : " Do n't criticise , condemn , or complain . "
This idea riveted Warren , who hated criticism .
In his early twenties , he signed up for a Dale Carnegie course in public speaking .
" You can't believe what I was like if I had to give a talk .
I was so terrified that I just could n't do it .
I would throw up .
In fact , I arranged my life so that I never had to get up in front of anybody . "
The course was a success and Warren has been teaching , lecturing and explaining everything he can to anyone who will listen ever since .
He seems to have viewed Berkshire Hathaway as a teaching tool right from its inception , and its annual shareholders ' reports are pored over like tablets from Moses .
On politics
Although his father was a Republican Congressman , Warren is a life - long Democrat who supported Barack Obama .
He rails against what he insists is an inequitable tax system whereby he pays a lower rate of tax than his secretary .
On career selection
Find something you are passionate about .
Only work with people you like .
If you go to work every morning with your stomach churning , you 're in the wrong business .
On golf
The love of golf is another thing he has in common with Bill Gates .
Warren attended the Gates 's wedding on New Year 's Day in 1994 , which was held on the 12th tee of the Four Seasons golf course in Hawaii .
On the ' bathtub memory '
Warren never dwelled on anything unpleasant .
He came to think of his memory as functioning like a bathtub .
The tub filled with ideas and experiences and matters that interested him .
When he had no more use for the information , whoosh – the plug popped up , and the memory drained away .
Painful memories were the first to be flushed , along with anything that might detract him from his goal : to become a millionaire .
On the rules of investment
Rule No 1 : do n't lose money .
Rule No 2 : do n't forget Rule No 1 .
Rule No 3 : do n't get into debt .
And finally ...
In case you have any doubt as to the wisdom of any of these points , it is worth one last reminder that Warren is indeed a man worth listening to .
( You may need to ask your financial adviser to explain the finer points of the following tale .
And if he or she does n't understand it either , you may need a new financial adviser . )
Long - Term Capital Management was the largest hedge - fund start - up in history when it launched in 1994 .
Warren was approached to invest in it , but declined – he did n't think it had the margin of safety within which he liked to operate , although the highest loss LTCM contemplated was 20 per cent of its assets .
The fund was astonishingly successful and amassed $ 7bn of capital in just three years .
The investors specialised in buying risky positions in such large amounts that they could n't fail .
Or they thought they could n't .
But then Russia defaulted on its rouble debt in 1998 , and the Dow dropped in a global margin call , with investors panicking and selling .
Soon , LTCM was forced into leveraging the leverage that was already leveraged .
Finally , the Federal Reserve was forced into taking the unprecedented step of bailing out a private investment firm .
So , yes , Warren was right .
The risk was there after all .
It 's a sorry story worth checking out , as it provides a model of our current situation .
The moral of the story ?
Warren would never have gotten us into this mess .

Pirates have been holding the MV Faina off the town of Harardhere A Ukrainian ship freed by Somali pirates for a reported ransom of $ 3.2 m ( £ 2.2 m ) on Thursday is preparing to leave Somali waters for Kenya .
Pirates seized the Kenya - bound MV Faina , which is loaded with 33 tanks and other weapons , in September 2008
The ship needs to refuel and take on fresh supplies for the trip to Mombasa , expected to take three or four days .
Its captain told AP news agency the 17 crew members had received medical aid from the US navy and were well .
A number of warships from foreign navies had been diverted to the area to monitor the situation , in part to ensure that the cargo of weaponry did not get into the hands of Somali insurgents .
' High spirits '
The head of the East African Seafarers ' Association told the BBC that the MV Faina is expected to take on fuel , fresh water and ship stores before sailing .
MV FAINA Pirates seized the MV Faina on 25 September 2008 Cargo consisted of 33 T - 72 tanks , rocket launchers and small arms Kenya says the cargo belongs to it ; some reports say it was destined for South Sudan
High stakes remain on high seas Pirates reveal Sudan 's arms race " MV Faina is expected to dock Mombasa port mid-next week , " Andrew Mwangura said .
" All crew members are said to be safe and in high spirits . "
The intended destination of the vessel 's cargo has been the subject of much dispute .
The Kenyan government says the tanks , rocket launchers and small arms on board belong to it ; however , the freight manifest suggests the arms were heading for South Sudan .
Ukrainian intelligence officials say they have " 100 % confirmation " that the arms on a ship are destined for Kenya .
" The Kenyan Defence Ministry 's authorities said they want to train their servicemen to handle these weapons at our bases , " the head of Ukraine 's External Intelligence Service , Mykola Malomuzh , was quoted as saying by Interfax - Ukraine news agency .
Analysts say the Kenyan government would be highly embarrassed to be found supplying arms to South Sudan , as this would be a violation of the peace deal it helped broker in 2005 .
The Government of Southern Sudan , which is said to be beefing up its military capacity ahead of the 2011 referendum , has also denied ownership of the arms .
Somali waters , considered to be among the most dangerous in the world , are now patrolled by a fleet of international naval warships which provide escorts to ships sailing along the coast .
Last year pirates in the area collected an estimated total of $ 150 m ( £ 105 m ) in ransom .
A recent BBC investigation has found that it costs as much again to negotiate and deliver these ransoms .

Congressman Ron Paul says that the people responsible for the economic crisis should not be hailed as saviors and given more power to fix the problem that they created , but arrested and criminally prosecuted .
Paul told the Alex Jones
Show that the only way the private Federal Reserve could be brought under control would come as a result of a mass uprising , noting that there is a lot more awareness in Washington about the Fed ’s contribution to the economic crisis .
The Congressman has two bills before Congress , one to abolish the Fed altogether and another to audit the organization .
“ Today they ’re protected , they ’re in total secrecy and they ’re protected by the law – if 1207 is passed we have an audit and they have to answer the questions and I figure , if we ever get that far and get the exposure and get the transparency that we need then people will wake up and realize , why do we have them at all , ” said Paul .
The Congressman ’s bill to audit the Fed is similar to another bill introduced by Bernie Sanders in the Senate which is aimed at getting the Fed to answer specific questions about where $ 2 trillion in bailout funds has gone , a subject that Bloomberg News sued the Fed simply to try and discover .
Staggering scenes unfolded last week at a Senate budget Committee meeting when Bernanke arrogantly refused to state where any of the bailout money had gone despite repeated questioning by Sanders .
[ efoods ]
Asked if the people who caused the economic collapse should be trusted as saviors or criminally charged , Paul responded , “ We should have minimal government , but even in a minimalist government your government is supposed to deal with theft and physical harm and fraud , and that ’s what ’s going on and that ’s what they ignore or protect ….it ’s horrible what they ’re doing …. and they should be prosecuting these people , these people should be in prison . ”
The Texas Congressman also discussed Obama ’s monetary policy , noting that every time a new government initiative was announced to supposedly rescue the economy , the stock markets sink .
“ In spite of how a lot of people think the markets do n’t know what ’s going on , the markets are pretty smart , so the fact that they ’re not responding , in spite of all this stuff the government is doing , every time the government comes up with a new program , the markets go down even more , ” said Paul , noting that free market advocates were right in warning that the problems will only begin to be resolved once liquidation is allowed to occur .
Asked how bad the economic picture would get , Paul responded , “ I think it ’s going to be very prolonged , I do n’t see any rebound , markets may come back up and that sort of thing but to rebound I would expect it to last every bit as long as happened in the 30’s , ” adding that the last depression did not really end until after a world war .
“ I think it ’s going to be a long long time but now we live in greater danger because people are far more demanding , they believe they have a right to their neighbors property and that ’s why there ’s liable to be violence …. ultimately they ’re going to destroy the dollar , ” said the Congressman , adding that the only quick solution to the crisis was to follow constitutional principles .

I ’m still trying to decide whether I ought to be embarrassed or just painfully amused .
My wife calls me at work and tells me to look up this article in today ’s New York Times talking about how the congregation at Greater Grace – Detroit ’s largest church – decided to take prayer to a Ringling Brothers Circus level on Sunday when they called on Dr. Jesus to save the auto industry .
Because when all else fails , we all know that a direct call to Dr. Jesus will bring down the Miracle Wagon every time .
Hallelujah .
Glory .
Etc .
OK , stop .
Just so you know ?
I do n’t have a thing against God , Jesus , or the Holy Ghost .
I consider myself a Christian , actually , although some might consider me one of those who just barely makes it in under the tent .
But I just want you to know this is n’t gonna be a diatribe against God or Christians or anything like that .
This is a diatribe against stark raving sensationalist Holy Roller BS .
Because when you decide that the best way to get God ’s attention and blessing is to drive three SUVs onto the stage of your church during service and then have folks pray over these vehicles and get splashed with anointed oil , all as part of your master plan to save the Big Three ?
That ’s when I think it ’s time to call out that kinda circus act for what it is , namely a heavy load of stark raving sensationalist Holy Roller BS .
You think I ’m lyin ’ ?
Check this out :
“ Pentecostal Bishop Charles H. Ellis III , who shared the sanctuary ’s wide altar with three gleaming sport utility vehicles , closed his sermon by leading the choir and congregants in a boisterous rendition of the gospel singer Myrna Summers ’s “ We ’re Gonna Make It ” as hundreds of worshipers who work in the automotive industry — union assemblers , executives , car salesmen — gathered six deep around the altar to have their foreheads anointed with consecrated oil . ”
— The New York Times , Dec. 7 , 2008 “ Detroit Churches Pray for God ’s Bailout ”
Look , I want the auto companies to get the loans just as much as the next Detroiter who is scared to death of what could happen to this city if our major employer bites the dust just when we ’re already at our lowest point ever .
This is critical , and I get that .
But how is it you figure
God needs you to drive a gas guzzling SUV onto a stage before he is able to see what the problem is .
Is the God we serve blind or just deaf ?
And whose idea was it to chose SUVs as the best vehicles to parade onto that stage anyway ?
Are n’t these the poster vehicles for just how dramatically the Big Three just do n’t get it ?
I mean , if you ’ve got to drive three cars on stage during your Sunday service to get God ’s attention ( and that of the New York Times who I ’m sure just happened to be in the audience at the time this happened , cameras at the ready ) , then why not pull up to the pulpit in something a bit smaller ?
Why in the hell would anyone with one functioning brain cell ask for God to give his blessing to our biggest mistakes so that we can keep on stumbling and tripping down Screwup Lane ?
Do the Big Three auto execs sit on the board at Greater Grace , because I swear this sounds like the kind of stunt they would pull judging by their Emmy Award - winning bonehead maneuver several weeks ago when they appeared before Congress , fresh off their Big Three corporate jets , hats in hand , pleading poverty .
Oh , and they had no recognizable plan .
I ’m sorry , do I sound pissed off ?

One way to look at our current predicament is through the lens of Irving Fisher ’s theory of debt deflation : as everyone tries to work off excessive debt , the combination of a contracting economy and falling prices puts everyone deeper in the hole .
But how do you get out ?
I ’ve drawn the above chart using debt data from Historical Statistics of the United States Millennial ; it shows the debt - deflation spiral of 1929 - 1933 , and the partial recovery of the New Deal years .
It also shows something I have n’t seen emphasized : the role of WWII in cleaning up private - sector balance sheets .
During the war years there was very little private borrowing , thanks at least in part to wartime restrictions ; meanwhile there was both strong economic growth and a lot of inflation .
The result by the war ’s end was a very low private debt level relative to GDP .
How big a role did these improved balance sheets play in the fact that the postwar economy did n’t fall back into depression ?
Dec. 26 , 2007 -- THC and another marijuana - derived compound slow the spread of cervical and lung cancers , test - tube studies suggest .
The new findings add to the fast - growing number of animal and cell - culture studies showing different anticancer effects for cannabinoids , chemical compounds derived from marijuana .
Cannabinoids , and sometimes marijuana itself , are currently used to lessen the nausea and pain experienced by many cancer patients .
The new findings -- yet to be proven in human studies -- suggest that cannabinoids may have a direct anticancer effect .
" Cannabinoids ' ... potential therapeutic benefit in the treatment of highly invasive cancers should be addressed in clinical trials , " conclude Robert Ramer , PhD , and Burkhard Hinz , PhD , of the University of Rostock , Germany .
Might cannabinoids keep dangerous tumors from spreading throughout the body ?
Ramer and Hinz set up an experiment in which invasive cervical and lung cancer cells had make their way through a tissue - like gel .
Even at very low concentrations , the marijuana compounds THC and methanandamide ( MA ) significantly slowed the invading cancer cells .
Doses of THC that reduce pain in cancer patients yield blood concentrations much higherthanthe concentrations needed to inhibit cancer invasion .
" Thus the effects of THC on cell invasion occurred at therapeutically relevant concentrations , " Ramer and Hinz note .
The researchers are quick to point out that much more study is needed to find out whether these test - tube results apply to tumor growth in animals and in humans .
Ramer and Hinz report the findings in the Jan. 2 , 2008 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute .
This post began as a comment on Matthew Gertner ’s blog post The Browser Platform Wars .
It ’s a rant not an article , do n’t take it personally .
In my experience ( 8 years building Mozilla based products and playing with WebKit since it was first released as WebCore in 2003 ) there are a few clear technical and social differences that can make WebKit a more attractive platform for developers than Mozilla .
There are plenty of reasons that Firefox is a better product than Safari ( I definitely prefer Firefox over Safari on my Mac ) , but that ’s a different story .
The scale and complexity of the Mozilla codebase is daunting .
Mozilla advocates will say that that ’s because Mozilla provides more functionality , but the reality is that even if you do n’t want all that functionality you still have to dig through and around it to get your work done .
Much of the Mozilla platform is poorly documented , poorly understood and incomplete ( the C++/ JS binding security stuff was the most recent example I ’ve looked at ) while WebKit is smaller , simpler and newer .
They use common c++ idioms instead of proprietary systems like XPCOM .
The scale of the Mozilla organization is also daunting .
Mozilla ’s web presence is vast and is filled with inaccurate , outdated content .
Their goals are vague and mostly irrelevant to developers .
By contrast WebKit ’s web site is simple and straight - forward .
Its audience is developers , it sets out goals that matter and make sense to developers , it explains clearly the process for participating and contributing in the project .
WebKit is designed for embedding .
Within Apple there are several customers for the WebKit library – Desktop Safari , iPhone Safari , Dashboard , AppKit and more .
Since WebKit already serves a variety of purposes it ’s likely to work for other applications which third party developers will want to build .
By comparison the Mozilla platform really only has one first - class customer – Firefox .
The WebKit community has welcomed non-employee contributors .
They ’ve even welcomed contributors who work for Apple ’s competitors .
There are WebKit reviewers from Google , Nokia and the open source community .
By comparison , Songbird and Flock do n’t have any Mozilla committers or reviewers who were n’t previously Mozilla Corporation employees even though they are two of the largest non-MoCo platform customers .
Perhaps I ’m short - sighted , but I do n’t see a clear path forward for Mozilla in competing with WebKit as a platform for web content display .
The long history of Mozilla have left them with a large , complicated codebase that ’s not getting smaller .
The rapid growth and defensive attitude of the organization ( probably brought on by the Netscape / IE wars ) has left it without a culture that welcomes friendly competition .
I think that Mozilla ’s focus on the product above the platform is the right decision for them .
I ’m just glad we have an alternative web content platform .

( CNN ) --
Though they support some federal action to help their states recover from the recession , several Republican governors said Sunday they plan to turn down a portion of what 's offered in the stimulus bill that President Obama signed last week .
Gov. Haley Barbour said the stimulus bill would force Mississippi to raise taxes .
" If we were to take the unemployment reform package that they have , it would cause us to raise taxes on employment when the money runs out -- and the money will run out in a couple of years , " Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour told CNN's " State of the Union " on Sunday .
The Republican governors of Idaho , Alaska , Texas , South Carolina and Louisiana expressed similar concerns .
But one of their colleagues , California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , had a message for them Sunday on ABC's " This Week . "
When asked about broader complaints from lawmakers such as South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford about the stimulus package leading to more debt , Schwarzenegger responded , " I am more than happy to take his money or [ that of ] any other governor in this country that does n't want to take this money .
I take it because I think California needs it . "
Schwarzenegger said he does not foresee a need for a tax hike in the future to sustain the unemployment provisions .
In a separate interview on CNN's " State of the Union , " Schwarzenegger said the complaints are " partially " right , but that using the money for now " cannot hurt . "
And another governor , Michigan Democrat Jennifer Granholm , told CNN , " We 'll take it . "
Watch how stimulus package could affect your paycheck »
" South Carolina , I 'll take your money .
Louisiana , we 'll take it , " Granholm said in an interview recorded last week and broadcast Sunday on " State of the Union . "
" We got plenty of work here , plenty of jobs that we would like to create here , " Granholm added as she discussed the struggling auto industry and job losses in her state .
A leading Democrat , meanwhile , said he does see a potential problem .
" I 'm not sure that we can , over the long run , cope with the high unemployment compensation standard that this mandates for states , " Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell , the head of the National Governor 's Association , told " Fox News Sunday . "
" But I do n't care .
My people are suffering , " he added .
" They need that extra money .
And right now that 's paramount in my mind . "
At issue is a portion of the unemployment assistance stipulated by the stimulus bill , which provides federal dollars to expand unemployment insurance in the states .
In exchange for accepting that , states would have to expand the number of people who are given jobless benefits .
In Louisiana , for example , that portion of the funds would total nearly $ 100 million , state officials said .
Gov. Bobby Jindal , a rising GOP star , has announced plans to turn it down .
" The $ 100 million we turned down was temporary federal dollars that would require us to change our unemployment laws , " he told NBC's " Meet the Press . "
" That would have actually raised taxes on Louisiana businesses .
We as a state would have been responsible for paying for those benefits after the federal money disappeared . "
The law demands a " permanent " change to state law , Jindal said .
Jindal and the other governors do plan to accept other funds offered by the stimulus , including money to increase benefits for those who are receiving them .
And even some governors who have expressed disappointment in the stimulus package are not shying away from any of the funding .
" I do n't like this bill , but it is now the law .
...
It 's now our responsibility and opportunity to try to implement it , " Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty told " Fox News Sunday . "
Calling his state " a major net subsidizer of the federal government , " he said , " We 're paying the bill either way -- we 're going to take our share of the money . "
In the end , some governors who would like to turn down a portion of the federal funding may not be able to .
The law stipulates that state legislatures can overrule governors .
Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick , a Democrat , said Americans are making it clear to all governors that they should accept whatever help they can get .
" Everywhere across the country , certainly in Massachusetts ... people want their roads repaired , they want their bridges repaired , they want a clean energy strategy ... and real alternatives , and they want us to be candid with them about those needs , " he told CNN 's " State of the Union . "

Extreme weather is hampering the search for a Brisbane man missing in the Japanese skiing town of Niseko .
A man who says he is a friend has named the missing man on a Japanese skiing website as Scott McKay from Brisbane , but Australia 's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ( DFAT ) has not confirmed the man 's identity .
The 27 - year - old was drinking with friends early on Friday morning .
He was last seen saying goodbye to them before he began walking home .
Police , friends and local residents are involved in the search .
Digging equipment has been brought in but heavy snow , strong winds and sub - zero temperatures have been hampering efforts .
The Japanese skiing websites also contain postings by people pleading for help to find Mr McKay .
One says it is out of character for him to go missing .
DFAT says the man 's family has flown to Japan and are receiving consular assistance .

Now it 's just a feature of the User Accounts setup that an administrator can enable or disable , with one sub-option to control drive access .
In the simplest terms , Guest Mode takes a snapshot of how a PC was working before the kid , friend , coffeeshop customer , or whoever else is using the Guest Mode account logs on .
That user can't do much to alter the system , and whatever they can do , like dropping files on the desktop , is discarded when they log off .
In specifics , Paul Thurrott 's SuperSite breaks down Guest Mode 's features , and we 'll thumbnail it further :
Prevents system setting changes .
Any attempts to change the system while running under a safeguarded account are prevented .
Prevents the installation of applications and other software .
Once you 've enabled Guest Mode , it is impossible to install or permanently configure already installed software applications .
Prevents the user from writing to the disk outside of their user profile .
Data saved inside of the user profile is deleted when the user logs off .
Want to set up a bomb - proof space for your nephews or friends who do n't quite respect an optimized system ?
Head to the Control Panel , then User Accounts and Family Safety , click User Accounts , choose Manage another account , then either create a new account , or select an existing one .
Now hit Set up Guest Mode , and you 'll get a basic on / off switch , with some explainers :
After turning on Guest Mode , you can head back to that " Set up Guest Mode " screen from the account manager and click the " Lock Drives ( Advanced ) " link just below the on / off options .
The drive Windows 7 sits on is locked by default , but you can go further to prevent users from writing to any of your USB or other connected drives :

While Guest Mode did n't let me choose a removable USB drive to lock down , the user in Guest Mode can't really get at any of your crucial files , so it 's probably safe to let them copy their own stuff on and off that thumb drive — assuming Guest Mode 's installer / system protections hold steady .
If you 're using the Windows 7 beta and want to enable Guest Mode now , however , take heed .
Microsoft has issued a warning for the beta saying that doing any of the following while in Guest Mode could kill that account :
Change any HomeGroup settings .
Use CardSpace to create a personal InfoCard .
Install Adobe Flash Player .
In addition , Windows ® Media Center will stop responding if you attempt to run it from an account in Guest Mode .

Let 's assume ( okay , and hope ) that those bugs will get worked out before the final release .
Otherwise , we 're digging the streamlining of a pretty great tool for letting someone else onto your system without having to worry about how they 're going to nuke your registry this time .
It ’s only a few more days before President George W. Bush will step out of the White House .

What do you think of what you 've heard so far about Timothy Geithner 's bailout plan ?
I 've read about 15 different supposed versions of the supposed plan by now and they 're each a little different .
Maybe it's not Geithner ’s fault because people at the press guess at what they do n't know , but I 'm a little worried how each time it sounds different — it reminds me of Paulson .
I do n't get what the plan is supposed to do .
It reminds me of the stimulus plan , it ’s a long list of things , any of which might be decent , but at the end you 're not quite sure what it adds up to .
The idea private capital would buy these assets , everyone is for that , but the question it begs is why do n't they buy them now ?
Maybe when you get to the details , it 's dealt with , but to me it seems like a lot of different ideas going in different directions pulled together from different sources .
It will work if things are fine , but if they 're not fine they 'll be revisiting the whole thing two months later .
So you do n't see a grand vision underlying the administration 's approach ?
I do n't see it .
Maybe when it ’s announced it will all be clear , but there have been so many changes and fits and starts already that it feels like more of that .
It 's a sort of finger in the dike approach with no clear vision , but maybe no one has a clear vision .
And a finger in the dike is better than nothing .
But it 's not a great place to be .
What would be your preferred approach to stabilizing the financial sector ?
It depends .
The key question is how insolvent are all these banks ?
Arguably Tim Geithner and Ben Bernanke know that and outsiders such as myself do not .
If the banks are not in that bad shape , some combination of what they 're doing will probably work OK — a lot of different things would .
In that case , what the economy would need is a kind of placebo , something to reassure people something will be done and then slowly and surely the banks will rebuild .
That 's the happy scenario .
The bad scenario is that either already or due to impending declines , large numbers of these banks are deeply and permanently insolvent .
If that 's the case , none of this stuff will work well .
So what would we see then — nationalization of the banking system ?
It 's already a matter of law that when a bank is truly and deeply unsound the feds have to take it over and do something with it .
It 's done through the FDIC .
This is what we did in the savings - and - loan crisis .
But the question is if you 're doing that to a large number of banks at once , what keeps your economy going ?
And I do n't really have an answer to that .
I think nationalization just puts the problem on the government 's balance sheet , but it does n't get you functioning banks .
Are some of the institutions too big to fail , though ?
Banks like Citigroup , for example .
Something like Citicorp or Bank of America — they 're too big to fail in the sense they 're too big to ignore the notion of them not paying their creditors .
The losses elsewhere would be massive , so that link in the chain has to be protected .
But under the worst - case scenario , if a large number are insolvent and it's a question of trillions of dollars , the notion the government can keep paying these debts stops being feasible .
That ’s the truly ugly scenario , which I would bet against but I do n't feel comfortable ignoring .
The fire department is there because your house might burn down , not because you think it will .
Right now we 're not really ready for anything like that .
The plan is to guarantee various aspects of banks and hope that with a guarantee we 'll never get there .
Maybe that ’s as good a gamble as we 've got right now .
Moving assets off the books does n't help you any because the assets are n’t worth much , so move them off your books — big deal .
So the plan will do some things to restore confidence .
It will look a little weak and unsystematic , which concerns me and some bad things could muddle through .
If things are bad I 'm not sure anyone has a plan .
In that sense it 's OK , but when it 's announced I think it will come across as somewhat underwhelming .
It sounds like a lot of its effect is psychological then .
I would put it this way :
The fact they 're talking about an itty - bitty plan suggests to me they think things are manageable so it makes me more optimistic .
I hope that ’s not just them trying to trick me .
So you can take their response actually as somewhat of a sign that things are n't as bad as the worst doomsayers are claiming .
Up until last year , no matter what happened in life , from bad break - ups to botched exams , I had the New England Patriots .
The world could be chaotic , but for three hours , I could toss on my Tom Brady jersey and lucky Patriots wool cap and immerse myself in the game .
The epic 2007 season was my sanctuary ; Brady , Moss , Welker , they were my gods .
Then came the miracle of Eli Manning : the mad dash in the backfield , the Tyree head - catch , and the Plaxico Burress reception that brought my personal Eden crashing down .
As the final seconds of Super Bowl XLII ticked away towards that single , brutal loss , my cell phone began to buzz , unrelenting for about 20 minutes .
Seventeen text messages and three voicemails , each one from someone I had ragged and ridiculed at the peak of my team ’s glory .
The messages were punishments for my arrogance ; all the chanting , bragging , smug remarks and blatant insults came flying right back in my face with each quiet hum in my pocket .
Locking myself in a room , I watched ESPN highlights late into the night .
Pure masochism .
But out of tragedy comes the hope of a new season .
Most of the 2007 Pats ’ crew was back and the humiliating defeat would only make them stronger , more willing to fight toward the goal they had almost reached .
I had been glued to pre-season coverage for weeks , enmeshed in fantasy football drafts and YouTube highlight reels .
I was ready .
Then , in the middle of the first quarter of Game 1 , it was over .
There are now four New England sports images that are forever burned in my mind : Aaron Boone ’s home run in the 2003 ALCS , Tom Brady ’s interception to end the 2006 AFC Championship , the Tyree head - catch , and Brady ’s leg bending the wrong way in Game 1 .
When Matt Cassel stepped onto the field , New England lost its confidence .
Its “ sure thing ” was gone .
Cassel is inconsistent and inexperienced , but more importantly , he does n’t have the connection with his receivers that Brady had .
Randy Moss has to slow down for Cassel ’s passes ;
Welker has to twist behind to attempt to snag underthrown balls .
The only reason Cassel has achieved marginal success is because of the athleticism of these receivers .
And although the team appears to be rallying behind their new quarterback , what they say to the press and how they play on the field are two very different things .
Moss is playing the half - hearted football like he did in 2005 as a receiver for Oakland .
He ’ll break out a long streak every once in a while , but unless Cassel can get him the ball ( which is rare ) this once unstoppable player is useless .
His competitive fire is gone .
He knows this is not another record - breaking year and he ’s playing like he ’s given up hope .
Moss and Brady made each other superstars .
They were the most destructive duo in the NFL and once that connection was broken , the result was mediocrity .
When Moss took the podium at the press conference following the Kansas City game , his usual rambunctious demeanor was gone .
He talked about constantly looking over toward the locker room , waiting for Brady to come back , but he never did .
That speech carried the equivalent emotional punch in the stomach as Billy Dee Williams ’ in Brian ’s Song .
The ensuing death rattle of the New England Patriots truly demonstrated what an integral link Brady served as a team leader and player .
He was a player who could control the game under any circumstances , and the team would rally around him .
One needs only to look at what he was able to accomplish in 2006 with the JV receiving squad of Troy Brown , Reche Caldwell , and Jabbar Gaffney ; he took them all the way to the AFC Championship .
The downfall of the Patriots , despite a stellar defense and record - breaking dream team of receivers , exemplifies that the three New England Super Bowl titles were largely Brady ’s work .
I know that Patriots fans will gather no sympathy from any football follower in the world .
We ’ve had our dynasty and we mercilessly slaughtered just about everyone in our path .
Our head coach Bill Belichick is a little scowl - faced ragamuffin in a torn - up sweatshirt .
His unyielding strategy of running up the score , his cold and emotionless attitude toward the press , not to mention the explosion of the Spygate scandal , which cast a shadow of doubt over each one of New England ’s victories , has established the Pats as the “ bad guys ” of the NFL .
And I ’ll be the first to admit the fact that the Patriots rank right up in the top five of having the NFL ’s most annoying fans ( along with the Jets , Giants , Eagles , and Steelers . )
But in the face of tragedy , we ’ve reached an era of humility .
We do n’t need or expect your sympathy ; we do n’t even want it .
We just want Tom Brady back .
So what ’s next ?
The Patriots have been on - and - off thus far , and while playoff potential is viable , it does n’t seem realistic to expect Matt Cassel to lead his team to the top this year .
As Patriots fans watch their team ruthlessly dominate one week only to be blown out the next , they can only sit back , let it play out , and wonder what could have been if Bernard Pollard did n’t take that extra little leap at Brady ’s knee .
Contemplating the alternate history of “ what could have been , ” I imagine the resurgence of the Patriots - Jets rivalry , made potent again by a showdown between Brady and Favre .
I dream of the Patriots settling the score with Indianapolis and watching Peyton Manning sulk his way to the locker room .
But back in the dark , scary place of reality , I ’m forced to watch all the potential re-broken records and all the shots at redemption shatter , with infections growing from each new attempt .
And until Brady walks back on the field and shows the world that he ’s the same player he always was , I ’m forced to accept that the glory days of the New England Patriots are over .
The UFC on Monday suspended middleweight Chris Leben for nine months following a positive test for use of the anabolic steroid Stanozolol .
Yahoo Sports writer Dave Meltzer was the first to report of the suspension , followed by a release posted at UFC.com .
The positive result , which came from an independent test administered by the promotion , followed Leben ’s unanimous decision defeat to Michael Bisping in the featured bout at UFC 89 on Oct. 18 in Birmingham , England .
As part of his punishment , Leben will forfeit one - third of his purse .
Since no regulatory body exists for mixed martial arts in the UK , the UFC performs its own independent testing at events held there .
When asked whether or not the Nevada State Athletic Commission planned to recognize Leben ’s nine - month suspension , NSAC Executive Director Keith Kizer said the commission would confront the issue if and when the need arose .
“ If we had proof of [ a positive test ] , whether it be from a regulatory body , a promotion or another third party , ” Kizer said , “ I ’m sure this would be something the commission would want to look into .
” Kizer said that Leben would likely have to submit a clean pre-fight test when he registered to fight in Nevada again .
The nine - month suspension mirrors those handed down by the NSAC to Stephan Bonnar Pawel Nastula and Vitor Belfort , all of whom failed drug tests in the state in 2006 .
UFC President Dana
White chastised Leben in a released statement on Monday but credited the 28 - year - old for facing the music .
“ I am obviously disappointed with Chris , who has made great strides getting his life back on track , ” White told UFC.com .
“ To his credit , he has taken responsibility for his actions and is accepting the punishment that has been handed down .
As always , the UFC puts the safety of its athletes first and foremost , and we wo n’t tolerate anyone using performance - enhancing drugs in our organization .
” Leben is just the second UFC fighter to flunk an independent test since the promotion returned to the UK in 2007 .
Anthony Torres , a cast member on season two of “ The Ultimate Fighter ” reality series , was flagged for suspected use of the anabolic agent Boldenone after his technical knockout loss to Jess Liaudin at UFC 75 .
Torres was released from his contract soon after .
Much was made of Leben ’s physical transformation in the weeks leading up to his bout with Bisping .
A former member of Team Quest who has relocated to Hawaii , Leben showed up for the fight with a noticeably improved physique .
“ I ’ve really done everything I can to turn my life around , and this is a huge setback for me , but it is something I will have to deal with , ” Leben told UFC.com .
“ During my time off from fighting , I want to speak to kids about the dangers of using performance - enhancing agents and let them know it just does n’t get you ahead in life . ”
Scientists are working harder than ever to see if they too can create fuel from the sun .
The trees do it so why ca n’t we ?
The world needs to be a little greener so if we could get natural sources of fuel from the sun then it could reduce our carbon foot print .
Scientist from the Pennsylvania state university has found some great possibilities in which this could be done .
They have discovered a way to generate hydro carbons 20 times faster than before .
They used titanium oxide the same ingredient we use in extremely tough paper .
However the titanium dioxide comes in the form of nano tubes .
They will measure a tiny 135 nanometers width and only a tenth of a millimeter long .
Once formed they went on to add nitrogen , copper and platinum nano particles onto the surface .
Usually ultra violet light would be used to activate the catalyst but because of the nitrogen and copper that was added to the nana tubes they may have moved the spectrum to longer wavelengths of visible light .
The copper and the platinum that were included would have moved the spectrum to a different wave length and this would have sped up the last few stages of the process .
Unfortunately the researchers are n’t fully aware of why this process works .
Their explanation is they think when the sunlight is in contact with the nano tubes it can then split water into two compounds which are hydroxide radicals and hydrogen ions .
The ions would then join to give hydrogen gas .
They are also unsure whether the carbon dioxide actually splits to go on to form oxygen and carbon monoxide if so this would then react with the hydrogen gas to form methane and water .
The scientists guess that his type of technology could make up around 500 liters of methane within an 8 hour period .
Who knows if they are given the facilities to continue with their studies they could possibly make a difference .
If only we could work out how to re create photosynthesis like the trees and plant then we could be on to something big .
Indians from the reservation danced in celebration
A ruling by Brazil 's supreme court has boosted the efforts of the country 's disadvantaged indigenous groups to keep control of their lands .
By 10 votes to one , judges ruled to maintain an Indian reservation in the northern border state of Roraima as a single , continuous territory .
It means that a small group of outside rice farmers with plantations in the area will now have to leave .
The head of the court also accused the government of failing the Indians .
This was the third occasion the court had met to reach a decision on the question , and the delays appeared to be just another indication of the sensitivity involved , the BBC's Gary Duffy reports from Brazil .
The Raposa Serra do Sol reservation , which stretches more than 1.7 m hectares ( 4.2 m acres ) along the Venezuelan border , is home to up to 20,000 Amazonian Indians .
Indigenous leaders had feared a ruling against them would have signalled to land - owners and loggers that it was acceptable to invade their territory .
' Complete neglect ' Thursday 's decision confirmed a decree issued by Brazil 's President , Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , who established Raposa Serra do Sol in 2005 exclusively as an area for use by the local Indian population .
Gilmar Mendes , president of the court , said the ruling should set a precedent for Indian land rights .
" We 've established a statute that has to be applied not only in the Raposa Serra do Sol case , but also in other cases of demarcation , " he said .
Mr Mendes also criticised what he called the neglect of the indigenous community by the government .
He said that beyond setting out the territory where they lived , the Indian population had been left to their own luck .
" It is a complete neglect of public responsibility , " he added .
Our correspondent notes that the case has raised fears in military circles that it would create an effectively autonomous Indian reservation running along a lengthy section of Brazil 's border .
To meet those concerns , the court imposed a series of conditions that guarantee access by the police and military to the territory .
' Conflict possible '
The land dispute has turned violent on occasion with several Indians shot and injured in May of last year .
" There is no peaceful solution , " Nelson Itikawa , president of the Roraima Rice Growers Association , told the Brazilian government news service .
" It 's possible there will be a conflict - there are people who will lose control . "
To add to a complicated dispute , our correspondent reports , one indigenous group in the reservation supports the farmers .
Police in the Roraima city of Boa Vista said the situation was calm .
" There have been no demonstrations for or against the reservation , and nothing has happened to justify beefing up security near the reservation , " said police spokesman Jose Negreiros .

THAT birds are the descendants of dinosaurs is now accepted by almost all evolutionary biologists .
The clinching discovery was of animals that were clearly dinosaurs , and clearly could not fly , but which had feathers .
That did raise the question , though , of why one twig of the great dinosaur tree had developed such strange outer vestments , even before it developed wings .
If a discovery announced in this week 's Nature has been interpreted correctly , that question is about to get even stranger .
For Zheng Xiaoting of the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature in Pingyi , China , and her colleagues , are suggesting that it was not just the part of the clan that led to birds that was feathered .
What they have found makes it likely that many dinosaurs had something rather like feathers , and that those which did not had lost a primitive characteristic of the group in the way that elephants and hippos have lost most of the hair that is characteristic of mammals .
The crucial discovery comes from a famous fossil bed in Liaoning province .
Dr Zheng and her colleagues propose to call it Tianyulong confuciusi .
The new species belongs to a group of dinosaurs called the Ornithischia .
This group , which includes such famous names as Stegosaurus and Triceratops , is one of the two clades into which the dinosaurs are divided .
The other is the Saurischia , whose famous members include Diplodocus and Tyrannosaurus .
The Saurischia also include all the immediate ancestors of birds .
Which is why Dr Zheng was stunned to find on Tianyulong confuciusi what are conservatively described in her paper as “ long , singular and unbranched filamentous integumentary structures ” .
In other words , things than look suspiciously like the central shafts of feathers .
Li Da Xing
Beautiful plumage
Such “ protofeathers ” have been found on other dinosaurs , but until now those species have , like those that sport true feathers , all belonged to a part of the Saurischia that includes the birds .
Yet the split between Ornithischia and Saurischia goes back to the very beginning of the dinosaurs , 80 m years before the first birds and about 100 m years before T. confuciusi .
So if the feather - like structures of T. confuciusi really have the same origin as feathers , then such structures must have been there from the outset , and be characteristic of dinosaurs as a whole .
Jurassic lark
That does not explain what they were for .
A few researchers argue that they were actually internal to the skin , and thus not related to feathers at all .
If they really were external , the most likely answer is that they served the same function — insulation — as hair does on a mammal .
But they may , like hair and modern feathers , have had a secondary , signalling function .
This discovery raises another question , too .
Taxonomically , the very definition of a bird was until recently an animal that has feathers .
Now , taxonomists argue that since birds are descended from dinosaurs they should be classified merely as a subgroup of the Dinosauria .
But if feathers truly are the diagnostic criterion , then perhaps things should be the other way round , and Stegosaurus , Triceratops , Diplodocus , Tyrannosaurus and their kin should no longer be thought of as terrible lizards , but as overweight , flightless birds .
- video encodings still in process -
Gavin McInnes teaches you the art of self defense .. on a baby lol .
On Thursday , February 26th , the Election Contest Tribunal commisioned a search for valid registration forms within 1526 currently rejected absentee ballots .
The conclusion of this search was supposed to have occurred last Wednesday , March 4th , but for whatever reason the release of this information was delayed until today .
The Minneapolis Star Tribune apparently obtained the search results late Monday afternoon as evidenced in one of their online articles :
Here is a county breakdown of 89 rejected - absentee ballot envelopes that were found to have properly completed registration cards .
The letter in parentheses after the county name indicates which candidate carried that county ( C - Coleman ; F- Franken ) ; it does not indicate for whom these ballots were cast .
Anoka ( C ) , 1 ; Clay ( C ) , 4 ; Crow Wing ( C ) , 1 ; Dakota ( C ) , 15 ; Faribault ( C ) , 1 ; Goodhue ( C ) , 1 ; Hennepin ( F ) , 15 ( Brooklyn Center , 1 ; Corcoran , 1 ; Edina , 1 ; Maple Grove , 2 ; Minneapolis , 8 ; Plymouth , 2 ) ; Koochiching ( F ) , 1 ; McLeod ( C ) , 3 ; Morrison ( C ) , 1 ; Mower ( F ) , 3 ; Olmsted ( C ) , 15 ; Polk ( C ) , 1 ; Pope ( C ) , 1 ; Ramsey ( F ) , 6 ; Steele ( C ) , 1 ; Swift ( F ) , 1 ; Washington ( C ) , 14 ; Winona ( F ) , 2 ; Wright ( C ) , 1 . Source : Minneapolis Star Tribune
The above quote is simply an excerpt contained within the current article , but the original posting featured only the above text , but with the " 89 " replaced with " 88 . "
The county list remained unchanged through this revision ; in fact the current list still adds up to 88 .
TheUpTake.org was the first to report the " 89 " through an exchange between a Coleman attorney and a reporter during the afternoon press conference ; the " 89 " reference occurs at about the 3:50 mark .
While the TheUpTake.org provided the total count , they did not publish a county level listing .
I have absolutely no idea why the Star Tribune amended their original figure , but I can , and will speculate .
One of following scenarios must have occurred within Star Tribune 's internal mechanisms
1 . They obtained the original listing provided by the Secretary of State 's office but failed to adequately report the information contained therein .
They literally would have to provide a link to a PDF , which is n't that difficult .
2 . Or they may have received the information from a secondary source , perhaps one of the campaigns .
If we assume scenario ( 1 ) occurred , the the Star Tribune absolutely dropped the ball ; but lets assume that the Star Tribune is capable of doing their job , which may not be a reasonable assumption , but stick with me .
Onto scenario ( 2 ) ; if they did receive the list from some other source , why would they make the change to reflect " 89 " instead of their originally reported " 88 . "
It does n't make any sense for them to change the count without changing the list .
The only thing that changed was a Coleman attorney stating " 89 " in a press conference , after quoting a reporter 's question .
Ben Ginsberg , the Coleman attorney , would have had absolutely no way of knowing the exact number and likely just trusted the reporter in the moment .
This then begs the question , why did the Star Tribune assign more weight to a Coleman Press Conference than they did their original source , whatever it was ?
I am personally assigning more weight to the presence of a table than I am to the proceedings of this particular press conference .
Its also entirely possible that the Star Tribune simply could n't reproduce a 25 line table from a PDF , and in catching their error , they simply adjusted the total to " 89 , " and ignored the error contained within the table .
In any case , the Star Tribune 's data is the only data currently available , and as such I 'm going to assume that their original report of " 88 " is correct because that is what their table reads .
If something changes tomorrow , I 'll update this article .
I parsed the Star Tribune 's table and created another table [ PDF ] complete with the final recounted votes from each county / municipality listed .
I 've also created a new map that depicts the origin of each successful registration search ; the colorization and shading process is the same as yesterday with divisions of 5 , and 10 votes :
I 've also extrapolated the likely outcome from each of these " 88 " votes below , assuming all " 88 " are eventually counted :
Identified Extrapolation Voters Coleman Franken Total 88 37.01 36.37 Coleman Counties 66 30.57 24.11 Franken Counties 22 6.45 12.25
Extrapolations : PDF , 138 KB
Neither candidate is likely to gain any ground from these " 88 " ballots ; in fact , if each of these ballots are included , Coleman is only expected to gain .65 votes .
Moral of the story , Coleman will need more than these " 88 " votes to overcome the current 225 vote deficit ; at least based upon the county / municipality trend .
The Star Tribune article also went on to talk about the Nauen 30 , a group of thirty petitioner seeking to intervene into the Election Contest through the Minnesota Supreme Court .
This group originally introduced their petition to the Minnesota Supreme Court on February 23rd .
The MNSC then issued a ruling Monday afternoon pertaining to these thirty voters ; the entire order is quoted below :
Based on petitioners ' notice of withdrawal of their petition and upon all the files , records and proceedings herein , IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition of Harold Shad , et al. , under Minn .
Stat . § 204B.44 be , and the same is , dismissed with prejudice .
Dated : March 9 , 2009 Source : Order to Dismiss Petition by Certain Minnesota Voters to Have Their Votes Counted Pursuant to Minn. Stat . § 204B.44 via MNCourts.gov
While these voters will not be allowed legal representation within the ECC proceedings , it is still possible for their votes to be counted by some other means .
The result of this ruling was good news for Coleman as these 30 voters are widely assumed to have cast their ballots for Franken .
At the end of the day , the Coleman and Franken campaigns likely looked in the mirror and thought it was a good day , and sadly , the Star Tribune probably did the same .

Large size and a fast bite spelled doom for bony fishes during the last mass extinction 65 million years ago , according to a new study . *
Today , those same features characterize large predatory bony fishes , such as tuna and billfishes , that are currently in decline and at risk of extinction themselves , said Matt Friedman , author of the study and a graduate student in evolutionary biology at the University of Chicago .
" The same thing is happening today to ecologically similar fishes , " he said .
" The hardest hit species are consistently big predators . "
Studies of modern fishes demonstrate that large body size is linked to large prey size and low rates of population growth , while fast - closing jaws appear to be adaptations for capturing agile , evasive prey — in other words , other fishes .
The fossil record provides some remarkable evidence supporting these estimates of function : fossil fishes with preserved stomach contents that record their last meals .
When an asteroid struck the earth at the end of the Cretaceous about 65 million years ago , the resultant impact clouded the earth in soot and smoke .
This blocked photosynthesis on land and in the sea , undermined food chains at a rudimentary level , and led to the extinction of thousands of species of flora and fauna , including dinosaurs .
Scientists had speculated that during that interval large predatory fishes might have been more likely than other fishes to go extinct because they tended to have slowly increasing populations , live more spread out , take longer to mature , and occupy precarious positions at the tops of food chains .
Today , ecologically similar fishes appear to be the least able to rebound from declining numbers due to overfishing .

To build the database he needed to test this prediction , Friedman traveled around the world measuring the body size and jaw bones of 249 genera of fossil fishes that lived during the late Cretaceous .
These kinds of direct measurements are possible in fossil fishes because many are represented by complete , articulated individuals .
This is unlike the fossil record of most other vertebrates , where bones , teeth and other parts of the skeleton are often scattered and found in isolation .
This study is the first to test this theory with hard data and to quantify the relationship between body size , jaw function and vulnerability of fishes during the Cretaceous extinction , according to Friedman .
" Anyway you sliced it , the data showed that if you were a big fish with a fast bite you were toast , " he said .
Ironically , today 's large fishes with fast bites evolved relatively shortly after the end - Cretaceous extinction , apparently filling the functional and ecological roles vacated by the victims of that mass extinction .
Although the two groups of fishes are not related to each other , their fates may end up being similar .
The paper is called " Ecomorphological selectivity among marine teleost fishes during the end - Cretaceous extinction " and will appear in issue 13 of PNAS .
In it , Friedman describes the results of his study as robust because the large - bodied , predatory fishes that are disproportionately devastated also have the best fossil records .
" In other words , we can be convinced that these forms really do die off here , and that their disappearance can't be chalked up to a lousy fossil record , " Friedman noted .
advertisement
Nevertheless , fossil fishes are not well studied because paleontologists , as a group , tend to be drawn to other animals , such as dinosaurs .
Therefore , many large - scale patterns of fish evolution remain unclear .
The fossil fishes included in the study are diverse in form , and range in length from about 20 feet to less than one inch .
" This study demonstrates that fossil datasets are germane to modern diversity and evolution by allowing us to calibrate what characteristics might relate to extinction vulnerability today , " Friedman said .
" Echoes of the end - Cretaceous extinction reverberate 65 million years later . "

It ’s raining flaming debris
February 15 , 2009 by twitterpaters
by twit
in Texas :
The Federal Aviation Administration has received numerous reports of falling debris across Texas , which could be related to a recent satellite collision .
Some of the callers around midmorning Sunday reported what looked like a fireball in the sky .
FAA spokesman Roland Herwig said officials suspect the debris could be related to the collision , but he said that had not been confirmed .
but not to worry !
The U.S. Strategic Command said there was no connection to the sightings over Texas and Tuesday ’s collision of satellites from the U.S. and Russia .
“ There is no correlation between the debris from that collision and those reports of re-entry , ” said Maj .
Regina Winchester , with STRATCOM .
The FAA notified pilots on Saturday to be aware of possible space debris after a collision Tuesday between U.S. and Russian communication satellites .
The chief of Russia ’s Mission Control says clouds of debris from the collision will circle Earth for thousands of years and threaten numerous satellites .
the trick is to pay no attention !
Meanwhile , there ’s no global air traffic control system that tracks the position of all satellites .
The U.S. military tracks some 17,000 pieces of space debris larger than 2 to 4 inches ( 5 to 10 centimeters ) , along with some 900 active satellites .
But its main job is protecting the international space station and other manned spacecraft , and it lacks the resources to warn all satellite operators of every possible close call .

THESE PIECES OF DEBRIS HAVE BEEN CAUSING SONIC BOOMS…RESULTING IN THE VIBRATIONS BEING FELT BY SOME RESIDENTS …AS WELL AS FLASHES OF LIGHT ACROSS THE SKY .
THE CLOUD OF DEBRIS IS LIKELY THE RESULT OF THE RECENT IN ORBIT COLLISION OF TWO SATELLITES ON TUESDAY …FEBRUARY 10TH WHEN KOSMOS 2251 CRASHED INTO IRIDIUM 33 .
update : via Slashdot , a report from a local Austin news site :
Torvald Hessel with the Austin Planetarium says it ’s unusual to see shooting stars in the daylight , if that ’s what the object is , because it ’s so bright with the sun out .
He also acknowledges it could be a defunct satellite , “ It actually might be possible this is debris from the two satellites that collided on Tuesday , we just do n’t know yet .
The FAA says it could be debris from the collision .
Astronomically speaking , we thought there was a very small chance it was the satellites but now we ’re rethinking that .
If it is a shooting star it is big , at least a yard or two across to make that much of a spectacle . ”
Hessel expects if it was a star , it would have exploded and there will be debris found .
If it was satellites they would have burned up in the atmosphere according to Hessel .
Hessel warns of the potential health hazards if someone stumbles on the debris , “ Potentially there will be a health Hazard if this is satellite debris , the iridium satellite should be ok and is probably most likely going to be solar power panels ; the defunct Russian satellite may pose a risk . ” …
The Austin Planetarium will look at the orbits of the two satellites to compare them to the path of the fireball .

Property seized by E. Texas police called ' highway piracy '
Property seizure by police called ' highway piracy '

Law enforcement authorities in this East Texas town of 1,000 people seized property from at least 140 motorists between 2006 and 2008 , and , to date , filed criminal charges against fewer than half , according to a San Antonio Express - News review of court documents .
Virtually anything of value was up for grabs : cash , cell phones , personal jewelry , a pair of sneakers , and often , the very car that was being driven through town .
Some affidavits filed by officers relied on the presence of seemingly innocuous property as the only evidence that a crime had occurred .
Linda Dorman , a great - grandmother from Akron , Ohio , had $ 4,000 in cash taken from her by local authorities when she was stopped while driving through town after visiting Houston in April 2007 .
Court records make no mention that anything illegal was found in her van and show no criminal charges filed in the case .
She is still waiting for the return of what she calls “ her life savings . ”
Dorman ’s attorney , David Guillory , calls the roadside stops and seizures in Tenaha “ highway piracy , ” undertaken by a couple of law enforcement officers whose agencies get to keep most of what is seized .
Guillory is suing officials in Tenaha and Shelby County on behalf of Dorman and nine other clients who were stripped of their property .
All were African - Americans driving either rentals or vehicles with out - of - state plates .
Lawsuit filed
Guillory alleges in the lawsuit that while his clients were detained , they were presented with an ultimatum : waive your rights to your property in exchange for a promise to be released and not be criminally charged .
Guillory said most did as Dorman did , signing the waiver to avoid jail .
The state ’s asset seizure law does n’t require that law enforcement agencies file criminal charges in civil forfeiture cases .
It requires only a preponderance of evidence that the property was used in the commission of certain crimes , such as drug crimes , or bought with proceeds of those crimes .
That ’s a lesser burden than that required in a criminal case .
But Sen. John Whitmire , D - Houston , chair of the Senate Criminal Justice Committee , said the state ’s asset forfeiture law is being abused by enough jurisdictions across the state that he wants to rewrite major sections of it this year .
“ The idea that people lose their property but are never charged and never get it back , that ’s theft as far as I ’m concerned , ” he said .
Supporters tout the state ’s forfeiture law , when used right , as an essential law enforcement tool , allowing state and local departments the ability to go after criminals using the criminals ’ money .
Law enforcement agencies last year captured tens of millions of dollars from such seizures statewide , according to records from Whitmire ’s office .
But in Tenaha , a town of chicken farms that hugs the Louisiana border , critics say being a black out - of - towner passing through with anything of value is almost evidence of a crime .
Town needs revenue
Tenaha Mayor George Bowers , 80 , defended the seizures , saying they allowed a cash - poor city the means to add a second police car in a two - policeman town and help pay for a new police station .
“ It ’s always helpful to have any kind of income to expand your police force , ” Bowers said .
Local police , he said , must take aggressive action to stem the drug trade that flows through town via U.S. 59 .
“ No doubt about it .
( Highway 59 ) is a thoroughfare that a lot of no - good people travel on .
They take the drugs and sell it and take the money and go right back into Mexico , ” said Bowers , who has been Tenaha ’s mayor for 54 years .
Bowers said he would defer questions about whether innocent people were being stripped of their property to Shelby County District Attorney Lynda Russell .
Russell could not be reached for comment , and her attorney declined comment .
Randy
Whatley , a local constable who himself deposited $ 115,000 into the county ’s seizure account for fiscal year 2007 — state records show $ 45,000 was eventually returned to their owners — also could not be reached for comment .
Russell , Whatley and Bowers are named in Guillory ’s lawsuit .
Harris County District Attorney Patricia
Lykos said the state ’s forfeiture law , which last year put millions in the coffers of local law enforcement agencies , including hers , takes some of the profit out of crime .
“ These ill - gotten gains are used to further the aims of law enforcement and public safety , ” she said .
“ It ’s kind of poetic justice , is n’t it ? ”
Lykos praises law
Lykos believes the law , if followed , provides citizens with adequate safeguards .
Local police and attorneys in her office , she said , are well - versed in what constitutes adequate evidence for seizures .
Rarely , she said , do seizures take place locally without the filing of criminal charges .
In Shelby County , the district attorney made legal agreements with some individuals that her office would not file criminal charges so long as the property owner waived all rights to the valuables .
“ In exchange for ( respondent ) signing the agreed order of forfeiture , the Shelby County District Attorney ’s Office agrees to reject charges of money laundering pending at this time , ” read one waiver , dated April 10 , 2007 .
The property owners named in the waiver had just signed over $ 7,342 in cash , their 1994 Chevrolet Suburban , a cell phone , a BlackBerry and a stone necklace .
The law , forbids a peace officer at the time of seizure to “ request , require or in any manner induce any person . . . to execute a document purporting to waive the person ’s interest in or rights to the property . ”

COLUMBIA , S.C. — Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott said he will charge Michael Phelps with a crime if he determines the Olympics hero smoked marijuana in Richland County .
Phelps , who set a record with eight gold medals in the 2008 Summer Olympics , was photographed smoking a marijuana pipe at a November party in Columbia .
The picture was published in the British newspaper News of the World .
Phelps apologized Sunday , calling his behavior “ inappropriate . ”
“ This case is no different than any other case , ” Lott said Monday .
“ This one might be a lot easier since we have photographs of someone using drugs and a partial confession .
It ’s a relatively easy case once we can determine where the crime occurred . ”
Possession of marijuana is a misdemeanor , punishable by up to 30 days in jail or a $ 570 fine , plus court costs .
But Lott seems to be the only person talking about making a case against Phelps .
The University of South Carolina and Columbia Police Departments said they would not pursue charges .
Meanwhile , Phelps ’ sponsors — from apparel company Speedo to luxury Swiss watchmaker Omega — issued statements calling the incident a “ nonissue . ”
The International Olympic Committee accepted his apology .

The Next Generation of Alternative Energy : Plug and Play Solar Panels
March 12th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Want solar power on the cheap ?
Veranda Solar may be able to help .
The company ’s innovative panel design requires only a screwdriver and a standard home outlet .
At $ 600 , the panel is much more affordable than many of its competitors .
Veranda says that its product can be affixed to windows , gutters , and balconies in “ plug and play style ” – so the panels snap together and can be plugged in directly to an outlet .
If you decide that a single panel is n’t enough to fulfill your power needs , springing for additional snap - on panels at $ 450 a pop is n’t too much of a stretch .
The company ’s panels are n’t yet on the market , but a 100,000 Euro prize from the PICNIC Green Challenge has sped up the production process .
According to Veranda , panels and flexible inverters should be available by the end of 2009 .

An alien ’s description of the cosmos might teach us a thing or two about the nature of reality ( Image : Wolcott Henry / National Geographic / Getty )
IF WE ever establish contact with intelligent aliens living on a planet around a distant star , we would expect some problems communicating with them .
As we are many light years away , our signals would take many years to reach them , so there would be no scope for snappy repartee .
There could be an IQ gap and the aliens might be built from quite different chemistry .
Yet there would be much common ground too .
They would be made of similar atoms to us .
They could trace their origins back to the big bang 13.7 billion years ago , and they would share with us the universe ’s future .
However , the surest common culture would be mathematics .
Mathematics has been the language of science for thousands of years , and it is remarkably successful .
In a famous essay , the great physicist Eugene Wigner wrote about the “ unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics ” .
Most of us resonate with the perplexity expressed by Wigner , and also with Einstein ’s dictum that “ the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible ” .
We marvel at the fact that the universe is not anarchic – that atoms obey the same laws in distant galaxies as in the lab .
The aliens would , like us , be astonished by the patterns in our shared cosmos and by the effectiveness of mathematics in describing those patterns .
Mathematics can point the way towards new discoveries in physics too .
Most famously , British theorist Paul Dirac used pure mathematics to formulate an equation that led to …

Tibetans recently observed Monlam , or The Great Prayer Festival , with prayers , ritual dances , traditional foods and giant tapestry - like paintings .
Ethnic Tibetans are maintaining their traditional culture while change slowly comes their way .
Chinese officials have prohibited the festival in the past , and still discourage participation , and more change will be arriving soon by rail as the Qinghai - Tibet railway between China proper and Tibet is scheduled for completion three years from now .
Chinese government officials are now preparing for possible trouble in March , on the 50th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising , when the Dalai Lama fled into exile , and tens of thousands of Tibetans were killed .
Foreign travelers have now been banned from large parts of western Tibet until late March .

Republican operative Scott Shires is accused of helping the head of an illegal - gambling ring hide the nature of his business , according to a state indictment .
Shires is alleged to have advised Jeffrey Castardi on how to disguise money laundering at Mario N Wongs , a restaurant Castardi owned .
Castardi and six others were indicted last month on allegations they ran an illegal - gambling operation and other rackets .
Shires is not charged in the case .
Shires denied involvement in the scheme .
He said he was not aware of what Castardi was doing during the period that his company , Shires Financial Group , handled bookkeeping matters for him .
Shires Financial went to work for Castardi after he opened the restaurant in late 2007 .
Around March 2008 , Shires noticed that large credit - card payments made to Mario N Wongs were being withdrawn from a bank account as soon as the transactions cleared .
“ There were large credit - card deposits coming in one day and the cash going out of the bank account the next day .
( Castardi ) said : ‘ Do n’t worry about it .
A guy owed me some money , and I ran it through as a credit - card transaction . ’
I said , ‘ You ca n’t do that , ’ ” Shires said .
He decided to drop Mario N Wongs as a client and gave Castardi three weeks ’ notice to find another company to handle bookkeeping and tax matters .
“ I said , I ca n’t hang around this dude , ” Shires said .
“ They raided him right after the three weeks was up . ”
Shires was among a list of people who “ feloniously and knowingly conducted or participated , directly or indirectly , in the enterprise , ” the indictment said .
Rob Shapiro , Colorado ’s first assistant attorney general , who is handling the case , did n’t return calls for comment .
Shires has brushed up against the law before .
He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of filing false tax returns in connection with a case against his one - time employer , Octane International Limited .
He was sentenced in June to a year ’s probation and a $ 3,450 fine in the case .
Shires is well - connected in Colorado GOP circles and has run tax - exempt 527 political committees formed to influence elections in the state , including the Colorado League of Taxpayers and the Coalition for Energy .
Real estate developer James Elterman , who is charged with helping to finance Castardi ’s operation and other crimes , referred Shires to Castardi .
“ My only fault was that I did n’t go to the cops and tell them about my suspicions , ” Shires said .

The Depatment of Interior announced on Wednesday that a task force has been created with the goal of pushing through renewable energy projects on federal lands .
“ We will assign a high priority to identifying renewable energy zones and completing the permitting and appropriate environmental review of transmission rights - of - way applications that are necessary to deliver renewable energy generation to consumers , ” Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said .
“ We have to connect the sun of the deserts and the wind of the plains with the places where people live . ”
The task force will have the assignment of identifying specific zones on public lands where the Interior Department can then step in and push through the creation of large - scale renewable energy production such as wind , geothermal , solar and biomass energy .
The Wilderness Society , which has been lobbying the White House for reform on how electrical grids are planned , built and managed , applauded Salazar ’s announcement .
“ Secretary Salazar has laid the foundation for our nation ’s entrepreneurs to harness the planet ’s wind , sun , heat and other renewable energy sources in a manner that safeguards the wildlife and natural resources that help keep American communities healthy , safe , and prosperous , ” Wilderness Society President Bill Meadows said in a statement .
The move is just the latest among other plans that want to clear the path for renewable energy production on lands that may otherwise pose a problem for construction .
Last week , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada introduced a bill that would create renewable energy power lines which would deliver electricity created from renewable sources in remote areas to more populated cities .
The senator wants the Federal government to have the power to override states in deciding where they should be placed and who will pay for them .
The ultimate authority will lie with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take land under eminent domain and issue permits if a project is being stalled on the state level .
“ The concept of this bill is simple , we need to have an efficient way to take energy created in often remote areas and move it to where it is needed , ” Reid said .
“ This is especially important for states like Nevada because it will create thousands of good - paying jobs and help diversify the economy . ”
A plane carrying Geert Wilders , the rightwing Dutch politician accused of Islamophobia who is banned from entering the UK , touched down in London today .
Wilders was due to show his 17 - minute film Fitna , which criticises the Qur'an as a " fascist book " , at the House of Lords today but on Tuesday he received a letter from the Home Office refusing him entry because his opinions " threaten community security and therefore public security " .
The controversial leader of the Freedom party , who arrived at Heathrow airport shortly after 2 pm , told the BBC of his plans to travel in contravention of the ban earlier today , saying " Let 's see what will happen . "
He added : " I was very surprised and very saddened that the freedom of speech that I believe was a very strong point in UK society is being harassed today . "
It is understood that the controversial politician 's passport will be flagged up at Heathrow immigration and he will be refused entry to Britain at that point .
Fitna intersperses images of the September 11 attacks with quotations from the Islamic holy book and its release last year sparked violent protests in the Muslim world .
In 2007 , Wilders called for the Qur'an to be banned and likened it to Adolf Hitler 's Mein Kampf .
Last month , an Amsterdam court ruled that he should be prosecuted for inciting racial hatred but Wilders has launched an appeal against the decision .
The Dutch foreign minister , Maxime Verhagen , said the Dutch government would press for a reversal of the travel ban on Wilders , and a UK Independence party peer , Lord Pearson , who invited Wilders to Britain , said the screening of the film would go ahead today , whether he was there or not .
Speaking outside the House of Lords today , Pearson said he disagreed with some of Wilders ' views but was " coming at this from the angle of free speech " .
Pearson described the Dutch politician as a " very brave man " and said he did not think he was a racist .
" I think this man is raising one of the most important issues of our time , which is Islamic militarism , which is a violent jihad , " said Pearson .
" That 's the issue that this man is raising , and I think that should be discussed much more , particularly amongst the vast majority of the mild Muslim community . "
The peer initially said he did not believe there should be any limits to freedom of speech but when pressed conceded that there should be " a very few " , such as language that incited violence .
Pearson said he believed a Hitler - type figure should be allowed to speak in public in Britain .
" I would go and laugh at him .
You could n't take him seriously , could you ? " he said .
The peer revealed he had put down a motion for debate in the House of Lords urging the government to sponsor a conference into whether the Old Testament , New Testament and Qur'an contained justification for violence .
The National Secular Society president , Terry Sanderson , said he wrote to the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , saying she should not have denied an application by a " democratically elected politician from a sovereign state who wants to come and express an opinion " .
" It may be a controversial opinion but he is entitled to express it , " he said .
The Home Office has said it would " stop those who want to spread extremism , hatred and violent messages in our communities from coming to our country " .
A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain described Wilders as " an open and relentless preacher of hate " .
" We have no problem with the challenge of criticisms to our faith , but the film that will be screened by Lord Pearson and Baroness Cox is nothing less than a cheap and tacky attempt to whip up hysteria against Muslims , " he said .
The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , Chris Huhne , said that while it was important to defend freedom of speech , Wilders " has overstepped the line that should be defended in a civilised society " .
Wilders said he had already shown his film to Denmark 's parliament and intended to take it to Italy and the US House of Representatives in the coming weeks .

I was looking for some way to easily create , read , manipulate and print cyclic or recursive data structures in some programming languages , and got to the cool concept of sharp variables .
A straightforward way of defining a recursive structure is to first assign a base ( non-recursive ) structure to a variable , and then alter or extend that variable with a recursive expression .
For example , in Python you can write : That code will create a recursive data structure : [ 1 , 2 , 3 , [ 1 , 2 , 3 , [ ... ] ] ] , or a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , a ] .
Actually , Python 's print function lets you print a representation of a recursive structure without recursing indefinitely :
Python 's pickle module lets you dump a recursive data structure into a file .
You can also read that serialized structure from the file :
However , there 's no literal way of creating , reading or modifying that structure :
For manipulating / printing recursive data structures in Common Lisp we first assign T to the global variable * print - circle *
We can define a recursive structure just as we did with Python , by defining some base structure and then modifying the structure to be recursive :
The final structure is represented with sharp variables :
This is just as the " Mathematical " definition we gave above : a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , a ] .
What 's interesting about this " serialization format " is that expressions involving sharp variables are : these " objects " can be read and manipulated just like any other structure :
Sharp variables seem like an excellent solution for creating , reading and manipulating cyclic data structures .
Mozilla 's JavaScript implementation has Sharp Variables .
They 've been introduced by Brendan Eich and they are inspired by Common Lisp 's syntax .
Sharp Variables can be pretty useful in JavaScript , since most of the time we 're manipulating object references and Firefox 's toSource ( ) method is pretty useful for debugging ( among other things ) .
Try running that in your Firefox console , it should return " #1 = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , # 1 # ] " .
Oh , and did I mention that you can also explicitly manipulate cyclic structures in JavaScript ?
I was happy to find such an interesting Lisp feature in JavaScript .
The US Drug Enforcement Administration has rejected the bid of a researcher at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who wants to create the second laboratory in the nation authorized to grow marijuana for medical research .
The ruling was released yesterday , nearly two years after a federal administrative law judge recommended that Lyle Craker , a horticultural professor who specializes in medicinal plants , be allowed to grow marijuana for medical research .
The DEA decision called the current supply of marijuana for research " adequate and uninterrupted " and said a second laboratory would not be in the public interest .
Since 1968 , a federally approved laboratory at the University of Mississippi's School of Pharmacy has grown nearly a hundred varieties of marijuana plants .
Access to the plants has been limited to researchers who gain federal permits .
The plants have been used for clinical studies across the country .
Some researchers complain that access to the laboratory 's supply is thwarted by a contract it holds with the National Institute on Drug Abuse , which must approve permits issued by the Food and Drug Administration or the DEA in a process that can take months to complete .
Rick Doblin , president of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies , a Belmont - based drug research group that wants to fund Craker 's marijuana cultivation , and sponsored the suit that spurred the administrative law judge 's recommendation in 2007 , calls the Mississippi lab a monopoly .
He said his group will file another suit or appeal to the Obama administration .

Battlestar Galactica creator Ronald D Moore prepared us for tomorrow night 's season finale , by explaining how it went down .
Plus , the backstory to the most mysterious name drop in BSG 's history , the missing Cylon Daniel .
Advertisement
When did you figure out what you wanted to do with the ending ?
Because I heard with President Roslin , you knew about her tragic family backstory almost from day one , but waited to show it .
Was it like that with the finale ?
That was in the show bible , actually .
That was in the original show bible that I wrote up .
I wrote all these these character bios , and that was in the character bio and we just never played it or had a point to it .
The focus of the flashbacks was sort of to say , " This is where the character 's ending , " and to [ help us ] understand where they ended and why .
[ And to do that , you need to ] understand who they were , and see that it 's all connected together .
That story of losing her sisters , and the subsequent events that you see in the finale , really are the connective tissue that took Laura to Galactica , which also mean that 's why she is where she is .
Advertisement
When did you know when you wrote the finale that this was what you wanted to do ?
It came much more naturally .
Over the years , David and I had lots of ideas about the finale .
When we were plotting out the fourth season , that was when we in earnest started taking about how it was going to end .
And it changed several times over the course of the fourth season .
It was n't really until we were in the room , breaking the final episode , that the flashbacks came in and we started talking in concrete terms about exactly how it ends , and the specific ends of each character , and exactly where Galactica is going to end up .
Let 's talk about the fan reaction to the final episode .
As with all things in this genre , there will be people that love it and people that speak out against it .
How will you address those who may leave unsatisfied ?
Well , all I can say is :
We 're happy .
This is what we wanted to do , this is the story I wanted to tell , and this is the end of the chapter .
You get to the end of the book and you may not like the ending , but this is what the author chose to tell you .
I 'm very proud of it .
We were all proud to do it , and so we just hope the people share this feeling .
But [ for ] the people that do n't , there 's nothing we can do about it .

How about fan theories over the show , like mention of a missing Cylon named Daniel ?
After his name was mentioned , the fans just went wild online .
Did you intend for that to happen , and was he supposed to inspire this big fan - driven backstory ?
You know , the Daniel thing is going to be one of the great fiascos of the show , in terms of what fans thought and what the truth was .
Because Daniel was not intended to be anything more than an interesting bit of backstory in that episode .
And that 's how we approached it .
It was just a story that Cavil and Ellen tell each other , that sort of goes to the idea of who Cavil was and how deep his resentments were , and his jealous nature - and [ we wanted to ] do a Cain and Abel allegory .
That was all it was .
Advertisement
And then after the show aired .
I started picking up all this stuff about how fans were obsessing about Daniel and how [ people thought ]
Daniel was Kara 's father , and he was the big surprise .
I started thinking , " Oh shit , slow down people , I do n't want you to really get invested . "
I usually do n't like to go out there and say , " Oh , that 's a bad theory , " because part of the enjoyment of watching the show is coming up with ideas .
But this was gathering such momentum , I did n't want people to be going into the finale and really be waiting for the Daniel shoe to drop , when there 's no shoe .
It 's one of those things where you 're inside the show , [ and ] you look at it , and go one way .
And then it 's broadcast , and an audience sees it , and then they seize on this piece that you never really anticipated , and then you 're sort of amazed .
And you 're saying , " Slow down , no - come back . "
Advertisement
Well we listen to every single thing you put up there , because they usually do come back at some point , so I 'm not surprised that name - drop took off .
Yeah , I kind of feel bad about that .
It 's like , " Oh man . " [ Laughs ]
A man in a Guangzhou Lenovo store died after the cellphone in his chest pocket exploded .
The explosion severed a major artery in his neck and caused massive blood loss , almost immediately killing him .
Though the make and model of the mobile phone are still under investigation , a member of the staff said the man had just changed his cellphone battery to a new one .
This is the 9th recorded cellphone explosion in China since 2002 , so maybe it ’s best to make sure your cellphone ’s in a bag or something , rather than on your physical person .

The perfectly shaped point break at Malibu ’s Surfrider Beach lures wave riders from around the world .
But the chronically polluted water has given countless swimmers and surfers queasy stomachs , eye infections and nasty rashes .
Long under orders from the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board to clean up its coastline , Malibu is eager to begin turning 17 acres of open space on Pacific Coast Highway in the heart of the city into a park that would double as a storm water treatment zone .
Many in the environmental and surfing communities contend that the design for Legacy Park falls short because it does not also provide for treating sewage in the Civic Center area , home to the Malibu Country Mart and Cross Creek Plaza , busy havens for well - heeled shoppers and diners .
Legacy Park “ was touted as a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to create a state - of - the - art environmental solution to the city ’s water quality problems , ” said Joe Melchione , an attorney who heads the Malibu Surfing Assn .'s environmental committee .
“ It ’s time for the city of Malibu to grow up and clean up their own mess . ”
And that , Melchione and others say , should include treating sewage along with storm water .
Malibu City Manager Jim Thorsen counters that studies showed the Legacy Park site does not lend itself to treating wastewater because it contains relatively impermeable clay .
Unlike other , more porous soils , clay keeps wastewater from percolating , or draining , through underground layers .
Percolation provides a natural cleansing , as soils absorb viruses , oils , metals , excess nutrients and other pollutants from the water .
Thorsen said the city must use a phased approach to the water quality problem .
It expects to begin building wastewater treatment plants in 2011 .
It did not make sense to hold off on Legacy Park while a wastewater treatment plan was devised and reviewed , Thorsen said .
Better , he added , “ to solve our storm water problems [ first ] .
Wastewater will lag behind a couple of years . ”
Environmental groups say wastewater from commercial septic systems in the area leaches into Malibu Creek and Lagoon and then flows into the ocean , accounting for much of the fecal bacteria and other contaminants that routinely earn Surfrider Ds and Fs on Heal the Bay ’s beach report card .
( The phenomenon also explains the foul odor that permeates that portion of Malibu . )
Cross Creek Plaza ’s septic system has been upgraded , but the water board has issued notices of violation to the Malibu Country Mart for failure to comply with orders to improve its sewage treatment .
In the board ’s view , the Civic Center area “ has reached its disposal capacity . ”
As a result , unless Legacy Park handles both types of water treatment , “ it ’s a waste of investment dollars , ” said Mark Gold , president of Heal the Bay , a nonprofit environmental group dedicated to cleaning up Southern California ’s coastal waters and watersheds .
Malibu already is in deep financially on the project .
In 2005 , it raised $ 25 million to buy the property -- known locally as the Chili Cook - Off site , for an annual Labor Day weekend festival held there since 1982 -- from Malibu Bay Co. , owned by Malibu Colony resident A. Jerrold Perenchio .
( Among the fundraisers was former Mayor Ken Kearsley , who said he and a councilwoman spent hours soliciting donations with “ a tin cup out in front of Ralphs . ” )
The purchase was made with a combination of public and private funds and “ certificates of participation , ” lease purchase agreements held by multiple investors .
The city ’s annual payment on that debt is $ 1.5 million , much of which is to be covered by rent from three tenants on the property -- a Coldwell Banker office , a veterinary hospital and the new Malibu Lumber Yard shopping center , nearing completion on the site of a locally beloved lumber yard that operated there for about 40 years .
In addition , the city is attempting to raise $ 15 million more to build Legacy Park , which would include an outdoor educational center and five habitats designed to attract coyotes , California quails , red - tailed hawks , Western toads and other critters .
Among those who have written sizable checks for the purchase or construction is a Who ’s Who of civic and entertainment royalty , including Steve and Patti Soboroff , rocker Don Henley , “ Dallas ” star Victoria Principal , Eli and Edythe Broad , Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson and Jeffrey and Marilyn Katzenberg .
The stakes are high for both Malibu and the environmental community .
Here , the battle over septic leaks and water quality is an old story .
Malibu incorporated as a city in 1991 after Los Angeles County pushed to build a huge sewage treatment plant in undeveloped Corral Canyon .
Residents feared that sewers would lead to unbridled growth .
More than 17 years later , critics say , Malibu has yet to seriously address the sewage problems plaguing the Civic Center area .
“ The city ’s foot - dragging . . . has left me and many other environmental leaders convinced that an integrated solution to Malibu ’s pollution problems will be delivered many years in the future , if at all , ” Gold wrote in November on his Spouting Off blog .
Since 2004 , Malibu and the regional water board , a state agency , have operated under an agreement that allows the city to issue wastewater disposal permits to single - family homes and small commercial developments .
In September , the city notified the water board that it intended to regulate the discharge at the upscale Malibu Lumber Yard shopping center at Cross Creek Road and Pacific Coast Highway .
In need of rental income to help pay its debt , Malibu was determined to get the project up and running .
The project expects to open in February , several months behind schedule , with shops including Tory Burch , James Perse , Kitson and Planet Blue .
Two restaurants are also planned .
Developers Richard Weintraub and Richard Sperber , both locals , spent more than $ 3 million constructing a state - of - the - art on - site water treatment system at the shopping center -- before receiving a permit .
The city contended that it could issue the permit because the project ’s first phase would produce less than 3,200 gallons of sewage a day .
The water board disagreed , saying it had jurisdiction because the addition of the restaurants would cause the amount of sewage to soar to 17,000 gallons a day .
On Dec. 11 , after Malibu relented , the water board approved the Malibu Lumber Yard system ’s permit but imposed conditions , including daily monitoring and a requirement that the system be hooked up to the city ’s proposed centralized water treatment plant within six months of its completion .
The increasingly disgruntled board has informed the city that it intends to terminate its agreement to allow Malibu to do some of its own permitting .
It said it also might seek a prohibition on septic tanks in the Civic Center area .
That could spell trouble for other developments in the pipeline in a city that came to be because of its adamant opposition to sewers .
“ How this is all going to play out is completely up in the air , ” Gold said .
But the result could be that “ the most critical section of Malibu , which has been demonstrated to exacerbate the pollution problems , would be off septic systems . ”

Obama 's Justice Department backs Bush secrecy on renditions suit Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday February 9 , 2009
Print This Email This Update ( at bottom ) : ACLU ' shocked and deeply disappointed '
An attorney for President Obama 's Department of Justice has told the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that it supports the Bush administration 's controversial state secrets defense in a lawsuit over the prior president 's " extraordinary rendition " program .
" The case involves five men who claim to have been victims of extraordinary rendition -- including current Guantanamo detainee Binyam Mohamed , another plaintiff in jail in Egypt , one in jail in Morocco , and two now free , " reports ABC News .
" They sued a San Jose Boeing subsidiary , Jeppesen Dataplan , accusing the flight - planning company of aiding the CIA in flying them to other countries and secret CIA camps where they were tortured . "
" Under the Bush administration , the U.S. government used false claims of national security to dodge judicial scrutiny of extraordinary rendition , " Ben Wizner , an ACLU staff attorney , said in a Monday media advisory .
" This case presents the first test of the Obama administration 's dedication to transparency and willingness to act on its condemnation of torture and rendition .
The administration should unequivocally reject the Bush administration 's abuse of the state secrets privilege and permit this case to go forward .
Victims of extraordinary rendition deserve their day in court . "
" A source inside of the Ninth U.S. District Court tells ABC News that a representative of the Justice Department stood up to say that its position has n't changed , that new administration stands behind arguments that previous administration made , with no ambiguity at all , " continued ABC .
" The DOJ lawyer said the entire subject matter remains a state secret . "
" This case cannot be litigated , " Department of Justice attorney Douglas Letter argued .
" The judges should n't play with fire in this national security situation . "
Asked by Judge Mary Schroeder whether the change in the White House had led to any changes in the government 's legal arguments in the case , Letter said it " remains the position " of the government that the case should not proceed .
" The Bush administrations claim is that the ' very subject matter ' of the suit is a state secret , " said the New York Times in a Wednesday editorial .
" We can understand why the Bush team would not want evidence of illegal detentions and torture presented in court , but the argument is preposterous . "
" We hope the judges will have the courage to stand up to the government , " said the LA Times on Saturday .
" The Attorney General has directed that senior Justice Department officials review all assertions of the State Secrets privilege to ensure that the privilege is being invoked only in legally appropriate situations , " Matt Miller , a spokesman for the Department of Justice , said in a prepared statement .
" It is vital that we protect information that , if released , could jeopardize national security . "
" The Justice Department will ensure the privilege is not invoked to hide from the American people information about their government 's actions that they have a right to know , " Miller continued .
" This administration will be transparent and open , consistent with our national security obligations . "
" If the Obama administration does not change course , ACLU attorney Wizner will feel betrayed , " reported National Public Radio on Sunday .
" It is hard for me to believe that a lawyer representing the United States , representing President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder , will take the same extreme positions that I 've been fighting against for the last several years , " Wizner said on NPR's All Things Considered .
" It 's inconceivable , given the rhetoric that we 've heard from candidate and President Obama . "
Update : ACLU ' shocked and deeply disappointed '
" We are shocked and deeply disappointed that the Justice Department has chosen to continue the Bush administrations practice of dodging judicial scrutiny of extraordinary rendition and torture , " Wizner said in a Monday advisory released after the government stated its position .
" This was an opportunity for the new administration to act on its condemnation of torture and rendition , but instead it has chosen to stay the course .
Now we must hope that the court will assert its independence by rejecting the governments false claims of state secrets and allowing the victims of torture and rendition their day in court . "
" Eric Holders Justice Department stood up in court today and said that it would continue the Bush policy of invoking state secrets to hide the reprehensible history of torture , rendition and the most grievous human rights violations committed by the American government , " Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the ACLU , said in the same release .
" This is not change .
This is definitely more of the same .
Candidate Obama ran on a platform that would reform the abuse of state secrets , but President Obamas Justice Department has disappointingly reneged on that important civil liberties issue .
If this is a harbinger of things to come , it will be a long and arduous road to give us back an America we can be proud of again . "
" Our clients did not ask to be abducted , chained to the floor of planes , dressed in diapers and taken to a foreign country , " Wizner told the court .
" If you affirm ( the judge 's dismissal of the case ) , plaintiffs will forever be shut out of their day in court . "
The judges did not immediately issue a ruling .

Jennifer Woloshyn reports on a recent victory for Woodfin Suites workers in their years - long struggle to get the hotel to honor a local living - wage ordinance .
EMERYVILLE , Calif . -- Hotel workers here won a significant victory January 15 when the city council ordered Woodfin Suites Hotel to pay workers $ 200,000 in back wages .
Workers have been organizing for years to demand that Woodfin honor Measure C , a living - wage ordinance passed by voters in the Bay Area city of Emeryville in 2005 .
Under the ordinance , hotels are supposed to pay a modest minimum wage of $ 9 per hour , and pay time and a half if they force housekeepers to clean more than 5,000 square feet in one day .
Woodfin ignored the ordinance , forcing housekeepers to clean 17 suites per shift instead of limiting it to 10 , as the square footage restriction required .
Workers began with a petition drive in the nonunion , mostly immigrant workplace to demand their employer comply with the city ordinance .
When Woodfin management ignored the petition and began using intimidation tactics , workers took their struggle into the streets , organizing pickets and protests that included thousands of community supporters over the years .
Woodfin Suites workers organized several rallies and pickets of the hotel while fighting for justice ( Brooke Anderson )
This recent victory is all the more satisfying given Woodfin 's ruthless tactics .
Management has fired some of the worker organizers , using the pretext of " no- match " letters , and even called in Immigration and Customs Enforcement , whose agents showed up at the home of one worker to humiliate and interrogate her in front of her family .
The first victory was forcing Woodfin to comply with the workload restrictions of the ordinance , but management still would n't admit to owing any back wages to current and former workers for the time period it did n't comply with the law .
The current ruling comes after five days of city hall hearings , which began in November 2008 .
This is a significant victory , but the struggle is n't over .
Woodfin plans to challenge the ruling in court , so workers have vowed to continue the struggle until the money is in their hands .
" Our struggle for justice has lasted more than 1,000 days , and it 's already been an inspiration to my children .
I look forward to sharing this hard - earned money with my family when it finally arrives , " said former Woodfin worker Luz D .
This struggle is an inspiration to anyone fighting for justice at work .
Workers and their supporters will keep up the pressure until Woodfin Suites gives workers the wages and respect that they deserve .
Britney Spears Threatens To Cancel Her Circus Tour
It looks likeand ex-husbandare in the middle of a new disagreement about the custodial arrangements for their children , Sean Preston and Jayden James .
TMZ is reporting that Britney 's Circus tour is in jeopardy and that if Kevin wo n't allow the couple 's children to spend some time with their mother while she is on the road , she may scrap the mission entirely .
Informal negotiation were reportedly going on between Britney , Kevin and papa conservator Jamie Spears to hash out a temporary custody arrangement for the duration of her tour .
K - Fed 's legal team got wind of this and put an end to the talks .
The initial plan was for Britney to set up home bases in New Jersey , New Orleans and Los Angeles and she would commute back and forth to be with the boys between shows .
The singer had also agreed to pay K - Fed $ 4,000 a week while she was on tour , presumably to win him over to the plan as well as support his lifestyle for the next few months and provide funds for his own digs in each of the cities .
So now that Kevin 's lawyers are in on the plan they are saying no way .
It is unclear what their objections are but they have clued in K - Fed that he can't be making side deals with his ex .
Britney , who has earned back nearly 50 percent custody of the boys , is adamant that she will cancel the tour if she is not able to be with her boys .
We will let you know what comes of this latest disagreement .
Network Programming in Erlang
Since I 'm learning Erlang I thought my first non-trivial piece of code would be in an area where the language excels : network programming .
Network programming ( or socket programming ) is a pain in the ass in most languages .
I first learned how to do it in C using Beej 's Guide to Network Programming .
Read it if you dare .
The big roadblock for most server applications is concurrency .
Languages like , where concurrency was an afterthought , make developing robust server software more difficult than it has to be .
Even so - called modern languages like Java , Ruby , or Python do n't handle it all that well , although you are relieved from the pain of managing all the minute details of the network connections .
Erlang , on the other hand , was built with this purpose on mind .
I wo n't be writing any user - facing applications in Erlang any time soon , but I thought , " If I 'm going to learn Erlang I may as well learn its strong points first . "
To that end I decided to try to replicate the suite of classic UNIX daemons like echo and chargen .
echo
Echo is a service that spits back whatever data is handed to it over a TCP connection , bit - for - bit .
Here it is in Erlang .
- module ( echo ) .
- author ( ' Jesse E.I. Farmer < jesse@20bits.com >' ) . - export ( [ listen /1 ] ) .
- define ( TCP_OPTIONS , [ binary , {packet , 0} , {active , false} , {reuseaddr , true} ] ) .
% Call echo:listen ( Port ) to start the service .
listen ( Port ) -> {ok , LSocket} = gen_tcp: listen ( Port , ? TCP_OPTIONS ) , accept ( LSocket ) .
%
Wait for incoming connections and spawn the echo loop when we get one .
accept ( LSocket ) -> {ok , Socket} = gen_tcp:accept( LSocket ) , spawn ( fun ( ) -> loop ( Socket ) end ) , accept ( LSocket ) .
% Echo back whatever data we receive on Socket. loop ( Socket ) -> case gen_tcp : recv( Socket , 0 ) of {ok , Data} -> gen_tcp:send ( Socket , Data ) , loop ( Socket ) ; {error , closed} -> ok end .
We can start this service by calling echo: listen ( < port number > ) .
from the Erlang shell , e.g. , echo:listen ( 8888 ) .
will start the echo service on port 8888 of your machine .
You can then telnet to port 8888 — telnet 127.0.0.1 8888 — and see it in action .
Here 's the breakdown of the program , by function .
listen ( Port ) Creates a socket that listens for incoming connections on port Port and passes off control to accept .
accept( LSocket )
Waits for incoming connections on LSocket .
Once it receives a connection it spawns a new process that runs the loop function and then waits for the next connection .
loop ( Socket ) Waits for incoming data on Socket .
Once it receives the data it immediately sends the same data back across the socket .
If there is an error it exits .
There are a few things worth discussing in this example .
Spawning Processes
Processes in Erlang are a basic data type .
They follow the actor model of concurrent computation and make network processes a breeze .
We create new processes using spawn , which takes a Fun , or functional object , as its input .
You can think of them as functions .
Control of the process is handed off to the functional object passed in , like a callback .
Functional Objects
Erlang , being a functional programming language , supports functions as first - class objects via the Fun , or functional object , data type .
Functions can create new functions , return functions , modify functions , and pass functions around .
The syntax to create a new functional object is like this :
MyFunction = fun (... ) -> %
Your Erlang code here end .
CHARGEN
chargen is a service that spews back a stream of characters when you connect to it .
You can read all about it , but it 's not that interesting .
There 's a canonical pattern that it prints out .
Here it is in Erlang .
- module ( chargen ) .
- author ( ' Jesse E.I. Farmer < jesse@20bits.com >' ) . - export ( [ listen /1 ] ) .
- define ( START_CHAR , 33 ) . - define ( END_CHAR , 127 ) . - define ( LINE_LENGTH , 72 ) . - define ( TCP_OPTIONS , [ binary , {packet , 0} , {active , false} , {reuseaddr , true} ] ) .
% Call chargen: listen ( Port ) to start the service .
listen ( Port ) -> {ok , LSocket} = gen_tcp: listen ( Port , ? TCP_OPTIONS ) , accept ( LSocket ) .
%
Wait for incoming connections and spawn the chargen loop when we get one .
accept ( LSocket ) -> {ok , Socket} = gen_tcp:accept( LSocket ) , spawn ( fun ( ) -> loop ( Socket ) end ) , accept ( LSocket ) .
loop ( Socket ) -> loop ( Socket , ? START_CHAR ) .
loop ( Socket , ?END_CHAR ) -> loop ( Socket , ? START_CHAR ) ; loop ( Socket , StartChar ) -> Line = make_line ( StartChar ) , case gen_tcp : send ( Socket , Line ) of {error , _ Reason} -> exit ( normal ) ; ok -> loop ( Socket , StartChar+1 ) end . make_line ( StartChar ) -> make_line ( StartChar , 0 ) . % Generate a new chargen line -- [ 13 , 10 ] is CRLF .
make_line (_ , ?LINE_LENGTH ) -> [ 13 , 10 ] ; make_line (?END_CHAR , Pos ) -> make_line ( ?
START_CHAR , Pos ) ; make_line ( StartChar , Pos ) -> [ StartChar | make_line ( StartChar + 1 , Pos + 1 ) ] .
As with echo we can start this by dropping into the Erlang shell and running chargen : listen ( 8888 ) to start chargen running on port 8888 ( or another port of your choice ) .
accept and listen are identical to the functions in echo , but here are the differences :
loop ( Socket , StartChar ) Calls make_line ( StartChar ) to get the CHARGEN line starting with StartChar , writes it to the socket , and then advances to the next line .
make_line ( StartChar , Pos ) Recursively generates a CHARGEN line , keeping track of the current position in the line with Pos .
There are a few key conceptual differences , too .
Definitions
As in C we can define constants in Erlang with the - define directive .
These are resolved at compile - time .
You can reference the definition by prefixing it with a question mark , ? , so as to differentiate it from a variable .
Function Definition Matching
As with assignment , function calls are done via matching .
When you call a function it looks for the first matching definition .
For example , if we invoke loop ( Socket ) it finds the appropriate definition , viz. , the definition that takes a single argument .
We can fix arguments , too , which is how you deal with loop control in Erlang .
?END_CHAR is 127 , so if we call loop ( Socket , 127 ) it first matches that definition rather than the more general loop ( Socket , StartChar ) definition .
make_line works the same way .
If we 're at the last position in the line we return a carriage return and line feed and stop recursing .
Conclusion
I created these to be legible and easily understood .
Working through them helped me understand a lot about the inner workings of Erlang and hopefully they 'll do the same for you .
A full - on project page will be coming shortly , but for now you can download the package here .
( CNN ) --
An Alaska lottery held to raise money for a group that helps sexual abuse victims had a surprise winner : a convicted sex offender .
Alec Ahsoak in an undated photograph .
Alec Ahsoak , who according to the state sex offender registry was convicted in 1993 and 2000 for sexual abuse of a minor , came forward Saturday with the winning ticket for the $ 500,000 Lucky Time Pull Tabs jackpot .
Proceeds of the lottery help Standing Together Against Rape in Anchorage , a nonprofit group that offers support to sexual assault victims among other services .
" It 's not how we had envisioned the story going , " Nancy Haag , the group 's executive director , told CNN Radio .
Alaska has the highest per capita number of rape cases in the United States , according to FBI statistics .
" With a ranking that high , it 's ironic that the person who wins is a convicted sex offender , " Haag added .
Ahsoak 's past was first revealed by KTUU - TV in Anchorage on Sunday .
His attorney , Lance Wells , did not immediately return a call Monday from CNN .
Efforts to reach lottery organizer Abe Spicola , who owns Lucky Times Pull Tabs , were unsuccessful late Monday .
But Spicola told the Anchorage Daily News that Ahsoak " was going to buy a house and said he was going to donate part of it to God , and , you know , charity . "
CNN 's Samira J. Simone and April Willliams contributed to this report .

DUBLIN PROTEST :THE RECENT upgrading by the EU of a trading agreement with the State of Israel has given its government “ the green light to kill Palestinians ” protesters claimed yesterday .
During a demonstration by 250 people outside the Israeli and US embassies in Dublin , protesters called for the immediate ending of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza , and the ending of the Euro - Mediterranean Agreement between the EU and Israel which aims to promote the integration of the Israeli economy into Europe .
Adnan Shadad of the Ireland Palestinian Solidarity Group called for the suspension of the agreement , which had recently been upgraded and “ for us , that gave the green light to Israel to kill Palestinians ” .
He said the protesters “ are here in solidarity with the victims of the attack ” and to get the international community to “ stop the illegal attacks by Israel ” .
Demonstrators , with placards saying “ Stop the Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine ” and “ End Israeli Terrorism ” , shouted “ shame on you ” outside the two embassies , which are about 500 m apart .
Richard Boyd Barrett of the Irish Anti-War Movement said that Ireland should “ take the lead in Europe and end diplomatic relations with Israel ” .
He said Israel should be boycotted because it is “ akin to apartheid South Africa ” .
Israel , he said “ is deliberately killing men and women ” and the protesters were there to “ reject claims the Palestinians are responsible for this ” .
Palestinians had suffered a blockade for two years .
Malacy Steenson of the Workers ’ Party called on Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin to summon Israel ’s ambassador to his office “ and send him home ” .
This lifestyle is something that can allow you to step away from the ‘ norm ’ in so many ways and one of those way is by being POLY – owning multiple slaves .
Now those outside of this life can quite often think that being poly is just a way of not committing to any one person , being a ‘ player ’ and just adding a different label to it , nothing could be further from the truth !
The pressure on a poly Master is intense , owning multiple slaves is something that involves a lot of work and time , patience and understanding , as I have said many times each slave / sub is different and as such they all need different things , and the way they serve me is different as well , some are house slaves and responsible for my well being and some could be pleasure slaves , their role is in pleasing me , but they could also be expected to move into another part of my life as they progress and grow , there value to me is unique to them , and they are not compared to each other as that is something I do not believe in , no one slave is more important to me than another , they might serve me in different areas but they are still valued as the individual slave they are .
One thing I have noticed is that many poly Doms and Masters like to involve multiple slaves in sexual play occasionally , again in the vanilla life this is every mans dream , two women pleasing a man * or vice versa in the case of Femdom * but this can also be a minefield if not done correctly , always allowing one to be treated to your cock while another looks on is not something I would recommend ever as this will lead to jealousy and issues of self worth , also if a hitherto slave is ‘ straight ’ expecting her to always lick another ’s pussy can lead to problems as well , a bi sexual slave will not mind this but again if that is all she is getting then she will start to wonder and doubt herself , not something a Dom or Master should be trying to install into them .
Being poly is not just having lots of slaves waiting to do your bidding , it is also something that can have adverse effects on people if it is not done with the care and thought that the slaves deserve

Everyone has toys from their childhood that they remember fondly .
I was born in the early 1970s , so most of the toys I feel nostalgia for were popular in the eighties .
It 's surprising ( to me , at least ) how many toys from the eighties are still , or again , popular today , so I wanted to come up with a list of toys and related items that are n't around now , but that I ( on some level ) wish were , so my kids could play with the same things I did .
1. Merlin -
I absolutely loved my Merlin , playing with it regularly for years .
My earliest exposure to the workings of electronic devices came when fixing it the several times the buttons stuck , until it finally broke irreparably .
Considering how crude Merlin seems compared with my son's Nintendo DS , for example , it seems amazing just how much fun they were to play with .
In searching for links for this article , I found out that Hasbro has actually reissued Merlin , with phone - style buttons ... strange , but cool .
2. Stretch Armstrong - I have no idea why they do n't make these any more — probably something to do with safety regulations — because they were a lot of fun .
You really could stretch them an incredibly long way before they broke , and pretty much everybody I knew who had one found out just about exactly how much stretching they could take .
I 've heard of , but have never actually seen , the Incredible Hulk version of the toy they made .
The fluid inside them was basically corn syrup , which makes me wonder how hard it'd be to construct a homemade Stretch Armstrong of your own .
3. Giant Tinkertoys - Sure , regular Tinkertoys were great , but there was a limit to how big you could make something before it collapsed under its own weight ( unless , I suppose , you had lots more Tinkertoys than I or anyone I knew did ) .
Giant Tinkertoys allowed you to make supersized things , including structures you could actually get inside .
The current toy Toobeez is billed as being similar to Giant Tinkertoys ( check out the home page title ) , but does n't look much like the ones I remember .
4. Wacky Wall Walkers -
Yeah , I know there are similar things available today , but none with quite the same appeal as these hugely popular octopus toys .
It was really a ridiculous amount of fun , throwing them at a wall and watching them make their sticky way down it .
Anyone who was over the age of four in the early eighties is bound to remember these , and everyone who was n't is bound to look at you like you 're crazy when you tell them how popular these things were .
5 . He -Man and the Masters of the Universe - Why has nobody tried to resurrect the He - Man cartoons in such a long time ?
Think of how cool Castle Grayskull would be rendered in CGI .
And maybe they could put a few more articles of clothing on He - Man so he is n't quite so ... well , I can't think of a good euphemism for " homoerotic . "
The He - Man cartoons were formulaic , preposterous , and kitschy , but those were all part of their charm .
Battle - Cat / Cringer was always my favorite , even if I could never figure out why he was green .
I mean , seriously , was he a Vulcan cat or what ?
6. Underoos -
They were n't toys , of course , but they were such an important part of eighties geekiness that I have to mention them .
What geeklet did n't have , or at least covet , Darth Vader or Superman or Wonder Woman or Ms .
Pac -Man Underoos ?
It never really occurred to most of us , I think , that displaying the characters we loved on our underwear was a bit silly , probably because they were just so awesome .
7. Coleco
Tabletop Games -
Most people remember Coleco for Cabbage Patch Kids or for ColecoVision , the last gasp of early gaming consoles before PCs took over the videogame market for a while .
But the tabletop games were awesome , self - contained games you could put on a table and pretend you were in an arcade — at least , until your parents told you to turn it off and do your homework .
8. Trapper Keepers
- I think these are still around in some form , but if you grew up in the eighties in the U.S. you must remember their heyday .
Everyone had to have a Trapper Keeper , and in some way your coolness or geekiness was defined by what was on ( and in ) yours .
I only vaguely recall my various ones
( you had to get a new one every year , of course ) , but I think I had a Star Wars one at some point , or possibly a generic one that I simply covered with Star Wars stickers .
9. Voltron - I caught an episode of Voltron a few months ago , and I can't quite see why I ever thought it was anything but cheesy .
But I did , and so did all of my friends .
We had to watch every episode , of both the series with the five lions and the series with all the little ships .
We bought the toys , which took way too long to make it to the U.S. from Japan , and we pretended we were in the show .
Come to think of it , I do remember making fun of the fact that the plot was always the same in every episode , and that they always stopped moving whenever they spoke .
10 . Shrinky Dinks
- I realize these are still around , but I have n't seen them in a store in well over a decade , so I 'm including them .
I thought these were just the most awesome thing , and still think it 's kind of a cool idea .
As a parent , I wonder about whether it 's such a good idea to deliberately put plastic in your oven , but how neat is it to draw on a large piece of plastic and then get it back much smaller , thus making any mistakes you made that much less significant ?
If you have any ideas , and I 'm sure you do ( since I had to leave out a lot ) , please share them in the comments .

President Clinton is scheduled to give a paid speech this Sunday at the Manchester Hyatt in San Diego to the annual convention of the International Franchise Association .
Doing so will violate a union boycott and labor dispute -- the workers at the hotel lack job security and the housekeepers face onerous workloads .
But that 's not all .
President Clinton will also be offending supporters of marriage equality .
Doug Manchester , the owner of the hotel , contributed $ 125,000 in early seed money to the Proposition 8 campaign .
We can't let this happen .
President Clinton has the power to move his speech away from the Manchester Hyatt .
And you have the power to convince him before it 's too late .
Please sign this petition to President Clinton immediately and the Courage Campaign and UNITE HERE will do everything in our power to get your signatures to him ASAP :

For those who wondered why a seemingly intelligent person like Blair was so close to Bush , here it is .
The man who helped launch a war that opened up religious strife in one of the most tense areas in the world is back to lecture us on the need for more religion .
Great .
After the last eight years of religion being shoved down our throats , this is the last thing I want to hear from a Western political leader .
The upside is he ’s out of power so there ’s only so there are limits to how much time he gets in the news .
Go pray for someone else and keep me out of it .
Keep your damned religion out of my government while you ’re at it .
Tony Blair gave an extraordinary speech about the global importance of religion yesterday , telling an audience which included the newly - inaugurated President , Barack Obama , that faith should be restored “ to its rightful place , as the guide to our world and its future . ”
The former prime minister also said he believed the 21st century would be “ poorer in spirit ” and “ meaner in ambition ” if it was not “ under the guardianship of faith in God . ”
He had been invited by President Obama to lead the prestigious US National Prayer Breakfast , a spectacular event in the ballroom of the Washington Hilton Hotel .
Mr Blair also managed to rain on Gordon Brown ’s parade , meeting the President before any European leader .
He dashed ahead of the Prime Minister and other political heavyweights , including Angela Merkel , Nicolas Sarkozy and Vladimir Putin , to lay on the hands and tell the President : “ It is fitting at this extraordinary moment in your country ’s history that we hear that call to action ; and we pray that in acting we do God ’s work and follow God ’s will . ”

PC 's remain the favourite way to play games says report
The personal computer is king in the world of games , according to a new report by the PC Gaming Alliance .
On the opening day of the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco , the Alliance said the industry made about $ 11 billion world wide last year .
PCGA president Randy Stude said these figures underline the PC as the " Number 1 platform for gaming world wide " .
" Despite Xbox LIVE and PlayStation , the online platform that remains the most accessible and robust is the PC . "
According to research company IDC , there are over 1 billion personal computers world wide .
The PCGA maintains that 250 million are being used for gaming .
The report also revealed that three of the biggest trends for last year were the growth of digital distribution , the rise of free games with a micro transaction model , and the increased presence of game cards at major retailers such as 7 - Eleven " The biggest story in PC games is the expansion beyond retail , " said Mr Stude .
" PC games have successfully pioneered online subscription and distribution models that have resulted in a global boom that shows no signs of slowing . "
In 2008 , Americans spent more than $ 21 billion on video game hardware , software and accessories , up from $ 18 billion in 2007 , according to market researcher NPD Group .
And sales continued to rise in January and February of this year .
Thriving and hiring Such figures come as a welcome boost for GDC as the recession casts a shadow over the event , the biggest of its kind in the world .
Even though organisers are expecting attendance to be down slightly from last year 's 18,000 people , GDC event director Meggan Scavio told BBC
News the economic downturn is not deterring people from coming .
Gaming is showing strong sales despite an economy heading south " It 's true that maybe some of the bigger players , publishers and studios can't send as many people as in the past but at the same time I have found that people are finding their own way to come to GDC .
" They are sharing hotel rooms , they are car pooling , they are probably sharing passes and they come for the entire week . "
Ms Scavio also pointed out that even though companies like Electronic Arts , THQ , Lucas Arts and Sega have had to make jobs cuts over the last few months , it is not all doom and gloom within the industry .
" We have a career pavilion here with 50 booths .
There are studios that are hiring , companies are hiring .
People like Nintendo and Blizzard are still thriving and people are forming their own independent studios and are looking to take people on . "
That is welcome news for Jeff Ball who is a musician and attending GDC for the first time with the aim of making contacts and getting work .
" I 've just graduated and I 'm trying to network and meet as many people as I can because that 's how you get into the industry and coming here is thee place to do that . "
Mr Ball is not alone in looking for business opportunities .
Pierre Langer of Dynamedion , Europe 's biggest audio studio for video games , has attended GDC for the last five years .
He told BBC News that this year he has changed his strategy for drumming up business .
" Over the last few years I just hung out and met people in a casual way .
This year it 's different and I am doing a lot of meetings .
I have 40 meetings in the next 4 days , " said Mr Langer .
" Year of opportunity " While the conference does not really get underway until Wednesday with the opening of the Expo , many attending the first day viewed the economic health of the industry in a positive light .
" I think people are optimistic , " said Marti Miernik of PR Sirens who is here promoting a game called Space Trader Wars for HermitWorks Entertainment .
GDC attendance is expected to be down this year " I think some of the shaking out of the economy has already happened and it's time to move forward .
In the last week the market turned from under 6,000 to 7,500 so things are shifting and people are looking much more positively at what 's going on , " said Ms Miernik who has attended GDC for the last five years running .
Meanwhile first timer Andy Park of AOS Inc said he believes the recession is actually good news for the gaming industry .
" I do n't know that the climate is affecting games too much .
If anything I would think the games industry maybe ought to see a little kick because of this .
" People are n't buying stuff so much but the idea of going to the movies or buying a new game which you can use again and again and again probably still holds water , " Mr Park told the BBC .
Ms Scavio said that while the industry is far from recession proof , this is undoubtedly a time for people to be creative .
" I like to call this the year of opportunity but the other message this year at GDC is that this community is resilient , creative and young and will definitely find its way out of this crisis .
" Throughout the week you will see deals going on in every corner of the building and pitches being made at every turn , " asserted Ms Scavio .

BALTANAS , Spain — Lance Armstrong says he ’ll have surgery after breaking his collarbone today during a race in Spain .
“ I ’m alive ! ” the seven - time Tour de France champion wrote on his Twitter feed .
“ Broken clavicle ( right ) .
Hurts like hell for now .
Surgery in a couple of days .
Thanks for all the well wishes . ”
The 37 - year - old American cyclist was knocked off his bike during a pileup in the first stage of the Vuelta of Castilla and Leon race .
The injury has jeopardized his participation in upcoming races .
Armstrong was scheduled to compete in the Giro d’Italia from May 9 - May 31 and the Tour from July 4 - 26 .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
In a dramatic break with the Bush administration , the Justice Department on Friday announced it is doing away with the designation of " enemy combatant , " which allowed the United States to hold suspected terrorists at length without criminal charges .
Officials will no longer use the designation of " enemy combatant , " the Justice Department said .
In a court filing in Washington , the department said it is developing a new standard for the government 's authority to hold detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba .
The announcement says the Justice Department will no longer rely on the president 's authority as commander in chief , but on authority specifically granted by Congress .
And the government document says that individuals who support al Qaeda or the Taliban are detainable only if the support was " substantial . "
The category of " enemy combatant " had been an important aspect of the Bush administration 's legal construct for dealing with terrorism suspects .
The government describes its new policy position in a memo submitted to the U.S. District Court in Washington , D.C. , in a case dealing with Guantanamo Bay detainee litigation that began during the Bush administration .
Watch CNN 's Jeanne Meserve explain the reversal »
In the document , the Obama administration provides a more limited definition of who may be held at Guantanamo Bay :
" The president has the authority to detain persons that the president determines planned , authorized , committed , or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 , and persons who harbored those responsible for those attacks , " the document says .
" The president also has the authority to detain persons who were part of , or substantially supported Taliban or al - Qaida forces or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners , including any person who has committed a belligerent act , or has directly supported hostilities , in aid of such enemy armed forces . "
The Justice Department did not say how many of the approximately 240 detainees now at Guantanamo may fall within the new definition .
The new construct clearly allows for the continued detention of admitted 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and a handful of his acknowledged al Qaeda operatives .
The government says that it is developing a comprehensive detention policy and that the new definition applies only to prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and not at other military prison facilities .
" This position is limited to the authority upon which the government is relying to detain the persons now being held at Guantanamo Bay .
It is not , at this point , meant to define the contours of authority for military operations generally , or detention in other contexts , " the government said .
Attorney General Eric
Holder is overseeing the administration 's review of what to do with each of the Guantanamo prisoners .
In the court document submitted by his lawyers , it is clear that the prosecutors will consider each case on its particular merits .
" It is neither possible nor advisable to attempt to identify in the abstract the precise nature and degree of ' substantial support , ' or the precise characteristics of ' associated forces , ' " according to the document .
The government said it will need to apply the new definition and the concrete facts in individual cases .
In a 12 - page explanation of its position , the government memo says the the Justice Department will look to the congressionally passed Authorization for the Use of Military Force and to international treaties , including the Geneva Conventions , to make decisions about holding prisoners .
But the government also said that because those treaties were developed for conflicts between the armed forces of nation states , new rules will have to be developed to fit al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners who were previously designated as " enemy combatants . "

If you join the Android developer program , Google will sell you an unlocked Android phone that works on any mobile network .
But it can't download paid applications from Google 's very own app market .
The Android Market began offering price - tagged applications late last week - at least in the US - but developers wielding unlocked Googlephones soon discovered they could n't download them , IDG News Service reports .
As it turns out , Google has prevented these developer phones from downloading any application that 's copy protected , including paid apps .
Anyone who forks over $ 25 to join the official Android developer program can then purchase an unlocked version of the T - Mobile G1 , the inaugural Googlephone .
Price : $ 400 .
These phones give developers unfettered access to their hardware and software , and judging from a brief statement from Google , they can somehow circumvent the company 's copy protection .
" Copy protection is a tool that provides basic protection to application developers and prevents casual user - to - user pirating of applications , " reads a canned statement Google tossed our way .
" The Developer version of the G1 is designed to give developers complete flexibility .
These phones give developers of handset software full permissions to all aspects of the device , including the ability to install a modified version of the Android Open Source Project .
We are n't distributing copy protected applications to these phones in order to minimize unauthorized copy of the applications . "
According to one blogging Android developer , Google copy protects apps simply by downloading them to a restricted folder .
But on unlocked phones , he says , the folder is n't protected .
In theory , once a paid app is downloaded , a developer could make a copy and return the original for a refund .
The Android Market allows refunds within 24 hours of purchase .
So , Google has banned downloads of copy - protected apps on developer phones .
The result : Many developers are prevented from downloading their own applications . ®
WinterGreen Research , Inc. has published a study purporting that 32.7 million electric vehicles will be on the roads in six years .
While we could n't check the math ( the study costs $ 3,400 to purchase and our own math prevents us from spending that much ) , that sounds like a lot of electric vehicle purchases in a short amount of time , considering that only 685 EVs were bought in 2008 .
Nevertheless , more EV buyers might mean more visitors to AllCarsElectric.com and we 're all for that .
The study , entitled Worldwide Nanotechnology Electric Vehicle ( EV ) Market Shares Strategies , and Forecasts , 2009 to 2015 cites growing demand for a renewable energy powered vehicle that substantially lowers the total cost of ownership .
According to Susan Eustis , lead author of the study , “ Economies of scale leverage the lithium - ion battery nanotechnology advances needed to make lithium - ion batteries competitive .
Nanotechnology provided by lithium - ion research solves the issues poised by the need to store renewable energy .
Lithium -ion batteries switch price reductions are poised to drive market adoption by making units affordable . "
The nanotechnology advances she 's referring to involve thin film lithium - ion batteries which have very high cycle life without losing much capacity .
This is critical for an electric vehicle battery that would have to be charged daily for many years without experiencing " memory loss .
" Availability of a highway legal EV at a middle class price would certainly help validate this study 's prediction .
( Note : the vehicle pictured above is not currently available at a middle class price . )

Let 's look at this situation objectively .
1stly let 's look at the surrounding area , are there any Close Circuit Televisions ( CCTV ) that are visible ?
If the answer is yes , then are those CCTV looking in the direction that this event occurred ?
If you have answered yes again , then you 've struck gold .
Contact the CCTV company requesting a video relating to the time and day that this event took place .
on recieving the footage , multiple viewings by yourself and your wife will definately bring a smile to her face .
invite along neighbours to laugh at how your baby rolled down your car and landed without any problems .
An advantage to this is your baby will probably have a future in the ' Stunt Person ' career within Films .
Here they will meat such greats as Jackie Chan , Van Damme and if they are lucky Steven Segal .
Another added bonus is you can also send in the video to Televisions ' You 've been Framed ' or any shows that showcase hilarious videos paying £ 250 or $ 500 for the privelege .
Warning however , you might get the child services paying a visit .
If you do recieve a visit from Child services , lock your baby in a cupboard wrapped in a towel until they leave .
P.S. : When your child grows up and learns the skill of language .
This would then be a good time to show your child ( hopefully they do n't have brain damage by this time from multiple droppings ) the CCTV video .
Ask them the question " Do you find this funny ? "
If your child watches the video and laughs then you have proven to your Wife that there was never a problem , because the child actually enjoyed the situation .

Once in a Blue Moon :
A neat description of " not very often , " it refers to the second full moon within a month - a rare thing indeed .
Full moons happen about every 29.5 days , and since a typical month runs between 30 to 31 days , the likelihood of two in a month is slim .
But over the course of a century there 'll be 41 months with two full moons , so once in a blue moon really means - if you want to get literal - once every 2.4 years .
Mad as a Hatter : Today we know enough to keep clear of mercury , but hat makers once used it to make the brims of hats .
When absorbed through the skin , it could wreak havoc on the nervous system : tremors , fatigue , not to mention behavioral dysfunction - that is , crazy behavior .
Just think of Lewis Carroll 's Mad Hatter from Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland .
Raining Cats and Dogs :
In 1600s England it was common practice to discard any waste into the streets - even dead household pets .
Once it rained so much that the now - deceased Tabbies and Fidos became buoyant and floated along the streets , thus inspiring writer Richard Brome in 1651 to record , " it shall rain dogs and polecats . "
Saved by the Bell : Before modern medicine , it was hard to determine if a person was really dead or simply in a really , really deep sleep .
As a precaution , the presumed dead were buried with a string that ran from the corpse 's finger to a bell .
If there was a mistake , the person could twitch the finger and thus be saved from being buried alive .
The Acid Test : Gold Rush miners tested possible gold nuggets in acid .
Unlike other metals , gold wo n't corrode in acid , so if the nugget did n't dissolve it passed the acid test and therefore must be pure gold .
If a person passes a figurative acid test , they 're telling the truth , as opposed to the literal acid test , which would be quite painful , not to mention corrosive .
In the Limelight : Theater stages used to be illuminated by heating lime ( calcium oxide ) until it glowed brightly .
Lime has a high melting point , and when heated , gives off a brilliant white light .
The light was then focused into a spotlight , so if an actor was in the limelight , he was certainly the center of attention ( and probably very hot as well . )
Dog Days :
The ancient Romans noticed that the Dog Star , Sirius , rose at the same time as the sun on the hottest days of the year , so they made the natural assumption that Sirius in the sky added to the heat of the day .
Today it 's generally accepted that the " dog days " of summer are July 3 through August 11 .
But they have nothing to do with Sirius .
Chew the Cud :
If you figuratively chew the cud , you 're chatting with an acquaintance .
If you literally chew the cud , you 're regurgitating food from your stomach to be chewed a second time ( do n't even try it ) .
Cows are ruminants - this means that to properly digest grass to pass through their four - chambered stomachs , they need to rechew it .
Consequently , a cow 's mouth seems to go nonstop , just like a person who is " chewing the cud . "
Do n't Look a Gift Horse in the Mouth :
In other words , do n't be ungrateful when someone gives you something .
You can tell a horse 's age by looking at its teeth , particularly the incisors , but if someone gave you a horse as a gift , it would be considered rude to examine its teeth .
( This would be like looking for the price tag on the present . )
The Bee's Knees :
It 's 1920s slang for something wonderful - but why would the knees of the Apis mellifera , the common honeybee , be something to be excited bout ?
Well , when bees find pollen they carry it back to the hive on pollen baskets located on their hind legs near their knees ( yes , bees have knees . )
The pollen is then used to make honey .
Cold Turkey :
To completely abandon an addictive habit is to go cold turkey .
As a result , the habit - kicker may experience cold sweats and goose bumps as blood rushes from the surface of the skin to internal organs .
That bristling gooseflesh looks like the skin of a plucked goose ( which looks quite similar to a plucked turkey ) .
And does n't it sound better to go cold turkey than to go cold goose ?
President - elect Barack Obama is expected to round out his economic team next week with the selection of Cecilia Rouse , a Princeton University labor economist well - known for her work on the economics of educational investments , according to an Obama economic transition aide .
Ms. Rouse will join Christina Romer and Austan Goolsbee as the third member of the Council of Economic Advisers , which advises the President on economic policy .
All three are academic economists with distinct specialties : Ms. Romer is an economic historian ...

The British public is set to come under even closer scrutiny during 2012 from an advanced CCTV system specially designed for the London Olympics .
The DYVINE system would allow police to tap - in to every CCTV network in London via a central police control room , and plot the information on a detailed 3D map .
" We are already the most watched society in the world and yet ministers want more snooping powers , " said Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne of reports that development of an advanced monitoring system is already underway .
A fifth of the world 's cameras are now pointed at UK citizens , a situation Mr Huhne blames on the " unchecked " growth of CCTV in Britain .
" These plans should not be implemented without significant public debate and legislation outlining clear safeguards , " he added .
Human rights group Liberty echoed Mr Huhne 's call for a debate over the issue , and warned that under current law such a system would be illegal .
" Effectively somebody can be monitored 24 - hours - a - day as they go about their business , so this is a fundamental shift in what CCTV can do " said spokesperson Isabella Sankey .
The draft security strategy for the games will be presented to ministers next month .
Responsibility for planning security at the Olympics will then be passed from the Home Office to the Office of Security and Counter Terrorism .
Is this woman really as old as the LIGHT BULB ?
' Oldest person in the world ' set to celebrate her 130th birthday
Officials in Kazakhstan say they have a found a woman who will this week celebrate her 130th birthday , making her 16 years older than the oldest known human currently living .
Sakhan Dosova - a mother of ten - says she has never visited a doctor nor eaten sweets .
She is addicted to cottage cheese and puts her longevity down to her sense of humour .
Her remarkable age came to light during a census in Karaganda in northern Kazakhstan .
Demographers were astonished to find that she was also on Stalin 's first census of the region in 1926 when her age was given as 47 .
Ten years old when Hitler was born : Sakhan Dosova , who apparently turned 130 on March 27 , in a recent picture
Her date of birth is said to be 27 March 1879 , and it is clearly shown on her documents including her Soviet era passport and independent Kazakhstan identity card .
Until the recent census , however , her fame did not extend beyond her far - flung city .
While some Kazakh officials are pressing for more detailed checks on her claim , fearing the country could face ridicule if it is shown to be false , she has no doubts and is basking in her new found fame .
' I do n't have any special secret , ' she said .
' I 've never taken pills and if I was ill , I used granny 's remedies to cure me .
' I have never eaten sweets , I do n't like them .
But I love kurt ( a salty dried cottage cheese ) and talkan ( ground wheat ) . '
Gaukhar Kanieva , 42 , her grand - daughter , said : ' She is a very cheerful woman .
We think laughter and her good mood helped her live so long . '
Proof ? :
Note the birth date on her Kazakh identity card - March 27 , 1879
Nailya Dosayeva , head of social and demographical department of Karaganga regional statistics bureau , said there is no doubt that her claim is authentic .
' Sakhan Dosova was found during our census held in February and March .
She has an old passport and documents which are genuine , and based on these we can judge her age as being correct . '
The local mayor Islam Togaybayev went to visit her ' to personally congratulate her on such an achievement and show his respect ' , said his spokesman .
If Sakhan 's year of birth is accurate , it means she was born when Queen Victoria still had 22 more years to rule in Britain and Disraeli was prime minister .
It was the year that Stalin and Einstein were born , the Anglo - Zulu war started , and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle published his first story .
The year 1879 also saw Edison present his new invention - the light bulb - while the ill - fated last tsar of Russia was just 11 years old .
Sakhan 's passport photo from 1979
She was ten when Hitler was born , 38 when Lenin led the Russian Revolution , and reached retirement age , 60 , the year the Second World War began .
The old woman lives in poor conditions in an overcrowded flat with one of her granddaughters , though she is said to be in good health apart from some problems with her hearing .
According to one account of her life , twice - married Sarkan was widowed at the Battle of Stalingrad during the Second World War .
Only three of her children remain alive .
Officially , the oldest living person in the world is American Edna Parker of the US at 114 .
Some Kazakh bureaucrats want more checks to be done to ascertain the accuracy of her claim , pointing out that birth records in Kazakhstan in the 19th century are notoriously unreliable .
' We can see that this is turning into a big story and for the sake of our country , we need to be sure her claim is correct , ' said one official .
According to one version of her life , she must have given birth to several children over the age of 60 , he said .
' There is no doubt she is very old .
But is she really 130 ?
Or was there a white lie long ago which was never corrected ?
We need to find out . '
The central Asian state is only now recovering from damage to its reputation caused by Sacha Baron Cohen 's film Borat : Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan .
Senior state statistician Lyudmila Kolesova said : ' We 're checking the authenticity of the data on her case . '
Other historical events which took place in 1879 include :
On January 11 , The Anglo - Zulu War begins ;
On May 26 , Russia and the United Kingdom sign the Treaty of Gandamak , establishing an Afghan state ;
On March 13 ; The Duke of Connaught and Strathearn , third son of Queen Victoria , marries Princess Louise Marguerite of Prussia . ;
On October 7 , Germany and Austria - Hungary create the The Dual Alliance ;
The Pirates of Penzance is first performed in Paignton , Devon , England on December 30
German - born physicist Albert Einstein is born on March 14 and Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky is born on November 7 , followed by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin on December 18 .

Mrs. Obama told them she always worked really hard and that they should , too .
" I wanted an A ... I wanted to be smart , I wanted to be the person who had the right answer , " said Mrs. Obama , a lawyer and former hospital executive in Chicago .
" I ran into people in my life who told me , ' You ca n't do it , you 're not as smart as that person . '
And that never stopped me .
That always made me push harder , because I was like , ' I 'm going to prove you wrong . ' "
She encouraged the students to pursue a college education because of the doors it will open .
There 's no need for them to know what they want to be before they get to college , she said , emphasizing that the goal is simply to get there and that it begins with hard work .
Some of the students have already been accepted to college .
" College is being able to get up and discipline yourself and get help when you need it and to work hard and not give up , " Mrs. Obama said .
" Those are like basic concepts that carry you through life . "
It 's what she 's trying to teach Malia and Sasha , she said .

Michelle Obama is a lot of things , mother , daughter , wife , lawyer , First Lady of the United States of America -- but she is NOT trash .
To even have the audacity and LACK of class to come out and say that she is trash in front of a large audience with such malice and ignorance says a hell of a lot more about YOU than it does about Michelle .
I thought we 'd gotten past the point where ignorant people who may not like her husband 's policies , or the fact that he is currently our President would attack Michelle for no reason .
Here is a diary I wrote in June 2008 about Michelle and how awesome she is , as I 'm sure most of you know , I do n't like it when people mess with Michelle , especially when it comes out of nowhere and is completely unwarranted .
I understand it 's all about being " controversial " on the Right , and the more offensive you can be the better , I guess I should n't expect any less from them .
So yeah , stay classy GOP .
This week 's hot topic is the reported collaboration between the RIAA , MPAA and your ISP .
The aim of the music and movie industries is to reduce and deter illicit file - sharing by sending out warnings to alleged infringers .
The big questions is this :
How would you react if you received one of these warnings ?
Last week we ran a poll asking why our readers use BitTorrent .
We were really impressed with the feedback with more than 14,000 readers taking the time to vote .
Following on from this success , this Sunday we ’re asking you guys a new question .
This week the press has been buzzing with the ‘ news ’ that the music and movie industries will be working with ISPs to send out infringement notices to alleged copyright infringers .
Of course , this has been going on for years already but the indications are that the tracking of file - sharers will intensify and with this will come an increase in warnings .
These warnings are designed to frighten people away from file - sharing networks but the million dollar question is :
Will these scare - mails work ?
Let ’s find out .
How would you respond to an RIAA / MPAA copyright infringement warning ?

While the global economic crisis is causing companies worldwide to tear up business plans and scale back growth , in the Middle East the relative declines in the media sector have been less severe and certainly the potential for growth is still very apparent .
A big factor in the growing media consumption in the Arab world is that young people – who are big consumers of media – make up a large proportion of the region 's population .
More than half of the people in Yemen , Oman , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , Jordan , Morocco and Egypt are estimated to be less than 25 years old , according to the Arab Media Outlook 2008 - 2012 produced by the UK consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers .
Meanwhile , traditional media here is also better - placed to weather the current slump in ad spend because of strong newspaper - reading traditions in many countries and also because many of the countries in the region – with some notable exceptions like Bahrain , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) – have less than 10 % of their homes connected to broadband .
Although growth forecasts in the region have been scaled back because of the global economic downturn , this area of the world is still set to see growing media consumption over the next five to 10 years , driven by demographics , new technologies and a gradual easing of some of the traditional restrictions on media .
Landmarks of media content expansion are already being set such as the success of the Qatar - based Al - Jazeera news channel in becoming a global brand and the first public screening of a movie for more than 30 years in Saudi Arabia last December .
What is becoming clear is that producing content to satisfy a growing appetite for media – and Arab media in particular – holds big potential .
Building up local media businesses and infrastructure is also seen as a way to diversify economies that have traditionally been resource - dependent .
Dubai , one of the seven Emirates that make up the UAE , began offering studios and office space to international media companies nearly 10 years ago as part of a bigger move to diversify its economic base .
Dubai Media
City has attracted many large foreign companies , from Viacom 's MTV and Nickelodeon to Time Warner 's CNN , to set up local channels and bureaux in Dubai .
More recently , the biggest and the richest of the Emirate countries , Abu Dhabi , has taken the next step and decided that attracting the expertise needed to create Arab media is a good way to both diversify its economy and help take local culture and traditions into the mass communications age .
Potential growth
" The region wants to be more than just buildings and a place for people to be , " says Tony Orsten , chief executive officer of twofour 54 , a new venture funded by the Abu Dhabi government that is building a " creative hub " for media training and production .
( The name twofour 54 refers to the map coordinates of Abu Dhabi . )
" The crown Prince of Abu Dhabi , Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan , has a cultural vision that includes not just building TV studios , which is part of what we are doing here at twofour 54 , " says Orsten .
Saadiyat Island , off the coast of Abu Dhabi is set to become the cultural centre of the Emirate , featuring the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi Museum , the Louvre Abu Dhabi , the Sheikh Zayed National museum and the Performing Arts Centre .
" The idea is if you bring the best of the world 's culture , then everything else just bubbles up to that same level , " says Orsten .
Twofour54 is part of a larger plan to diversify Abu Dhabi 's economy away from oil by 2030 , but it is also about setting a standard and an example of how media should be developed to make it more professional and also more exportable .
" It is about making the Middle East a cultural force on the world stage , " says Orsten , a former executive at Paramount Pictures who came to Abu Dhabi to set up and run twofour 54 in December 2007 .
By 2014 , a rumoured $ 3bn will have been spent by twofour 54 on building studios , offices and training facilities as well as providing incubation funds for local media professionals and foreign media companies wanting to create locally - targeted content .
" Content for TV in this part of the world is made on very low budgets and the focus tends to be for programming around Ramadan only , " says Orsten .
" We want to help enrich the whole process so that there are two to three dozen production companies working here in the next two to three years . "
The twofour 54 project has attracted the attention of western media giants from the BBC to HarperCollins and CNN but backing has also come from of one of the biggest Arab media companies , Rotana Studios , the film and TV production company owned by Saudi billionaire and media enthusiast Prince Waleed bin Talal .
It was Prince Waleed who got the necessary local permissions to screen Rotana 's film , Manahi , in Saudi Arabia late last year .
The screenings lifted a ban on cinemas by ultraconservative Wahhabi clerics set in the 1970s .
Whereas Saudi Arabia is one of the most traditional societies in the Middle East , the UAE is one of the most open .
Dr Amina al - Rustamani , a woman , is the executive director for media at Tecom Investments , which owns Dubai Media City .
And twofour 54 is keen to offer training to both men and woman from the region .
" The best thing about the UAE is they back women , " says Nashwa Al Ruwaini , a Egyptian producer who works across the Middle East .
" If you are a woman and you want to do something , the Emirates is the place to be . "
Rotana has signed a partnership deal with twofour 54 that will see it produce programming in Abu Dhabi .
" There is no country without culture and there is no modern country without content , " says Frederic Sichler , president of Rotana Studios who believes that professionalising Arabic content production is key to unlocking the region 's creative force .
" We thought that twinning the idea of training and funding was a good approach , so we became part of twofour 54 . "
Sichler joined Rotana 15 months ago from Paris where he ran Vivendi's film production unit , StudioCanal .
Rotana will develop and co-produce Arabic TV programming with twofour 54 , with a focus on TV movie production , which shows great potential , says Sichler .
Natural understanding
Sichler is also keen to see local women become more involved in media .
" Women have a natural understanding of what people want to see .
They already have key positions in the media world here .
Prince Waleed himself is particularly keen on helping women progress to the highest levels possible .
At Rotana , the heads of Rotana Cinema Channel , human resources and corporate marketing are all women . "
When asked about the restrictions on media in some parts of the Middle East Sichler says : " I think that real talent has always found a way to express itself and all of the history of art has proved that .
I am here not to say what I want but to help the local people do what they want to do and to do it professionally and successfully .
I am on a mission to help people but not to tell them how to express themselves . "
SANTA ANA , Calif . ( AP )  Border Patrol agents working about 100 miles north of the Mexican border say they have been given arrest quotas at odds with agency practices and threatened with punishment if they failed to meet the number .
Agents stationed in Riverside reported being ordered to make at least 150 arrests of suspected illegal immigrants in January , two of which must lead to prosecutions , said Lombardo Amaya , president of Local 2554 of the National Border Patrol Council .
“ They were told if you do n’t produce this , we will have to change your weekends off , ” Mr. Amaya said , adding that he would discuss the matter Monday with the sector chief .
“ Sometimes , like in politics , this agency is about looking good . ”
An agency spokesman in Washington , Lloyd Easterling , said quotas ran counter to agency practice , which does not set a minimum number of arrests .
A new wave of mergers is likely to sweep through the oil industry as cash - rich companies such as ExxonMobil eye up smaller rivals - possibly even Shell - after the collapse in the price of crude .
Analysts think many firms have made themselves vulnerable to takeover because they took on major new commitments when the oil price was rattling up to its summer high of $ 147 a barrel , compared with the current level of under $ 40 .
Oil companies enjoyed record earnings over the last couple of years and have in some cases been spending billions of pounds rewarding investors through share buybacks .
Service companies such as Schlumberger and Halliburton have also seen profits soar as steadily increasing crude prices led to a drilling boom that enabled them to charge much higher prices for providing rigs , well work and personnel .
Until last year there were huge shortages of equipment , and massive inflation , in the industry .
But now that situation is changing fast .
" In my 30 - year career I have never seen before so many in the industry - even the most conservative companies - believe so hard in the fairytale of unjustifiably high crude prices , " says Fadel Gheit , analyst with Oppenheimer & Co in New York .
" We saw a range of mega - mergers in 1998 when the price collapsed to $ 9 , including BP taking over Amoco , Exxon acquiring Mobil , and Chevron buying Texaco , and I would not rule out a similar outcome this year . "
Gheit , who told US Senate committee hearings in 2008 that the high crude price was unwarranted by supply and demand fundamentals and would not last , says Exxon is likely to be the lead predator in a new wave of consolidation because it has $ 40bn of free cash and a pile of highly valued Treasury bonds .
" Every oil company is a potential takeover target for Exxon , " says the Oppenheimer analyst , who believes an acquisition of Shell might be desirable for the world 's biggest quoted oil company , but unlikely to happen because of competition concerns .
Shell has privately let it be known that it sees itself as a buyer in any future shake - up , having accepted that it let BP steal a march on it last time when its rival , then led by Lord Browne , bought Amoco , Arco and Burmah Castrol in quick succession .
Under new chief executive Tony Hayward , BP is also unlikely to sit on the sidelines - but even Shell and BP together are now less than half the size of Exxon .
Much depends on the future direction of crude prices , which have been plunging on the back of scares about a collapse in demand triggered by a global economic slowdown .
The oil producers ' cartel Opec has been busy cutting back its output in a bid to put a floor under future falls , so far to little avail , although some analysts , such as Barclays Capital , still expect a $ 76 oil price in 2009 .
Goldman Sachs , on the other hand , believes it could sink to $ 30 this quarter .
The damage being done to the oil sector will become visible at the start of February when BP will report a $ 6bn slump in pre-tax profits between the third and final quarter .
Chevron is expected to show a more than 40 % decline in earnings over that period .
This squeeze is likely to trigger a scaling - back in capital expenditure for the next 12 months , particularly for projects such as tar sands exploitation in Canada , which needs crude to cost more than $ 70 a barrel to be truly profitable .
Firms in the North Sea can survive at prices of $ 45 , but if prices remain around $ 50 this year - as most on Wall Street expect - no new investment is likely into developing new British fields .
The most vulnerable companies to takeover are the smaller independent exploration and production firms .
Oilexco North Sea , which has been one of the most active drillers off the UK , has called in the administrator , saying that its lenders , led by Royal Bank of Scotland , were not prepared to underwrite the future development of new fields .
Schlumberger , the world 's largest oil services group , has already outlined plans to axe 1,000 staff , and rival Halliburton has said it is also likely to make an unspecified number of redundancies .
" We have been consistent in our view that our results would be affected in the event of a severe global economic downturn , " says Schlumberger chief executive Andrew Gould .
Critics are surprised at the speed with which some companies have become distressed given recent records highs for oil , but industry insiders say companies expect to fund new developments with a mixture of their own , now declining , cashflow and bank borrowings , which are hard to obtain in a world where no one knows what lies ahead .
Meanwhile , bidding for a joint project between Saudi Aramco and ConocoPhillips to build a 400,000 - barrels - a- day refinery in the Saudi port of Yanbu has been delayed .

Blood test time approaches for American liberals .
Obama 's decision to accelerate the war in Afghanistan should force his fans to reexamine their allegiance , yet something tells me that ain't gonna happen anytime soon .
Not being registered Democrats , Afghan civilians can't compete with liberal concerns , like how Republicans are n't true patriots , always seeking to blackmail or intimidate Dems into acting against their moral beliefs .
Or how Sarah Palin 's still crazy .
Or how the corporate media hates Democrats .
You know , the pressing issues .
A recent UN survey reports that violence in Afghanistan is surging , the civilian death rate up some 40 percent from last year .
The Taliban is blamed for 60 percent of the carnage , but the US has n't been slacking either , killing more than its share of civilians through airstrikes and raids on villages .
Obama plans to add to the body count with no end in sight .
What is the final purpose here ?
Kill kill kill until the Taliban and other armed groups surrender ?
Or is Obama simply planning to exterminate them , regardless of the civilian toll ?
Negotiation appears out of the question , if Hillary Clinton 's uneasy reaction to Pakistan 's ceasefire deal with militants in Swat is any indication .
So , where does this all lead ?
As a former , enthusiastic supporter of this war , all I can see is perpetual death for years on end .
Obama 's not going to turn Afghanistan into Sweden ; he'd be lucky to turn it into post - Katrina New Orleans .
Given how many liberals bashed Bush for shifting the focus away from the Good War in Afghanistan in favor of his Iraq adventure ( which continues and will continue under Obama ) , I 'm not sure if partisan Dems will ever seriously question President Change 's Central Asian crusade .
Their main concern is the holy American middle class , at least those segments that reflect their political biases and educational levels .
The American poor are pretty much out of the picture .
The forgotten and marginalized have no real voice amid the ceaseless white noise .
And that 's inside the greatest country ever created forever .
What do the Afghan poor offer American liberals , other than target practice ?
Mario Explains Relationships for Us
It ’s no secret I peek at Reddit when I ’m working weekends .
But last week its contributors made something too hilarious not to share :
An extremely dark view of relationships , in the context of Super Mario Bros .
Around Wednesday a user kicked it all off with “ Mario Explains It : Lesson 001 . ” ( Above )
The guy was clearly going all Mr. Bitterpants over the state of a just - friends relationship with some girl who is probably never , ever going to give it up for him .
It was then followed up with many pictures and revisions .
Here are the ones that were the funniest while still forming a logical progression :
Here ’s a “ Fixed that for you ” from someone even more bitter .
The third picture shows the OP how to git ‘er done .
Uh , staying “ just friends ” now sounds like a pretty good idea , does n’t it ?
Smoker !!!!!
Reloading !
Of course , there ’s always this path .
I ’d probably make supersize Bullet Bob into a divorce lawyer .
And finally , for those who hate counseling , the Scott Peterson option .
And so we learned an important lesson today , did n’t we kids ?
That ’s right .
Never ever never have sex with anyone you care about …

Following the Moon ( 1974 ) [ Jul. 1st , 2005 | 11:43 pm ] Billy Corgan
On a particular cool night , I am making my usual trek to the liquor store to buy my step - mother cigarettes … she has given me a $ 20 bill , which to my 7 year old mind is a tremendous amount of money … the moon is full , and as always when it is , I feel the call of the wild in my bones … the clean air fills my head , and for the first time in my life I consider running away …of course , there is nowhere to go , no one to see … I imagine I can live for a little while on the 20 bucks , but of course will have no way to get any more money once it runs out …
I figure the best place to live would be under an overpass bridge , but I will have to figure out where to get some blankets …
I walk particularly slow , weighing each aspect of my decision with each step I take … the situation at home is so utterly toxic to my nerves that I cannot possibly stand another night … it is a rare moment where I only think of myself , leaving my younger brother and anyone else I love completely out of the question … there is no one to be seen on my walk thru the back alley behind the stores , it 's just me and the possibility of leaving for good …
I come to figure that I will probably be caught , and will only get beat worse when I do … I have come to be used to the beatings , they are fairly regular now , it is just the waiting for the beatings that drives me insane … the pregnant pause between the release of the impacted energy thru violence and the long sweep of the tide out , till all is still … then , a faint rumble as it heads back into my direction , and the numb roar that comes up thru the floor , until fists meets temple , and the cycle is complete …
I have learned the fine art now of judging what is expected of me when I am being beat … it takes a keen ear to detect if the desired result is one of the following : submission , capitulation , confession , or negation … sometimes when I am being beaten down , the desired result appears to be tears , a bleating “ no more , no more ” , until the monster is satisfied … in stark opposition , sometimes the desired result appears to be to stop me crying , until a numb pall falls over the scene … as she beats me , she repeats over and over again “ stop crying , stop crying you piece of shit ” , and the formula reads that once you do the beating will stop …
I learn the fine art of giving her whatever she desires , if only to feel that I am the one ultimately in control …
On a visit to my maternal grandmothers , I am up in my aunt 's apartment , sitting on my haunches in the corner , staring at a curio case full of porcelain figures …
I think calmly through the things that plague me , which at this age are that I hate cigarette smoke , and I do n't like anyone to see me cry …
I make two decisions in that moment I remain faithful to till this day…one , I will never smoke cigarettes , such is my hatred of the smell ( I have still never smoked a cigarette in my life ) … and two , that I will never cry for any reason ( I would estimate that I have cried just 6 or 7 times in my entire life since that moment , the circumstances usually so overwhelming that I cannot override the feeling --- my mother 's funeral , absolute betrayal , the Pumpkins last show ) …
So when I am beat now , if the desire seems to be to make me cry , I learn a sort of fake sob , dramatized to heighten the necessary effect … she does n't seem to notice the difference between the fake version and the real deal , so this passes muster and therefore I never need to cry at all …
My father spends most evenings getting stoned and watching t.v… this becomes our time together , the most effective way to be in his presence is to learn to enjoy what he enjoys … for my father has little interest in what I am interested in …any attempt to get him to watch a baseball game perhaps results in a waving of the hand and a dismissal of the game as “ boring ” … fortunately for me , my dad likes to watch things like “ Monty Python 's Flying Circus ” and “ The Midnight Special ” , which was a program that featured live music from new bands … this was in many ways my first exposure to international rock music not covered by our local radio …
Since we live so close to a world class bowling facility , my brother and I often go over to hang out and watch people bowl … the bowling alley is always well air - conditioned in summer , and a toasty warm in the winter ( our home is generally kept on the cold side during winter to save money ) … after a time , our curiosity gets the best of us , and we decide that we want to try bowling for ourselves …
I have about $ 3 dollars saved , and since the board says it costs $ 1 dollar to play , I figure it 's enough for the both of us , with some left over to get some soda pop…we rent our shoes , and proceed to have a blast , bowling for about 4 hours … when we go up to pay , the man behind the counter informs us that we have played 16 games , and with the shoes , etc , we owe him around $ 18 dollars … I unfortunately did n't realize that the $ 1 dollar fee was PER GAME …. as luck would have it , my brother had recently found a $ 20 dollar bill on the ground , but it is presently hidden under the couch …
I convince the man to let me leave my brother as collateral , promising I will return with the money …
I run quickly home , steal my brothers $ 20 dollars , and come back to pay the fee , purposely not telling my brother where I got the money … because if he knew the money was his , he will refuse on principle , blaming me for the oversight since the whole thing was my idea …
The pond that sits just across from our apartment becomes a place where I just go to sit and stare , a small piece of tranquility from the urban sprawl that we live amongst …
I watch the men fish , pulling their dirty catfish from the water and plopping them in their white plastic buckets …
I always feel sorry for the fish , with their uncertain fates , swimming around in a bucket … one afternoon , I spot a teenager I know a little bit who lives in one of the townhouses next to the pond …he is bleeding from his head , a severe gash cut right across the top of his brow …
I ask him what happened , and he tells me that someone from across the way hit him with a rock …he does n't know who did n't it , but vows revenge … the pond suddenly loses it 's luster as a peaceful place to sit , so I stop going …

Catching Up with ' Lost's ' Michael Emerson
By Liz Kelly
Michael Emerson . ( ABC )
It turns out that Michael Emerson , living , breathing actor , is every bit as intense as Ben Linus , fictional , diabolical mastermind .
The difference , I suppose , is context .
Where Ben Linus 's frightening gravity is mustered to bend those around him to his will , Emerson 's is more of a centeredness and workman - like approach to his craft .
Yesterday , I spoke with Emerson by phone and it may behoove fans of " Lost " to pay close attention to a man who -- both in and out of character -- chooses his words carefully .
Emerson , who says his default mode is theater work , never expected his run on the show to last this long ( he 's in his third season ) or for his character to become so central to the plot .
" I 'm really sort of grateful I did n't know or I might 've been so nervous I 'd have screwed it all up , " says Emerson .
But there 's no doubt that " Lost " could hardly get along now without Emerson 's nuanced portrayal of a character who we 're never quite sure about .
Is Ben LInus good or evil ?
For the record , Emerson thinks Linus is inherently a good guy whose methodology is a little rough around the edges .
Read on to get more of Emerson 's thoughts on the " Lost " mythology , Ben 's inevitable encounter with Daniel Faraday , promise of an explanation to come -- finally -- for that four - toed statue and more about the rest of the show 's fifth season , including this take on some upcoming scenes with his favorite co-star , Terry O'Quinn :
" Oh we have some crackerjack scenes -- epic , vintage Ben and John Locke coming up -- in ways you would never expect . "
Excellent .
Much more after the jump ...
Liz :
You 've taken the character of Ben Linus and made him your own creature -- beyond where the producers saw him going .
Have you contributed to his development as the show has matured ?
Michael : I 'm on a kind of a circuit with the writers .
I would never presume to call them up and give them a character idea or even a story idea .
But I know they watch the dailies closely and over time they 've gotten used to me and I see that the character is a better and better fit as time goes by because they 're familiar now with my tics -- the way I express myself or stand or look or scratch my head .
They tend to write that in more , so with each passing season the line is blurred a little bit , I guess , between my playing of the character and what is required for the playing of the character .
What evil lurks in the heart of men ?
Ben Linus ( Michael Emerson , right ) and Jack ( Matthew Fox ) form an uneasy alliance .
( Image courtesy ABC )
Liz :
So I would imagine it 's getting easier as time goes along ?
Michael :
It does , which does not mean I get more comfortable .
This season I 've had a couple of alarming moments when I thought " I 'm not doing any acting , am I ? Or am I ? "
When day in and day out you play this character , it does n't require a lot of priming on the morning of the day you work .
You just sort of put on the clothes and there you are .
You kind know how he ticks -- and to me that 's sort of alarming because I 'm used to having to craft and re-craft the back story , the interior monologue , all that kind of stuff -- and now it does n't feel like I 'm doing enough .
I mean , I think I am , but it is sort of a funny feeling .
Liz :
We have a big " Lost " following here at washingtonpost.com and one of our readers noticed that you -- or Ben Linus -- does n't blink much .
Is it a conscious decision to not blink or is that just Michael Emerson ?
Michael : I do n't think about it .
I 've heard people mention it before .
Maybe it 's something that 's held over in me from the stage .
It 's maybe more about there not letting there be a lapse in intensity , not letting a connection be broken .
Maybe .
I probably should n't think about it too much .
Liz : A question from my colleague in " Lost " scholarship , Jen Chaney :
What was it like turning the frozen donkey wheel in last season 's finale ?
Did it weigh two pounds or was it really as heavy as it looked ?
Michael :
It was heavy .
It needed to be heavy .
We tried pushing it with no resistance and it was too easy and it's hard to fake that particular kind of effort , so we ended up having the biggest grip on the set sit on the other side of the wall -- a 250 pound man put his weight against it -- so I would have something like real work to do .
And that helped .
Liz :
Are there any actors that you particularly enjoy working with ?
I read in a recent interview that you did n't get the warmest welcome when you joined the cast .
Is that right or did you want to clarify ?
Michael :
Oh , yes , because I would n't want to give that impression .
When you come to a show late like I did you do n't fall into the party scene of the show , you keep to yourself a bit .
They 've already been there for years -- most of the people on the show are family people so they have soccer practices and PTA meetings to go to .
I live on a different part of the island and I 'm away a lot .
Most of my life remains on the mainland , so I tend to spend a lot of time away on breaks .
But I get along famously and socialize with lots of members of the cast .
There are many that I never get to work with , which is an odd thing about our show .
Ben ( Michael Emerson ) , Hurley ( Jorge Garcia ) and John ( Terry O'Quinn ) in search of the elusive Jacob .
( ABC )
But for me , a workday when I 'm doing scenes with Terry [ O ' Quinn ] is always a very good workday .
I love the way he works and the scenes between Ben and John Locke are , I think , especially well written .
And I think they 're somewhere near the heart of the dialogue that is at the heart of " Lost . "
Liz :
Will we see any of those scenes in the upcoming season ?
Michael :
Oh we have some crackerjack scenes -- epic , vintage Ben and John Locke coming up -- in ways you would never expect .
Liz : Talk about Ben a little bit more .
There 's a big schism between people who believe the guy is just bad to the bone , pure evil and then others who believe he's an inherently good person who happens to be using any means at his disposal to bring about his goal .
What 's your take ?
Or maybe you know the absolute right answer to this question ?
Michael : Maybe I 'm naive or self - serving , but I tend to subscribe to that latter theory .
Maybe that 's the only way I can live and operate within the character .
Even if the net result was to be that he 's a 100 percent heinous villain , I would still have to for my purposes , my process , find the sympathetic notes in it and hold on to those to find justifications for behavior .
I think he 's complicated .
I think if you spoke to the writers about it you 'd come away with the impression that they think of him as not a wholesale villain .
I think they like right where he's at -- which is kind of a question mark .
And one of the reasons they like me is that I abide by that question mark .
Liz : Speaking of where Ben 's at -- will we see him make it back to the island this season ?
Michael :
He 's certainly working that direction , but I 'm not sure he 's allowed to resume life on the island in the natural course of things .
It may take some extraordinary circumstance for him to go back .
But he 's certainly busy trying to get the Oceanic 6 back there .
Liz :
There 's one season of the show left .
Which is good for the story line , but maybe not so good for the actors who have found such great work on this show .
Have you given any thought to what 's next for you ?
Have you thought that far ahead ?
Michael : I have n't .
I always assume my default mode is to be a stage actor , so I imagine myself doing plays somewhere .
But I 'll be open to whatever opportunities come my way as long as they are n't too Ben - like .
Liz :
Have you had a lot of offers for Ben - like roles ?
Michael : Ben 's not the only sort of dangerous or damaged character I 've played on television .
I 've sort of had a run of those and I do continue to get offered ; for example , people want to offer me serial killers and as many variations of interest as there can be within that small character profile , I think that 's a thing I should best leave alone for a while .
I think it 's a trap you could exhaust and become over - identified with it .
I 'd like to stay light on my feet and mix it up a little bit .
One of the appeals of the world of theater to me is that on stage I 've always done comedies and played silly characters , which is fun .
That might be a good way to cleanse the palate between Ben and whatever comes up next .
Liz : Evangeline Lilly did an interview recently where she said she does n't really buy into the whole mythology of " Lost " ; that she 's more in it for the relationships created between the characters .
What about you ?
Michael : I like the day - to - day process of this work and I 'm not sure that " Lost " contains a profound or life - changing mythology , but I think the show is complex and interesting enough to merit some puzzlement and reflection in the off hours .
I do enjoy it and I enjoy the way it inspires conversation and meditation in others who do n't work on the show -- viewers and such -- so I do n't make a study of it , but I do enjoy it .
I admire and continue to be impressed by our writing staff and I think the show ends up meaning more than we thought it meant when it first came out .
Liz :
Do you think it 's possible that viewers read too much into the show ?
Michael :
We read a lot or too much into things we 're passionate about or seem to speak to us .
I suppose it 's possible to go overboard .
It is a television show , not a world religion .
But at the same time , it 's kind of fun and the speculative part of our show is honest and intelligent .
And at the end of the day it 's entertaining .
And the place people find for it in their lives is rather up to them .
What I think is good about " Lost " ( if I may say so ) , there 's something there for every level of viewing passion -- from light interest to obsession -- so you do n't run out of stuff even for the obsessed viewer .
Liz : Speaking of obsessed viewers -- do you get recognized on the street ?
Michael : I get that more and more -- not so much in Hawaii where I live .
Maybe the tourists here have other things on their mind .
The tourists here are heavily Japanese and I do n't know to what extent we are watched in Japan .
We 're watched some , but I do have a kind of easy anonymity in my adopted neighborhood here .
Liz :
A few more questions here that if I do n't ask them , I 'll never hear the end of it from my readers .
Michael : [ Laughs ]
Liz : Is Ben 100 percent cured of his cancer ?
Michael : Oh , I -- yes -- there 's nothing in the current storytelling that refers back to it .
I do n't think about it anymore .
Maybe I should .
Liz : Will Ben ever meet Daniel Faraday , do you think ?
Michael : I think he must sooner or later .
Liz :
Well , he 's already met his mother ...
Michael : Yeah .
Who 's his mother ?
Liz :
You tell me .
All signs point to Mrs. Hawking .
Michael : Ohhh .
Yeah ...
Liz : Is Nestor Carbonell -- who plays Richard Alpert -- wearing eyeliner ?
Michael : No .
But he has a kind of genetic beauty that is a rare thing in men or women .
No , that 's what he looks like when he wakes up in the morning .
It 's hard not to study his face and admire it .
Liz :
Well you 've probably just put to rest several theories about Alpert being a transplant from ancient Egypt .
Michael : Ah. Well , hold that thought about Egypt .
That 's all I 'll say .
Liz :
Will we find out what the deal is with the four - toed statue ?
Michael :
You are going to learn more about the world from which that statue came .
I do n't think we 're going to see the statue again in context , but maybe .
You 'll certainly know from whence it is a relic .
Liz :
Thank you so much for talking to us today .
Michael : My pleasure .

In Tokyo bars , malls and heavily trafficked areas , these machines come packed with motion - activated ads , interactive touchscreens and plenty of beer options .
Often , the bar establishment provides a clean glass that a customer places on the machine 's slot , and the machine takes it from there with style .
A hooking mechanism secures the glass with a giant claw and tilts it 45 degrees for the optimal amount of foam .
Using motion sensors , the machine can tell when the glass is full , and releases it softly on the beer mat .
Sometimes , instead of working , I like to see what search terms are bringing readers to my blog .
The most common search that healthyalgorithms has been most useless for is “ minimum spanning tree python ” .
Today , I ’ll remedy that .
But first , dear searchers , consider this : why are you searching for minimum spanning tree code in python ?
Is it because you have a programming assignment due soon ?
High - school CS class is voluntary .
All college is optional , and many you are paying to attend .
You know what I ’m talking about ?
Perhaps the short motivational comic Time Management for Anarchists is better than some Python code .
Still want to know how to do it ?
Ok , but I warned you .
I wrote about what a spanning tree is and why you might want one a few months ago , while promoting my wares .
But forget all that fancy stuff .
If you need to find a plain - old minimum spanning tree , and you like speaking Python , then you want MinimumSpanning Tree.py from David Eppstein ’s PADS library ( Python Algorithms and Datastructures ) .
PADS does n’t have an easy_install package that I know of , but for finding MSTs , there are only two files you need : UnionFind.py and MinimumSpanningTree.py .
Put these somewhere that Python can find them , like in your working directory .
Python makes Kruskal ’s algorithm so short that I ’ll just quote Eppstein ’s entire MinimumSpanning
Tree function here :
def MinimumSpanningTree ( G ) : " " " Return the minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph G. G should be represented in such a way that G[u ] [ v ] gives the length of edge u , v , and G[u ] [ v ] should always equal G[ v ] [u ] .
The tree is returned as a list of edges . " " " # Kruskal 's algorithm : sort edges by weight , and add them one at a time .
#
We use Kruskal 's algorithm , first because it is very simple to # implement once UnionFind exists , and second , because the only slow # part ( the sort ) is sped up by being built in to Python .
subtrees = UnionFind ( ) tree = [ ] edges = [ ( G[u ] [ v ] , u , v ) for u in G for v in G[u ] ] edges.sort ( ) for W, u , v in edges : if subtrees [ u ] != subtrees[ v ] : tree.append (( u , v ) ) subtrees.union ( u , v) return tree
So , for example , if you have ever had a desire to find the minimum spanning tree of complete graph with uniformly random edge weights , you could do it like this :
from random import random from MinimumSpanning Tree import MinimumSpanning
Tree as mst n = 10 G = {} for u in range ( n ) : G[u ] = {} for u in range ( n ) : for v in range ( u ) : r = random ( ) G[u ] [ v ] = r G[v ] [ u ] = r T = mst ( G ) mst_weight = sum ( [ G[u ] [ v ] for u , v in T ] )
We might as well get some beautiful pictures out of this , since it ’s not much more work .
For the above code , but tweaked so that every point has a random position in the unit square with distances as - the - crow - flies between them , behold .
For fun times , ask yourself , what if I wanted 2 disjoint spanning trees on this set of points ?
The minimum cost solution can be very different from the spanning trees you find if you yank out the MST and use Eppstein ’s code on the remaining edges .
p.s. It looks like Aric Hagberg just added this mst code to NetworkX , so if you have the most - most - most recent version of that , maybe you can build up any XGraph and then just say T = networkx.algorithms.mst ( G ) .

A crippling heat wave and strong winds in southeastern Australia contributed to an outbreak of forest and grassland fires in Victoria in late January 2009 .
By January 30 , about 5,500 hectares had burned and at least 10 homes had been destroyed , reported the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) .
The homes were located in a small community near the town of Boolara .
Nearly surrounded by wildfire , the town had also run out of water and lost power , said ABC News .
This image from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Aqua satellite was captured on January 30 .
A large plume of smoke spreads southward from a fire ( outlined in red ) that appears to be burning in a small area of forest west of Churchill ( a larger town near Boolara ) in Victoria ’s Gippsland region .
The forest is dark green in contrast to the surrounding grass or cropland .
The fire , says ABC News , started as two blazes in plantation forests in the Strzelecki Ranges .
The large version of the scene shows a wider area that includes several other fires .

A plan to display the Ten Commandments on a monument at the state Capitol has cleared a state House committee .
The measure would authorize installation of a three - by - six - foot monument on the Capitol grounds at no expense to the state .
Rep. Mike Ritze of Broken Arrow authored the bill and says he and his family will pay the estimated $ 10,000 cost of the project .
Ritze says he believes the nation has lost its moral compass and that the Ten Commandments is a reminder of basic values .
Rep . Wallace Collins of Norman says he believes placing a copy of the Ten Commandments on the Capitol grounds could be unconstitutional .
The measure was approved 8 - 3 by the House General Government Committee and now goes to the full House for a vote .
Protesters said they wanted to make their voices heard but avoid strike action
About 100,000 people have taken part in protests in Dublin city centre to vent their anger at the Irish government 's handling of the country 's recession .
They oppose plans to impose a pension levy on 350,000 public sector workers .
Trade union organisers of the march said workers did not cause the economic crisis but were having to pay for it .
In a statement , the Irish government said it recognised that the measures it was taking were " difficult and in some cases painful " .
The pension levy was " reasonable " , the government said .
It reflected " the reality that we are not in a position to continue to meet the public service pay bill in the circumstances of declining revenue " , it added .
Reports say the plan could cost the 350,000 public sector workers between 1,500 euros and 2,800 euros ( £ 2,500 ) a year .
High unemployment
There were conflicting estimates of the numbers of people at the march , which began on the north side of Dublin in the middle of the afternoon .

Police said 100,000 people were on the streets , while organisers said they expected 200,000 to protest in total .
The Irish Congress of Trade Unions ( Ictu ) , which organised the march , said it was campaigning for " a fairer and better way " of dealing with the economic crisis .
" Our priority is about ensuring that people are looked after , the interests of people are looked after , not the interests of big business or the wealthy , " Sally - Anne Kinahan , Ictu 's secretary general , told the BBC .
I 've a mortgage to pay , I 've children to put through school , and now I 'm being told I have to take cutback , after cutback , after cutback
Irish protester
One protester said he was " sick and tired of the way this government conducts itself and what it 's doing to this country " .
" I 've worked all my life , I 've never broke the law , never walked out on strike .
Instead I 've went to work and done my job , " he said .
" I 've a mortgage to pay , I 've children to put through school , and now I 'm being told I have to take cutback , after cutback , after cutback . "
Ireland , which was once one of Europe 's fastest - growing economies , has fallen into recession faster than many other members of the European Union .
The country officially fell into recession in September 2008 , and unemployment has risen sharply in the following months .
The numbers of people claiming unemployment benefit in the Irish Republic rose to 326,000 in January , the highest monthly level since records began in 1967 .

Well , it appears that one of the first things the Obama - Biden Office of Management and Budget has done is to instruct the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy to jointly " assess the costs and benefits of transferring budget and management " of our nuclear weapons research , development , test and production programs and associated facilities from DOE to DOD , " beginning in FY 2011 .

Under the terms of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 , the responsibilities for all aspects of our nuclear energy related programs  not just nuclear weapons related  were invested in a civilian agency , the Atomic Energy Commission .
The commission , itself , was comprised of five full - time civilian presidential appointees and a civilian General Manager who administered the day - to - day operations of four divisions : research , production , engineering and military applications .
The Director of the Division of Military Application was required to be a serving member of the armed forces , and the Act established a Military Liaison Committee , comprised of Pentagon representatives , whose function was to provide the AEC its military requirements .
Finally , the Act established the truly extraordinary Joint [ House - Senate ] Committee on Atomic Energy , endowed with both authorization and appropriation responsibilities .
The Act further authorized the President to direct the AEC " from time to time " to transfer AEC civilian - produced nuclear " weapons to the armed forces for such use as he deems necessary , in the interest of national defense . "
Under the Act , the AEC was to be the " exclusive owner " of its facilities , but could let contracts to operate them .
Hence , the AEC continued to contract with the Board of Regents of the University of California to operate  essentially pro bono  the Los Alamos nuclear - weapons design laboratory , and persuaded AT&T to establish the Sandia Corporation , to operate  essentially pro bono  the AEC nuclear - weapons engineering facility in nearby Albuquerque .
( Even the Soviet Union  to the extent it could  essentially replicated our model , with its important civilian control over all aspects of nuclear energy . )
Enter the anti-everything - nuclear activist crowd and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 , which abolished the AEC and the associated Joint Committee on Atomic Energy , established the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to " regulate " the bejezus out of the nuclear power industry , and established something called the Energy Research and Development Administration , which incorporated  in addition to programs to develop energy - efficient refrigerators  nuclear weapons research , development , test and production programs .
Well , it s been all downhill since then .
Now , when the Warsaw Pact disintegrated in 1989 , President Bush the Elder unilaterally began to withdraw all our tactical nukes  originally developed and forward deployed to compensate for our perceived lack of manpower in a NATO - Warsaw Pact war in Europe  and return them to their civilian parents for dismantlement , recovery and eventual peaceful disposition of the fissile material .
Soviet Union biggie Gorbachov , unilaterally , began doing the same .
And under the so - called Nunn - Lugar Act of 1991 , Congress even authorized Bush the Elder to assist the Russians  who were in the process of becoming custodians of all Soviet nuclear energy programs , both civilian and military  do the same .
Now , Bush the Elder believed we still needed nukes , not nearly so many , but some new types of nukes for the Post - Cold War period .
In the fall of 1991 , two civilian nuclear - weapons scientists described four new types of nukes in " Countering the Threat of the Well - armed Tyrant . "
10 - ton - yield " micro- nukes , " robust ground penetrating nukes to destroy underground bunkers
100 - ton - yield " mini- nukes , " to counter  exo-atmospherically  incoming nuclear warheads
1000 - ton - yield " tiny - nukes , " for " battlefield " use
large - yield " EMP - nukes , " for generating  exo-atmospherically  high power electromagnetic pulses
But then the Clinton - Gore anti-everything - nuclear crowd came to power and began to not only get rid of our entire existing nuke stockpile , but attempted to ensure that we could never again design , build or test new nukes .
For two years , until the Republicans took control of both Houses , the Democrat - controlled Congress did Clinton - Gore ’s bidding on nukes .
They even adopted a total prohibition against " research and development which could lead to the production by the United States of a low - yield nuclear weapon … [ that is ] a nuclear weapon that has a yield of less than five kilotons . "
But , last October , then Bush - Cheney Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , in a key speech before the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , announced he was setting up a study group under former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger to make recommendations about the future goals of our nuclear - weapons programs and about who ought to be charge of implementing those goals .
Gates claimed that the United States ceased developing new ( or improved ) nukes in the 1980s and ceased producing nukes ( or the makings thereof ) altogether in the 1990s , and has conducted no " full - up " tests  proof of concept , vulnerability , survivability or safety  since 1992 .
Of course , as a former CIA Director , Gates knew the same claims could be made about Russias nuke programs .
Yet Gates went on to claim that
" Currently , the United States is the only declared nuclear power that is neither modernizing its nuclear arsenal nor has the capability to produce a new nuclear warhead .
The United Kingdom and France have programs to maintain their deterrent capabilities .
China and Russia have embarked on ambitious paths to design and field new weapons .
To be blunt , there is absolutely no way we can maintain a credible deterrent and reduce the number of weapons in our stockpile without either resorting to testing our stockpile or pursuing a modernization program . … "
" Let me be clear :
The program we propose is not about new capabilities  suitcase bombs or bunker - busters or tactical nukes .
It is about safety , security , and reliability .
It is about the future credibility of our strategic deterrent .
And it deserves urgent attention .
We must take steps to transform from an aging Cold War nuclear weapons complex that is too large and too expensive , to a smaller , less costly , but modern enterprise that can meet our nations nuclear security needs for the future . "
Okay , is beginning to take urgently those steps recommended by now Obama - Biden ’s Secretary of Defense Gates what the Obama - Biden OMB has just directed DOE and DOD to do ?
A paper that was published in the December issue of Psychological Science has attracted some attention recently because of some of its potential implications , namely that living in urban environments can harm our cognitive control .
It 's an intriguing idea , and there is some experimental support for it , but right now , the theory behind the work appears to have some inconsistencies with other recent results .
The basic idea is derived from the fact that the brain has two forms of attention .
The first is a bottom - up process , in which low - level , subconscious parts of the brain identify something worthy of attention and alert the conscious portions .
The alternate , top - down version ( often termed " executive " ) kicks in when the conscious part of the brain decides to pay attention to something , and directs sensory resources to do so .
According to the theory , which its proponents term " attention restoration theory , " or ART , this latter form of attention is mentally taxing .
People can only maintain focus for a finite amount of time before exhausting their mental resources and finding themselves in need of a recharge , the restoration portion of ART .
That restoration comes from the mental equivalent of peace and quiet — periods of time when the bottom - up portion of things is not demanding that the conscious part of the brain decide whether something is worth further attention .
Thinking better ?
Supposedly , natural environments help enable that restoration process .
They contain information that the unconscious portions of the brain are better able to deal with , allowing it to leave the conscious portion undisturbed .
Urban environments , in contrast , contain a host of potential distractions , which keeps the brain too busy to recover .
The paper focuses on testing this contention via two different experimental setups .
In the first , the authors had their subjects perform a mentally taxing task : listen to a string of digits , and then repeat the string in reverse .
After a bit more than a half - hour of this , the subjects were sent on a walk , half through the campus arboretum , the other half through downtown .
Their performance on a similar digit reversal task was then measured ; those who had walked among the trees outperformed the subjects who went through town , a result that held up when the same subjects were invited back a week later to perform the opposite walk .
In a second test , the walk was replaced by pictures of natural and urban areas , and the test of attention skills was switched to the ANT suite , which includes tests that distinguish between both bottom - up and top - down attention .
The tests indicated that , while bottom - up skills were indifferent to the type of picture viewed , those who saw nature scenes had better performance in the tests of executive attention .
Now , it would be easy — and stupid — to view this as indicating that an urban environment damages the brain ( which , obviously , means someone has done so ) .
If ten minutes of looking at pictures could have a restorative effect , then it 's possible that simply choosing your computer 's desktop background could potentially counteract any urban - generated issues .
A lot of settings also do n't fall neatly into a urban / natural category .
The view from the home office here is dominated by water and an island with a mixture of trees and soccer fields — with a suspension bridge and the FDR drive in the background .
What exactly am I getting out of that ?
The ART proposal also does n't seem to be thoroughly integrated with a lot of the rest of psychology .
For starters , they equate visual and audio attention in their exercises ( the digit task is audible , while the subjects looked at pictures ) .
The test then focused , at least in part , on the working memory needed to reverse digits .
I say " in part " because working memory seems to hold fewer items than the number of digits used in many tests .
Finally , there 's data indicating that components of natural scenes actually grab more of a share of conscious attention than the inanimate objects that populate urban scenery , possibly as a result of the fact that we evolved where natural objects were all that mattered .
As someone who gets a lot out of the time I spend in scenic places , there 's little doubt in my mind that natural scenery can be beneficial to one 's mental state .
But there 's a big gap between that and the ART model , which proposes some very specific cause - and - effect relationships .

Alice Uchi slowly pushed a near - empty shopping cart down the near - empty aisles flanked by near - empty shelves in what had been the first and largest modern Japanese supermarket in Little Tokyo .
“ I feel lost .
Sad , ” the retired Los Angeles registered nurse said glumly .
Uchi was catching the tail end of Mitsuwa Marketplace ’s 50 % fire sale before it prepares Sunday to shut its doors , marking an emotional transition for many in Little Tokyo .
Last year , a group of six ethnic Korean investors purchased the property , part of the Little Tokyo Shopping Center at 3rd and Alameda streets , for $ 35 million .
The group plans to recast the market with more Korean , Chinese and American products in addition to Japanese ones .
The change reflects the rapidly diversifying demographics in Little Tokyo -- most prominently , the growing Korean influx into the historic heart of Southern California ’s Japanese American community .
Ethnic Koreans have moved into the neighborhood as shopkeepers , running frozen yogurt stores , pharmacies and sushi restaurants , and as residents in both the new condos and historic senior housing complexes such as Little Tokyo Towers .
As a mark of the shift , Korean - language newspaper stands are now scattered throughout the neighborhood .
Many see the change as inevitable -- but not without pangs of nostalgia and regret .
“ There is some regret in seeing Japanese businesses change and others come in , because it is Little Tokyo , ” said Chris Aihara , who heads the Little Tokyo Community Council .
“ But the change is something we have to embrace , use to build a strong community and move forward . ”
Young S. Cho , a 48 - year - old Los Angeles garment manufacturer and one of the market ’s new co-owners , said his group would respect the area ’s historic ethnic traditions and retain , even enhance , the center ’s Japanese design elements .
But he said the neighborhood ’s growing diversity offered an opportunity for a supermarket with a broader focus .
“ This is America , ” said Cho , a Seoul native who immigrated to the United States at age 10 .
“ Now everyone lives in Little Tokyo -- Koreans , Americans , Japanese , Chinese -- and they do n’t have a lot of places to go shopping . ”
For much of its 24 years , the supermarket stood as a symbol of Little Tokyo ’s boom times , when the Japanese were flush with cash and invested millions in the neighborhood .
One of their first joint projects was the three - floor , 300,000 - square - foot shopping center and its flagship supermarket .
The mall was built by Japanese American developer Albert Taira in partnership with the U.S. real estate arm of Obayashi Fudosan of Japan .
The supermarket was operated first by Japan - based Yaohan and then Mitsuwa Marketplace .
Long before tofu and sushi became common items in California supermarkets , the Little Tokyo market was the biggest game in town for Japanese shoppers .
They flocked to the market for bean paste and burdock root , Japanese - brand rice cookers and Japanese - language rental videos .
On the second floor , the market sold Japanese furniture , clothing , electronics and other goods , offering shoppers a chance to see the latest products from the motherland .
Friends ran into friends at the market , sharing the latest swatch of gossip or a bowl of noodles at the Sakura restaurant inside the establishment .
The market reconnected the Japanese with their traditional celebrations , selling herring roe and black beans for New Year ’s , displaying pink and green rice snacks for Girls ’
Day , featuring festivals celebrating the food of different regions in Japan .
At one time , the mall included a bowling alley , Japanese bookstore and movie theater , providing gathering spots for people such as Nobuaki and Koko Kimoto of Temple City .
The couple , shopping for Mitsuwa bargains Wednesday , said they used to come to the mall two or three times a week to rent Japanese - language videos ; pick up ramen , curry and miso ; go bowling ; and browse through the latest books and magazines from Japan .
Not only Japanese Americans lamented Mitsuwa ’s closure .
Yi Li Sung , a 35 - year - old Chinese American court interpreter , said she came to shop at least once a month for Japanese - brand coffee and “ little girlie things ” like eyebrow shapers .
She and her family also buy Japanese when looking for rice cookers , water heaters and other electronics , she said .
“ A lot of my Chinese friends shopped here because of the variety of products and their freshness , ” Sung said as she looked through a picked - over pile of light bulbs , cat food , bath salts and brownie mix .
“ The prices are not always the cheapest .
But we feel the Japanese stand by their quality . ”
To Uchi , the retired nurse , Mitsuwa ’s closure marks more than the loss of a supermarket -- after all , she said , Little Tokyo still has two other Japanese markets , Marukai in Weller Court and Nijiya in the Japanese Village Plaza .
Rather , it stirred in her a deep sadness to see the community ’s abandonment of such a major project of the Issei and Nisei , the first - and second - generation pioneers .
“ The market was built with the sweat and dedication of the Issei and Nisei , ” she said .
“ If they were alive to see what has happened today , they would cry . ”
Cho said the Mitsuwa owners chose to leave , despite having four to five years remaining on their lease .
A spokesman for Mitsuwa ’s Torrance headquarters could not be reached for comment , but the Little Tokyo store ’s manager , Masaaki Yoshimoto , said he was surprised by news of the closure .
Yoshimoto said that business had picked up in recent years because of the influx of new residents in the area and that two - thirds of the store ’s patrons were now non-Japanese .
Cho said that his group had initially negotiated with two different Korean market owners to take Mitsuwa ’s place but that the deals failed to work out .
Instead , the group decided to hire someone to run the market for them .
The new store , to be called the Little Tokyo Galleria Market , will primarily feature Korean and Japanese products but also include Chinese , American and even Mexican items , such as marinated carne asada , Cho said .
It will reopen Feb. 15 with 90 % of its stock on the shelves but hold its grand opening in May .
Cho , a business graduate from Cal Poly Pomona and a U.S.
Army veteran , said his group hoped to bring new business to the area with the revamped market and plans for what he billed as the largest Korean - style spa outside New York .
The 50,000 - square - foot space on the mall ’s third floor would offer body scrubs , massages , saunas , exercise equipment , resting stations , a nail and hair salon and several eateries , including a coffee shop and ice cream parlor .
Once launched in 18 to 24 months , he said , the spa would be open from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. and possibly 24 hours a day on weekends , drawing potentially 1,000 people to Little Tokyo daily .
But Cho said his group is also mindful of the community ’s sensitivities about keeping the mall ’s Japanese flavor .
Most of the Japanese tenants , he said , seem ready to stay .
And the group ’s architectural plans for a face - lift to the mall , an aging structure often likened to a fortress , feature Japanese motifs such as cherry blossoms , exterior panels patterned after shoji screens and a modern Zen garden .
“ We ’re going to try our hardest to keep this a Japanese - theme mall , with an international flair , because this is Little Tokyo , ” Cho said .
To Japanese Americans such as Bill Watanabe , executive director of the Little Tokyo Service Center , the changes are simply a sign of the times .
“ I think Little Tokyo will become part Korean and that ’s a fact , because there are just more of them , ” Watanabe said .
He added : “ Shoganai ” -- it ca n’t be helped .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Pedro Pablo slowly folds up his American flag blanket and stuffs it in his duffel bag .
With it goes his American dream .
Pedro Pablo , an illegal immigrant from Guatemala , headed home recently due to the bad U.S. economy .
" I left my family and lost four years with them .
I will ask them to forgive me , " he said .
Pablo is an illegal immigrant from Guatemala who came to the United States to support his wife and five sons back home .
When he arrived , construction jobs were plentiful .
Over the last year , he says , he 's worked three days .
He recently boarded a bus with a one - way ticket home , paid for by the Guatemalan consulate in Los Angeles .
" I thought I could get ahead here .
I regret coming . "
Watch day laborers head home »
Across the United States , tens of thousands of immigrants -- those here legally and illegally -- are facing a similar dilemma :
Do they continue to search for jobs in a struggling U.S. economy or return home to an even bleaker economic situation ?
" Things are very dire , and I think it 's impacting those at the very bottom even more so , " said Abel Valenzuela , a professor at the University of California - Los Angeles who has spent years studying day laborers .
" Day laborers are being really , really impacted . "
America 's economic boom during the 1990s and 2000s created a high demand of day workers needed for anything from building homes to picking fruit and from working at slaughterhouses to working as nannies .
Many of those jobs have since evaporated , resulting in more and more people -- immigrants and native - born Americans -- flooding day labor job sites and standing on street corners in search of any type of work they can get .
" All of them are competing for the few jobs being dispatched , " Valenzuela said .
Immigration experts say it 's not yet clear how large an immigration exodus of Latin Americans is under way .
But they say anecdotal evidence suggests day laborers , like Pablo , have begun packing -- a result of the economy and tougher immigration enforcement .
For some immigrants , the experts say , the reasons for toughing out the U.S. economic recession outweigh the reasons for leaving , including :
• One or two days of work per month at $ 8 an hour is often better than what they can make back home ;
• Tougher border enforcement along the U.S. - Mexico border has made it harder for them to return once they leave ;
• Smuggling costs to get into the United States from Mexico have skyrocketed from about $ 1,500 three years ago to about $ 6,000 today .
" I 'm not convinced it 's a tidal wave of exodus , " Valenzuela said .
" There really is a fear mentality [ of leaving ] , and as a result many immigrants are buckling down -- that is they 're hiding or living in the shadows of our law .
So they think more than twice about whether or not they want to go back to their country of origin , because they know very well that it 's going to be extremely difficult and very expensive to come back if they want to pursue their dream . "
Steven Camarota with the Center for Immigration Studies , a Washington - based think tank that seeks a " pro-immigrant , low - immigration vision , " said Census data indicate that more than 1 million illegal immigrants left last year , a departure that began even before the nation 's economy took a turn for the worse toward the end of the year .
He said better border enforcement and workplace raids on illegal immigrants " let people know that the immigration law was back in business . "
With illegal immigrants returning home , he said , " It 's certainly good for two groups : taxpayers and less educated natives . "
The lack of work in the United States has had a trickle down effect in the immigrants ' countries of origin .
The money sent back home by Mexican immigrants in 2008 fell for the first time since record - keeping began 13 years ago .
Watch lack of remittances has " real large economic implications " »
The remittances dipped 3.6 percent , from $ 26 billion in 2007 to $ 25 billion , according to Mexico 's central bank .
Remittances are Mexico's second - largest source of foreign income , behind only oil .
Other Latin American countries also have seen money sent from immigrants in the United States slow .
Erik Camayd - Freixas , a professor at Florida International University who has served as an immigration court interpreter for two decades , recently traveled to Guatemala , where he saw the effects of less money being sent home by immigrants .
" Everybody was talking about it , " he said .
" The local economies are severely impacted and the unemployment is rampant . "
He said scores of people deported from the United States are trying to find any type of job in Guatemala .
" They 've been there six months and they have no work , " Camayd - Freixas said .
That 's why he said he believes most immigrants already in the United States are willing to stick it out , despite the hard - scrabble times in America .
" The truth of the matter is , despite our 7.6 percent unemployment , most Americans are not going to do those jobs that migrant workers do , " Camayd - Freixas said .
" They 're certainly not going to pick tomatoes , grapefruits and oranges . "
Camarota disagrees .
He said Americans most likely to compete for day labor jobs -- those with a high school degree or less -- are currently unemployed at an astounding rate of about 15 percent .
" It 's very hard to argue that we 're desperately short of unskilled workers , " he said .
Jeronimo Salguero is the director of a day labor site in Los Angeles .
He says employment for day laborers has dipped 75 percent over the last year .
He said on any given day three years ago , his center found work for nearly 50 percent of the people who gathered there .
Now , that figure is about 5 percent of the 250 men who huddle daily searching for work .
A study issued in January by the Pew Hispanic Center found that nearly three of four Latinos surveyed said their personal finances were in fair or poor shape , compared to 61 percent of the general U.S. population .
Among Hispanic immigrants who sent remittances home over the last two years , about 70 percent said they sent less in 2008 than in 2007 .
Salguero said to help offset the hard times , immigrants are crowding about 20 men into apartments .
He 's now working with the Guatemalan consulate .
Once a week , he said , the consulate purchases a bus ticket for an immigrant to go home .
" They are completely desperate , " he said .
" Each day , I have workers coming into the office and say , ' Geronimo , help me .
I want to go back to my country . ' "
Pablo was one of those men .
He had lived in a one - bedroom apartment with seven other men .
His " bedroom " was a corner of the living room where he kept his blanket , duffel bag and picture of his family .
" I can't make it here , " he said .
" If I have to suffer , it 's better to suffer in Guatemala with my family . "

TOKYO ( pictured ) is currently the most expensive city in the world .
The Economist Intelligence Unit , part of the Economist Group , has released its Worldwide Cost of Living survey , and the Japanese capital climbs from last year 's seventh place to first .
The table 's figures represent a weighted average of the prices of over 160 items found in 140 cities , from a loaf of bread to a luxury car .
This year ’s survey shows substantial changes from last year 's because of recent exchange - rate fluctuations .
For example , when the data was actually collected in September 2008 , Oslo was the most expensive city in the world ( as it was the year before ) .
But the depreciation of the Norwegian krone since then has dropped the city to fifth place .
By the same token , London , which was third last year and eighth when the data was collected , is now ranked the 27th - most expensive city in the world , thanks to the pound ’s fall .
It is cheaper than New York for the first time since 2002 .
On the other hand , the strengths of the dollar and the yen have made American and Japanese cities comparatively more expensive in the last five months .
This accounts for Tokyo's rise to the top of the ranking and Osaka 's surge to second place .
But despite the fall of the euro , Western Europe still dominates the table and supplies seven of the top ten cities .
Chicago , Los Angeles and New York are the dearest American cities , in joint 23rd position .
At the other end of the table , Karachi replaces Tehran as the cheapest city .

Alex Bennee left a comment on my dollar editor post :
I then open a number of separate emacs processes for each project I ’m actively working on .
I mainly do this as each project typically has it ’s own make invocation .
I have a similar issue myself where my work projects require different commands but I prefer to avoid running multiple emacs instances if possible .
It is not too difficult to fix .
The idea is to detect the name of the file and run a different make command depending on which directory the file is in .
This can be extended to as many different directories as necessary .

The Wonder of Economic Freedom By David Henderson
Yesterday my wife and I got on the road early to go to San Jose ( we live 75 miles south in Pacific Grove ) to help our daughter move her stuff from a storage locker to a shared apartment in San Francisco .
After we rented and loaded a U - Haul truck , I drove it behind my wife and daughter , who were in my daughter ’s car .
Carrying a mattress and a box spring and umpteeen boxes up over 50 stairs took it out of me .
On the way home , Rena , my wife , who is an editor , not an economist , told me that she had said to our daughter , Karen , on the way up ( I ’m paraphrasing ) :
Is n’t it neat that we can call a truck rental place just two days beforehand and rent a truck to haul your things and that there ’s someone willing to rent us a storage place at a fairly low price ?
What my wife was appreciating was the wonder of economic freedom .
Economic freedom in this country is not complete and it ’s diminishing , but there ’s still a lot left .
And think about the first paragraph above .
My wife and I drove her car , with 105K miles on it but still going strong , and then my daughter drove her car , with 80 K miles on it and still performing well .
In other words , each of them has a great car .
And I have an even better car with only 27 K miles on it .
Think of the wealth that we have that our parents , and definitely our grandparents , would not have been able to fathom .
There are negatives .
When I had helped move my daughter ’s things into storage earlier in the month , the person there had insisted that she give her fingerprints .
Shocked , I asked why , and if you think about it , I bet you can guess the answer .
Hint : the word “ Homeland ” with a big H is in the answer .
Still , we have a fair amount of wealth left ( “ we ” meaning our family but also most people in the United States ) and almost all that wealth is due to economic freedom .
A film about a member of the Nazi party who saved thousands of Chinese during the massacre in Nanjing recently opened in Germany .
The BBC's Zoe Murphy looks at the possible impact this unlikely hero 's story may have on Sino - Japanese relations .
On Christmas Eve in 1937 , German businessman John Rabe visited the mortuary in China 's then capital , Nanjing .
John Rabe remains a hero in China but his story is little known elsewhere
He later described in his diary the charred body of a civilian man whose eyes had been gouged out , and a boy of perhaps seven , whose corpse was punctured with bayonet wounds .
" I wanted to see these atrocities with my own eyes , so that I can speak as an eyewitness later , " he wrote .
" A man can not be silent about this kind of cruelty ! " The Second Sino - Japanese War was raging .
Japanese troops had stormed the capital , carrying out mass executions and raping tens of thousands of local women and girls , in a six - week orgy of violence that became known as the Rape of Nanjing .
Risking his life , Rabe remained in China and , along with a handful of Westerners , set up a " safety zone " in Nanjing that is thought to have prevented the massacre of more than 200,000 Chinese during one of the bloodiest episodes of the Japanese invasion .
Japanese soldiers used live Chinese prisoners for bayonet practice As Germany and Japan were allies , Rabe used his Nazi party membership to do all he could to protect civilians in the zone - including sheltering 650 refugees in his own house and garden .
With a flash of his swastika armband and through sheer force of personality , he intervened in acts of looting and attempted rape by the Japanese troops .
The diaries of this unlikely and unsung hero only became public knowledge in the late 1990s , when they were published in Germany .
They have now been made into a film , simply titled John Rabe .
The biopic , which premiered recently in Germany , may stoke historical tensions between Beijing and Tokyo .
But it is hoped that Rabe 's story may renew debate and ultimately help heal old wounds .
Historical document
The events of 1937 have left enormous psychological scars in China , and the Chinese believe that Japan has not done enough to atone for its militarist past .
China says 300,000 people were killed during the assault on Nanjing .
But much to the anger of Beijing , some conservative Japanese politicians and academics have said such figures are exaggerated .
Some even deny that a massacre ever took place .
Such declarations also frustrate mainstream historians in Japan and further afield .
William Kirby , head of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University , says the exact death toll is not the main issue .
" What you have is a great massacre of a civilian population that goes on for weeks Nanjing is surrendered but the Japanese proceed to terrorise the inhabitants .
These facts are incontrovertible . "
Coming to light nearly 60 years after the event , he says that John Rabe 's diaries are a powerful new document detailing what happened day - by - day .
Mr Kirby says that Rabe had " no anti-Japanese axe to grind " at the outset .
When faced with this film , many people will be shocked [ to learn ] the Japanese carried out such cruel acts during the war
Japanese actor Teruyuki Kagawa
" He saw the Japanese as a normal army and initially resisted the stories of wrongdoing - he was a neutral outsider . "
During the conflict , Rabe wrote : " Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped ...
If husbands or brothers intervene , they 're shot .
" What you hear and see on all sides is the brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiery . "
Nazi links
The film 's director Florian Gallenberger says it was by staying true to the events as described by Rabe that the film achieved neutrality .
" At the beginning of the conflict I think [ Rabe ] has great trust in the Japanese as German allies to behave in a disciplined and fair way - but when it turns out otherwise he is shocked .
He feels it is his responsibility to act . "
The events of 1937 have left deep psychological scars in China
He says Rabe 's courage was fuelled by his sense of morality , rather than any political conviction .
As bombs rained down , Rabe wrote : " Anyone who has ever ... held a trembling Chinese child in each hand through the long hours of an air raid can understand what I feel . "
At one point , he covered a shelter with a huge swastika flag , which he described as being considered " especially bombproof " .
After living in China for 30 years , Rabe had a naive image of Germany 's National Socialism as a humanistic workers ' movement , says Mr Gallenberger .
Rabe even wrote to Adolf Hitler asking for his intervention in the violence , as he believed the Nazi leader would not have condoned Japan 's actions .
' Hard to watch '
The passage of time has allowed Germany to review its own wartime actions , notably the Nazi genocide of some six million European Jews during World War II .
Now with historical distance , the 37 - year - old director hopes the film will trigger a new dialogue and help Japan also come to terms with its own past .
Rabe 's house in Nanjing is now a museum and centre for peace studies " After such a long time , there should be a way of dealing differently with the responsibility they have , rather than trying to avoid it or make it disappear , " he says .
John Rabe is expected to be widely viewed in China after it premieres at the Shanghai Film Festival in June .
But it is unclear whether the film will be released in Japanese cinemas .
The film 's producers hope that the involvement of Japanese star Teruyuki Kagawa will prevent the film from being silenced there .
Teruyuki Kagawa plays the emperor 's relative , Prince Asaka , who was the top ranking Japanese officer in Nanjing at the height of the atrocities .
During the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in 1946 , Prince Asaka denied any massacre of Chinese and said he had never received any complaint about his soldiers ' conduct .
Controversially , the film speculates on his involvement in the decision - making process .
Teruyuki Kagawa says : " When faced with this film , many people will be shocked [ to learn ] the Japanese carried out such cruel acts .
" I think Japanese people will find the two hours very hard [ to watch ] . "

NASA has outlined plans for dealing with an asteroid a quarter of a mile wide that astronomers believe is on a near - collision course with Earth .
The agency says there is no need at present to dispatch a radio transponder to the asteroid , but adds that it will be keeping a close eye on the rock 's progress through the solar system .
Stargate fans will no doubt delight in the knowledge that the asteroid , which used to be known as 2004MN4 , has now been dubbed 99942 Apophis .
If the current estimates are correct , the asteroid will miss our planet by just tens of thousands of miles , some time in 2029 .
While this is plenty of distance in everyday terms , in astronomical terms , it is a very near miss .
In addition , the proximity of the pass is likely to be such that the gravitational interaction between the asteroid and the Earth could alter the rock 's projected orbit , making it more likely to hit us seven years later in 2036 .
If it did hit , the damage would be substantial , but not deadly on a global scale .
If it hit a city , there would n't be much urban life left , and if it landed in the sea , it would trigger a potentially destructive tsunami .
The space agency says that if the asteroid still appears to be threatening Earth by 2013 , it will start work on a mission to visit Apophis with a probe in 2019 .
This would be followed by an attempt to deflect the asteroid some time between 2024 and 2028 .
It also estimates that planning and executing a deflection mission would only take seven years from start to finish , rather then the 12 suggested by the B612 Foundation .
This would make it unnecessary to mark the asteroid with a transponder before 2021 , when a decision on deflection would have to be made , because by then scientists should have a far more accurate idea of the path Apophis is going to take .
The Deep Impact mission would serve as a model for the deflection attempt mission , although presumably the impactor would be considerably more massive than Deep Impact 's 300 kg chunk of copper .
NASA 's plans were made public by the B612 Foundation , a group agitating for more action from governments on the threat from near - earth - objects .
In June this year it asked NASA whether Apophis needed to be tagged with a transponder , and what NASA would do if the asteroid did turn out to pose a serious threat to Earth .
The B612 Foundation says that while it welcome 's NASA 's response to its questions , if it had n't raised the question " the current understanding of the Apophis circumstances might not have developed .
This is not an acceptable scenario " . ®
