A common criticism which atheists raise against religion is how violent religion and religious believers have been in the past .
People have slaughtered each other in large numbers either because of differences in religious beliefs or because of other differences which are further justified and intensified through religious rhetoric .
Either way , religion has a lot of blood on its hands .
Can the same be said for atheists and atheism ?
Have n't atheists such as Stalin killed more people in the name of atheism than religious theists have killed in the name of their religion ?
No , because atheism is n't a philosophy or ideology .
How Many Have Been Killed by Communists in the Name of Atheism & Secularism ?
None , probably .
Millions died in Russia and China under communist governments which were both secular and atheistic .
This does n't mean , though , that all those people killed because of atheism — even in the name of atheism and secularism .
Atheism itself is n't a principle , cause , philosophy , or belief system for which people fight , die , or kill .
Being killed by an atheist is no more being killed in the name of atheism than being killed by a tall person is being killed in the name of tallness .
Communists Do n't Kill in the Name of Atheism ...
Was Hitler an Atheist Who Killed Millions in the Name of Atheism , Secularism ?
It 's common to believe that the Nazis is that they were fundamentally anti-Christian while devout Christians were anti-Nazi .
The truth is that German Christians supported the Nazis in the belief that Adolf Hitler was a gift to the German people from God.
Hitler himself often referenced God and Christianity .
The Nazi Party 's official program explicitly endorsed and promoted Christianity in the party platform .
Millions of Christians in Germany supported and endorsed Hitler and the Nazis on the basis of common Christian beliefs and attitudes .
Hitler Was Not an Atheist ...
Is n't Atheism the Same as Communism ?
Many theists , especially fundamentalists , have argued that atheism and / or humanism are socialist or communist in nature .
They then conclude that atheism and humanism should be rejected since socialism and communism are evil .
There is strong evidence that bigotry and in America stems from anti-communist activism by conservatives Christians , so this allged connection has had serious consequences for American atheists .
Atheism and Communism are Not the Same ...
Militant Atheists are Atheist Fundamentalists , a New Atheism
A popular reaction to atheist critiques of religion or theism is to label the critic a " militant " or even " fundamentalist " atheist .
This label is most frequently used against those who self - identify with " New Atheism . "
The problem is , there are no essential or " fundamental " beliefs for an atheist to be " fundamentalist " about .
So why use the label ?
This seems to be mostly due to misunderstandings about and prejudice against fundamentalism and the label cannot be applied to atheists .
Atheists are Intolerant for Criticizing Religion , Theism
Some religious believers , mostly Christians , respond to atheistic critiques of religious theism by alleging that vocal , unapologetic atheists are much like to religious terrorists and that criticism of religion is similar to religious intolerance .
The implication is that believers should n't have to be faced with criticism .
This is wrong because neither religion nor theism should receive automatic deference .
Being Irreligious is Risky , Short - Sighted Behavior Like Crime
Many associate atheism with antisocial and criminal behavior , but such assertions are little more than that : bare assertions without evidence or arguments .
The most which anti-atheist critics may offer are be question - begging claims about religion and god being necessary for moral behavior .
One relatively recent ( and flawed ) argument is to claim that there is a physiological , biological reason behind people - or at least men - rejecting religion and gods .
Being Irreligious is Not Like Criminal Behavior ...
If People Fail to Believe in God , They Will Believe in Anything :
Many theists believe that their god creates or otherwise provides objective standards against which they are supposed to measure all of their beliefs , attitudes , behaviors , etc .
Without their god , they can't imagine how anyone could differentiate true from false beliefs , moral from , or proper from improper attitudes .
According to them , then , atheists are capable of believing and doing absolutely anything , having nothing at all to hold them back .
Will Atheists Believe in Anything ?

A chat with Nick Frost , Nick Frost interview , Pirate Radio , Shaun of the Dead
Movies Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
During the course of the “ Pirate Radio ” press junket , which took place at the Mayfair Hotel in London , it seemed that I was running into Nick Frost everywhere .
First , I shared an elevator with him .
He was chatting with one of the publicists from Focus Features , and when she said with a sigh that she knew he was getting ready to embark on another round of interviews , he said , “ That ’s all right , I quite like doing them . ”
I piped up , saying , “ That ’s good , ‘ cause I ’m in the next round . ”
Let me tell you : there ’s nothing like the cheap thrill of getting a laugh out of someone who makes you laugh .
The next time I saw Mr. Frost , he was stepping into the room for a round table interview with myself and three other journalists , at which point he immediately grinned .
Good man , that Nick .
Journalist # 1 : So I have to ask you : were those your actual sideburns that you grew out for the film ?
Nick Frost :
They are actually my sideburns , yeah .
Fortunately , I ’ve got the kind of big - man hair genes , so I can literally grow a beard in a matter of days , which is pretty cool .
It means you can change what you look like all the time .
( Laughs )
Journalist # 2 : What was the coolest part for you about being in a Richard Curtis film ?
" Growing up and being a fan of comedy , you ca n’t not know Richard ( Curtis ) , but … it ’s all very well and good doing these little indie horror comedy films , but I did n’t even realize that he knew I was alive .
So to get him to phone me personally and say , ' I ’ve written you a big part in a film , ' it was pretty great . "
NF : The coolest part … ?
Well , I ’m a fan of Richard Curtis , you know .
Growing up and being a fan of comedy , you ca n’t not know Richard , but I kind of did n’t even … it ’s all very well and good doing these little indie horror comedy films , but I did n’t even realize that he knew I was alive .
So to get him to phone me personally and say , “ I ’ve written you a big part in a film , ” it was pretty great .
I think he does something that British filmmakers generally have n’t done before and do n’t really do , and I wanted to be a part of it .
I just wanted him to like me .
( Laughs )
He ’s like an amazing headmaster that you just want to impress , and you want him to know that you ’re alive , so I think when you get someone like that , you kind of want to do your best work for him .
But just hanging out with him and seeing how calm he is on set …he ’s always got a story , and he ’s always approachable .
He is the most upbeat , positive person I think I ’ve ever met …and it makes me sick .
( Laughs )
I ’m waiting to be around when the laughter stops , but it does n’t .
He ’s very positive .
It ’s great .
It ’s nice to be around that kind of attitude , you know ?
It ’s infectious .
Journalist # 3 : He ’s also got a big love of music , and I understand he ’s a walking encyclopedia of the ‘ 60s .
NF : Absolutely .
Him and Bill ( Nighy ) together as well , they were both … Bill especially , he ’s a proper old rocker , and I think I upset Richard and Bill slightly when , the first week , I kind of said to Richard , “ Can I talk to you ? ”
And he said , “ Yes , yes , sure .
What is it ? ” I said , “ I think I should probably tell you that I ’ve never listened to a Rolling Stones record . ”
But I said , “ Do n’t say anything . ”
And he immediately said , “ Oh , Bill ? ” And got Bill over , and he said , “ Tell Bill what you just told me . ”
And I just kind of said it to Bill as well , and then the two of them just kind of railed on me for five or ten minutes , and made me go back and buy loads of Rolling Stones records on my iPod .
And I ’m very pleased that that happened , because it was an eye - opener for me .
I was a big fan of Hendrix , I was always a fan since I was about 10 or 11 , but that was kind of it for me .
That was my ‘ 60s touchstone .
I like house music and stuff like that , so for me , the Stones were never really relevant .
J2 : What about the Beatles ?
NF : Not really .
( Looks right at me , smiling ) I saw you raise your eyebrows at that .
Bullz - Eye : ( In mock disgust ) This interview is over .
NF : ( Laughs ) I ’ve got to say , again , they just were n’t relevant to me .
There ’s a guy called Scroobious Pip , who ’s an English hip - hop singer , and he says that the Beatles were just a band .
And for me , that ’s true .
It ’s true , but Simon Pegg is a massive Beatles fan , so I think for him more than anything I went and , again , bought everything and spent six weeks just listening to the Beatles on my iPod .
And I sent him a little text that he was very happy about , saying , “ I get it .
I understand it now . ”
And I ’m really pleased .
It took me awhile to think that .
I knew all the Beatles hits , but when actually sit and make a concerted effort to listen to a back catalog , you think , “ Wow . ”
It kind of felt like it was the first time someone had actually taken time and effort to sit down and purposely produced an album of music , so you ’d listen to it as an album and not just a three - minute soundbite on the radio .
So , yeah , it ’s quite nice that , at the age of 37 , you can still be musically learning and sucking it in , you know ?
J3 : So are you a new fan of a lot of the music in the film ?
NF : I am !
As soon as Richard cast me , I did n’t listen to any music post - 1969 for the whole period that I was involved in it , which was about five or six months .
And for someone who likes house music and very modern tweets and beeps and whistles , it was pretty tough for awhile !
( Laughs )
It was !
But my iPod is much richer because of it .
J2 : Any Motown ?
NF : A little bit of Motown .
Next time , when Richard does a Motown movie , then … ( Laughs )
J1 : So how did you like being the stud in this ?
NF : Well , it ’s my natural state of being .
( Laughs )
Well , you know …
J1 : You get all the ladies !
NF : I do get all the ladies !
BE : And a nude scene .
NF : And a nude scene .
( Sighs ) I ’m so terribly sorry for you all .
My mother - in - law is Swedish and very forthright and opinionated , and when I told her that I was going to do a nude scene , she says , “ Oh , I hope I do n’t see your penis . ” ( Laughs )
But , you know , I think it ’s quite brave of Richard to have a 20 - stone man making out with a Bond girl .
I mean , not many people would write that kind of …well , not that I was the romantic lead , but , y’know , sex scenes for a big man .
I think Gemma ( Arterton ) was more afraid than I was .
I do n’t think she ’d ever seen a man like me before .
Daniel Craig is one thing , but I ’m a different kettle of fish .
J3 : What about the boat camp that you attended ?
Can you talk about that experience ?
NF : Yeah , absolutely !
Well , the exteriors of the ship were … what was it called ?
It was an old hospital ship called the Timor Challenger , and it was docked in Northampton , and we were on it for a week .
We lived on it , and we rehearsed on it during the day , all day , and then at night , we would all sit around a table and eat together , and then we ’d watch Richard screen “ M * A * S* H ” one night , or we ’d just drink and play foosball and just hang out .
There was a DJ booth that they ’d set up , so usually after dinner someone would … you ’d hear music drifting out , and then someone would go and join , and then before you know it , there was ten of you just going through singles , saying , “ Play this , play this , play this , play this . ”
It was great .
I ’ve never kind of done that on a film before , but I think that a movie about ten people on a ship who ’ve been on that ship for potentially three years , I think you need to have that sense of friendship .
I think sometimes when you watch a film and there ’s no chemistry between the stars , it ’s that they ’ve never met before , so I think it was important that we did this .
It was just one of those four or five days where you think , “ They are paying me for this ! ”
It ’s such a nice thing .
And I like ships , too .
I think that Richard ’s partner , who was also the script editor on this film , Anna Freud , she has a team of people whom she works with who went into the ship and did an amazing spring cleaning .
It was like a little boutique hotel when we got there , so our cabins , which usually would be filled with oily seamen , so to speak , they were filled with Egyptian cotton and green and black chocolate .
It was nice .
It was a nice five days .
" My mother - in - law is Swedish and very forthright and opinionated , and when I told her that I was going to do a nude scene , she says , ' Oh , I hope I do n’t see your penis . '
I think Gemma ( Arterton ) was more afraid than I was .
I do n’t think she ’d ever seen a man like me before .
Daniel Craig is one thing , but I ’m a different kettle of fish . "
BE : How much swimming did you end up having to do ?
NF : ( Laughs )
A little bit , actually , in the harbor down in Weymouth , which is cold in March .
It ’s not warm .
But , again , it ’s one of those days as an actor where you look at your schedule and think , “ Oh , I ’m going to swim in the sea today ! ”
It ’s exciting .
It was very good .
J2 : So what ’s some of your favorite house music ?
NF : Well , there ’s a kind of branch of house music which started here in Britain and is still going strong called Hard House .
It ’s not a great name , but I ’m a big fan of it .
It ’s pretty frantic and full - on , but for me , there ’s a saying amongst clubbers which is , “ Go hard or go home . ”
So it fits the bill for me .
And I Twitter quite a lot , so through Twitter I ’ve kind of become friends with three or four of the kind of major Hard House DJs in Britain .
So I ’m kind of living vicariously through them , 23 year olds going out for two days , then I ’m tucked up in bed , Twittering at 9:30 at night .
BE : What do you think about the title change of the film ?
NF : I like it .
I think .
I like “ The Boat That Rocked . ” I ’ve no idea why they changed it .
I guess the powers that be have an idea about marketing strategy , but it ’s …it ’s all right , y’know ?
I guess .
What do you think about it ?
BE : I just have a vision of a suit somewhere saying , “ Well , you know , the kids like the pirates … ”
NF : Sure , yeah .
What ’s it called , the one Johnny Depp did ?
BE : “ Pirates of the Caribbean . ”
NF : “ It ’s very big !
Let ’s just drop ‘ Pirates ’ in the name ! ” ( Laughs )
J3 : But it is more specific , though , than “ The Boat That Rocked , ” because pirate radio was a legendary thing .
NF : Maybe they could ’ve called it “ The Boat That Rocked ( With Pirates ) . ”
Just to make everyone happy .
J1 : I never saw the British cut of this , but I heard that it was a bit longer .
NF : I think it was a lot longer .
I saw it on a plane , so if you ’re flying from New York to London , you wo n’t finish watching the film .
( Grins )
Yeah , you know , Richard shot so much stuff that I think that the figure was , like , at one point eight million feet of film or something crazy like that .
J1 : Did any of your scenes get cut from the American version , as far as you know ?
NF : No , I was saved .
J1 : They knew what they were doing .
NF : Thank you very much .
I think … I do n’t know for sure , but I think the British version was , like , two hours thirty - five .
Or two - forty .
And it ’s fucking long for a comedy , you know .
It ’s Judd Apatow long , or it ’s getting there .
So I think it was quite a wise move .
You can always trim stuff out of a film to make it quicker and faster and funnier .
I do n’t think that ’s a bad thing .
J1 : Did you know about the whole pirate radio and Radio Caroline thing beforehand ?
Not firsthand , obviously , but from your folks ?
NF : Well , I did .
I ’m from a part of the country called Essex , which is on the east coast .
It kind of juts out into the North Sea , and that is where the boats were moored : just kind of off the coast of Essex and Kent .
And I do remember Radio Caroline in 1976 , 1977 , but those same ships ... ( Hesitates ) I hate to go on about house music again , but when the house music revolutions kind of hit in 1986 and 1987 , the same thing happened to those guys that happened to the rock ‘ n ’ roll generation .
The government realized that this movement was fairly powerful and people were listening to this music and not doing what the government said , so they essentially banned it .
And they went and lived on these sea forts and ships again , and instead of playing rock ‘ n ’ roll music , they were playing house music .
And for me and for a lot of people who listened to Radio Rock , that was the attractive thing : that the government did n’t want you to listen , and your parents potentially did n’t want you listening , and …it was naughty .
So I wanted to do it .
( Laughs )
That little fellow in the film who ’s listening to Small Faces at the beginning of the film , under the sheets ?
That was me , except it was Frankie Knuckles and some Detroit and Chicago DJs at the time .
J3 : Speaking of DJs , what about the DJ training ?
How intensive was that ?
On working with Philip Seymour Hoffman : " You ’re on the set , and you see him arrive , and …he ’s got a tremendous presence , you know .
It ’s like seeing a prize fighter walk into a ring .
He had this amazing calf - leather script bag with his name embossed on it that he came onto set with , and it was , like , ' Wow , this guy…he ’s good . "
NF : It was good .
It was really good .
We had an authentic ‘ 60s booth set up in an office in town , and we were kind of encouraged to go two or three times a week for an hour .
If you were in town , you ’d just go in , and they had the whole place set up , and you ’d each play records for a couple of hours .
I ’ve DJ ’ed a bit , but on modern equipment .
The theory ’s the same , but the equipment was the kind of stuff that was there at Frankenstein ’s reanimation : lots of valves and arcing electricity .
It was good .
I ’d forgotten the kind of joy of taking a record out of its sleeve and , y’know , blowing on it and smelling it , and when you set the needle on it , it ’s not completely flat .
There ’s a little ripple to it .
I ’d forgotten the kind of joy from that .
And the little crackle before the music starts , which they try so hard to produce out now ... but you can actually get a program on the computer that puts that crackle back in .
But it was great , you know ?
I ’d forgotten the feel of a big baker - like valve in my hands .
It was good , really good .
Oh , and the point was they wanted us to do an hour - long show , which they shot as live .
So that was working toward that hour - long show .
I put quite a lot of effort in , but it did n’t make the cut at all .
I ’m sure it ’s on the DVD as an extra , though .
BE : You mentioned having a bit of a learning curve as far as the Beatles and the Stones went .
Did you get the impression that Tom ( Sturridge ) ’s curve was even steeper , given his age ?
NF : Well ,
Tom is one of those blokes – and he ’s very lucky , actually , and skillful because of it – who , even though he ’s quite young , he seems to look into the past for his musical references .
He ’s a big fan of a lot of ‘ 60s music , anyway , so his knowledge of ‘ 60s music was better than mine at that point , I think .
J3 : Philip Seymour Hoffman …
NF : That guy …
J3 : ( Laughs ) Yeah , that guy .
He came to the project kind of late , did n’t he ?
NF : Well , yeah , he did .
I think we ’d already been on the ship for two or three weeks shooting before he arrived , and it was …you know , he ’s Philip Seymour Hoffman .
He ’s Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman .
So there was that odd sort of excitement like when you get a new headmaster coming into the school .
Everyone saw his scene on the call sheet .
( Whispering ) “ Philip Seymour Hoffman ’s coming !
Phil Hoffman ! ”
And then you ’re on the set , and you see him arrive , and …he’s got a tremendous presence , you know .
It ’s like seeing a prize fighter walk into a ring .
He had this amazing calf - leather script bag with his name embossed on it that he came onto set with , and it was , like , “ Wow , this guy…he ’s good . ” I need to get one of those .
( Laughs )
I wish I could tell you a story where he was an absolute arsehole , but he was amazing .
He mucked in , and there was no pretense .
He was a real good bloke , you know , just like a mate on set .
You can see why he ’s as good as he is .
A lot of times , you ’ll see me looking at him during a scene , and I ’m thinking , “ Are you acting ?
Are you still acting now ?
I ca n’t tell the difference . ”
It was great .
And he encourages everyone else to up their game , you know , because no actor wants to be left behind and eclipsed by another actor .
So you just immediately see that everyone ’s upped their game , and you kind of get a feeling that it ’s on .
Every day , you have to bring your best work .
And that ’s a good thing .
It ’s a nice way to work .
J2 : You ’re a funny guy , but do you think that at some point there ’s a heavy drama in you ?
NF : Absolutely .
I ’m just about to do an adaptation of the Martin Amis book , “ Money , ” for the BBC , and I ’m playing John Self .
And that is …it ’s darkly comedic , but , again , I ’ve spent a lot of time in my pants , weeping .
I never trained as an actor , so it would be silly for me to pigeonhole myself as a comedy actor , because I ’d like to do more .
I ’d like to win an Oscar for being a heavyweight actor .
D’you know what I mean ?
J2 : And then you can get your name on your script bag .
NF : Get an embossed kit and leather script bag .
That ’s where the big money is .
J1 : When does “ Paul ” come out ?
NF : “ Paul ” should be out in August of next year , touch wood .
I do n’t think Simon and I realized how tricky it would be making a film with a CGI alien .
( Laughs ) I mean , it takes so long … so long …to shoot a film with an alien in it , and so long to edit it , and all of the post - production , too .
For every single shot I had , he had six .
There were some phone calls to the producers , let me tell you .
( Laughs )
I ’m not sure we ’d do it again .
I think we ’ll just write a nice , quiet piece about two men fishing .
No CGI .
J1 : So it ’s basically in post - production now , I guess ?
NF : Absolutely .
Yeah , it ’s been there for the last six weeks or so .
So there are assemblies cut together , but I have n’t wanted to see one yet .
I remember watching the first day ’s rushes and wanting to kill myself , so I kind of promised that I ’d wait a little bit .
When you watch rushes and they ’re not funny and there ’s no sound or comedy or effects , you think , “ Oh , my God , this is shit .
We ’re ruined ! ” ( Laughs )
But I ’ve heard some people say it looks all right .
J1 : Who ’s doing your effects ?
NF : Double O Negative , who did “ Hellboy . ”
So I think we ’re in the best hands .
I hope .
And , again , it ’s an amazing cast .
I was quite surprised , because it was my first big American movie , and I think you expect one thing , and you hear certain things , but then you get the cast and an amazing crew .
They just worked , and they were great .
So , yeah , it was a really amazing experience , and Santa Fe , where we shot it , was …I think that helped .
It felt like we were doing something a bit special , with a little gang of people , making a little guerilla film up in the mountains .
And with that , our time with Nick was up , and he bid us a fond “ cheers , guys ” and departed for his next group of journalists .
Fortunately , however , I was able to secure another ten minutes with him that afternoon , this time for a one - on - one .
As such , I tried to ask him questions that had n’t been brought up during the roundtable … well , except for the one about the boat camp .
That really just sounded like a cool experience , so I wanted to know a bit more about it .
Bullz - Eye : We meet again .
Nick Frost :
Hey , how are you ?
Third time !
Do you mind if we stand by the window , so I can smoke a fag ?
BE : Not at all .
NF : I know I should n’t , but … ( Lights up )
BE : So when I was in the roundtable with Talulah ( Riley ) , she made a comment about how you two were comfortable doing your nude scene , but then you suddenly blurted , “ I ’m engaged , you know . ”
NF : Yeah , well , I think that for all Talulah ’s beauty and height and … she ’s a very good , nice girl , and I think that was her first nude scene , and , y’know , I think it was important that she felt comfortable .
And I think if by me saying “ you ’ve got nothing to fear from me , because I am happily engaged did that , then …
( Fades out and takes another drag from his cigarette ) I have that weird gentleman ’s thing going on that I have to just make sure that they ’re all right .
The same with Gemma Arterton as well .
It must be tough for a young girl to have to do a naked scene with a 40 - stone man in front of 40 men looking on .
( Laughs ) I ca n’t even imagine how embarrassing that would be !
So , y’know , as one of the lead actors , I think it ’s my responsibility – as well as other peoples – that they are comfortable enough to think that they can actually perform as they want to perform .
BE : Tell me a little bit more about the whole boat camp experience .
How successful was it at bonding the cast ?
" Eight years ago , I was a waiter , and I did n’t have a pot to piss in .
And now … ?
It ’s like I said to my wife : I love the fact that , if I was in a restaurant and Steven Spielberg walked in , I could go up to him and say , ' Hey , mate , how are you ? '
I think that ’s pretty amazing , actually . "
NF : I think it was great .
I think my only regret was that Phil ( Seymour Hoffman ) was n’t there .
Phil could n’t come to boat camp .
But it was great .
It was …it was like a work piss - up .
You know ?
We rehearsed during the day , and we ’d finish at seven o’clock , and …you quickly get into a routine , even on a boat in a week .
So you ’d finish up , and everyone would rush to the galley to see what was for dinner , and you ’d all eat together .
I think … I do n’t want to sound like some sort of fucking Italian mama , but eating dinner together …it does a lot for a group .
It does a lot for the dynamic of a group and a cast , and …it was great getting to hang out with Chris O’Dowd and Rhys Darby and Rhys Ifans .
And Richard ( Curtis ) , having a few drinks with Richard and playing darts .
We played a lot of music on board as well , on the boat .
There was , like , a DJ booth set up in the ship ’s hospital … which was the ship ’s hospital … and we just played a lot of music .
It was fun .
What a nice thing to do .
I spent a lot of time on canal boats as a kid , so it kind of had that same vibe , where you and a group of mates were on a ship .
It was great .
I love it .
BE : There seems to be kind of a different dynamic between British and American television when it comes to doing television work at the same time as you ’re doing film work .
Here you ’re able to do them simultaneously .
NF : Yeah , I do n’t think there ’s that stigma attached necessarily to doing television .
I think sometimes there ’s that snobbery in the American media where , if you do a film and then go and do something on TV , it ’s seen almost as a step down .
But I do n’t necessarily think there ’s that here .
I think it ’s such a small industry over here as well that it ’s …well , it ’s silly to say , “ I ’m only going to do film . ”
I mean , that said , though , I love making films .
There ’s something about film that seems more permanent that doing a six - episode series which plays at 9 o’clock on Wednesday nights for six weeks and is then gone forever .
I like the permanence of cinema , so to speak .
BE : If you ’re wondering , I brought this up because I was wondering about the experience of doing “ Hyperdrive . ”
I have n’t seen it yet , but …
NF : Fucking hell , it was … ( Hesitates )
You know what ?
I loved shooting it .
It looked amazing .
It was shot on 16 millimeter .
The sets were fantastic , like your classic cheap sci - fi sets .
And the other performers in it were great .
The writing was a little hit and miss , because the writers were all so …they were there on set every day , and we clashed as groups .
I think we were told that we could pretty much improvise what we wanted as long as the written stuff had been done , and then we could have a go at improvising .
But I think a lot of times the improvisations were frowned upon , and it kind of made shooting the second series not as much fun .
But that said , I ’m still very proud of my performance in it .
And it was my first lead as well , so I ’m very proud that they would ’ve trusted me to lead the whole thing , y’know ?
But I loved it .
I really enjoyed it , and I think people who watch it as well …it ’s always going to be compared to “ Red Dwarf , ” because it ’s a British sitcom set in space , but space is a big fucking place .
I think there ’s enough room for “ Red Dwarf ” and us .
BE : Were you pleased when “ Spaced ” finally came out on DVD in the States , so people in America could finally see what everyone had been talking about for so long ?
NF : Yeah !
( Puts out cigarette ) Y ’wanna go sit down ?
BE : Sure .
NF : ( Walks back over to the couch )
It was a long time ago , but I think that ’s the thing that we get asked about more than most anything else , really .
Either “ Is there going to be a third series ” or “ When is the Region 1 DVD coming out ? ”
Yeah , I ’m glad it ’s come out , and it ’s pretty intact , as far as I know , music - wise .
That was always the issue : there was so much music that it was difficult to clear for America .
I dunno what the regional market is – I do n’t know half that shit !
– but , yeah , I ’m glad that it ’s come out .
It ’s been ten years , and people are still really into it .
I think Simon and Edgar and Jess did a clever thing , and you hear it on the radio sometimes as well , but with television and films , even though the audience is several million , you think that it ’s talking to you personally .
That ’s the kind of ethos behind “ Spaced , ” and “ Hot Fuzz ” and “ Shawn of the Dead . ”
We never wanted to make a film for a mass market , because … you tread a very thin line there , because you kind of reach a point where you dilute your comedy so much that nobody enjoys it .
So if we make a film for Pete Sarofinivitz … ( Laughs ) … if we make something that ’s gonna make Pete Sarofinivitz laugh , then other people out there are like Pete Sarofinivitz and are like our group of friends .
So a lot of time we just make people that we ’d want our mates to see…and , touch wood , up to this point there are people who are like us all over the place .
And it talks to them directly , I think .
That ’s quite a nice way of doing it .
BE : That being the case , do you feel like you ’re just one of the luckiest bastards in the world , because you get to do what you think is funny for a living ?
NF : Oh , God , yes .
Every day .
I ’ve got a friend called Andrew who calls me the luckiest waiter in the world .
( Laughs )
But it ’s true , you know .
BE : And , lastly , I wanted to ask you about “ Tintin . ”
What was that experience like ?
: We ’re done .
We shot in February down in Santa Monica , and …it was amazing , really .
It was the most stressful month of my life , and I do n’t think I really slept for a month .
I was tired and frightened and cranky , and it was amazing .
Just to meet Steven Spielberg , let alone to have him kind of punch me on the arm or …you know , sometimes he comes on and , if you did a good take , he ’d laugh and come on and do a dance and punch the air and say …
( Offers his Spielberg impression ) “ That ’s great !
That ’s in the movie ! ”
Eight years ago , I was a waiter , and I did n’t have a pot to piss in .
And now … ?
It ’s like I said to my wife : I love the fact that , if I was in a restaurant and Steven Spielberg walked in , I could go up to him and say , “ Hey , mate , how are you ? ” I think that ’s pretty amazing , actually .

Xbox Live allows gamers to play against one another Thousands of gamers may have been cut off from Microsoft 's online gaming service Xbox Live for modifying their consoles to play pirated games .
Online reports suggest that as many as 600,000 gamers may have been affected .
Microsoft confirmed that it had banned a " small percentage " of the 20 million Xbox Live users worldwide .
Microsoft said that modifying an Xbox 360 console " violates " the service 's " terms of use " and would result in a player being disconnected .
" All consumers should know that piracy is illegal and that modifying their Xbox 360 console to play pirated discs violates the Xbox Live terms of use , will void their warranty and result in a ban from Xbox Live , " Microsoft has said in a statement .
" The health of the video game business depends on customers paying for the genuine products and services they receive from manufacturers , retailers , and the third parties that support them . "
Xbox gamer on being cut off Read more of your reaction The Xbox 360 is equipped with Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) technologies to detect pirated software .
But many gamers modify their consoles by installing new chips or software that allows them to run unofficial - but not always illegal - programs and games .
However , some chips are specifically designed to play pirated games .
Microsoft has not said how it was able to determine which gamers to disconnect .
" We do not reveal specifics , but can say that all consoles have been verified to have violated the terms of use , " the firm said in a statement .
Affected gamers were met with a message during the login process informing them that they had been barred from the service .
Reports suggest that the ban does not stop the console from working and only affects a gamer 's Xbox Live account .
Industry figures suggest that piracy may cost the video game industry as much as £ 750 m a year .
In other news , a UK court has dismissed a man 's appeal against an earlier conviction for selling modification chips - " modchips " that allow gamers to play illegal games .
Christopher Gillham 's earlier conviction was upheld by Hereford Crown Court which found that playing counterfeit games on a modified console infringed copyrights .

Ashok Kamte was shot dead with two other senior officers
The widow of a senior policeman killed in the 2008 attacks in the Indian city of Mumbai ( Bombay ) has criticised police for what she says were lapses .
Vinita Kamte said police were slow to respond to the attacks and had still to tell her exactly how her husband died .
Ashok Kamte was killed with two other top officers in the attacks .
Mumbai 's police now admit there were lapses .
At least 174 people , including 14 policemen , died when 10 gunmen attacked the city on 26 November 2008 .
Police caught one of the gunmen alive and he is currently on trial .
Nine other attackers were killed .
Mrs Kamte makes her claims in a book released on Tuesday evening .
What happened was unprecedented and we were unprepared to handle such things
Police commissioner D Sivanandan
The book uses information gathered by Mrs Kamte from freedom of information requests , meetings with eyewitnesses , police control room records and post mortem reports .
" There were no clear answers forthcoming for simple and basic questions , " she writes .
Her book contains several uncomfortable questions for police - relating to co-ordination between the police control room and officers on the ground .
Additional police commissioner Ashok Kamte was killed along with anti-terrorism chief Hemant Karkare and inspector Vijay Salaskar in the first hours of the attacks .
' Stings my heart '
Mrs Kamte 's book provides a detailed account of how the policemen ended up in a lane near the Cama hospital , where they were killed when two of the gunmen ambushed their vehicle .
The thought of our husbands lying bleeding for 40 minutes with no help haunts our families
Vinita Kamte
Mumbai hero's wife seeks inquiry
She argues that the police control room did not pass on to the officers crucial information which might have saved their lives .
" With prior information , they would have ambushed the terrorists ...
This is what stings my heart . "
On the basis of police records obtained by freedom of information requests , Mrs Kamte says it took 40 minutes for help to reach the officers .
" When after a full 40 minutes help arrived , Mr Salaskar was still breathing as he was taken to the hospital , " she writes .
" If only help had arrived earlier , Mr Salaskar would certainly have been saved and may be Mr Karkare and Ashok too .
" The thought of our husbands lying bleeding for 40 minutes with no help haunts our families . "
Mrs Kamte also says she was not allowed to make a submission to an inquiry into police handling of the attacks .
" It is surprising to note that the persons on whom the committee relied were mostly persons who were themselves interested in covering up their lapses . "
' Confusion ' Last week Hemant Karkare 's widow demanded an inquiry into his death .
Kavita Karkare said she wanted answers following media reports questioning the quality of bulletproof jackets used by the police .
An independent inquiry has already criticised the city police for a lack of co-ordination in dealing with the attacks .
On Wednesday , Mumbai police commissioner D Sivanandan admitted there had been lapses in dealing with the attacks .
" I am not giving any excuses but all I can say is that what happened was unprecedented and we were unprepared to handle such things , " he told an Indian television channel .
He promised that answers would be found to questions raised by Mrs Karkare and the families of other officers who died in the attacks .
" We will look into that and find .
We 'll look for the bulletproof jacket , but yes there was some kind of confusion at the time - because of that some slips might have taken place , " he added .

UPDATE # 2 : Following the release of Shaykh Tantawi ’s personal reflection of the incident , in which a much more benign version of the story is stated , where the Shaykh asks the girl why she is so strict and eventually tells a teacher to remove her niqab , and in which he expressly denies telling her that she was unattractive , we will accept his rendering at face value .
Allah knows what happened , and there is no need to get involved in judging which of the two versions is correct ( the other version , upon which this article was written , was narrated by eyewitness journalists , and links to their videos can be found in the comments ) .
We leave his affair to Allah ; the information that this article was written on was based on credible sources ( even the Shaykh ’s office released a statement the next day that affirmed something along the lines of the story occurred , and the Shaykh ’s silence since the incident , especially in light of world reaction to it , seemed outwardly to affirm the veracity of the story ) .
No matter how credible the sources , I will give the Shaykh the benefit of the doubt since he clearly stated his version .
I would also hope that the Shaykh corrects some of the damage done because of this incident ( regardless of which version is correct ) .
I ask Allah ’s forgiveness if I stepped beyond bounds .
UPDATE : Following the proposed ban that Tantawi wished to place on females wearing niqab in al - Azhar , other Universities and countries are following suit .
See this video which was released on al - Jazeera regarding veiled students at Cairo University : Also , MPs from Italy are suggesting a law , based on Tantawi ’s comments , which would ban the niqab from public spheres :
And the progressive Muslim Canadian Congress have also lobbied the Canadian government to ban the niqab , once again based on Tantawi ’s statements :
By now , almost everyone has heard of the recent incident involving the Shaykh al - Azhar , the esteemed Dr. Sayyid Muhammad Tantawi , with the veiled high - school student .
The office of the Shaykh al - Azhar is symbolically the most senior office in the entire Sunni world , outranking even that of the Grand Mufti of Egypt , since it purportedly places in the highest office the most scholarly personality of the oldest and more revered Islamic University in the Sunni world , al - Azhar University .
In fact , Dr. Tantawi had previously held the position of the Grand Mufti of Egypt for almost a decade , after which the great leader of Egypt , Hosni Mubarak , impressed with his services to Islam , promoted him to the office of Shaykh al - Azhar .
Hosni Mubarak should be thanked for promoting Dr. Tantawi to his office , and this promotion shows not only the credentials of the learned Doctor , but also the care and concern that this three - decade veteran leader of Egypt has for the cause of Islam .
. Dr. Sayyid Tantawi hardly needs an introduction , for he has already established a reputable career , and his resume boasts of such fatwas as the one which encourages Muslim women in France to abandon the headscarf so that they may be in conformity with French law .
It appears , however , that the venerable Shaykh understands that his role cannot stop at merely removing the headscarf from our sisters .
In his concern for the welfare of the Ummah , he has now taken an even bolder step .
In case some are still unfamiliar with the details of the event which occurred two days ago , here are the details which have been reported by a number of reliable eye - witnesses and the media .
When the Grand Shaykh was invited to address a group of young female high - school students , he noticed one of them wearing a face - veil ( niqab ) .
This seemed to irritate his Excellency rather mightily , and , his conscience so roused , he proceeded to ask the supercilious girl to remove her veil ( of course , he is not the first person to do so , having been preceded by the likes of Jack Straw and Tony Blair , amongst other honorable mentions ) .
The girl refused , and said rather innocently that it was her habit to wear it , and she did not show her face to strangers .
The Shaykh ’s sense of right became even more miffed , so he proceeded to pontificate rather starkly , “ The niqab is nothing but culture – it has absolutely no relationship whatsoever with the religion of Islam . ”
Thus buttressed , he then boldly asked her once again to take off the intimidating cloth .
Rather surprisingly , the young girl rejected the demands of the senior - most religious authority in Egypt , stood her ground , and once again reiterated that she was uncomfortable with any man seeing her .
The esteemed scholar could not take such an insult to his honorable demand so lightly , nor could he allow a sixteen - year old girl to get the better of him !
The temerity of such a girl deserved that the Grand Shaykh put her in her place .
Gathering all the might and courage that he needed – for 16 year old girls are known for their tempers and bad moods – he charged on , blasting , “ I have already told you that the niqab has absolutely nothing to do with the religion , and it is something that is from custom ! ”
To drive the point home , he added , in a crude Egyptian vernacular , “ … and I know the religion better than you , and those who gave birth to you ( i.e. , your parents ) . ”
Of course , such langues was completely justified , as how else was the coarse and ill - mannered young lady going to be taught the refined manners of Islam ?
Petrified and terrified , intimidated and bullied by a man four times her age , embarrassed in front of her peers and teachers and media by the highest - ranking religious authority in the land , the young lady felt she had no choice but to take off the blameworthy fabric .
The Shaykh of al - Azhar , satisfied and vindicated , threw in his final blow , to really put the girl in her place , and teach her a well - deserved lesson that she would never forget .
Outdoing his crude expression of a few moments ago by a number of exponential notches , he said , “ Ama law kunti hilwa shuwaya la-amilti eh ? ”

Alas !
English simply cannot do justice to the coarseness and incivility of the Shaykh ’s street - manner talk ( which , of course , the impudent young girl fully deserved ) .
While the vulgarity and tone of the language might fool some people , in fact what the Shaykh really did was to skillfully and subtly demonstrate that , despite his high office and erudite mastery of the religion , he was completely in tune with the riff - raffs and hooligans of the alleyways of Cairo .
A rough translation – albeit without the vulgar connotations of the Arabic ( and my apologies to our English readers for the loss of the coarseness ) – would be , “ So if you were even a little beautiful , what would you have done then ? ”
The implication , of course , was that the egotistical girl was presuming herself to be worthy of participating in a beauty pageant , hence covering her face out of fear of tempting others .
Little did she realize that she was not even qualified to use the adjective ‘ beautiful ’ in the same sentence as her name !
The wise and nurturing religious father - figure of the nation made sure that the self - esteem of this young sixteen year old girl would forever be shattered – so let all teachers pay heed to the lessons that the Shaykh imparts through his astounding pedagogical skills .
It is comforting to know that the ex-Grand Mufti is more knowledgeable than we are ( of course , in his humbleness and humility , he only restricted his greater knowledge to ‘ the girl and those who gave birth to her ’ , but we all understand that it was only his modesty that precluded more epithets , and allowed the self - praise to be so restrained ) .
Thank God for that , for indeed us simpletons are in need of his seemingly unrestrained knowledge ( not to mention his perfect mannerisms and gentle nature ) .
For indeed , a cursory reading of the hadith literature to people of lesser knowledge such as ourselves shows that the face veil ( niqab ) was quite common amongst the wives and female Companions of the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam .
The niqab appears to have been so common , in fact , that before the only Hajj the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam ever performed , as he was instructing people regarding the rites of this Sacred Journey , he had to give a general command to all women that they should not wear the niqab during the state of ihram ( al - Bukhari in his Saheeh ) .
To an untrained mind , this would indicate that the custom of wearing a niqab had at least some prevalence , or else there would have been no need to caution against it ( after all , it ’s not as if there is a specific hadith prohibiting women from wearing mink fur coats during ihram ) .
One wonders whether perhaps these noble ladies from amongst the Companions had managed to import this un-Islamic practice from Persia ( for the learned Shaykh did not tell us which culture it was imported from ? ) even before Persian customs reached Arabia – an amazing feat indeed !
To further confound us simpletons , we read in the Sunan of Abu Dawud and other sources , that Aishah ( r ) would lower her loose scarf over her face even during the state of ihram ( thus effectively veiling it ) when male riders passed them by .
Apparently , Aisha understood that the prohibition for wearing niqab only applied to using that cloth , and not to the actual covering of the face ( similar to the fact that men cannot wear trousers during ihram but must still cover that portion of the body with other materials ) .
Lest some misguided individual , infatuated with the Roman (? ) custom of veiling , inform us that this veiling was specific for the wives of the Prophet , perhaps our very knowledgeable Mufti can better educate us as to how to understand the narration in the Muwatta of Imam Malik , which states that Fatima b. al - Mundhir used to cover her face in the state of ihram in a similar manner that Aisha did ?
And while we are on the subject , perhaps the erudite scholar can also explain how Umm Khallad , another female Companion , was seen wearing a face veil by the Prophet and other Companions ?
In one tradition ( recorded in Sunan Abu Dawud ) , we learn that after a certain battle , she was seen hurrying to and fro , searching for her son to see if he were still alive .
The companions were amazed that even in such a frantic state of mind , she had covered herself with a veil .
One of them commented at her veiled state , at which she replied , “ Even if I have lost my son , I shall not suffer the loss of my modesty ! ”
A pity that our ex-Grand Mufti and Shaykh al - Azhar were not present there , for if he were , he would have told her that he was more knowledgeable of the rules of modesty that she was !
It is indeed confounding to simpletons who lack the grace and mastery of books that the Shaykh does to find narration upon narration that seems to assume that wearing a face veil was common practice amongst the earliest of generations .
In one , we find that Aishah ( r ) was recognized by Safwan b. Mu`attal in the ‘ Incident of the Slander ’ only because he had seen her before the revelation of the verses of hijab ( thus clearly showing that Aishah , at the very least , understood from these verses that she must cover her face ) .
In another narration , we find that ` Umar b. al - Khattab recognized Safiyya after the revelation of the verses of hijab by her gait , thus again indicating that he could not see her face ( both narrations in the Sahih of al - Bukhari ) .
What perturbs the lesser - educated minds of the Ummah is that this pernicious custom of obscuring the face seems to have crept into this nation rather early .
Regarding the interpretation of Surah Ahzab , verse 33 , which commands women to ‘… not display your beauty like the women of Jahiliyya did , ’ al - Tabari ’s Tafsir tells us that even the Companions differed amongst themselves regarding whether the face was a part of that beauty which should be covered or not .
It appears that the Shaykh al - Azhar was able to detect something which even the Companions missed : that the face covering had nothing to do with Islam !
The pervasive insidiousness of this imported fabric was not limited to the Companions , however .
We find each and every classical work of legal jurisprudence – from al - Nawawi’s Majmu to Ibn Qudamah ’s Mughni to Ibn Abideen ’s Radd al - Muhtar to Ibn Abd al - Barr ’s al - Tamhid – have sections dedicated to this issue .
Peculiarly , we find all four classical Sunni schools of law discussing the legal status of the niqab , in numerous major work of fiqh , written throughout the centuries of Islam .
In fact , we even find schools of law outside of the four , such as Ibn Hazm ’s al - Muhalla , that discuss this issue .
It is indeed great Providence that we have been blessed with the pedantic wisdom of the Shaykh of the Azhar for being able to cut through and expose such a large conspiracy , which spanned the entire geographic regions of the Ummah , and reached back to the earliest of our times .
Without his insight , it would be quite easy for someone to believe that the niqab has been a part of the Islamic tradition from its very inception .
One cannot help but sympathize with someone as learned as Dr. Yusuf al - Qaradawi , who is not exactly known for conservative views , yet still says ,
“ Those who believe that niqab is an innovation or forbidden are ignorant , and by this they lie about the Law of God .
The least that can be said about the issue of niqab is that it is merely permissible . ”
That is why we need government appointed Shaykhs of al - Azhar , to correct such misunderstandings in the wisest and most fatherly of fashions , and to make sure that rash , impetuous young girls are taught the mercy of our religion and the beauty of our mannerisms .
All I can say is : with scholars like these …. who needs the French ?!
Bradley said he was proud that Rolle had set the groundwork for a life after sports .
Rolle and his foundation have made strides toward raising the $ 5 million it will cost to open the clinic in the Bahamas .
Rolle ’s decision to study for a master ’s degree in medical anthropology here will help him build an education foundation for his medicinal and philanthropic career .

“ It shows real character on his part that he ’s giving up the chance to sign a big N.F.L. contract and going to Oxford , ” Bradley said .
“ The experience he ’ll have will last a lifetime , while the context of his experience in pro football compared to college football will not be as different as his experience in Oxford will be from the non - football life he ’s led . ”
Rolle has been here three weeks  long enough that reality has overtaken expectation .
He said he had no regrets .
He said that nothing had better epitomized and reinforced his Rhodes experience than his unexpected friendship with Aisha Saad .
Saad , a Rhodes scholar from the University of North Carolina who is studying environmental policy , is a native of Egypt and a practicing Muslim who wears a hijab .
She and Rolle agree that social constructs of undergraduate life would probably have precluded them from becoming friends in college .
But on the seven - hour flight to London from Washington , linked by the serendipity of alphabetical order , Rolle and Saad talked nonstop about everything from global warming to gender equity , race , politics and family .
( Saad has three younger brothers and Rolle four older brothers . )
Some conversations were in English , others Spanish .
There was little talk of football .
“ I think other people were just as surprised as we were that we got along so well , ” Saad said .
The two even played pranks on their fellow Rhodes scholars , making them dance to pass an imaginary toll booth , complete with beeping sound effects , in order to get to the bathroom .
“ We got little jigs , shoulder bops and hip wiggles , ” Rolle said , laughing .
Worried that Rhodes scholars would be stuffy , Rolle knew by the time he landed in London that he would fit in .
Neither he nor Saad drinks alcohol , so they have avoided the popular pub scene , opting instead for four - hour debates .
“ You definitely see his competitive side come out , ” Saad said of Rolle .
“ Some conversations , we say , ‘ We ’re going to table this and continue it next week . ’ ”
( CNN ) --
If the chaste Bella and Edward lived in writer J.R. Ward 's world , they would have hit the sheets long ago .
Ward is the New York Times best - selling author of the popular erotic romance series " Black Dagger Brotherhood , " which follows the sexy adventures of a group of male vampires .
And while she applauds author Stephenie Meyer 's " Twilight " success , Ward is the first to say they are n't vying for the same fans .
" I do not want minors reading my books , " Ward said .
" Stephenie Meyer , in writing those great books , got a whole new generation interested in vampires and further cemented this romantic myth around them , " Ward added .
" A lot of her readers ' mothers have in turn found my books . "
Yearning for the undead may be all the rage now , but vampire romance novels are nothing new .
Ward is part of a group of writers who have flourished in a subgenre known as " paranormal romances " where the love -- and the sex -- is often out of this world .
So are the profits .
According to the Romance Writers of America , romance fiction generated $ 1.37 billion in sales in 2008 .
Judy Scott , media manager for the romance writers group , said romance novels sell really well , especially during tough economic times .
The desire for a bloodsucker is n't that different from other love stories , she said .
" It 's a fairly traditional , forbidden romance story , with a twist , " Scott said .
" The cool thing is that apparently vampires are always handsome and debonair , although they are dead . "
Sandy Coleman , publisher / senior editor of All About Romance , said fans of the vampire romance novels are like any other romance reader who enjoys the fantasy of the story .
" Definitely romances are an escape , " Coleman said .
" There are some very , very good writers writing romance these days . "
Coleman said there is no longer a stigma about being a romance fan .
Her site has been online for 11 years and has about 360,000 visitors a month , she said .
The site is often a place where intelligent women come to discuss their favorite romance novels , Coleman said .
" There 's nothing to be embarrassed about when it comes to reading romance anymore , " Coleman said .
Things were n't quite like that when Laurell K. Hamilton got her start .
The author said she was rejected more than 200 times when she first tried to get her books published .
Now , more than 20 years later , her " Anita Blake : Vampire Hunter " series is one of the best - selling in the genre .
" Everything now that is so hot , when I was trying to sell this , nobody wanted it , " said Hamilton , who is working on her 19th novel .
" [ Vampire novels ] have never been as prominent in the media as they are now . "
Hamilton said she has gotten some crossover in fans of her books who have also read the " Twilight " series .
The author said that in polling those readers , she learned that regardless of their ages , they found similar appeal in Edward and Bella 's story .
" They loved that [ Edward ] waited on the sex and was content to do that , " Hamilton said .
" Vampires have become the new Prince Charming . "
Hamilton , whose series features a strong , independent heroine , said she was a little blown away that women were still craving a white knight to sweep them off their feet .
" One twentysomething woman explained it to me like this , " Hamilton said .
" She said ' Well , I just got out of college and I can't get a job , none of my friends can get jobs that will let us be able to move away from home , so if we can't wait for Prince Charming to come rescue us what are we going to do ? '
I thought that was interesting . "
That has gotten loyal readership for writers like Hamilton and Charlaine Harris , whose Sookie Stackhouse series was made into the wildly popular HBO series " True Blood . "
Heather Graham ( not the actress ) has written vampire novels under both her name and her pseudonym , Shannon Drake .
Graham said she enjoys the creativity that comes with creating romances with vampires as the main characters .
" There is total freedom , " said Graham .
" The only rules are once you make any , you then have to stick to them . "
Graham , whose book " Dust to Dust " melds two frightening topics as vampires seek to save Earth from the 2012 end of the world prophecy , said life can be fraught with lots of anxiety .
Vampire romances are a good escape from that , she said .
" You get to have something sexy , something edgy and something that is scary , but outside the realm of our everyday scary , " Graham said .
Ward said women gravitate toward vampire heartthrobs because the vampires are " always in 3 - D . "
" They are deadly , they are dangerous and they are desirable , " Ward said .
" Big , bad , sexy and lethal , but redeemable is a great setup for a romantic hero . "
Suck on that , zombies !
The Walt Disney Company is refunding parents who bought its Baby Einstein DVDs following a row with a campaign group over their disputed educational merits .
The Campaign for a Commercial - Free Childhood , a US - based advocacy group , is claiming victory after Disney said it would offer a full cash refund to anyone who bought one of the DVDs in the last five years .
The campaigners had already complained to the Federal Trade Commission in May 2006 about products from Disney 's Baby Einstein subsidiary .
At the time , the corporate giant changed some of the wording on its products and Baby Einstein website .
But the row escalated and now Disney says it is offering a full refund to " leave it up to consumers " to decide whether its products offer " value " .
CCFC argues the move is a direct result of its pressure over " false and deceptive marketing of baby videos " .
" The refund offer is a wonderful victory for families and anyone who cares about children , " the group said on its website .
" Recent research shows that screen time is not educational for babies .
Now parents who purchased Baby Einstein DVDs , mistakenly believing the videos would make their babies smarter , can recoup their money . "
Disney slammed the attack by " propaganda groups taking extreme positions that try to dictate what parents should do , say and buy " .
It accused CCFC 's campaign director , psychologist Susan Linn , of twisting " a simple , customer satisfaction action into a false admission of guilt " .
It also denied making claims Baby Einstein was educational .
" We strongly believe that , unlike Linn , our consumers find value in our product , and rather than continue to fight with her , we decided it to leave it up to those consumers .
That is why we extended a refund policy that was already in place , " said a statement on Baby Einstein 's website .
The United Nations is withdrawing its international staff from Pakistan 's dangerous north - west and suspending long - term development work because of the wave of militant violence sweeping country – the latest instance of which saw at least 35 people killed yesterday when a suicide bomber detonated a device outside a busy bank .
In a move that marks a considerable blow to efforts to use aid and development to counter extremists , the world body said that , having already lost 11 members of its staff in Pakistan , the security rating of the north - west had been increased to " phase four " out of a possible five .
The organisation only considers places such as Mogadishu to be more perilous .
" The international staff who have been involved in development programmes in the tribal areas and the North West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) are being immediately relocated , " said Ishrat Rizvi , a UN spokesperson in Islamabad .
She said she was unsure precisely how many people were being moved , but said it was a relatively small number .
" Eleven UN staff have lost their lives in the past year in these incidents , " she added , " but we are determined to continue our humanitarian work . "

The decision by the UN , which followed an attack on a World Food Programme office in Islamabad last month in which five people were killed , came as militants struck again .
Three dozen people waiting outside a bank in Rawalpindi , the garrison city near Islamabad , were killed when a man on a motorbike detonated a bomb .
Yesterday was pay day and many people had gathered outside the branch of the National Bank , close to military headquarters , to get their salaries .
A number of military personnel were among those killed in the blast , which also injured around 50 people .
" I was sitting on the pavement outside to wait for my turn , " Mohammed Mushtaq , a soldier who suffered a head injury , told the Associated Press .
" The bomb went off with a big bang .
We all ran .
I saw blood and body parts everywhere . "
Meanwhile last night at least seven people were injured when a suicide bomber attacked a police checkpoint near the city of Lahore .
Witnesses said a car drove towards the checkpoint and then exploded .
Pakistan has been beset by violence in recent weeks , with more than 300 people killed in a series of militant attacks in cities across the country that were apparently launched in retaliation for the major offensive being carried out by the Pakistani military in South Waziristan .
Targeting both Taliban and al - Qa'ida fighters , the army operation comes amid intense pressure from the US government to confront militants responsible for carrying out cross - border attacks on Western troops in Afghanistan .
In turn , militants apparently hope their attacks will undermine public support for the military operation and distract the authorities .
As such , the decision by the UN will be a big disappointment to those hoping that development work in Pakistan 's remote and impoverished tribal areas could help counter the lure of extremism .
Many experts have stressed the need for better government services , law and order and infrastructure in an area that has long been ignored by the authorities .
Imtiaz Gul , an analyst and author of The al - Qa'ida Connection : The Taliban and Terror in the Tribal Areas , said : " What a country like Pakistan needs is long - term commitment and engagement for helping with development issues rather than a knee - jerk reaction because one or two people are being killed .
Our people are being killed every day .
In a situation like this , a country like Pakistan would be left fending for itself .
How can people expect the country to improve ? "
The decision by the UN will certainly be greeted with consternation by Barack Obama 's administration , whose plans for both Pakistan and Afghanistan are facing more and more challenges every day .
Yesterday , the Pakistan government said it understood the reasoning behind the UN 's decision to withdraw its international staff but hoped its work would resume once the Waziristan operation was completed .
* Agency can tap Treasury line of credit
* FDIC considering ‘ all our options ’ to rebuild fund
* Bair says concerned about mark - to - market proposals
* Backs compensation that rewards long - term profitability ( Recasts first paragraph , adds details on line of credit , Bair comments on banking pay )
By Karey Wutkowski
WASHINGTON , Sept 18 ( Reuters ) - U.S. bank regulators are considering tapping a line of credit with the U.S. Treasury Department and may explore other lesser - known options to replenish the dwindling fund that safeguards bank deposits .
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair said on Friday that the agency would meet at the end of the month to discuss options to rebuild the fund , which has been significantly drained by a sharp increase in bank failures .
“ We are carefully considering all our options , including borrowing from Treasury , ” Bair said , referring to the agency ’s $ 500 - billion line of credit with the Treasury Department .
She was speaking at a global finance conference in Washington .
But regulators are still reluctant to tap the line of credit because they want to avoid temporarily using taxpayer money to clean up the banking mess , she said .
Bair said the FDIC also had lesser - known alternatives for replenishing the fund , such as prepayments of assessments on banks and issuing a note .
She did not give further details on those options .
Other options include more special assessments on banks .
The FDIC has already charged the industry one emergency fee of $ 5.6 billion this year , and is authorized to levy two more .
Bair said the FDIC would seek comment on these options before making a final decision .
So far this year , 92 U.S. banks have failed , compared with 25 during all of last year and only three in 2007 .
Those failures have whittled the balance of the insurance fund down to $ 10.4 billion from $ 45 billion a year ago .
The FDIC is careful to note that it has $ 42 billion in reserves to handle failures over the next year .
“ There are a few options available to the fund - none of them very palatable , ” said Brian Olasov , a managing director with McKenna , Long & Aldridge in Atlanta .
He said the long - term solution to replenish the fund will be higher quarterly assessments .
MARK-TO -MARKET
Bair ’s comments touched on a range of topics , from her view that regulators should not have the option of extending “ open - bank assistance ” to troubled financial firms , to her concerns about accounting proposals that could imperil banks in times of stress .
She said she generally agrees with actions by the Financial Accounting Standards Board but is worried about a proposal to further extend “ mark - to - market ” accounting to bank loans .
“ During periods of market stress , losses could be exacerbated , ” Bair said .
“ We do n’t need to deepen the crises . ”
FASB met last month to discuss whether to force companies to value nearly all financial instruments on their balance sheets , including loans , at market value , and to reflect them in earnings .
Banks oppose such a change .
FASB is expected to release a proposal in the first half of 2010 .
Bair also took aim at proposed reforms to combat systemic risk .
She said large financial institutions should not be allowed to believe they will receive government assistance if they run into trouble .
The Obama administration has proposed giving the FDIC authority to wind down troubled , large financial firms , but it also gives regulators the option to provide open - bank assistance on a temporary basis .
“ So - called open - bank assistance ... should be prohibited , ” Bair said .
She said the FDIC ’s system for resolving failed depository banks is effective and should be extended to large financial firms .
The change is especially crucial because the recent crisis has further concentrated the financial industry , and no firm can be considered too big to fail , she said .
“ The process is harsh , it ’s painful , but it works , ” Bair said of the FDIC system .
“ Unless we enact reforms ... our system will be more , not less , fragile after this crisis . ”
Regarding pay , Bair said she hopes Wall Street has learned its lesson .
She urged business students in the crowd to steer clear of the pay structures that contributed to the financial crisis .
“ I hope you will be advocates for compensation structures that reward long - term profitability and penalize quick - buck schemes that reward employees who put an entire company at risk for the sake of high , upfront fees , ” she said .
Her comments come as the Federal Reserve is close to proposing wide - ranging rules on bankers ’ pay that would apply to any employee able to take risks that could imperil the institution .

Nov. 4 , 2009  --
The tide of extending marriage rights to same - sex couples -- which has swept across New England in recent months -- has stopped at Maine .
Voters rejected a state law Tuesday that would have allowed same - sex couples to wed .
The repeal comes just six months after the measure was passed by the Maine legislature and signed by the Democratic Gov. John Baldacci .
Maine would have been the sixth state in the country to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry , but instead becomes the 31st state to oppose the unions in a popular vote .
With 87 percent of precincts reporting as of 2 a.m. today , gay marriage opponents claimed 53 percent of the vote to supporters ' 47 percent .
Marc Mutty , campaign manager for Stand for Marriage Maine which opposed gay marriages , claimed victory at a rally in Portland just after midnight .
" We 've struggled , we 've worked against tremendous odds , as we 've all known , " he said .
" We prevailed because the people of Maine , the silent majority , the folks back home spoke with their vote tonight . "
Gay - rights activists had hoped Maine voters -- known for thier moderate , independent - minded views -- would have been the first to endorse same - sex marriage in a statewide ballot .
In the five states performing gay marriages – Iowa , Connecticut , Vermont , New Hampshire and Massachusetts -- the practice took effect after legislation or court order .
New York and the District of Columbia recognize same - sex marriages performed in other states , but do not grant them .
" We 're in this for the long haul .
For next week , and next month , and next year until all Maine families are treated equally .
Because in the end , this has always been about love and family and that will always be something worth fighting for , " said Jesse Connolly of the pro-gay - marriage group Protect Maine Equality .
Sources inside the Protect Maine Equality campaign tell ABC
News the referendum is likely headed for a statewide recount .
After the Maine secretary of state certifies the results , the campaign will have to pay a nominal fee to request the count , which could take at least several weeks .
Both campaigns spent millions in out - of - state funds on rallies , phone calls , e-mails and ads in the days leading up to the vote , and their messages resonated among voters of both sides .
Mary Lou Narbus , a 51 - year - old mother of three from Rockwood , Maine , told ABC News she 's pleased Question 1 prevailed in rejecting same - sex marriage .
" I believe that marriage is for a man and a woman ... and I do n't believe that [ gay marriage ] should be taught in school , period , " she said .
Gay - marriage opponents had stressed the idea , disputed by supporters , that public schools would begin teaching children about unions between same - sex couples if the law were allowed to stand .
" That 's a red herring , " David Rutledge , a 43 - year - old father of two in Bangor , told ABC News .
" I have felt like this law was very important to equality . "
Ellen Sanford McDaniel , 35 , of Fairfield , Maine , said she 's relieved the referendum passed , rejecting gay marriage .
" I do n't feel anybody has the right to redefine marriage , " she said .
" I would have been heartbroken for our country if it did not pass ...
We had a prayer night last night for it to go the way it should . "
But gay marriage supporters , like Carole Cheeseman Russo , 65 , of Carmel , Maine , says this vote likely wo n't be the last on the matter .
" No one in my family is gay – at least that I 'm aware of -- but I just do n't think anyone has the right to tell someone who they 're allowed to love or who their allowed to marry , " she said .
" [ Same - sex marriage ] has just got to come back . "

SEOUL , South Korea  Naval patrol boats of North and South Korea exchanged fire in disputed waters off the western coast of the Korean Peninsula on Tuesday , the South Korean military said .
“ Our high - speed patrol boat repelled the North Korean patrol boat , ” the South Korean Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement .
“ We are fully prepared for further provocations from the North Korean military . ”
The skirmish Tuesday preceded by only a few days President Obama ’s scheduled departure on a trip to Asia , which includes a stop in Seoul and a meeting with President Lee Myung - bak of South Korea next week .
North Korea ’s nuclear program is likely to be a prominent topic of the American president ’s talks here and elsewhere .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
Any tax imposed on financial transactions would have to take effect internationally to keep Wall Street jobs and related business from moving overseas , U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday .
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( R ) with Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) arrives at a news conference about the House vote on health care reform on Capitol Hill in Washington November 7 , 2009 .

“ It would have to be an international rule , not just a U.S. rule , ” Pelosi said at a news conference .
“ We could n’t do it alone , we ’d have to do it as an international initiative . ”
Several House Democrats have proposed a Wall Street tax to pay for job - creating legislation they plan to pass in December .
The tax , which could raise $ 150 billion per year , would tap into widespread public outrage at Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis .
“ There ’s something really out of kilter in this society , ” said Democratic Representative Marcy Kaptur , noting the gap between wages in her Ohio district and Wall Street bonuses .
But support is tepid among key legislators , especially those from the New York region who worry that finance jobs could disappear if the tax drives trading activity overseas .
The No. 4 Democrat in the House , Representative John Larson , said his proposal to impose a 0.25 percent tax on over - the - counter derivatives transactions would apply internationally .
“ Part of our proposal would include that it would be international , ” Larson told Reuters after meeting with other lawmakers about the jobs package .
Democratic Representative Peter DeFazio said his separate proposal , which would tax a wider array of trading activity , would cover all U.S. corporations and individuals no matter where their trades took place .
Pelosi and other Democratic leaders have emphasized that the proposal is merely one of many ideas in play .
“ It has n’t been developed to a high priority , but it has substantial currency in our caucus , ” Pelosi said .
Britain urged other governments earlier this month to consider a bank tax as a way to fund future bailouts , and France and Germany have also called for a bank tax .
The International Monetary Fund is studying the idea .
LITTLE ADMINISTRATION
SUPPORT
But it has little support in the Obama administration .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Thursday that he has “ not seen a version of that tax that I think would be appropriate for our country . ”
Democrats are developing their jobs bill to ease double - digit unemployment levels that threaten an economic recovery .
The Senate is expected to act early next year .
Increased road construction , money to help states avoid layoffs of police and other public employees , and a further extension of unemployment benefits are some of the elements under consideration , Pelosi said .
Other options include extending health - insurance subsidies for the jobless , a tax credit for businesses that create jobs , more funding for energy - efficiency programs , and low - interest loans for small businesses .
Funding for these initiatives could come from a transaction tax or by using leftover money from last year ’s $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program , a federal government program to buy assets and equity from financial institutions .
Lawmakers could also pay for the package over a five - year time period to avoid imposing tax increases or spending cuts that may hurt the nation ’s fragile economy .
Democrats passed a broader $ 787 billion stimulus bill earlier this year , but less than half has been spent .
A bipartisan group of at least 120 House lawmakers said on Thursday they had set up a “ jobs caucus ” to ensure that rank - and - file members , not just senior lawmakers , get a chance to shape the bill .
Their proposals included easing business regulations , revamping trade agreements , and extending existing tax breaks .
Think Again : God
“ God Is Dead . ”
No .
When Friedrich Nietzsche announced the death of God in 1882 , he thought that in the modern , scientific world people would soon be unable to countenance the idea of religious faith .
By the time The Economist did its famous “ God Is Dead ” cover in 1999 , the question seemed moot , notwithstanding the rise of politicized religiosity — fundamentalism — in almost every major faith since the 1970s .
An obscure ayatollah toppled the shah of Iran , religious Zionism surfaced in Israel , and in the United States , Jerry Falwell ’s Moral Majority announced its dedicated opposition to “ secular humanism . ”
But it is only since Sept. 11 , 2001 , that God has proven to be alive and well beyond all question — at least as far as the global public debate is concerned .
With jihadists attacking America , an increasingly radicalized Middle East , and a born - again Christian in the White House for eight years , you ’ll have a hard time finding anyone who disagrees .
Even
The Economist ’s editor in chief recently co-authored a book called God Is Back .
While many still question the relevance of God in our private lives , there ’s a different debate on the global stage today :
Is God a force for good in the world ?
So - called new atheists such as Richard Dawkins , Sam Harris , and Christopher Hitchens have denounced religious belief as not only retrograde but evil ; they regard themselves as the vanguard of a campaign to expunge it from human consciousness .
Religion , they claim , creates divisions , strife , and warfare ; it imprisons women and brainwashes children ; its doctrines are primitive , unscientific , and irrational , essentially the preserve of the unsophisticated and gullible .
These writers are wrong — not only about religion , but also about politics — because they are wrong about human nature .
Homo sapiens is also Homo religiosus .
As soon as we became recognizably human , men and women started to create religions .
We are meaning - seeking creatures .
While dogs , as far as we know , do not worry about the canine condition or agonize about their mortality , humans fall very easily into despair if we do n’t find some significance in our lives .
Theological ideas come and go , but the quest for meaning continues .
So God is n’t going anywhere .
And when we treat religion as something to be derided , dismissed , or destroyed , we risk amplifying its worst faults .
Whether we like it or not , God is here to stay , and it ’s time we found a way to live with him in a balanced , compassionate manner .
“ God and Politics Should n’t Mix .
Not necessarily .
Theologically illiterate politicians have long given religion a bad name .
An inadequate understanding of God that reduces “ him ” to an idol in our own image who gives our likes and dislikes sacred sanction is the worst form of spiritual tyranny .
Such arrogance has led to atrocities like the Crusades .
The rise of secularism in government was meant to check this tendency , but secularism itself has created new demons now inflicting themselves on the world .
In the West , secularism has been a success , essential to the modern economy and political system , but it was achieved gradually over the course of nearly 300 years , allowing new ideas of governance time to filter down to all levels of society .
But in other parts of the world , secularization has occurred far too rapidly and has been resented by large sectors of the population , who are still deeply attached to religion and find Western institutions alien .
In the Middle East , overly aggressive secularization has sometimes backfired , making the religious establishment more conservative , or even radical .
In Egypt , for example , the remarkable reformer Muhammad Ali ( 1769 - 1849 ) so brutally impoverished and marginalized the clergy that its members turned their backs on change .
When the shahs of Iran tortured and exiled mullahs who opposed their regime , some , such as Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , concluded that more extreme responses on the part of Iran ’s future religious rulers were necessary .
Shiism had for centuries separated religion from politics as a matter of sacred principle , and Khomeini ’s insistence that a cleric should become head of state was an extraordinary innovation .
But moderate religion can play a constructive role in politics .
Muhammad Abdu ( 1849 -1905 ) , grand mufti of Egypt , feared that the vast majority of Egyptians would not understand the country ’s nascent democratic institutions unless they were explicitly linked with traditional Islamic principles that emphasized the importance of “ consultation ” ( shura ) and the duty of seeking “ consensus ” ( ijma ) before passing legislation .
In the same spirit , Hassan al - Banna ( 1906 - 1949 ) , founder of the Muslim Brotherhood , began his movement by translating the social message of the Koran into a modern idiom , founding clinics , hospitals , trade unions , schools , and factories that gave workers insurance , holidays , and good working conditions .
In other words , he aimed to bring the masses to modernity in an Islamic setting .
The Brotherhood ’s resulting popularity was threatening to Egypt ’s secular government , which could not provide these services .
In 1949 , Banna was assassinated , and some members of the Brotherhood splintered into radical offshoots in reaction .
Of course , the manner in which religion is used in politics is more important than whether it ’s used at all .
U.S. presidents such as John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama have invoked faith as a shared experience that binds the country together — an approach that recognizes the communal power of spirituality without making any pretense to divine right .
Still , this consensus is not satisfactory to American Protestant fundamentalists , who believe the United States should be a distinctively Christian nation .

“ God Breeds Violence and Intolerance .
No , humans do .
For Hitchens in God Is Not Great , religion is inherently “ violent … intolerant , allied to racism , tribalism and bigotry ” ; even so - called moderates are guilty by association .
Yet it is not God or religion but violence itself — inherent in human nature — that breeds violence .
As a species , we survived by killing and eating other animals ; we also murder our own kind .
So pervasive is this violence that it leaks into most scriptures , though these aggressive passages have always been balanced and held in check by other texts that promote a compassionate ethic based on the Golden Rule :
Treat others as you would like them to treat you .
Despite manifest failings over the centuries , this has remained the orthodox position .
In claiming that God is the source of all human cruelty , Hitchens and Dawkins ignore some of the darker facets of modern secular society , which has been spectacularly violent because our technology has enabled us to kill people on an unprecedented scale .
Not surprisingly , religion has absorbed this belligerence , as became hideously clear with the September 11 atrocities .
But “ religious ” wars , no matter how modern the tools , always begin as political ones .
This happened in Europe during the 17th century , and it has happened today in the Middle East , where the Palestinian national movement has evolved from a leftist - secular to an increasingly Islamically articulated nationalism .
Even the actions of so - called jihadists have been inspired by politics , not God .
In a study of suicide attacks between 1980 and 2004 , American scholar Robert Pape concluded that 95 percent were motivated by a clear strategic objective : to force modern democracies to withdraw from territory the assailants regard as their national homeland .
This aggression does not represent the faith of the majority , however .
In recent Gallup polling conducted in 35 Muslim countries , only 7 percent of those questioned thought that the September 11 attacks were justified .
Their reasons were entirely political .
Fundamentalism is not conservative .
Rather , it is highly innovative — even heretical — because it always develops in response to a perceived crisis .
In their anxiety , some fundamentalists distort the tradition they are trying to defend .
The Pakistani ideologue Abu Ala Maududi ( 1903 - 1979 ) was the first major Muslim thinker to make jihad , signifying “ holy war ” instead of the traditional meaning of “ struggle ” or “ striving ” for self - betterment , a central Islamic duty .
Both he and the influential Egyptian thinker Sayyid Qutb ( 1906 - 1966 ) were fully aware that this was extremely controversial but believed it was justified by Western imperialism and the secularizing policies of rulers such as Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser .
All fundamentalism — whether Jewish , Christian , or Muslim — is rooted in a profound fear of annihilation .
Qutb developed his ideology in the concentration camps where Nasser interred thousands of the Muslim Brothers .
History shows that when these groups are attacked , militarily or verbally , they almost invariably become more extreme .

“ God Is for the Poor and Ignorant . ”
No .
The new atheists insist vehemently that religion is puerile and irrational , belonging , as Hitchens argues , to “ the infancy of our society . ”
This reflects the broader disappointment among Western intellectuals that humanity , confronted with apparently unlimited choice and prosperity , should still rely on what Karl Marx called the “ opiate ” of the masses .
But God refuses to be outgrown , even in the United States , the richest country in the world and the most religious country in the developed world .
None of the major religions is averse to business ; each developed initially in a nascent market economy .
The Bible and the Koran may have prohibited usury , but over the centuries Jews , Christians , and Muslims all found ways of getting around this restriction and produced thriving economies .
It is one of the great ironies of religious history that Christianity , whose founder taught that it was impossible to serve both God and mammon , should have produced the cultural environment that , as Max Weber suggested in his 1905 book , The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism , was integral to modern capitalism .
Still , the current financial crisis shows that the religious critique of excessive greed is far from irrelevant .
Although not opposed to business , the major faith traditions have tried to counterbalance some of the abuses of capitalism .
Eastern religions , such as Buddhism , by means of yoga and other disciplines , try to moderate the aggressive acquisitiveness of the human psyche .
The three monotheistic faiths have inveighed against the injustice of unevenly distributed wealth — a critique that speaks directly to the gap between rich and poor in our society .
To recover from the ill effects of the last year , we may need exactly that conquest of egotism that has always been essential in the quest for the transcendence we call “ God . ”
Religion is not simply a matter of subscribing to a set of obligatory beliefs ; it is hard work , requiring a ceaseless effort to get beyond the selfishness that prevents us from achieving a more humane humanity .
“ God Is Bad for Women . ”
Yes .
It is unfortunately true that none of the major world religions has been good for women .
Even when a tradition began positively for women ( as in Christianity and Islam ) , within a few generations men dragged it back to the old patriarchy .
But this is changing .
Women in all faiths are challenging their men on the grounds of the egalitarianism that is one of the best characteristics of all these religious traditions .
One of the hallmarks of modernity has been the emancipation of women .
But that has meant that in their rebellion against the modern ethos , fundamentalists tend to overemphasize traditional gender roles .
Unfortunately , frontal assaults on this patriarchal trend have often proven counterproductive .
Whenever “ modernizing ” governments have tried to ban the veil , for example , women have rushed in ever greater numbers to put it on .
In 1935 , Shah Muhammad Reza Pahlavi commanded his soldiers to shoot hundreds of unarmed demonstrators who were peacefully protesting against obligatory Western dress in Mashhad , one of Iran ’s holiest shrines .
Such actions have turned veiling , which was not a universal practice before the modern period , into a symbol of Islamic integrity .
Some Muslims today claim that it is not essential to look Western in order to be modern and that while Western fashion often displays wealth and privilege , Islamic dress emphasizes the egalitarianism of the Koran .
In general , any direct Western intervention in gender matters has backfired ; it would be better to support indigenous Muslim movements that are agitating for greater opportunities for improved women ’s rights in education , the workplace , and politics .

“ God Is the Enemy of Science . ”
He does n’t have to be .
Science has become an enemy to fundamentalist Christians who campaign against the teaching of evolution in public schools and stem - cell research because they seem to conflict with biblical teaching .
But their reading of scripture is unprecedentedly literal .
Before the modern period , few understood the first chapter of Genesis as an exact account of the origins of life ; until the 17th century , theologians insisted that if a biblical text contradicted science , it must be interpreted allegorically .
The conflict with science is symptomatic of a reductive idea of God in the modern West .
Ironically , it was the empirical emphasis of modern science that encouraged many to regard God and religious language as fact rather than symbol , thus forcing religion into an overly rational , dogmatic , and alien literalism .
Popular fundamentalism represents a widespread rebellion against modernity , and for Christian fundamentalists , evolution epitomizes everything that is wrong with the modern world .
It is regarded less as a scientific theory than a symbol of evil .
But this anti-science bias is far less common in Judaism and Islam , where fundamentalist movements have been sparked more by political issues , such as the state of Israel , than doctrinal or scientific ones .
“ God Is Incompatible with Democracy . ”
No .
Samuel Huntington foresaw a “ clash of civilizations ” between the free world and Islam , which , he maintained , was inherently averse to democracy .
But at the beginning of the 20th century , nearly all leading Muslim intellectuals were in love with the West and wanted their countries to look just like Britain and France .
What has alienated many Muslims from the democratic ideal is not their religion but Western governments ’ support of autocratic rulers , such as the Iranian shahs , Saddam Hussein , and Hosni Mubarak , who have denied people basic human and democratic rights .
The 2007 Gallup poll shows that support for democratic freedoms and women ’s rights is widespread in the Muslim world , and many governments are responding — albeit haltingly — to pressures for more political participation .
There is , however , resistance to a wholesale adoption of the Western secular model .
Many want to see
God reflected more clearly in public life , just as a 2006 Gallup poll revealed that 46 percent of Americans believe that God should be the source of legislation .
Nor is sharia law the rigid system that many Westerners deplore .
Muslim reformers , such as Sheikh Ali Gomaa and Tariq Ramadan , argue that it must be reviewed in the light of changing social circumstances .
A fatwa is not universally binding like a papal edict ; rather , it simply expresses the opinion of the mufti who issues it .
Muslims can choose which fatwas they adopt and thus participate in a flexible free market of religious thought , just as Americans can choose which church they attend .
Religion may not be the cause of the world ’s political problems , but we still need to understand it if we are to solve them .
“ Whoever took religion seriously ! ” exclaimed an exasperated U.S. government official after the Iranian Revolution .
Had policymakers bothered to research contemporary Shiism , the United States could have avoided serious blunders during that crisis .
Religion should be studied with the same academic impartiality and accuracy as the economy , politics , and social customs of a region , so that we learn how religion interacts with political tension , what is counterproductive , and how to avoid giving unnecessary offense .
And study it we ’d better , for God is back .
And if “ he ” is perceived in an idolatrous , literal - minded way , we can only expect more dogmatism , rigidity , and religiously articulated violence in the decades ahead .

Karen Armstrong has spent the past 25 years writing about the centrality of religion to the human experience .
Before her most recent book , The Case for God ( New York : Knopf , 2009 ) , she wrote The Bible : A Biography ( New York : Atlantic Monthly Press , 2007 ) , an account of the not entirely orthodox way that the Bible came into being .
Over the last few years , the so - called New Atheists have become increasingly vocal about the dangerous shortcomings of religion in such books as Sam Harris ’
The End of Faith : Religion , Terror , and the Future of Reason ( New York : W.W. Norton , 2004 ) , Richard Dawkins ’ The God Delusion ( New York : Houghton Mifflin , 2006 ) , and Christopher Hitchens ’ God Is Not Great : How Religion Poisons Everything ( New York : Hachette Book Group , 2007 ) .
Recently , some books have sought out a middle ground between atheism and fundamentalism .
These include Robert Wright ’s The Evolution of God ( New York : Little , Brown and Company , 2009 ) , which incorporates evolutionary psychology to explain shifts in belief over time , and Economist editors John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge ’s God is Back ( New York : Penguin , 2009 ) , examining the curiously vital relationship between modernity and religion .
Religion scholar John Esposito and polling expert Dalia Mogahed argue in Who Speaks for Islam : What a Billion Muslims Really Think ( New York : Gallup Press , 2007 ) , a book based on more than 50,000 interviews in Muslim countries , that Westerners have been getting Islam wrong for decades .
Nobody , not even those in the government , knows what is going to happen in life .
People are not automatons .
There is a certain regularity to life ; the earth revolves on its axis such that the sun “ rises ” every morning and “ sets ” every evening , but neither my life nor yours repeats itself exactly as the day before .
I can leave my place of businesses wondering whether we will have work to do the next day .
When I return the following morning , before we even open , people appear : one needs chicken feed , another horse feed ; two have cars that need repair ; one wants a transmission flush ; another needs four new tires .
All this unscheduled work appears overnight .
People ’s desires change ; babies are born ; people die ; there are new inventions ; people have accidents ; people make new discoveries ( they have a flat tire , they have run out of feed ) .
If one were a government planner , one could either react to this with amazement and wonderment or disgust .
Should people have the liberty to do what they want with their bodies and property or should there be some central institution that tells them what to do and controls all this activity ?
Does private property provide us with a means to a peaceful and prosperous world ?
Or should things be “ dictated ” by the State and its directives ?
Is liberty the mother of order in our human societies ?
As Wendell Berry once wrote , is the “ attempt at total control … an invitation to disorder [ and disaster ] ” or just what humans need ? *
Butler Shaffer in his new ( 2009 ) book , Boundaries of Order : Private Property as a Social System , argues that " individual liberty and social order are obverse sides of the same coin . " ( xiii ) A harmonious society can only come about if people are not coerced by thieves , muggers , murderers , gang members , or government agents , who in the process of exercising violence force people to do what they would not otherwise choose to do .
In other words , voluntary exchanges take place only because both parties expect to benefit .
The spontaneous actions of millions of individuals aim at nothing less than the improvement in their well - being .
But people can only act if they have property to act with .
They must use their bodies in some specific space ( even if they do nothing but think with their mind , they are somewhere ) .
That is why private property constitutes a social system , and why such a system brings about higher standards of living .
People are not always successful , but in the vast majority of exchanges they do better themselves .

The underlying theme of his book , as Shaffer describes it , is " that our traditional institutional model [ of government ] is not only no longer useful to , but actually destructive of , the purposes for which we have long embraced it .
This book will suggest and explore an alternative model for the peaceful and productive conduct of society . "
( 25 ) This paradigm is based " on the principle of the private ownership of property ; that freedom is possible only when private ownership claims are respected ” ; and that the very " existence of political systems " means that private property has been violated .
( xiii )
Using private property as a yardstick three critical questions need be answered in any social conflict 
1 ) Whose property is it ?
2 ) Who has aggressed ?
and 3 ) Who has been aggressed against ?
With a slightly different twist , one can determine the amount of government aggression in society by asking  how much of a criminal does one become by minding one 's own business ; and to what extent do government employees confiscate property ?
In short , if you can ignore the government , by using your own property as you choose , and if the government does not put you in jail or seize your property for failure to pay your taxes , then you 're probably facing an institution that possesses little coercive power .
Life and Death in Shan ... Nien Cheng Best Price : $ 0.10 Buy New $ 11.90 ( as of 09:00 EST - Details )
One of the recurring observations throughout this book is that regardless of " [ w ] hatever system of ownership is in place , someone will exercise decisional authority over property . "
( 6 ) Whether one is living under Hitler 's national socialism , Stalin 's communism , Britain 's Fabianism , or American democracy every political system must answer the question : " how are decisions to be made in the world , and who will make them ? "
( 9 ) The reason for this is the “ need of all living things to occupy space and ingest energy . "
( 133 ) " Each of us must be able to exclude others from the use and consumption of resources necessary for our survival . "
( 123 ) In other words , private property “ is at the core of ” our humanness and “ our well - being . ”
( 133 ) We must own ourselves and then the property that we require for survival .
A perfect example of how a collectivist system must answer the question “ who decides on the use of scarce resources ” is found in a short scene from Nien Cheng 's Life and Death in Shanghai ( pp. 406407 in the 1988 edition ) .
The author , after having been imprisoned for six years , was released and wanted to have a brick wall constructed in order to create a small bedroom in her hallway .
In order to do so , she had to bribe the driver of an electrical utility truck to help transport the bricks .
In answer to the author 's query as to whether this was legal , and whether or not the mileage and gas consumption of the truck was checked , the driver answered
" Do n't forget , in a socialist state , everything belongs to the people .
You and I are part of the people . " …
" Well to tell you the truth , I feel uneasy about using this truck , for my private purposes .
I do n't really think it 's right . "
" We have public ownership in China .
Right ?
Who is the public ?
We are .
Right ? "
So despite the long - standing claim of collective ownership in a communist society , the driver of the truck decided who could make use of it as a tool of transport .
Someone has to decide , whether it is an individual , or a committee , or a politician , or a policeman .
The idea that there can be societal - wide collective ownership is a propaganda myth .
Furthermore , as Shaffer points out , the ultimate test of ownership comes down to this : " who can decide , without getting the permission of another , to destroy [ … ] his property ? "
( 171 )
The truck driver could not decide whether or not to destroy the people ’s truck , nor could the utility manager .
Ultimately , Mao Zedong or someone or some group of people within the Communist Party held that decision - making power .
As in his earlier works , Shaffer refers to chaos and complexity theory , and points out that an orderly system may arise out of apparent disorder . ( 65 ) " [ T ] he substance of social order is found in the regularities that arise , spontaneously and without any intention to do so , from the interplay of [ voluntary ] human behavior . ” ( 73 )
Three important observations in this regard are : first , that each person 's capacity to obtain accurate information on which to make decisions is limited ; second , that the further a person is from the actual source of knowledge , the more likely there is room for error ; and third , that “ when we allow the [ S ] tate to make decisions for an entire population , we run the risk of utter disaster should the ” decision be wrong .
( 44 , 280 ) Decision - making by those who risk their own property not only localizes the impact of wrong choices , but allows people everywhere the freedom to copy those who succeed .
( 42 , 84 )
The Discovery of Freedom Lane , Rose Wilder Check Amazon for Pricing .
Boundaries of Order is the result of many decades of the author 's thinking about the interrelatedness of social order and private property .
He clearly comes down on the side of voluntaryism , arguing “ that liberty and order imply one another . ” ( 297 ) In other words , voluntaryism comes about naturally if no one does anything to stop it .
This book is not for a budding , or even beginning , voluntaryist .
It requires deep concentration , patience , and assumes a basic familiarity with the concepts of self - ownership and homesteading .
Although Shaffer embraces the idea that the first to claim and use an un-owned resource thereby becomes its legitimate owner , he also recognizes that without the support of one 's neighbors , one 's claim to ownership will never be respected .
As Rose Wilder Lane explained in The Discovery of Freedom ( pp. 109110 in the 1943 edition ) , the protection of our property ultimately depends upon human decency .
The only safeguards of property seem to have been possession of the property , individual honesty , and public opinion .
… [ C ] abins were never locked on the American frontier where there was no law .
The real protection of life and property , always and everywhere , is the general recognition of the brotherhood of man .
How much of the time is any American within sight of a policeman ?
Our lives and our property are protected by the way nearly everyone feels about another person 's life and property .
With that Butler Shaffer would surely agree .

November 11 , 2009
In 2007 , Nemertes Research released a dire report on Internet traffic .
By 2010 , it said , the " exponential " growth in demand for bandwidth will butt up against the " linear " investment in networking technology , and that whole Internet thing you 've come to know and love will start experiencing " brownouts or snow days , during which performance will ( seemingly inexplicably ) degrade . "
By mid-2009 , this certainly seemed implausible .
Millions of people now stream Netflix on - demand video to their computers and TV sets , YouTube has added high - quality options to its videos , and Hulu 's launch showed that ad - supported Web video could be hugely popular .
Despite the growth in video ( which is usually pitched as the thing that will bring the Internet to its knees ) , " Internet snow days " were about as likely as real snow days in Havana .
Which is why it was surprising to see Nemertes President Johna Till Johnson double down on the doom - mongering in a May 2009 column for Computerworld called " The Internet sky really is falling . "
The article 's point was largely that " we were right " because YouTube has " recently announced it 's discontinuing video delivery to certain geographies due to — ahem — lack of access capacity . "
( We have no idea what 's being referred to here , but it 's certainly not related to anything happening in the US , Canada , Europe , and other places with good Internet infrastructure . )
Also , ISP usage caps prove that there 's some kind of bandwidth crunch and IP ( both v4 and v6 ) are doomed .
But it 's not just bandwidth brownouts and Internet Protocol that will destroy the Internet — turns out that network neutrality will , too .
In an October 1 column , Johnson painted some new warnings on her apocalyptic sandwich board .
Forget brownouts and snow days — what we 're talking about now is the Internet " going away . "
The article 's headline pretty much sums it up : " Hello net neutrality , goodbye Internet . "
The argument is that :
Internet growth rates are continuing to edge up by anywhere " between 50 % and 100 % year over year . "
This puts strain on last - mile access lines ( like your DSL or cable connection ) , and those lines are " excruciatingly expensive to upgrade . "
Net neutrality means that you can't recoup these costs by charging , for instance , absurd rates for instant messages and cheaper rates for other traffic .
And that means carriers will all have to " charge by the bit . "
And that will " have a domino effect on peering arrangements .
Tier - one providers now peer for free with each other .
Once they have no choice but to charge for bandwidth , free peering will go away .
And one of two things will happen then — both unpleasant .
Either user costs go up ( to cover the costs of peering ) , or more likely , carriers wo n't bother to peer in the first place ( because they can't charge users enough to recoup the costs of peering ) . "
When peering goes away , " so does the Internet — because you 're no longer able to connect to anywhere from anywhere . "
Poor Internet , we hardly knew you .
The reality
Fortunately , actual Internet traffic growth rates are between 50 - 60 percent year over year , not 100 percent , according to the authoritative MINTS project at the University of Minnesota .
And in countries like Canada ( where carriers revealed much of their data to regulators as part of a net neutrality hearing ) , growth rates have dropped from 53 percent ( 2005 - 2006 ) to 44 percent ( 2006 - 2007 ) to 32 percent ( 2007 -2008 ) .
The Internet 's core has plenty of bandwidth , so traffic growth really poses the biggest problem for access lines .
Fortunately , big gains in capacity in the last mile are n't " excruciatingly expensive . "
While Johnson 's single example is the most expensive last - mile buildout in the US ( Verizon 's transition from copper lines to fiber optics ) , cable and DSL operators can upgrade their lines for bargain basement prices by adopting DOCSIS 3.0 ( cable ) or by running fiber deeper into the network ( as with AT&T 's U- verse , which already offers 18 M bps connections over copper wire compared to 6 M bps on the rest of its network ) .
Even Verizon , which is dropping $ 18 billion on the job , is doing so in the very sort of environment that Johnson says will sink the ' Net — one where neutrality is assumed and differential protocol pricing is not utilized .
And what " charging by the bit " has to do with peering remains a mystery ; peers choose to " peer " ( exchange traffic freely ) with one another because they exchange roughly similar amounts of data .
Customer billing methods do n't affect this decision .
Besides , data increasingly fails to pass through the big Tier 1 providers anyway .
New research out today from Arbor Networks and the University of Michigan shows that " over the last five years , Internet traffic has migrated away from the traditional Internet core of 10 to 12 Tier - 1 international transit providers .
Today , the majority of Internet traffic by volume flows directly between large content providers , datacenter / CDNs and consumer networks .
Consequently , most Tier - 1 networks have evolved their business models away from IP wholesale transit to focus on broader cloud / enterprise services , content hosting and VPNs . "
What 's most odd about Johnson 's argument about network neutrality is that she admits that this is default network behavior right now .
And while she frets about the huge growth of Internet traffic , the reality is that the growth rates have been much faster in the past ( doubling every year or faster ) — and the Internet abides !
As for ISPs not having the money to invest in enough infrastructure to keep up with demand , well just take a look at ISP balance sheets .
Tremendous profits are being made now , even as cable operators roll out DOCSIS 3.0 tech and boost download speeds to 50 Mbps or 100 Mbps .
In the end , the song remains the same : of course the Internet has issues , but some kind of network - killing " exaflood " has n't materialized in two years and does n't look about to wreak devastation on the Internet in the near future .
What we have instead is declining traffic growth rates in mature markets , and big boosts to access line capacity ( for Verizon and the cable operators , at least ) , plenty of bandwidth in the core — all on a network that has generally been neutral for decades .

Printer Friendly ... Interactive IPython Shell for IDA Python Author : sagar # Views : 13818
( post updated )
We all use IDA Python and it kicks ass !
But sometimes opening scripts all the time by hitting ALT+9 is annoying .
So why do n't we have an interactive console with all IDA Python features ?
I 've created an IDA Python script that creates an interactive console based on IPython .
This console lets you run any IDA Python function but interactively .
Since it 's based on IPython you can also take advantage of its cool features , like tab autocompletion , magic commands , command history , aliases , etc ( http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/manual/html/interactive/tutorial.html).
Some screenshots :
You can get the script at :
http://www.ribadeohacklab.com.ar/tools/scripts/IPythonShell/IPythonShellGTK.py
Requirements :
- pyGTK , pyGobject and pyCairo ( http://www.pygtk.org/)
- IPython ( http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/FrontPage)
A minor problem this still has is that you must close the IPython Console before closing IDA Pro or it will give an access violation .
I 'll work on that in another release .
I 've been told this blocks IDA .
So far I only had problems while running the debugger .
If the console is used when doing a static analysis it seems nothing is blocked .
If you find issues , please let me know .
Some ideas for the future :
- create a nicer console with some built - in things you can run just pressing buttons in a toolbar .
- another version but using pyQT .
Hope you enjoy it !

Good work Sagar !
If you can make it not block IDA while the console is showing it would be even nicer .
ero Posted : Wednesday , October 14 2009 04:36.18 CDT
Very cool !
Although it 's probably worth mentioning that since IDA 5.5 one can use IDA 's command - line with Python , interactively .
Definitely not as cool as using IPython , but it does n't block and gets the job done .
sagar Posted : Wednesday , October 14 2009 06:34.16 CDT
Thanks for the feedback guys .
@lallous :
Honestly , I did this very quickly , so I did n't notice it was blocking IDA :(
I 'll see if I can fix that .
@ero : I knew about the command - line , but as you said , is much cooler having IPython features ( magic commands , autocomplete , full CMD shell , etc ) .
Any ideas to include in this console will be appreciated !
QvasiModo Posted : Wednesday , October 14 2009 11:58.54 CDT
Very good work ! :)
Just out of curiosity , how feasible would it be to do this without GTK , using a normal Windows console only ?
sagar Posted : Wednesday , October 14 2009 22:05.12 CDT
I have an IPython shell running embedded in a windows console .
The main thing here is that in order to do that we would need to run the window console in other process , so the python enviroment ( which is running in idag. exe process ) wo n't be the same .
The good thing about running this with pyGTK is that it is really running in ida process and that is why you can do things interactively .
I thought about creating a simple XMLRPC server which exposes an IPython shell running so you could connect any console ( with any GUI you like ) and use it .
I have n't tested this too much but so far it seems that a basic XMLRPC server does n't block IDA .
But if I try to run an RPYC server it does .
Another option might be to patch the IDAPython plugin to be able to run the embedded python interpreter in a different thread without blocking anything .
I do n't have much experience developing IDA plugins so these are just random thoughts .
Thanks everyone !
lallous Posted : Thursday , October 15 2009 02:35.22 CDT sagar :
Note that IDA does not support multi- threading yet , so any call to IDA 's API must be carried from the main thread .
There is a new function in 5.5 called execute_sync ( ) that will execute instructions in IDA 's main thread context .

Great script !
Thanks !.

Wife No. 2 Paying for Wife No. 1 ? Join the Club Massachusetts ' 2nd Wives Club lobbies to change rules on alimony payments .
Nov. 6 , 2009  --
Stress over alimony payments to her husband 's ex-wife nearly drove Deborah Scanlan to divorce .
Helping her husband make alimony payments to his ex forced Jeanie Hitner to take on a second job .
Both Massachusetts women now say they wish they 'd never gotten married .
Welcome to the 2nd Wives Club .
The club , which claims 70 members and counting , consists mostly of married women who say that Massachusetts judges ' rulings forced them to contribute to alimony payments for their partners ' ex-wives .
Together with its parent group , Mass Alimony Reform , the club is lobbying the state legislature to stop that practice and institute several reforms to alimony law .
Scanlan , the club 's chairwoman , says she is paying the price for her husband 's divorce .
She said that because a judge took into account her $ 58,000 income as an executive assistant , her husband Daniel Gingras ' alimony payments total $ 26,000 a year -- about $ 16,000 more than they would otherwise .
" I was absolutely horrified that I was now responsible for a portion of the support of his first wife , " she said .
On the day of the judge 's alimony ruling in her husband 's case , Scanlan said , " I left the court house and just could n't believe that such a thing was possible . "
Gingras ' ex-wife did not return calls from ABCNews.com seeking comment .
How often a second wife 's ( or second husband 's ) income is factored into alimony payments nationwide is unclear , though Massachusetts does n't appear to be unique .
In Louisiana , for instance , an appellate court ruled in 1994 that a lower court had improperly reduced an alimony award to a first wife because it had n't considered a second wife 's income .
Unlike child support statutes , state laws on alimony are often vague , said Andrea Carroll , a law professor at Louisiana State University .
This means , she said , that courts in other states could very well make rulings similar to the one in Louisiana .
How widespread the practice is in Massachusetts , meanwhile , is up for debate .
Making Ends Meet
Denise Squillante , the president - elect of the Massachusetts Bar Association said that , in her experience , judges look to a second spouse 's income as a source of alimony only when the alimony payer has been found to be in contempt of a court order to pay up .
" Judges do n't say , ' OK , former husband , your income is x and your new wife 's income is y , so we 're going to add those incomes together and enter an alimony order . '
That does n't happen , " she said .
Founders of the 2nd Wives Club and Mass .
Alimony Reform disagree .
It 's requests for payment modifications by either side that can ultimately ensnare a second spouse into a court 's alimony decisions , they said .
Jeanie Hitner , vice president for the 2nd Wives Club and the wife of Mass Alimony Reform President Steve Hitner , said that her husband asked a state court for a reduction in his payments after his printing business began to struggle .
It was rejected .
" The reason for the denial was all about ME …and what I should be doing to help my husband , " Jeanie Hitner wrote in a message to ABCNews.com .
" The judge in her findings said that ' Your current wife needs to supplement your income so that you can continue to make the alimony payments . ' "
Hitner , who works at her husband 's business , said she took on tutoring jobs to help make ends meet .
Both the 2nd Wives Club and Mass Alimony Reform are pushing for a bill that would include a number of reforms to state alimony laws , including preventing a judge from considering a second spouse 's income and assets when making changes to alimony .
Squillante said the Massachusetts bar opposes the bill , saying it would hamper judges ' discretion and could create unintended consequences .
State Sen. Cynthia Creem , a family lawyer who has called for a commission to study alimony reform , questions what should happen to alimony recipients if their ex-husbands decide to quit working entirely and rely on their new spouses instead .
( Steve Hitner said the bill backed by his group would allow such situations to be judged on a case - by - case basis . )
In the meantime , some women say they 're doing what Scanlan and Hitner only wish they had done -- they 're not getting married in Massachusetts and avoiding the alimony issue altogether .
The 2nd Wives Club said its membership increasingly includes such women , too .
Elizabeth Benedict is a New Yorker who has dated a divorced Massachusetts man since 1999 .
A supporter of the 2nd Wives Club , Benedict said she decided against marriage years ago , on the advice of several lawyers .
" I decided that if I was going to get married , " she said .
" I was not going to then invite a lawsuit as a wedding present . "
This guest post was contributed by Lawrence B. Glickman , who teaches history at the University of South Carolina .
He put the fight for the Consumer Financial Protection Agency in historical perspective in his previous post on this blog .
A recent ad taken out by the “ The Center for Consumer Freedom ” marks the latest assault by business lobbyists and conservatives on the idea of consumer protection .
This organization ’s motto — Promoting Personal Freedom and Protecting Consumer Choice — defines consumer freedom as “ the right of adults and parents to choose how they live their lives , what they eat and drink , how they manage their finances , and how they enjoy themselves . ”
Like other critics of consumer protection , this organization ( “ supported by over 100 companies , ” according to its website ) speaks in the name of freedom and depicts consumer protection as an assault not only on the liberty but on the intelligence of ordinary people .
The ad begins with the following rhetorical question , “ Are you too stupid …to make good personal decisions about foods and beverages ” ?
Arguing against the “ campaign to demonize soda ” the advertisement blasts “ food cops and politicians ” for “ attacking food and soda choices they do n’t like . ”
Another of their ads warns about “ Big Brother ” in the “ Big Apple ” because New York City is considering taxes on junk foods and sugar - laden sodas .
[ The group ’s print ads can be seen here . ]
A nearly identical line of criticism is currently being deployed against President Obama ’s proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency .
Richard Shelby , the Republican Senator from Alabama , finds the proposal “ disturbing and somewhat offensive ” because it relies on the “ concept of the intellectually deficient consumer . ”
Jeb Hensarling , a Congressman from Texas , worries that “ un-elected bureaucrats ” might “ decide if we can have a credit card . ”
Scott Garrett , his fellow Republican colleague from New Jersey , is worried about the “ Orwellian , government - bureaucrat - knows - best mentality ” evinced by the proposal .
Opponents of consumer protection have long spoken in the name of individual liberty .
They have done so by misconstruing the nature of human agency and freedom in the modern world .
At least as far back as the Progressive era , many Americans noted that industrial society –in which consumers did not produce their own food and drink and often lived far from such sites of production –called for federal regulation and protection to insure that the food we bought was safe .
This was the essence of the landmark 1906 Pure Food and Drugs Act and it was the meaning of presidential candidate Woodrow Wilson ’s statement in 1912 that “ freedom today is something more than being let alone .
The program of a government of freedom must in these days be positive , not negative merely . ”
Wilson and other progressives– - including members of the Republican Party , such as Theodore Roosevelt– - recognized that extending freedom in the twentieth century required a federal government capable of regulating business .
In Wilson ’s view , federal regulation of the sort provided by the 1906 Pure Food law did not substantially restrict the freedom of individual Americans .
It instead instilled confidence that the market for food and drugs would be stripped of poisonous and dangerous goods .
The freedom that is restricted by consumer protection laws is the freedom of businesses to sell dangerous or even poisonous goods .
By preserving confidence in the marketplace , such regulations allow consumers the freedom to make choices , and therefore esteem the intelligence of the American people .
Of course , regulation can become excessive and Americans need to balance individual autonomy with federal protection .
( So too can federal assistance go in the other direction : one of the reasons businesses ply Americans with unhealthy food is that subsidies to agribusiness make possible the cheap production of high fructose corn syrup .
Thus , these defenders of the free market ignore the inconvenient fact that the playing field is not truly level . )
The claims of business lobbyists that common sense regulation amounts to incipient totalitarianism , however , demonstrate their unwillingness to accept what has become over the last century a fundamental part of the social contract , and which makes tangible true freedom of choice .

Do you really like the concept of the Multimedia Dock for the Motorola Droid but refuse to buy it because – heck – you ’ve already got an alarm clock and ca n’t justify the $ 30 purchase ?
What if I told you that you could have the Multimedia Dock for FREE … just … not the hardware ?
DockRunner is an application on Android Market that , when entered , makes your Droid think it is in the Multimedia Dock and gives you all the goodies like live location - based weather , media player , alarm clock , image slideshow and a nice big digital clock .
Your Droid will remain in Multimedia Dock mode until you try to re-enter the application through the application launch icon .
Personally I already purchased the Multimedia Dock and I rather like it , but this is a nice alternative .
Unfortunately , without the dock , the MicroUSB plug gets in the way if you ’re trying to finagle it onto your nightstand , dresser or whatever else to sit upright like the actual dock allows .
A quick fix – if the developer is listening – would be to spoof the orientation of the phone and display the application upside down so that you can safely put your Droid on a flat surface , lean it against something and have the plug protrude out the top .
At the end of the video I mention how I just saved you $ 30 and you should PayPal me .
I was joking , of course , but your gratitude should go towards the folks at ActiveFrequency.com who developed Dock Runner and provided it free to all of us .
Plus some props to David who sent in this tip – great find !
So yeah … you can PayPal them instead .
Or me .
Either way .
The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement is a proposed copyright treaty that contains provisions that criminalize non-commercial file - sharing ; require net - wide wiretapping for copyright infringement and border - searches of hard - drives and other devices ; and disconnection from the Internet for people accused of violating copyright .
The actual text of these provisions is a secret , though , as the treaty is being negotiated away from the UN , behind closed doors ; the Obama administration denied a Freedom of Information
Act request for it on the grounds that it is a matter of " national security . "
The NGO Knowledge Ecology International pressed the US Trade Rep on this , and received a reply stating that 42 DC insiders — including some reps from activist groups — have been shown the treaty , after signing a vow promising to treat it as classified .
KEI has researched the 42 people and their bios and corporate affiliations .
Sherwin Siy of Public Knowledge describes his experiences with the secret treaty :
Our first exposure to any text was on fairly short notice .
We were allowed to view a draft of one proposed section as we sat in a room at USTR with some of its negotiators and counsel .
We were not allowed to take any copies of the text with us when we left the meeting about an hour later .
We were urged to keep any notes we took secure , and not to discuss the substance of what we saw unless USTR confirmed that the other party had also seen the text .
The meeting proceeded with USTR discussing each point of the text in turn as we viewed it for the first time and compared the text to existing statutes , trade agreements , and treaties .
We were invited to set up additional meetings or call USTR to confirm our recollections if we wanted to verify what we remembered from the meeting , as we were not allowed to photograph , scan , or ( presumably ) transcribe the documents .
We were told that some edits might be made in the near future to account for various concerns .
A meeting a few weeks later convened a range of people who had been cleared to see the text , and functioned as a roundtable , at this meeting , a slightly altered version was shown , which in some areas was slightly better , in some slightly worse , but without some of the most troubling aspects resolved .

Reuters asked " what about the PS3 and the Wii ? " and here is his full answer :
Eventually we want to be on all the game consoles , all the Blu-ray players , all the Internet TVs .
So we are working in parallel with all of those efforts .
Currently our Xbox deal is exclusive and we have n't characterized it more than that .

Going further , Reuters asked if there were any partnership talks with Apple , specifically regarding the iPhone .
While Hastings said something might happen long term , it is not a near - term goal .
" We are not focused on mobile yet , but on the TV , on Blu-ray , and on the video game consoles . "

NEW YORK , Oct 26 ( Reuters ) -
The plunge in U.S. newspaper circulation is accelerating , according to the latest figures released on Monday , as more people cancel their subscriptions and publishers cut distribution and sales of discounted copies .
Average weekday circulation at 379 daily newspapers fell 10.6 percent to about 30.4 million copies for the six months that ended on Sept. 30 , 2009 from the same period last year , according to the U.S. Audit Bureau of Circulations .
The pace of decline more than doubled compared with last year .
From September 2007 to September 2008 , circulation fell 4.6 percent .
Sunday circulation , which was measured at 562 papers , fell 7.5 percent to 40 million copies .
Last year ’s Sunday decline was 4.9 percent .
None of the top 25 papers by circulation made any Sunday gains in the latest figures .
The results measure paid circulation and are a key measure for businesses deciding where to spend their advertising dollars .
Newspaper publishers want advertisers to measure readership -- the number of people estimated to read a copy of the paper -- a number that is growing at most papers .
Circulation at only one U.S. paper rose among the top 25 ; News Corp ’s Wall Street Journal said circulation rose 0.6 percent to 2.02 million .
It took the top position in size after Gannett Co Inc GCI.N reported a 17 percent circulation decline for USA Today as hotels cut back free copies of the paper .
News Corp fared less well with the New York Post , whose weekday circulation fell almost 19 percent .
Its daily tabloid rival New York Daily News , owned by Boston Properties BXP.N co-founder Mort Zuckerman , reported a 14 percent decline .
The New York Times 's NYT.N daily circulation fell 7.3 percent , while Sunday circulation , where it is the No. 1 paper in the U.S. , fell 2.7 percent .
The Boston Globe , which the Times until this month was trying to sell , reported an 18.5 percent decline .
Among other top 10 U.S. dailies , Tribune Co's TRBCQ .PK
Los Angeles Times posted an 11 - percent drop and the Chicago Tribune fell 9.7 percent .
The Washington Post WPO.N reported a 6.4 - percent drop on weekdays and a 5 - percent drop on Sunday .
Three top 25 papers , The Star - Ledger in Newark , New Jersey , Hearst Corp 's San Francisco Chronicle and AH Belo's AHC.N Dallas Morning News , reported declines of more than 20 percent .
Mostly smaller papers populated the list of top gainers .
The best was the York Daily Record in southern Pennsylvania with a 16.5 percent weekday rise .
Others included the Las Vegas Review - Journal , the New Haven Register in Connecticut and the Fargo Forum in North Dakota .

Ziua nuntii este cea in care totul trebuie sa decurga perfect .
Tu trebuie sa arati impecabil , invitatii sa se simta minunat , iar fotografiile sa aiba un cadru natural de exceptie .
Planificarea , secretul unei nunti perfecte Daca ne dorim o nunta perfecta este necesar ca aceasta sa fie planificata minutios , cu o buna perioada de timp inainte de fericitul eveniment .
Cel mai important lucru ramane insa sa ne urmarim interesele proprii , pentru ca atunci cand prietenele vor afla ca ne planificam nunta , vom primi o mai multe sfaturi , ce vor intra in siguranta in contradictie .
Cel mai bine ar fi sa apelam la sfatul unui mentor , o persoana cu o experienta mare de viata in care sa avem incredere , sau daca aceasta nu exista , este cel mai bine sa angajam o agentie de evenimente .
Alegerea rochiei de mireasa este adevarata piatra de temelia a nuntii .
Desi suntem tentate sa ne alegem o rochie cat mai somptuoasa , cu multe accesorii , este necesar sa ne gandim ca aceasta vine la pachet cu un cost ridicat si poate deveni obositoare la un moment dat .
Rochia cu un design simplu ne va oferi o nota eleganta si un farmec personal cu atat mai mare , cu cat aceasta va avea putine accesorii , alese cu gust .
Albul nu mai este in trend in aceasta perioada , iar rochia noastra poate avea si culoarea ivoriu , gri deschis sau auriu .
Rochia va fi completata cu o pereche de cercei menita sa ne sublinieze linia delicata a gatului , precum si de un colier fin , menit sa estompeze decolteul si de o bratara fina .
Mireasa perfecta trebuia sa aiba pantofi comozi Secretul unei nopti linistite consta si in perechea de pantofi pe care ne-am ales - o .
Desi nu multe dintre noi stim , pantofii sunt elementul cu care trebuie sa incepem , iar acestia trebuie cumparati inainte de a ne alege rochia , deoarece aceasta va fi aleasa in functie de inaltimea tocului si de modelul pantofilor .
Modelul ales trebuie sa fie cat mai comod , deoarece ziua nuntii va fi lunga si nu trebuie sa uitam de un accesoriu obligatoriu : un set de pernite de silicon , ce vor fi asezate in interiorul pantofilor si care ne vor oferi un plus de confort .
Asortati rochia alba cu un telefon iphone de culoare alba .
O atentie deosebita trebuie sa acordam gablonturilor .
Nu trebuie sa exageram cu numarul acestora si nici cu piese foarte scumpe , deoarece riscam sa avem un aer vulgar .
Interesant ar fi ca acestea sa fie montate intr-o bijuterie hand made , cu o montura ce ne va scoate in evidenta personalitatea .
Atata manichiura , cat si coafura si machiajul trebuie sa arate imperial .
Coafura si machiajul trebuie insa alese cu o atentie deosebita , intrucat acestea vor trebui sa ne puna intr -o lumina cat mai favorabila si trebuie sa reziste cel putin pe o durata de 24 de ore .
Tenul ar trebui sa fie pregatit special pentru nunta , asa incat ar fi bine sa incepem un tratament cosmetic cu o perioada mai lunga de timp inainte sa aiba loc nunta .
Pentru toate acestea este recomandat sa apelam la specialisti in domeniu , nu sa facem experimente cu ar putea sa ne ruineze nunta .
Fossil - Funded Group Succeeds in Spreading Lies About How Much Water Desert Solar Uses
The Heartland Institute , the infamous fossil - industry - funded climate denier group that faked 500 scientists to deny climate change , is now creating a new fake narrative about water use in utility scale solar .
They did a very thorough job of disseminating their 500 supposed skeptic climate scientists story ; as Desmogblog notes – helpfully printing 150,000 copies for distribution across the US including 850 journalists , 26,000 schools , “ 19,000 leaders and politicians ” .
Now they are working on a new disinformation narrative :
That solar power uses more water than traditional oil , gas , coal and nuclear power .
Their story is now that Environmentalists Oppose Mojave Desert Solar Power .
But the quotes come not from “ environmentalists who oppose desert solar power ” , but from another fossil - funded think tank .
Here ’s their false claim about water use ( with a bonus false claim about land use ) :
“ With solar power plants having a much larger footprint and demanding more water for power generation than traditional power plants require , battle lines between environmental activist groups are being drawn in the desert sand . ”
Solar power plants actually demand less water than traditional power plants .
Much , much less :
As much as 60 times less , according to the ( pdf ) Report to Congress on Concentrating Solar Power Commercial Application Study : Reducing Water Consumption of Concentrating Solar Power Electricity Generation .
Of all the kinds of solar power , the one that uses the most water is wet cooled solar thermal trough concentrated solar power .
Even this ; the most profligate water user of all the utility - scale solar technologies uses 60 times less water than nuclear , 50 times less water than coal , and 20 times less water than gas , per megawatt hour of electricity generated .
( And solar also has a much smaller footprint than coal , as Grist writer Gar Lithow demonstrates . )
But battle lines are supposedly being drawn in the sand because of this supposed solar thirst .
But who are these environmental groups ?
Tom Tanton is one .
Environmentalists Oppose Mojave Desert Solar Power :
Tom Tanton , a senior fellow for energy studies at the Pacific Research Institute said ,
“ It ’s not just the construction of the solar farms but the ongoing maintenance of the plants that further encroach on habitats ” .
Tanton is also disturbed by the preferential treatment wind and solar projects receive .
“ They already get favoritism in the form of tax credits ; they should not get it when it comes to habitat conservation .
It ’s time to stop extreme favoritism for wind and solar and make them play by the same rules , ” Tanton said .
“ Sacrificing anything , especially endangered species , to enable one of the dumbest modern energy ideas imaginable is anathema , ” Tanton added .
While using the catch - phrases of environmentalism ( encroach on habitats , habitat conservation , endangered species ) note how Tanton ’s actual argument here is that ( supposedly ) un-subsidized traditional electricity is not getting a fair shake .
This assertion does n’t pass the smell test ; when one group of “ environmentalists ” demands a fair shake for traditional ( fossil - fueled ) electricity plants .
Climate change will make many species extinct , forget their habitat conservation .
Turns out the quotes actually come from the Pacific Research Institute – which , like The Heartland Institute ; is yet another front group funded by Chevron , Exxon and the Koch Foundation .
It is frustrating to see resistance being created to utility - scale solar over cleverly propagated water myths .
Yet I always assumed that the environmental resistance was genuine .
Now I am not so sure that at the heart these are not fundamentally astro - turfed movements where we environmentalists are being cynically manipulated by the fossil industry .
The Heartland Institute has also put out well propagated myths about wind turbines ’ supposed bird kills .
Now the organization has successfully generated an echo in the environmental movement to the effect that solar in the desert uses too much water .
There has been a whole spate of articles about desert solar thermal with wild claims about water use .
But since when did we environmental writers get our facts from organizations that work to keep us wedded to fossil fuels ?
It is sad to see these lies about water use dutifully make the rounds of the environmental blogs as if this is a fact - based objection .
Can people be persuaded that a common good is bad for the environment ?
People can .

Mozilla will add a new lockdown feature to Firefox 3.6 that will prevent developers from sneaking add - ons into the program , the company said .
The new feature , which Mozilla dubbed " component directory lockdown , " will bar access to Firefox 's " components " directory , where most of the browser 's own code is stored .
The company has billed the move as a way to boost the stability of its browser .
" We 're doing this for stability and user control [ reasons ] , " said Johnathan Nightingale , manager of the Firefox front - end development team , in an e-mail today .
" Dropping raw components in this way was never an officially supported way of doing things , which means it lacks things like a way to specify compatibility .
When a new version of Firefox comes out that these components are n't compatible with , the result can be a real pain for our shared users .
" Now that those components will be packaged like regular add - ons , they will specify the versions they are compatible with , and Firefox can disable any that it knows are likely to cause problems , " Nightingale added .
His mention of " regular add - ons " referred to the new policy that will be enforced by Firefox 3.6 , a minor upgrade to last summer 's 3.5 that is to ship before the end of the year .
Because third - party developers will no longer be able to drop their code into the components directory , they must instead recreate their add - ons as XPI - based files , the standard Firefox extension format .
Mozilla has posted information on its developer site to aid programmers who need to migrate add - ons to the XPI format .
Most , but not all , Firefox add - ons are available through Mozilla 's Add - On site , which boasts that more than 1.6 billion add - ons have been downloaded by users .
Nightingale said that rogue add - ons created performance and stability problems for Firefox users .
" [ They ] can lead to all kinds of unfortunate behavior : lost functionality , performance woes and outright crashing , often immediately on startup , " he wrote in a post to the Mozilla developer 's blog Monday .
Quoted today in the Times is an executive courageous enough to speak to the climate of persecution sweeping the land :
" The investment community feels very put-upon .
They feel there is no reason why they should n't earn $ 1 million to $ 200 million a year , and they do n't want to be held responsible for the global financial meltdown . "
Indeed .
Imagine being blamed for a crisis you caused .
And we know that 200 million a year is n't what it once was , what with price of Carribean islands and gas for private jets .
Thankfully , there is one intrepid journalist pushing back against the effort to castigate the super - rich .
Paul Sullivan of the New York Times .
ALL THE ANGER AGAINST THE RICH MAY BE UNHEALTHY BEATING up on the wealthy seems to be the order of day .
I suspected that .
But a recent Wealth Matters column touched a particularly raw nerve .
It looked at how even people with sizable fortunes were concerned about money in this recession and the impact that could have on the rest of us .
Readers rejected the attempt to understand the concerns of the rich .
“ That ’s so stupid that you ought to be slapped for it , ” one woman wrote .
My favorite began : “ Bowties and Reaganomics are for losers .
You can cry for the rich all you want , the rest of us will be happy to see them get taxed . ”
The vehemence in these e-mail messages made me wonder why so many people were furious at those who had more than they did .
And why are the rich shouldering the blame for a collective run of bad decision - making ?
After all , many of the rich got there through hard work .
And plenty of not - so - rich people bought homes , cars and electronics they could not afford and then defaulted on the debt , contributing to the crash last year .
But in this recession , anger flows one way .
Good point .
During a financial crisis caused by political and financial elites , we should blame the victims : poor people , preferably minorities .
' Cause that never happens .
Sullivan astutely points to the danger that this mean talk about rich people poses to the next generation :
[ T ]he risk is creating a generation that distrusts investing and associates wealth with greed .
Pity the children .
But an even more alarming danger is that all this icky populist anger might force politicians to create a more just and humane society .
We can't have that .

H1N1 Genetic Changes in RBD Raise Pandemic Concerns
Recombinomics Commentary 19:09
November 8 , 2009
Right now we know that many clinical specimens and viruses have been sent to one of the WHO collaborating centres for further study .
We do n't know the results of those studies , and it will probably take a couple of days for the full analysis of those viruses to be available .
The above comments are from Thursday 's WHO press conference and raise concerns that the sequences from Ukraine ( see map ) have small changes which may include receptor binding domain changes .
Several such changes have been seen in previously published sequences and position 225 has been of concern .
That position was linked to the establishment of amantadine resistance in seasonal H3N2 and raises concerns that such a change in swine H1N1 could make the virus more virulent .
In seasonal flu , the change was D225N , and that change is in at least three swine flu sequences , including two from fatal cases in San Paulo , Brazil collected in August ( see list here ) .
The same position has also changed to D225G , which was also found in other fatal cases in San Paulo , Brazil .
It is also in more recent ( September ) isolates from China ( see list here ) .
The new polymorphism most widely reported in sequences in Genbank is D225E , which is common in recent sequences from Italy ( see list here ) .
Thus , similar changes in sequences from Ukraine would be of most interest , and such changes have not been ruled out by WHO statements thus far .
The release of these sequences from Ukraine is now overdue , and these delays increase pandemic concerns .
I 'm going to begin by making a slight correction .
Last time while I talked about sandstones and carbonates , I did not explain the second group very well .
And because the structure of a carbonate field is often quite different from one that occurs in sandstone , I am going to put the more generic post on production from carbonates off another week .
Save only to say that the carbonates are usually limestones ( including chalks ) and dolomite , and that because these are very fine grained rocks , but easier to dissolve , the oil is more often found in the joints and cracks and dissolved holes in these rocks , than it is evenly spread through the rock .
In contrast , with sandstone , the oil is often in the pore spaces that are spread throughout the rock , and so let 's assume for now that we 've got oil within a sandstone layer .
Ah , but hold on a moment gentle folk , are n't we forgetting that to get the oil out of the ground , it first has to get to the well .
The basics of this are n't particularly complex , but within this topic of oil well production lies a scientific reason that production goes down in an oil field as the field gets older .
We got oil !
We have put together the drill , mounted it on the derrick , circulated mud and drilled a well and used casing to line it , and a Christmas Tree to control it , and we found a layer of rock with the right porosity , and it has oil in it .
Hell - lo , Beverly Hills !
The sketch shows three different layers of oil lying next to a well .
In the top case none of the little pockets of oil connects to another , nor do any reach the well .
( Like the holes in a swiss cheese they can be large , but are not connected one to another . )
If the entire rock were like this , even though it had porosity , and a fair bit of oil , none of it could be extracted , since none of it could flow to the well .
Now we can make a path for such oil to get to the well , but this artificial stimulation of the well ( through hydrofracing and its variants ) is a secondary process that we will also leave until later .
What we need is a clear path that connects all the oil that sits between the grains of sand to have a path to the well , similar , perhaps , to that shown by the second layer of green ( for oil ) in the sketch .
The existence of flow paths in the rock is known as the permeability of the rock .
It is a measure of how easy it is for oil to move through the passageways that it finds in the rock .
These are the interconnected spaces , and the fractures and breaks that occur in the rock .
The law describing the flow of fluid through rock is known as Darcy 's Law .
( I ’m not actually putting the equation in the post – but it can be found at the citation , together with the terms that go into it . )
However , in simple terms it says that the volume of liquid flowing through a rock is going to be a function of the area of the rock through which the flow occurs , multiplied by the pressure difference between the two faces at each end of the flow path , multiplied by a constant which is related to the ease with which the oil can flow through the rock , and divided by the length of the rock path .
We ’ll assume that the volume that the rock will flow through is a constant ( it 's the side of the well ) , so the area over which the flow will take place is also a constant .
When we had reached the rock just above the oil reservoir we had a break while we discussed the difference in pressure between the fluid in the well and the fluid in the rock .
At the time we set the well pressure at 3,000 psi and the pore pressure , the pressure of the oil in the rock , at 5,000 psi .
The difference in pressures , that 2,000 psi is the driving pressure that will push / pull the oil to move it to the well .
This is the pressure drop that exists in the rock from the background pressure to the well .
( As the oil flows the pressure along the path that it flows will start to drop . )
The hydraulic conductivity is a phrase used to describe the resistance that the rock gives to the oil moving through it .
( You might think of it as a reverse friction -- in other words the higher the number the less resistance there is to flow . )
A wide crack in the rock , with almost smooth sides ( the third row above ) has a higher conductivity than the second where the gap is narrower and more tortuous .
And let us just say for now that the length is the distance from the well to the point that the oil pressure is equal to the original pressure when the drill reached the rock .
( We call that the original pore pressure . )
Now you might think that with the original 2,000 psi difference , that I used above , between the pore pressure and the well pressure that the oil would really gush from the well .
And yes it might - but we do n't want that and so we tighten the choke to reduce the difference in pressure between the well and the pore pressure , and the flow slows down .
However , as the flow of oil starts to move towards the well , it does not flow evenly through the rock .
Think of watching rain hit a pile of freshly dumped earth .
At first , as the rain falls it runs evenly over the surface .
But as it does it finds some layers of soil are weaker , and others have been compacted a bit more .
And so the water erodes the softer , less compacted soil , and the water near those channels finds it easier to flow into them .
And so after a while the water coming off the pile is no longer evenly flowing but is cutting grooves in the soil and all the water is coming out of those channels .
Rain on a tilled field in Iowa - note that the rain is already starting to cut channels .
In many ways the rock carrying the oil acts the same way .
The two channels in the top picture are in the same rock , with the same oil , but it is much easier for oil to flow through the bigger channel , and it will be at much less pressure drop than it takes to get oil to flow out of the thinner crack .
And with the flow of the oil the channels in which it does flow well get bigger , reducing further the flow through the narrow channels , and trapping , or stranding the oil that is left in them .
Piece of sandstone , showing the grains
Now you might think that this has , initially to be a great difference .
Well , here is a picture of a piece of sandstone I had in my office .
It is at first glance made up of grains of about the same size and were it full of oil you might think that oil would flow evenly through it .
( It has no oil in it - - oily rock looks black and it is hard to make out the features I am talking about due to lack of contrast . )
But if you look more closely ( and I have zoomed in a bit on one area above the 6 - inch marker ) you might see a thin connected path wandering through the sandstone .
( I have marked it with arrows . )
That line is one of higher permeability .
I have been on a site where the ground was supposed to be as evenly sized and permeable as this sandstone , if not more .
A test was being run in which my hosts had pumped some fluid into the rock .
Since they did not get the result they wanted , they dyed the next batch of water a bright color and pumped it into the ground .
They then dug a hole over the site , and looked down the side to see the thick colored layer that they expected to find .
They needed a magnifying glass , all the fluid ( hundreds of gallons ) had gone into a single flaw , about the size of the one shown in the two pictures , and none anywhere else .
For those who ca n’t see it very well , here is a picture of a block of sandstone outside the Oil Museum in Stavanger that I took this afternoon , and you should be able to see a number of larger fractures that have been naturally recemented running through the block )
However , while we were injecting fluid in the case just above , the opposite can happen if one is not careful in drawing the oil from a well .
The initial production can create flow paths through the rock , leaving isolated patches of oil that are not recovered on either side .
But hold - on you say surely if we just keep dropping the pressure ( by opening the choke ) then eventually we will have enough difference to move even that oil .
Well , No !
( You may have noticed I am becoming a relatively negative person . )
I was reading " The Color of Oil " by Michael Economides and Ronald Oligney when I first drafted this post .
It is a very fast ( even more so than this ) spin around the world of oil , but I am going to use their numbers ( page 32 - 33 ) for this next bit .
The oil inside the pores of the rock is initially assumed , for now , to be at the same pressure as the burial depth of the rock ( due to geological movement this is a very , very simplifying assumption , but let 's make it ) .
But as we let the oil flow out of the rock this pressure , which is caused by the oil and rock compression will get less .
While the oil can expand and flow , the rock does not , and so after a while there is no pressure difference between the oil and the fluid in the well .
The oil stops moving because the differential pressure has gone away .
Professor Economides
" Recovery of 3 percent or less of the initial oil in place can make the reservoir pressure equal to the pressure at the bottom of the hole .
When this occurs , fluids are no linger driven into the well and 97 % of the original oil is left " in place " in the reservoir .
This defines primary recovery , the most elemental but generally unacceptable ending point in petroleum exploitation . "
What else can we use as a driving force ?
Well , some posts back I mentioned the analogy of a bottle of champagne .
Shake it , pop the cork , and the dissolved gas in the wine will fountain it out over the happy celebrants .
But after the fizz is gone , there will still be some wine in the bottle .
It is the same sort of thing that happens with the oil .
Oil usually contains gas dissolved within it .
As the pressure within the oil drops , this gas begins to come out of the liquid .
( Slowly release the cap on a bottle of soda water and you will see the same thing . )
( Note that this does not change the pressure in the well , and thus reduces the difference or driving pressure moving the fluid to the well . )
Professor Economides continues :
" A specific ( lower ) pressure level called the " bubble - point " pressure marks the onset of natural gas evolution , known as the solution gas .
When this level is reached ( the point at which this occurs depends on the specific crude ) , recovery can increase substantially to 15 % or more . "
Now let 's go back to our example of the two bottom layers of oil in the top sketch .
The bottom one will flow oil faster and draw oil from further out , than the upper one .
As the pressure in the larger channel drops , as it empties , the remaining oil in the channel will start emitting gas .
While the gas will rise , overall , to give a gas layer above the oil , it will also flow more easily into the well than the oil in thinner channels .
If the reservoir engineer is not careful at this point , all of a sudden he may find that all he is getting out of the well is gas .
( Take a drinking straw and sucking gently move it down onto the top of water in a glass .
Note that the straw has to be in the water before you can drink any .
If you had machine strength suction and you do n't so DO NOT TRY , you would find that if the straw was within half an inch of the water you might start to get a little , but effectively you wo n't get much . )
So it is with the oil well .
You need to be drawing from the oil zone only to keep oil production happening .
However , going back to Darcy 's Law ( in itself an application of Newton 's Law ) as the well has produced the oil and the compression has come off the oil as some of it left , the pore pressure in the rock has gone down , and thus the difference in pressure between the well and the rock is less .
With less of a “ push ” the flow of oil from the well will also get less , and with no further stimulus , the oil flow will gradually stop as the difference between the pressure in the rock and in the well reached the same level , and if this were all that happened then it would leave about 85 % of the well in the ground , and sometimes that does occur .
However , if you remember from the first post where I talked about rock pressure , there can often be water under the oil .
Simplified sketch of an oil bearing layer in the ground .
This water can provide some pressure on the oil above it , and as the oil flows up into the well , the water can rise up into the pore spaces that the oil has left , and keep some of the pressure on the oil a little longer .
Professor Economides :
" If a large water aquifer is in contact with the petroleum reservoir , a natural drive mechanism can be provided by natural water influx .
The larger the aquifer , the more effective and the more long - lived this drive mechanism tends to be .
If a strong water drive is in effect , 10 to 25 % of the oil in place can be recovered . "
Once that is over , and with 25 - 40 % of the oil recovered , then in a conventional well the oil is at the same pressure as the fluid in the bottom of the well , and no more oil will flow .
To get the rest out will require some form of pumping .
And yes , one of the ways to increase the production is to pump water , under pressure , below the oil level to keep the pressure up .
But to discuss that , and other steps in enhanced oil recovery are topics for another day .
But for now remember , it is not the oil in the reservoir that has been depleted , at this point , it is the force ( the differential pressure between the oil and the well ) that has been reduced , and finally gone away , and with it the oil production .
Unfortunately because driving pressure and permeability are so inter - twined this has been a long post .
And yet I still may have glossed over some points too rapidly .
So as usual if there are questions or discussion or correction , please comment .
The Department of Justice has finally admitted it in court papers :
The nation 's telecom companies are an arm of the government – at least when it comes to secret spying .
Fortunately , a judge says that relationship is n't enough to quash a rights group 's open records request for communications between the nation 's telecoms and the feds .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation wanted to see what role telecom lobbying of the Justice Department played when the government began its year - long , and ultimately successful , push to win retroactive immunity for AT&T and others being sued for unlawfully spying on American citizens .
The feds argued that the documents showing consultation over the controversial telecom immunity proposal were n't subject to the Freedom of Information
Act since they were protected as " intra - agency " records :
" The communications between the agencies and telecommunications companies regarding the immunity provisions of the proposed legislation have been regarded as intra-agency because the government and the companies have a common interest in the defense of the pending litigation and the communications regarding the immunity provisions concerned that common interest . "
U.S. District Court Judge Jeffery
White disagreed and ruled on September 24 that the feds had to release the names of the telecom employees that contacted the Justice Department and the White House to lobby for a get - out - of - court - free card .
" Here , the telecommunications companies communicated with the government to ensure that Congress would pass legislation to grant them immunity from legal liability for their participation in the surveillance , " White wrote .
" Those documents are not protected from disclosure because the companies communicated with the government agencies “ with their own ... interests in mind , ” rather than the agency ’s interests . "
The feds were supposed to make the documents available Friday , but in a motion late Thursday , the Obama administration is asking for a 30 - day emergency stay ( . pdf ) so it can file a further appeal .

Innovations developed for the race are adopted by large car makers
One of the world 's toughest endurance races for solar and hybrid cars is underway in Australia .
The Global Green Challenge takes competitors over 3,000 km ( 1,864 miles ) of the country 's harshest terrain from tropical Darwin to southern Adelaide .
The early front - runner after the first day is a team from Japan .
The race aims to highlight advances in hybrid , electric and low emission vehicles as well as those propelled by the sun .
Japan 's Tokai University car is powered by some of the world 's most innovative solar cells and leads other entrants from the United States , the Netherlands and Britain .
Copenhagen message
The sort of aerodynamic design and tyres that improve fuel efficiency , which the competition has showcased over the years , have increasingly been adopted by large car makers .
With the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Denmark just a few weeks away , Professor John Storey , an astrophysicist from the University of New South Wales , says the race shows that the motoring industry can adapt to environmental challenges .
" Going into Copenhagen I would see this event as being , if you like , the ray of sunshine on the horizon in the future to say that look if we have to cut our CO2 by 20 % , 30 % , 50 % or more , it 's not the end of the world . "
This iconic and gruelling transcontinental race is celebrating its 10th anniversary .
It has attracted 35 teams from more than a dozen countries .
The first cars are expected to cross the finish line in Adelaide , the capital of South Australia , on Wednesday or Thursday .

Foreign Policy has just published a list of its “ top 100 global thinkers ” and the winner is …
1. Ben Bernanke
for staving off a new Great Depression .
Chairman , Federal Reserve | Washington
The Zen - like chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve might not have topped the list solely for turning his superb academic career into a blueprint for action , for single - handedly reinventing the role of a central bank , or for preventing the collapse of the U.S. economy .
But to have done all of these within the span of a few months is certainly one of the greatest intellectual feats of recent years .
Not long ago a Princeton University professor writing paper after paper on the Great Depression , “ Helicopter Ben ” spent 2009 dropping hundreds of billions in bailouts seemingly from the skies , vigilantly tracking interest rates , and coordinating with counterparts across the globe .
His key insight ?
The need for massive , damn - the - torpedoes intervention in financial markets .
Winning over critics who have since praised his “ radical ” moves ( including Nouriel Roubini , No. 4 on this list ) , he now faces an uphill battle in his bid for permanently expanded Fed powers .
The radicalism is far from over .
The challenge of global warming has captured the attention of politicians around the world .
The following article is part of a series leading up to the December U.N. conference in Copenhagen on how ordinary people in different countries view the issue :
When he first got sick , Samson Banda did n't realize he had malaria .
Only after he came down with a serious fever did he end up at a clinic in the Bauleni slum compound in Lusaka , Zambia .
The clinic has just a few nurses and staff with basic medical skills ....
There is a point in every family when it 's time for the talk .
No , not that talk .
Not that one either .
I 'm talking about the science - and - math talk .
The kind of talk that should happen every time your child is having trouble or even just working on homework .
Most parents , having been through primary school themselves at some point , have a difficult time with this talk .
In fact , according to a recent survey conducted through the Intel Corporation , parents are more comfortable talking with their kids about drugs than about science and math .
Some key points from the survey :
More than half ( 53 percent ) of parents of teenagers admit that they have trouble helping their children with math and science homework .
Nearly a quarter of parents ( 23 percent ) who admit to being less involved in their child 's math and science education than they would like say their own lack of knowledge in these subjects is a key barrier .
Another 26 percent of parents who are less involved than they would like wish there were a one - stop shop with materials to refresh their existing , but unused math and science knowledge so they can better help their kids .
Talking about drugs is easier for parents because it's a vague subject .
It does n't have much depth to it .
You can get the message across in just a couple of short sentences , or an example of someones ' life gone wrong thanks to the influence of drugs .
Not to mention , it 's a talk that almost every competent parent has with their child at some point in their lives , right up there with the good ol ' sex talk .
Science and math are not vague subjects .
Not only is there extreme depth to be found , but there is commonly a generational gap between the parent and the child .
Science and math have n't changed , but the amount of knowledge and the understanding has .
We know more as adults than when we were children , but we have to relate to them on a child 's level , rather than on an adult - level understanding of the material .
This is where it becomes difficult for parents .
Shelly Esque , vice president of Intel 's corporate - affairs group , explains the challenge :
Our survey points to a difficult reality for our nation 's parents :
While they may recognize the importance of math and science , they are unable to engage with their children around these subjects due to limited understanding of the topics and scarcity of resources to help .
We need to help parents help their kids make the best choices , including taking math and science courses so they are prepared to succeed .
Even though 98 percent of parents believe that science and math are critical to the future of the country , and 91 percent believe that parental involvement is key to their children 's success , parents are still having trouble talking to their children about science and math .
Sure , it 's easy to express the importance of the subjects , but when it comes down to actually doing something – that is where we 're lacking .
Even I have trouble helping with math and science sometimes .
Not because I 'm not knowledgeable , but because it's hard to transfer my knowledge to that of an 8 - year - old .
The problem is , parents recognize that math and science are critical to their child 's future success , but they also realize that speaking to their children about drugs and alcohol is critical to their child 's survival .
Especially when it comes to talking to teenagers , it 's hard enough just saying hello to them , much less trying to connect with them on their schoolwork .
So the drug talk is always easier .
What parents need , and – as the survey data mentioned above shows – they know they need .
is help .
Normally I 'd say that it 's all up to the parents , and they should work on the effectiveness without outside intervention .
However , when a company like Intel is willing to step up and put in the time and resources to come up with solutions to assist parents in connecting with their children on math and science , I 'll make an exception .
Through its initiatives it 's looking to bridge the gap and create tools that parents can use to better understand what their children are working on and what they can do to help .
Shelly Esque again :
Over the past decades , Intel has worked extensively with teachers , students , communities and governments to help inspire and prepare the next generation of innovators with a solid math and science education .
We have n’t , though , worked with parents , who we think are a critical piece of the education equation .
Our goal in releasing the results of this survey is to raise awareness among parents that they are n’t alone in their challenges so they feel more confident seeking out assistance to encourage their kids to take an interest in math and science , and we hope resource providers will come forward to help them .
Parents , take note .
When a company like Intel is stepping in to provide a means to assist you in bridging the educational gap with your children , take full advantage .
To that point , if you have the resources to help , feel free to do so .
While it 's important that your kids grow up drug - free and healthy , it 's just as important that they grow up educated as well .
You can almost guarantee that the less you focus on their education , the more you are going to be focusing on the drug talks .

When it looked to redesign its dominant operating system after the struggles of Windows Vista , Microsoft reportedly turned to Apple 's Mac OS X for the " look and feel " of Windows 7 .
Simon Aldous , partner group manager with Microsoft , told PCR that the graphical style of Windows 7 — which he calls " Vista on steroids " — was inspired by the look of Apple 's Mac OS X .
The new Windows operating system launched in October .
" One of the things that people say an awful lot about the Apple Mac is that the OS is fantastic , that it 's very graphical and easy to use , " Aldous said .
" What weâve tried to do with Windows 7 — whether it 's traditional format or in a touch format — is create a Mac look and feel in terms of graphics .
We 've significantly improved the graphical user interface , but it 's built on that very stable core Vista technology , which is far more stable than the current Mac platform , for instance . "
One of the more obvious similarities between Windows 7 and Mac OS X is the new taskbar .
By default , the Windows 7 taskbar acts much like the dock that has been in OS X , combining program applications for both launching and accessing open windows , with only one icon per running application .
And like Expose with the OS X dock , Windows 7 allows users to glimpse open windows on the taskbar before selecting them with Aero Peek .
The similarities between Windows 7 and Apple 's latest operating system upgrade , Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard , were noted by The Wall Street Journal 's Walt Mossberg in his review of the Microsoft software .
He said he believes that the Mac OS is still the superior operating system , but only slightly .
Snow Leopard had a head - start on Windows 7 , launching in late August to positive reviews that praised the software 's performance improvements and bargain $ 29 price .
Consumers also responded positively to Mac OS X 10.6 , with initial sales doubling that of its predecessor , Leopard , and coming in four times higher than Tiger .
I was in a local Sainsbury supermarket yesterday looking for organic margarine .
Reading the label of their own brand ‘ Olive Spread ’ I found it contained only 4 % virgin olive oil .
There were pictures of olives on the tub !
The major ingredient was palm oil .
How can they get away with such misleading labelling ?
I have asked them , watch this space … .

Antifascist Calling
Monday , August 31 , 2009
You have to hand it to congressional Democrats .
Mendacious grifters whose national security agenda is virtually indistinguishable from Bushist Republicans , when it comes to rearranging proverbial deck chairs on the Titanic , the party of “ change ” is second to none in the “ all terrorism all the time ” department .
While promising to restore the “ rule of law , ” “ protect civil liberties ” while “ keeping America safe , ” in practice , congressional Democrats like well - coiffed Republican clones across the aisle , are crafting legislation that would do Dick Cheney proud !
As the Cybersecurity Act of 2009 ( S.773 ) wends its way through Congress , civil liberties ’ advocates are decrying provisions that would hand the President unlimited power to disconnect private - sector computers from the internet .
CNET reported August 28 , that the latest iteration of the bill “ would allow the president to ‘ declare a cybersecurity emergency ’ relating to ‘ non- governmental ’ computer networks and do what ’s necessary to respond to the threat . ”
Drafted by Senators Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) and Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) , “ best friends forever ” of the National Security Agency ( NSA ) and the telecommunications industry , they were key enablers of Bush - era warrantless wiretapping and privacy - killing data mining programs that continue apace under Obama .
As The New York Times revealed in June , a former NSA analyst described a secret database “ code - named Pinwale , that archived foreign and domestic e-mail messages . ”
The former analyst “ described being trained in 2005 for a program in which the agency routinely examined large volumes of Americans ’ e-mail messages without court warrants .
Two intelligence officials confirmed that the program was still in operation . ”
Antifascist Calling has noted on more than one occasion , that with “ cyberterrorism ” morphing into al - Qaeda 2.0 , administration policies designed to increase the scope of national security state surveillance of private communications will soon eclipse the intrusiveness of Bushist programs .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
As Cindy Cohn , the Legal Director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) wrote earlier this month , commenting on this summer ’s public relations blitz by former NSA boss Michael Hayden and Office of Legal Counsel torture - enabler John Yoo ’s defense of the so - called Presidential Surveillance Program ,
While the details are unknown , credible evidence indicates that billions of everyday communications of ordinary Americans are swept up by government computers and run through a process that includes both data - mining and review of content , to try to figure out whether any of us were involved in illegal or terrorist - related activity .
That means that even the most personal and private of our electronic communications –between doctors and patients , between husbands and wives , or between children and parents–are subject to review by computer algorithms programmed by government bureaucrats or by the bureaucrats themselves .
( Cindy Cohn , “ Lawless Surveillance , Warrantless Rationales , ” American Constitution Society , August 17 , 2009 )
Both Rockefeller and Snowe are representative of the state ’s “ bipartisan consensus ” when it comes to increasing the power of the intelligence and security apparatus and were instrumental in ramming through retroactive immunity for telecoms who illegally spy on the American people .
If last year ’s “ debate ” over the grotesque FISA Amendments Act ( FAA ) is an indication of how things will go after Congress ’ summer recess , despite hand - wringing by congressional “ liberals , ” S.773 seems destined for passage .
CNET revealed :
When Rockefeller , the chairman of the Senate Commerce committee , and Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) introduced the original bill in April , they claimed it was vital to protect national cybersecurity .
“ We must protect our critical infrastructure at all costs–from our water to our electricity , to banking , traffic lights and electronic health records , ” Rockefeller said .
( Declan McCullagh , “ Bill Would Give President Emergency Control of Internet , ” CNET News , August 28 , 2009 )
But as we witness practically on a daily basis , hysterical demands for “ protection ” from various “ dark actors ” inevitably invokes an aggressive response from militarized state security apparatchiks and their private partners .
As Antifascist Calling reported in July ( see : “ Behind the Cyberattacks on America and South Korea .
‘ Rogue ’ Hacker , Black Op or Both ? ” ) , when North Korea was accused of launching a widespread computer attack on U.S. government , South Korean and financial web sites , right - wing terrorism and security specialists perched at Stratfor and the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) – without a shred of evidence–linked the cyber blitz to a flurry of missile tests and the underground detonation of a nuclear device by North Korea .
Adding to the noise , Rep. Peter Hoekstra ( R - MI ) , the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee went so far as to urge President Obama to respond–by launching a cyberattack against the bankrupt Stalinist regime .
Despite provocative rhetoric and false charges that might have led to war with disastrous consequences for the people of East Asia , as it turned out an unknown sociopath used an updated version of the MyDoom e-mail worm to deploy a botnet in the attack .
As Computerworld reported , the botnet “ does not use typical antivirus evasion techniques and does not appear to have been written by a professional malware writer . ”
Hardly a clarion call for bombing Dear Leader and countless thousands of Koreans to smithereens !
In this context , the Cybersecurity Act of 2009 goes much further than protecting “ critical infrastructure ” from over - hyped cyberattacks .
Among other measures , Section 18 , “ Cybersecurity Responsibilities and Authority , ” hands the Executive Branch , specifically The President , the power to “ declare a cybersecurity emergency and order the limitation or shutdown of Internet traffic to and from any compromised Federal Government or United States critical infrastructure information system or network . ”
This does not simply apply to federal networks , but may very well extend to the private communications ( “ critical infrastructure information system or network ” ) of citizens who might organize against some egregious act by the state , say a nuclear strike against a nation deemed responsible for launching a cyberattack against the United States , as suggested in May by the head of U.S. Strategic Command ( STRATCOM ) General Kevin Chilton .
As I reported in June ( see : “ Cyber Command Launched .
U.S. Strategic Command to Oversee Offensive Military Operations ” ) , the military ’s newly - launched U.S. Cyber Command ( CYBERCOM ) is a “ subordinate unified command ” overseen by STRATCOM .
Would “ message force multipliers ” embedded in the media or Pentagon public diplomacy specialists carrying out psychological operations ( PSYOPS ) here in the heimat , become the sole conduit for critical news and information during said “ national emergency ” ?
Additionally , under Section 18 ’s authority The President “ shall designate an agency to be responsible for coordinating the response and restoration of any Federal Government or United States critical infrastructure information system or network affected by a cybersecurity emergency declaration under paragraph ( 2 ) . ”
What agency might Senator Rockefeller have in mind for “ coordinating the response ” ?
As Antifascist Calling revealed in April ( see : “ Pentagon ’s Cyber Command to Be Based at NSA ’s Fort Meade ” ) , CYBERCOM will be based at NSA headquarters and led by Lt. General Keith Alexander , the current NSA director who will oversee Pentagon efforts to coordinate both defensive and offensive cyber operations .
How might an out - of - control Executive Branch seize the initiative during an alleged “ national emergency ” ?
Paragraph 6 spells this out in no uncertain terms : “ The President may order the disconnection of any Federal Government or United States critical infrastructure information systems or networks in the interest of national security . ”
The draconian bill has drawn a sharp rebuke from both civil libertarians and the telecommunications industry .
Larry Clinton , the president of the Internet Security Alliance ( ISA ) told CNET : “ It is unclear what authority Sen .
Rockefeller thinks is necessary over the private sector .
Unless this is clarified , we cannot properly analyze , let alone support the bill . ”
And Wayne Crews , the director of technology studies at the rightist Competitive Enterprise Institute ( CEI ) told Federal Computer Week : “ From American telecommunications to the power grid , virtually anything networked to some other computer is potentially fair game to [ President Barack ] Obama to exercise ’ emergency powers ’ . ”
True enough as far as it goes , these “ free market ” cheerleaders are extremely solicitous however , when it comes to government defense and security contracts that benefit their clients ; so long as the public is spared the burden of exercising effective control as cold cash greases the sweaty palm of the market ’s “ invisible hand ” !
As Antifascist Calling revealed in June ( see : “ Obama ’s Cybersecurity Plan : Bring on the Contractors ! ” ) , the ISA is no ordinary lobby shop .
According to a self - promotional blurb on their web site , ISA “ was created to provide a forum for information sharing ” and “ represents corporate security interests before legislators and regulators . ”
Amongst ISA sponsors one finds AIG ( yes , that AIG ! )
Verizon , Raytheon , VeriSign , the National Association of Manufacturers , Nortel , Northrop Grumman , Tata , and Mellon .
State partners include the U.S. Department of Homeland Security , Congress , and the Department of Commerce .
Indeed ISA and CEI , are firm believers in the mantra that “ the diversity of the internet places its security inescapably in the hands of the private sector , ” and that “ regulation for consumer protection ” that rely on “ government mandates ” to “ address cyber infrastructure issues ” will be “ ineffective and counter - productive both from a national security and economic perspective . ”
CEI and ISA ’s solution ?
Let ’s have another gulp of that tasty “ market incentives ” kool - aid !
In other words , hand over the cash in the form of taxpayer largess and we ’ll happily ( and profitably ! ) continue to violate the rights of the American people by monitoring their Internet communications and surveilling their every move through nifty apps hardwired into wireless devices as the Electronic Frontier Foundation revealed in a new report on locational privacy .
Unfortunately , Clinton , Crews and their well - heeled partners seem to have forgotten an elementary lesson of history : a national security state such as ours will invariably unwind its tentacles into every corner of life unless challenged by a countervailing force–a pissed - off , mobilized citizenry .
Now that national security “ change ” chickens are coming home to roost , both CEI and ISA seem incredulous : you mean us ?
How ’s that for irony !
Lee Tien , a senior staff attorney with EFF told CNET that changes to the original version of the bill do not address pressing privacy concerns .
Tien told the publication : “ The language has changed but it does n’t contain any real additional limits .
It simply switches the more direct and obvious language they had originally to the more ambiguous ( version ) … The designation of what is a critical infrastructure system or network as far as I can tell has no specific process .
There ’s no provision for any administrative process or review .
That ’s where the problems seem to start .
And then you have the amorphous powers that go along with it . ”
McCullagh avers : “ Translation :
If your company is deemed ‘ critical , ’ a new set of regulations kick in involving who you can hire , what information you must disclose , and when the government would exercise control over your computers or network . ”
And there you have it , a “ cybersecurity ” blacklist to accompany a potential state takeover of the Internet during a “ national emergency . ”
What will they think of next !

Amid all the controversy about the hacked e-mails of climate scientists comes an ABC - Washington
Post poll that says a majority of Americans believe that global warming is happening and that a cap on greenhouse gases should be imposed nationally .
That 's a drop of 8 percentage points ( thanks , Don ! ) compared with those believed in global warming a year ago ( and a drop of 12 percentage points over the past three years ) .
Juliet Eilperin of The Post explains the change in numbers this way :
The increase in climate skepticism is driven largely by a shift within the GOP .
Since its peak 3 1/ 2 years ago , belief that climate change is happening is down sharply among Republicans -- 76 to 54 percent -- and independents -- 86 to 71 percent .
It dipped more modestly among Democrats , from 92 to 86 percent .
A majority of respondents still support legislation to cap emissions and trade pollution allowances , by 53 to 42 percent .
Among Democrats , 86 percent believe the world has been getting warmer ( down 6 percentage points from 2006 ) .
Among Independents , believers number 71 percent ( 15 percentage points less than three years ago ) .
A scant majority of Republicans also believe : 54 percent ( 22 percentage points less than in 2006 ) .
Seventy - five percent of respondents 18 to 29 think that global warming is happening ; along with 72 percent of those 30 to 64 , and 68 percent of those over 65 .
College grads were more likely to be believers that non-grads , 77 to 70 percent .
You can read the all the other questions that were asked and see the graphics about the poll answers here .
There was a Pew Research poll last month that had fewer people believing in climate change and more skeptics .
Will these changing attitudes have any effect on what happens at the upcoming climate - change conference in Copenhagen ?
Politics Daily notes :
President Obama plans to go to Copenhagen next week to attend the early rounds of a U.N. climate summit , which is drawing delegations from 192 countries .
Fifty - five percent of Americans believe that the U.S. should act on global warming even if other countries do less ; 21 percent say the U.S. should take action only if other countries do ; and 22 percent say the U.S. should not take action at all , according to the Post / ABC poll .

Its new guidelines , which are different from those of some professional and advocacy organizations , are published online in The Annals of Internal Medicine .
They are likely to touch off yet another round of controversy over the benefits of screening for breast cancer .
Dr. Diana Petitti , vice chairwoman of the task force and a professor of biomedical informatics at Arizona State University , said the guidelines were based on new data and analyses and were aimed at reducing the potential harm from overscreening .
While many women do not think a screening test can be harmful , medical experts say the risks are real .
A test can trigger unnecessary further tests , like biopsies , that can create extreme anxiety .
And mammograms can find cancers that grow so slowly that they never would be noticed in a woman ’s lifetime , resulting in unnecessary treatment .
Over all , the report says , the modest benefit of mammograms  reducing the breast cancer death rate by 15 percent  must be weighed against the harms .
And those harms loom larger for women in their 40s , who are 60 percent more likely to experience them than women 50 and older but are less likely to have breast cancer , skewing the risk - benefit equation .
The task force concluded that one cancer death is prevented for every 1,904 women age 40 to 49 who are screened for 10 years , compared with one death for every 1,339 women age 50 to 59 , and one death for every 377 women age 60 to 69 .
The guidelines are not meant for women at increased risk for breast cancer because they have a gene mutation that makes the cancer more likely or because they had extensive chest radiation .
The task force said there was not enough information to know whether those women would be helped by more frequent mammograms or by having the test in their 40s .
Other experts said women with close relatives with breast cancer were also at high risk .
A German shepherd K - 9 in Ventura County should be eligible for a bump in hazard pay ( read : more treats ) after having a seizure that may be drug - related .
Officials say K - 9 Balu may have inhaled some loose methamphetamine Monday during a narcotics search in Moorpark , the Ventura County Star reported :
The deputies believed they saw the suspect toss two bags of drugs , and they recovered one torn bag of methamphetamine , ( Balu's partner Senior Deputy Dean Worthy ) said .
While he was searching for more drugs , Balu went to the area where the first bag was tossed and alerted Worthy , said the senior deputy .
Balu got close enough to the spilled drugs that Worthy worried his K - 9 partner might have sniffed some of it up , but there were no remnants of drugs on the dog's face , and he was acting fine , Worthy said .
But two hours later , the dog had a seizure and was rushed to an emergency veterinary clinic .
At the clinic , Balu was treated for ingestion of methamphetamine .
" He seems to be doing OK , " Worthy told the Ventura County Star .
" The risk is always there , which is why the handler and dog stay close together . "
Worthy stayed with Balu until the dog was released Tuesday , Capt .
Ross Bonfiglio told the newspaper .

Webster , a Christian conservative who served nearly three decades in the Florida legislature and served as House Speaker , said in a statement that despite encouragement from supporters he was prompted to “ follow a principle that has always served me well : ‘ When in doubt , do n’t . ’ ”
“ I do firmly believe that in every public office there needs to be a resurgence of the basic principles on which this Republic was founded , and a return to our original standards of integrity and character , ” he said .
To be fair about Grayson , he 's not simply eloquent and knowledgeable ; he 's also rich .
If he were poor but outspoken , he 'd probably find Republicans lining up to run against him -- or more likely , Rahm lining up a Republican to run against him in a primary as a Democrat .
But if he keeps going the way he currently is , I agree it 's unlikely Grayson 's going to get a reasonable opponent .
A wingnut ?
Sure !
But someone who 's electable from among the Republicans ?
Hard to see that happening .
And I 'm frankly very glad of it , too .
whole
what do you suppose those people would consider a position of strength ?

Florida crime buster Alan Grayson has been ahero ever since we first met him in 2007 as the " longshot " candidate to unseat entrenched GOP incumbent Ric Keller .
Even as Grayson was rolling up a victory in the primary over a worthless " good ole boy hack , " Establishment Democrats were endorsing the opponent .
If Grayson was good back then , he 's 10 times better now -- one of the most effective members of Congress , not just from Florida , but from anywhere .
On the House Financial Services Committee , he 's been driving Republicans and their bankster paymasters insane with his hard - hitting and uncomfortably direct questions for witnesses who expect to be handled with kid gloves .
Grayson did n't bring any kid gloves with him to Congress .
Lately he and Republican free spirit Ron Paul have been a thorn in the side of a Federal Reserve , demanding , on behalf of taxpayers that we get to know who the Fed loaned out $ 2 TRILLION of our money to in the last two yearsBen Bernanke is confirmed by the Senate .
The GOP has been on overdrive trying to draft a challenger to Grayson , who they claim is their # 1 target .
But every single Republican they 've tried to recruit has looked at the landscape -- including Grayson ' large and growing popularity with his constituents -- and declined .
Yesterday the last hope the Florida Republican Party had for a credible candidate , Dan Webster , said he 'd decided to join the rest of the right - wingers too scared to face Grayson .
Instead , Republicans will pick between two extremist kooks , teabaggers Patricia Sullivan and Dan Fanelli , both so radical and insane that mainstream Orlando Republicans are likely to sit this one out .
Aside from being the scourge of Republicans and their bankster and war profiteering buddies , Grayson is one of the 32 Democrats taking issue with the Obama Administration 's plans to expand the war in , and maintain the occupation of , Afghanistan .
He 's also a cosponsor of Barbara Lee 's bill , HR 3699 to deny funds for escalation .
Take a look at the list of the 32 Democrats at the No Means No page and notice the way netroots enthusiasm for Grayson has manifested itself .
I bet this has a lot to do with why the Republicans can't find a legitimate candidate to take him on !
Yesterday evening Ken urged President Obama and his aides to look at Grayson as an example of what happens when a Democrat stands up for his principles and for his constituents and refuse sto back down for the obstructionists , the special interests or the media Big Lie machine .
I want to second that .
It 's a far better model than the Rahm Emanuel strategy of marginalizing progressives on behalf of corporate donors adamant about maintaining the status quo .
Meanwhile , Politifail has an interesting take on the disconnect between the GOP / corporate media spin on Grayson 's political ife expectancy and the hard reality ; worth reading !
And there 's still ...
Getting Grayson 's Back Our friend Balakirev added this excellent comment to my post :
You 're right , B , there are other factors playing in Grayson 's favor , starting with his ability to self - finance his campaign .
FL -08 has also been trending increasingly Democratic in voter registration .
Those and several other factors are important , and I do n't mean to discount them .
I 've heard laments from friends in southern Virginia , for example , that Tom Perriello has been as steadfast in maintaining his outstanding principles in the large number of town halls he has held to explain his positions and listen to this constituents ' , and that many of those constituents respect him for it but nevertheless leave thinking that his views are " too Democrat . "
For sure , this matters .
But that 's why I started my notes on the Grayson situation yesterday by pulling out that blog comment confidently predicting that Dan Webster would defeat Grayson by more than 10 points in 2010 .
I want us to remember until how recently the Conventional Wisdom was that Grayson 's House career was over , just waiting for the circling R's to decide on a candidate .
The counting of the votes would be a mere formality .
And that continued to be the Conventional Wisdom when Grayson took his stand on the Republicans ' nonexistent health plan .
For the first day or two , the R's werehe had just driven the final nail in his own coffin , and a lot of non -R 's wondered too .
But by standing his ground so forcefully and sensibly , he actually overturned the Conventional Wisdom -- and to the extent that he solidified his position among the home voters , I do n't think they 're thinking about his ability to self - finance .
So no , it 's not thestory , and that matters .
But it 's a part of the story that Rahm Emanuel will never understand .
Remember that in 2006 , when the Conventional Wisdom attributed the Dems ' startling House electoral triumph to opposition to the Iraq war , the fact was that , because he considered it a losing issue .
Again , though , with Master Rahm we have to consider that it may not be just a matter of strategy .
Looking back , it seems clear that he never opposed the Iraq war , any more than he supports all the progressive initiatives we 're told by Dem leadership have to be deferred " until we have the votes . "
I suspect that on such issues for Rahm there would n't ever be such a thing as " enough " votes .
As for the applicability to the national Democratic Party , including the current Democratic president and overwhelmingly Democratic Congress , an online colleague made a pithy observation I should have cited yesterday .
If , as appears to be the case , the Obama administration considers itself to be operating from a position of cliff - teetering weakness , making it necessary for " Actual Obama " to maintain a healthy distance from " the Image of Obama , " to reprise Tom Tomorrow 's exquisite terms

In an odd exposé that has left the worlds of politics and academia abuzz , a local homeless person revealed yesterday that he only blamed himself for his failures .
The incident occurred near the dumpster behind the Shop Rite store in Brooklyn , when Willard Kookish , formerly of 435 Subprime Lane in Nutly , NJ , casually told a reporter that " my problems are my own fault . "
The veteran New York Times reporter Ken McLiar , who has been searching area dumpsters for a 3,785 - part series on people who are homeless due to the evils of American capitalism , admits he was astonished by Mr. Kookish 's bizarre confession .
When asked to elaborate , Mr. Kookish went on to say , " I went through college drinking and smoking dope and never learned anything .
I 've had many job opportunities but did n't bother to show up .
My family left me a nice house to live in but I took out home equity loans on it and spent the money on hookers and gambling .
When the housing boom collapsed I lost everything .
I made bad decisions and here I am bearing the consequences . " ~
The startling revelation has left many in the community troubled by what it may portend for society at large .
" It should be illegal to talk like that " , said Marge Stumpko , an angered low - wage waitress from Lower Skunkworks , NY .
" Are n't we all our brother 's keepers ?
Is that all you 're leaving for my tip , turdface ? "
Floyd Grabbuck , a community organizer from Chicago , furiously described Mr. Kookish 's statement as " un-American and downright traitorous , " suggesting that " If that ungrateful rat - bastard does n't like how we do things in this country , maybe he should move to a place like Russia where the government does n't care for its subjects and see how he likes it there . "
Eddie Fuppish , a mismarked ballot corrector from Franken , Minnesota , sounded more conciliatory : " The poor man needs help .
Anybody that takes responsibility for his own actions is certifiably insane .
Just look at all the big businesses selling you stuff for money .
Do n't tell me you are in control of your own spending or anything else for that matter .
You 're not .
That 's why I vote Democratic and make sure other people do the same , even if they did n't mark their ballots that way .
It 's the right thing to do .
People need to be protected . "
Experts , on whom the incompetent depend to explain the complicated world they fail to understand , are unanimous .
" It 's Reagan 's fault , " says Professor Wilton Chumpley , a consulting sociologist from the University of Twerp in Belgium .
" Remember how in the 1980s that actor - president mislead people into thinking they could spend their own money and run their own lives without expert help ?
And then you had that crackpot economist Milton Friedman falsely claiming that the government should n't be responsible for directing people 's existence .
It made less sense than the UFO stories , at least for smart people like myself .
But , tragically , some fools took it seriously ; it ruined their lives . "
President Obama has not commented publicly on the controversy but has privately told aides that " former President Bush is not getting off the hook for the economy , the War in Iraq , Hurricane Katrina or Willard Kookish 's failures on my watch . "
Sources speculate that Kookish 's mortgage default will be added to the list of indictable offenses against former Bush Administration officials .
Reverend Al Sharpton excoriated Kookish 's " arrogant fantasy , " calling it " blame the victim " rhetoric from the right and predicting that the incident would set race relations in the US back fifty years , even though Kookish is white .
" It do n't matter who the victim is , it 's who 's doing the blaming that makes it wrong , " Sharpton said .
Regardless of the troubling short - term fallout from the incident , the long term trends are clear .
" We need to make people understand they do n't matter , " stated House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
" Having become cogs in the huge state machine , they can't be allowed to think independently and control their lives ; that 's what we 're here for . "
Pelosi stressed the inevitability of new taxes and government programs in order to liberate people from such delusions .
" People like Willard Kookish better get this through their thick skulls : it 's not their fault , it 's society's .
And that 's why they need President Obama and the Democrat - controlled Congress to subdue this country in order to fix it . "

Blessed be Comrade Peloski
It 's been a long week Nanski , you worked so hard .
I have a lovely video just for you ............
I 'm so glad that Nanski Peloski is here so that I do n't have to be , er , here .
What would I do if I were responsible for myself ?
Once I was responsible .
I went to school and did well .
I went to college and got a degree .
I did n't cheat , and it was a degree which simply did n't let me bullshit because it was quantifiable .
The answers were right or not , and did n't care who held the pencil .
But that was before I saw the light and became a progressive .
As a progressive I feel so much better now , knowing that the world is responsible for me .
I used to worry that I was supposed to do something for the world , you know , like all those public - service ads say I should , but then I realized that a true progressive always says exactly the opposite of what s/h / it means .
You mean someone is actually not blaming Obama or Bush for their financial troubles ?
Thank you comrade Grigori for marvelous example of glorious Soviet talent .!
Is thing of beauty !!
I am searching for more of these talents and hope to find !

It 's been a long week Nanski , you worked so hard .
I have a lovely video just for you ............
This man needs help .
He is deranged .
Look at him .
He 's holding up a sign , a sure sign , of his own will , his own accord , of self reliance .
First , he must immediately be listed as an ACORN worker , and get his housing allowance .
Then , he can be enrolled in AmeriCorps , with extracurricular group therapy meetings to make him understand that with every breath he takes , he is destroying the planet , but above all , evil Kapitalist businesses are destroying the planet , and they must be destroyed , and instead of standing on street corners holding up signs , he needs to stand up on street corners holding signs for any union workers who strike against evil kapitalist corporations .
Above all , he must be made and kept dependent .
Dependent on the government for his housing , dependent on unions for his worker rights , dependent the government for his food stamps , and dependent on the government for his health care .
Only then , will he be on his way to being straightened out .
He is a project only a made prog who works as hard as Saint Nanski Peloski will be able to fix , but it can be done .
This poor man needs re-education !
Holding anti-revolutionary banners like that is dangerous .
All right thinking people know the current economic hardships are the result of years of oppression by the capitalist warmongers and not the ordinary citizens !
O.K. , so a few decided to get houses they could never afford in the first place , but is n't that why we are redistributing the wealth around ?
This poor comrade needs some time in a re-education center and fast !
and he needs to be cleaned up too !
( although I dont mind the beard , after all , if it was good enough for Marx and Engels , it 's good enough for him ... )
Comrade Leninka is correct about Saint Nanski Peloski .
See :
Comrade Boris ,
You 're welcome .
I try to showcase the best from the Motherland .
That video was a lovely performance by Анастасия Приходько ( young lady on the right ) and Полина Гагарина ( young lady on the left ) . " Я тебя не прощу " is a beautiful song about betrayal from both sides .
This Willard Kookish person needs to report to the nearest E.O.L. Counseling Clinic .
It will be easy to spot .
They 're right in front of the buildings with green smoke coming from the chimneys .

Self determination ?
Pfft , I have n't had an independent thought since I was reeducated , and I 'm assured that I 've never been happier .
I learned long ago that the path to security lies in obsequious groveling at the feet of The Party .
Therefore , I think Mr. Creepy Hobo needs more toad in his diet .
That 'll set him straight .

Commissar , I must question your revolutionary dedication .
If you were a true progressive
you would say " the world is responsible to me " not responsible for me .
This is not some pseudo - communist nanny state .
You are supposed to be an elite among exhalted dictators .
How are we to teach the proles to develop malignant - entitlement - syndrome with you making freudian slips ?
How will we ever elevate the mindset created by the peoples hero

Ask the native population in our border regions :
What is propelling the Jew -- and has been propelling him for centuries ?

WAIT A SECOND KOMRADES , WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ?
Let us not be so hard on Willard Kookish .
Of course our first reaction is one of repulse and horror to his sign and his words , but let us step back for a moment and see what this really is .
A cry for help to the progressive community and a real wanting to finally assign the real reason for his current status , as a complete loser and leech on society .
He is seeking a way to finally have someone tell him the words he wants to shout out , are okay after all .
He just does n't know how to do it yet .
How do I know this Comrades ?
It is all there in his sign .
There is a subtle code in the sign that underlies the mental turmoil roiling in his mind right now .
He may think he is blaming himself , but his inner mind betrays the fact that this is really not the case after all .
I 'll demonstrate :
Before an examination of his sign and looking at the deeper clues involved in his thought processes .
After examination the undeniable conclusion after all .
His current confused mental state is not allowing him to put the ' S ' and the ' H ' in the proper place yet , but he is close Comrades , so close !
Let 's not beat up on him and instead help him get to the finish line as to who is really to blame for his situation after all .
DAMN THAT GEORGE BUSH !

Oh , Wills , sometimes I just get tired of blaming the world .
You know , it 's all someone else 's fault .
Have you ever , and this is hard for me , ever thought that all this progressive stuff was just [ looking around nervously ] a bunch of whining , self - exculpatory bullshit by a bunch of childish wankers ?
I mean , if ...
All right , Bruno !
All right !
I 'm know I skipped last week 's Jiffi-Lobo appointment !
I 'll go now .
Right now !
Put down that stiletto heel , you ditzy queen !
Put it down , I say !
I 'm a made progressive , Bruno .
I just had a , er , slight slip .
Everyone does .
It wo n't happen again .
It 's everyone else 's fault .
I know that .
I 'm not to blame .
I 'm not responsible for myself .
What 's mine is mine and what 's yours is mine too and if I can get it it was n't nailed down .

How then will we make capitalist pigs true downtrodden and ignorant ?

Commodore Snoogie you are correct in observation but you have divulged state secret of our work .
We do not want this criminal to be able to spell and construct intelligent sentence or even understand why he is bum .
If he blame self good then he will not blame us .
It is enough for him to know he is bum and continue to drink preferably vodka which we have total control of production .
If you continue to tell state secret like this you will begin to see Trotsky Troll Trooper keeping eyes on you .
You have been warned .

I too am outrage about this prole !
I have a suggestion .
To soften this prole up before sending him in for a Jiffi - Lobo , lock him in a room with Bruno and force him to listen to Bruno 's basso profundo rendition of " The Way We Were " .
That should turn is brain into The People 's Gruel™ .
--
ZB
And as an encore he 'll do his Liza impersonation , and the hit of that is " Cabaret . "
Here 's his poster : [ center ] [ / center ]
It 's very thrilling when he sings , in his rusty basso profundo ,
" What good [ kick ] is sitting [ kick ] alone in your room [ kick , kick ] "
as he sashays toward you , hands on hips , in his 6 " heels .
You 'll never be the same .
Zampolit , a brilliant scheme .
I 'll tell you .
Bruno has been working on an entire Streisand medley , including " Memories . "
Those high notes are something to hear .

Comrade Theocritus ,
Does Bruno do bachelor parties ?
Theo , congrats on your first Photoshop job !
I predict you will go far .
Which will be great so long as it does n't distract you from the usual impaling for the Common Good ( TM ) .
Bruno once did a bachelor party but the groom was so traumatized that the wedding had to be annulled .
" Son , " the preacher said to the groom , " You look like you 've seen a ghost . "
I think it was the fishnet stockings that did it .
Red , thanks .
That was a 15 - minute job , but I stole RR 's Bruno head .
But I know how to do it now .
I wondered if your rendering of Bruno as a Cabaret girl had been of your own doing .
Yes , congratulations .
Just watch where you go with the magic wand tool .
I found the Cabaret picture on Google images , and yes , used the Magic Wand .
The Undo is very useful .
But I also used the lasso and square marquee tool and am just now ( DUH ) learning the joy of layers .
Even though I was told .
This brings back memories of something that required the " stamp " tool , where I needed to cover a Borat swimming suit with stomach hair ( click on stamp tool , press ALT , then click on wherever you want to copy , then reuse stamp tool without the ALT ) .
I bought one of the first PSs in the late 80s , I think , before layers .
And then it grew and grew and grew and I did n't need it as I retreated into myself .
I 'm having fun with this , and I just had my piano tuned .
The two are not unrelated .
Let 's hope .
Commissar Theocritus ... Bruno has been working on an entire Streisand medley , including " Memories . "
Those high notes are something to hear .
Hmmm .... the word " something " is not what comes to mind .

Frank Rich said it was brilliant ; there could have been more of it if only the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy had n't conspired to keep 6 ' 4 " tall transvestites with basso profundo voices and five - o' clock shadow at 10 AM from doing Liza and Barbra medleys .
You 're so lucky to have Bruno , O Comparatively Magnificent and Astoundingly Equal Commissar Theocritus .
All I 've got is half a lime next to my bowl .
The VRWC knows not the joy it has denied the world .
Tell Bruno to stay strong for the sake of all the 6 '4 '' transvestite stage divas out there !
Pasternak , the problem with Bruno , oh hell , just one of the plenitude of problems with Bruno , and do n't get me started , is that he thinks that he 's the only 6 ' 4 " transvestite stage diva on earth .
You know the act - - drama , tears , storming , rage , and more neuroses than Bellvue and Ben Taub in Houston combined .
But I do find value in Bruno .
He is the perfect window into the Progressive mind .
Shallow , self - obsessed , selfish , mean , nasty , solipsistic , and arrogant .
Why , if I did n't have Bruno , I 'd have to think and then I could n't be a Made Progressive .
Thinking 's never been a problem for me , Eternally Ruthful Commissar .
One of many benefits of being a vegetable , I guess .
On that note , it might be a good idea for The Party to run more veggies in the future ; a cabbage could be at least as useful in office as Chris Dodd .
It would be easier to re-elect , and it'd smell better .

So true Comrade , just look at these people masquerading as Progressives trying to be free among the subjects of nature ...
I think though they are really teabaggers in disguise , notice the pickup truck in the background and the " Texas " website ad on the truck .
Poor little Bambies , seems these Evil KKKonservatives are really just too damn lazy to hunt the right way , I think they cut the video short to spare us the gory slaughter afterwards .

Castrate , you know that we must be respectful for all the creatures of the Holy Gory , Primate of the First Church of Gaia and keeper of the Bio - Solar Yacht , which is neither .
In fact I am so mindful of the little tiny organisms which my body kills every day and which I egest in turds that I hold a funeral service for them .
These one - celled animals did nothing to me and it was only by my being human that they died .
An American human .
One time I laid a deuce which looked exactly like Nanski Belly Boobs , which I took as the one - celled organisms ' tribute to Nanski .
It is now reposing in a jar of formaldehyde .
It 's truer to Nanski than Nanski herself .
Progressives come to marvel at the image of the Nanski Belly Boobs deuce ; I 'm not getting any sleep at all .
The lines are a mile long just to marvel at the perfect stercoraceous incarnation of Nanski Belly Boobs .
I have had to build an altar for the Progressive Pustules Postulants who genuflect before the Nansky Deuce .
Comrades , I have a totally irrelevant factoid .
I recently discovered the following emoticon- ( : (
The smowney face .
( forgive me , I had to space to avoid the auto- emoticon ) .
I assumed that it could be used to represent either indecision or schizophrenia , but I was n't quite sure which one .
Now , I have reached a better conclusion :
It can be used to represent our mindlessness apart from the party and our glorious leader .
It is not up to us to choose between happiness or sadness , but rather for the party to chose for us .
Of course , even if the party should choose sadness , we should be happy with their decision .
Of course , we must also be sad .
This leads us back to my point :
) : )
The Smowney face .
Remember comrades , just because you have sadness rations , that does n't mean you have to use them ... unless , of course , you do have to use them .
I love this place .
Never forget Comrades what our dear leader has taught us :
“ The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest , by degree , all capital from the bourgeoisie , to centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the state …
Of course , in the beginning , this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property …
You must , therefore , confess that by " individual " you mean no other person than the bourgeois , than the middle - class owner of property .
This person must , indeed , be swept out of the way , and made impossible . ”
Karl Marx
Holy Book :
BTY , this man is in danger of becoming a Kulak - Gulag 376 .
Willard Kookish is not a true proletarian because he came to see the self - evident truth that he is not equal in his rights to property with those in the hateful middle class who have labored for their property .
He has lost sight of The Party 's Doublethink ( officially irrational ) truth whereby all proletarians have a State - given right to middle class property regardless of creativity and labor , with an eye toward the destruction of equality before law ( along with the middle class ) and with an eye toward equality of outcome ; what we intellectuals in the Inner Party have dubbed " Social Justice . "
We in the Party , as rulers of the State , will procure said property with the aid of our gun-clinging State enforcement officers and Manifesto - clinging State Judges .
Let us forever maintain equality of outcome for each and every one of our former middle class – now proletarian – serfs , with the proviso that some of us ( Inner Party ) are more equal than others .
Let Social Justice roll down like a mighty river .
Never forget Comrades what our dear leader has taught us :

And Kulak , yes indeed all property is theft and must be shared equally .
But some are more equal than others .
Think of Ralph Nader , that fearless crusader .

When his magazine decided to unionize , he fired them and changed the locks .
He 's done well by doing good .
And who has done better by doing good than the Holy Gore ?
He takes private jets to his talks and the limousines wait , idling , while he speaks .
But we must renounce .
Yes , the Holy Gore understands .
And Lord 0 bama and Miss Resentment go on a Date Night to New York , on taxpayer expense .
Well , progressives of their stature deserve that .
The hated Ronald Reagan chopped wood on his ranch , and Chimpy McBu$hitler cleared brush on his ranch .
So some are more equal than others .
Commissar Theocritus ,
Yes , of course ; thank you for reminding me that Holy Gore is an extremely equal Inner Party Comrade of the Holy Book .
The Holy Gore and Our Many Titted Empress were so close during the reign of Slick Willie the honorable Bill Clinton .
Not that I am implying anything by that , but they had the true progressive attitude toward people , especially the Secret Service .
The Holy Gore once berated his children , saying , " If you do n't straighten up , you 'll wind up like that ! " pointing to someone who was protecting them .
I 'm not sure I got the words just right , and a pox of me for forgetting Holy Script , but no one can match is disdain .
For people who do things for him .
A true Progressive .
Commissar Theocritus I bought one of the first PSs in the late 80s , I think , before layers .
And then it grew and grew and grew and I did n't need it as I retreated into myself .
I 'm having fun with this , and I just had my piano tuned .
The two are not unrelated .
Let 's hope .
Just think of it as all the different variations of " Ah! Vous Dirai -je Maman . "

I thought I was fairly au courrant with Mozart , if you can be current with a man who 's been dead for 218 years , come December .
But I had n't heard that .
The Mozart at the end did n't pop up but it yelled Mozart to me .
What a great pianist .
BTW , have you heard the young Polish pianist Piotr Anderszewski ?
Very fine .
Good technique .
Obviously young , but very listenable .
His 20 and 21 , 24 and 17 are all very good and stay on the iPod that I travel with , and are on the iMac which feeds my house .
I have a CD ,
At first , when I was stodgier , I would harrumph over the indignities but Mozart himself arranged Bach into string trios .
One of my favorite Bach pieces was really written by Vivaldi .
And at work one of the girls puts on the local country radio station which plays the same song over and over .
There 's the Hoo Hoo Song , and the Stomach Ache Song and all of them are 2:30 long and all of them are tedious and boring and repetitive and nasal ...
At least they 're not hip - hop with thugs screaming violence .
Thank you , Leninka .
What a wonderful pianist .
I 'd hate to shake hands with him , if I wanted my right hand intact .

I 've had it for years and now is the time to drag it out .

Comrade Theocritus ,
I 'm glad you enjoyed it .
This piece is one I have been playing on my cheap and off - pitch electric keyboard that I purchased a couple of years ago on e-bay .
Do you somehow think that I do n't know what I said Comrade K'Scribe .
Much less , do you think my devoted proles of The Cube have not read my works and do not proselytize the dream of Equality ™ across the USSA ?
A religion , comrade , of The State , trumps all mythologies in spades .
Karl , a religion by definition is based on faith and by definition trumps reality .
Successful religions are sufficiently in touch with reality that they do not fail obviously .
Progressivism is a secular religion which can be disproven on its very face .
Which is why why must enact the Fairness Doctrine and demonize everyone who questions us .
Leninka , I am impressed if that is a Mozart practice piece of yours .
Are you by chance left - handed ?
When I 'm out of practice , which is always , the first thing to go is the Mozart .
He takes a delicacy of touch that no one else seems to .
There 's nothing to hide behind .
Actually , Comrade Theocritus , I am somewhat ambidextrous , but I learn a song one hand at a time , and struggle to put it all together .
But , in my childhood I preferred to be at a keyboard while other children were playing , so gradually , through the years , I accumulated a larger repertoire , nevertheless , I remain an amateur who is best fitted to entertain no one but me .
Commissar Theocritus : " religion by definition is based on faith and by definition trumps reality . "
Beautifully stated Commissar ; the Inner Party Priesthood - Big Brother himself - will soon present you with the Party certificate of immortality .
Always remember these principles from the Inner Party Preists of Power in regards to our objectives and our reality :
The Party seeks power entirely for it 's own sake .
We are not interested in the good of others ...
We 're different from all the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we 're doing ... Power is not a means , it is an end ...
We are the priests of power .
The individual is only a cell ... Power is collective ; the individual has power only in so far that he ceases to be an individual ... if he can make complete utter submission ; if he can escape from his identity , if he cam merge himself in the Party so that he is the Party , then he is all powerful and immortal .
Power is power over human beings , over the body ; but above all over the mind ... reality is inside the skull .
Outside man there is nothing ... the Earth is the center of the Universe ; the Sun and the Stars go round it .
The real power ; the power we have to fight for night and day is not power over things but over men .
How does one man assert his power over another , Winston ?
By making him suffer ...
Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation .
Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing .
Can you not understand that the death of the individual is not death ; the Party is immortal ... You 're imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do , and will turn against us ; but we create human nature .
Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one 's mind simultaneously , and accepting both of them ... with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth .
Those who have the best knowledge of what is happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is ; in general the greater the understanding the greater the delusion ; the more intelligent the less sane .
If human equality is to be forever averted ; if the " high , " as we have called them , are to keep their places permanently ; then the prevailing mental condition must be controlled insanity .
Y'know , I may be a junior Party member - - ergo a little less equal than others -- but it seems to me that Komrade Kulak may have had undue exposure to a certain notorious thought criminal 's magnum opus ( and oh , the very word " magnum " disgusts me ) .
I humbly ( very humbly , for I am as nothing unto The Party ) submit that Kulak ought to be investigated , and if need be , re-reeducated .
Can I have his shovel afterwards ?

Noodzakelijk kwaad ‘ Alles is mijn eigen schuld !’
Gepubliceerd op 15/11/2009
Actueel , Overheid , Politici , Politiek algemeen , PvdA , Westen
Een onverwachte verklaring van een dakloze man leidde gisteren tot commotie bij politici en opiniemakers in het gehele land .
Het incident begon nadat Vrij Nederland journalist Edwin Niemendal op bezoek ging bij de opvang van het Leger des Heils in Amsterdam om onderzoek te doen in zijn 748 - delige serie waaruit moet blijken dat de economische crisis , en de gevolgen voor individuen , geheel en al de schuld zijn van het grootkapitaal .
I 'm guilty as charged ; a thought criminal .
Worse yet , I have feelings of hatred for the Party ; a feeling criminal .
Thoughts about truth and such feelings against the Party are indeed very serious crimes .
Anything , anything , anything .... but room 101 .
Re-education of thoughts and feelings is the only way to collective Party reality Comrades .
Let Party Doublethink live in our minds regardless of the grating against it .
Let us also reach out with our feelings and hold Party insanity dear to our hearts ; we shall hold it religiously .
Let our reality roll down from the State like a mighty river .
Poor , poor man .
He has obviously been so beaten down by the corrupt American system that he has become delusional .
Sadly the cruel effects of the criminal George W Bush will be felt for decades to come ...
OK , Kulak 's actually confessed now .
Seriously , can I have his shovel ?
I know I 've already got one of my own , but I understand Party Logic means " I want it " = " I deserve it " , right ?
With no effort required ?
Pasternak ,
I 've come to the Party knowledge that curing my thought crime resides in Doublethink ; to ignore the abyss opening beneath my feet at the thought of lies becoming truth .
As for my feeling crime I 've come to collective Party knowledge that the cure lies in ceasing to love God and in loving Big Brother , i.e. ; in loving The Party .
It is not enough to obey the Party ; one must love the immortal and infallible Party .
I throw myself at the mercy of The Party .
Party have mercy .
Big Brother have mercy .
Party have mercy .
I must also confess to the Party that I 've committed another crime ; I labored and hoarded up two shovels .
PP , I think that you have proven that you 're worthy of your own , first - rate shovel .
And a double ration of beet vodka .
So mote it be !
Kulak , I love your egocentric view of the world .
Since I'm a Made Progressive I spend all my time denouncing others , and denouncing myself , and my wicked needs .
Why , I apostrophize , does anyone need to use the resources of Gaia ?!
I sink to my knees and sob , flailing myself with a cat - o - nine - tails while I moan about my iniquities .
As I look under my eyebrows to see just who 's noticing my pious stance .
For after all , there 's utterly no reason for anyone to do any denunciation if no one is watching , is there ?
And of course the lie has to be one step ahead .
That 's why I like recursive lies .
A recursive lie just keeps going .
And going .
And going .
You do n't have to tend to it .
Tell a bit fat lie and when anyone begins to ask if it is indeed a lie you accuse him of not having a soul big enough to understand it , which is proven because he does n't understand it .
See how easy it is ?
I got this once from a woman I knew who said , " If you do n't understand it , I ca n't explain it to you . "
And this is of course the basis of the First Church of Gaia , Socialism , and indeed all of Progressivism .
Let the lies roll on !
But since we all believe them , and since if you think that they 're lies , you just do n't get it , that means that they 're not lies and if you doubt that then you 're a cold - hearted Republican bastard .
Kulak I must also confess to the Party that I 've committed another crime ; I labored and hoarded up two shovels .
Te absolvo .
As long as you use both of your shovels for the Greater Glory of the Collective , you are forgiven .
As long as you use both of your shovels for the Greater Glory of the Collective , you are forgiven .

Your logic , as always , Commissar , amazes the infidel and frightens children and small animals .

Thank you , Rex .
I 'm in the process of rewriting Plato and Principia Mathematica .
I think that math is a bully .
Why , just where does the CBO get off predicting that Obamacare is a complete and total economic basket case and the biggest lie since Slick 's " I did not have sex with that woman " ?
It 's obvious to me , meaning that it ought to be obvious to you , and if it's not , Red Star 's goons will be escorting you to Jiffi - Lobo , that math is the problem .
If a ray of light falls into a pig sty and shows pig shit , whose fault is it ?
The ray of light 's fault , of course .
Duh .
Or even Doh .
We shall have Obamacare .
We shall have cap - and - trade .
And all that number crunching is nothing more than disloyalty .
Which means of course that the math is the problem .
The accounting is the problem .
Now .
I want all Made Progressives to consider how best to reform the examinations for a license to be a CPA .
They have a nasty habit of telling unpleasant truths .
Perhaps Sarbanes Oxley Two ?
This is the one that imposes criminal penalties if you do n't come up with the current truth , and screw the numbers .
Commissar Theocritus ,
Your skilled use of Newspeak ( formerly known as bullshit in oldspeak ) is impressive ; it forces the individual to either think for him / herself or submit to Inner Party Doublethink ( preferred ) .
Our Dear Leader ( The One ) and his associate Priest of Power ( Holy Gore ) are depending on the dissemination of this process throughout the less equal masses ; particularly the middle class - those the Inner Party now refer to as proto -Proletarians .
Remember this maxim : More Newspeak = More Doublethink
More lies spoken =
More lies digested
Chairman M. S. Punchenko
Does this mean we get a boost in our shoe and chocolate rations ?
Shoe leather goes great with beet stew .
No !
Commissarka Pinkie will only increase one 's beet and / or vodka rations .
Shoe leather will have to be recycled .
It 's for The Environment™ , you know .
BTW ,
Where the hell have you been ?
In case you have not heard , the Rethuglicans won the Gov. , Lt. Gov. and Atty Gen. elections here in our beloved People 's Commonwealth of Virginia !
This is a travesty !!!
Before you know it , they will begin implementing pro-Capitalist initiatives in our Commonwealth !
CAPITALISM IN A COMMONWEALTH ?
The very thought of such a thing turns my progressive stomach !

A bit off topic , but Newsweek really should re-style itself as Newspeak .
Kulak , I have been doing Newspeak for so long that I do n't believe my name when I see it .
Olga Katrina , have you seen the estimable Time ?
Read some of the wisdom of Margaret Carlson and Richard Lacayo .
How I envy them .
They have never been right about anything .
Everything that they say is a lie , including " and " and " the . "
Komsomolka Olga Katrina ,
Newsweek has already been through the re-education process , i.e. : it has already been re-styled ; it only now needs to be re-named , but the renaming from Newsweek to Newspeak would its self be a violation of Newspeak , and would be a missed opportunity for Doublethink .
Better to leave the name as is ; all the better to confuse the Proletarians and proto-Proletarians ( middle class ) .
Think , think , think my dear ; but above all , Doublethink .
BTY , I ’m an ambitious Kulak ; I ’ve been considering some selected denunciations , which if successfully prosecuted by the Thought Police , might lead to an Outer Party appointment .
If I play my cards right it is entirely possible that Commissar Theocritus , or one of the other extremely equal Inner Party members might write me a letter of recommendation .
I ’m looking for opportunities to be more equal than others through arbitrary State Power .
It ’s time to jump ship from the Kulak class ( lower middle class owners of property ) .
You know what happens to ordinary Kulaks do n’t you ?
Our Great Leader from long ago ( Marx ) foretold it , and our other Great Leader ( Stalin ) took care of it .
“ You must , therefore , confess that by " individual " you mean no other person than the bourgeois , than the middle - class owner of property .
This person ( Kulak ) must , indeed , be swept out of the way , and made impossible . ”
Karl Marx
Let Social Justice roll down from the Inner Party like a mighty river .
Comrades I am fresh from the comfort of compulsory communist parade of Siberia .
There for dinner sometimes our benevolent betters would let us have frozen turnips on holidays such as Ugly Olga Mother of Machinist Appreciation Day .
Normally I would hold it to my breast and pretend it was the hard cold heart of a capitalist pig but if I had one now I would stone this spoilt sot of a socialist heretic !

Most equal observations !
Point well - taken .
I guess I need to go back and thumb through myred - covered , well - worn Rules of Newspeak ... or at least skim through the introductory course provided at the back of 1984 .
No , do n't tell me to think !
I can't bear the thought of it !
Thinking is dangerous , exhausting , and will make me a Thoughtcriminal ( TM ) .
I just had a thought realized that thinking violates the principle of Doublethink ( TM ) !!!!
Singlethink is lesser than Doublethink !!

Actually , when the Party ( TM ) is in control , social justice Trickles Down ( TM ) , but of course we cannot say this in front of the proles , because then we would be violating Newspeak again ...
I love how our glorious philosophy is built on a series of contradictions paradoxes .

Anyway , I overheard a homeless man say that he was homeless because : " I been doin wrong , man .
Always smokin dope ! "
Willard Kookish ?
Is that you ?
Had the brain matter responsible for my sense of humor not been long emaciated by years of Political Correctness and removed by frequent Jiffi-Lobos I might have laughed ( [ prog off ]
I very nearly did laugh , which would have been utterly inappropriate .
Thank God for coughing .
[ prog on ] ) .
No doubt this Kookish fellow has been infecting other homeless people with his lies .
I chastised the man , as shown below .
This past Saturday I was spying on a group " ministering to the homeless " by cleverly posing as one of their own .
I knew this group was up to no good because it makes no sense to give something to someone unless it somehow increases your power over them or procures votes .

Comrades , I have solved the problem of Newspeak , Doublethink and singlethink .
The solution is Zerothink , or O - think , or even , in some circles , Obathink .
The cockroach has a tiny brain , like any good Progressive .
The cockroach also has nerves in its legs which tell the roach to run without any interaction from the brain whatsoever .
After enough trips to Jiffi - Lobo I have such centers myself .
All I have to do is hear " Rush Limbaugh " and I start spitting and cursing .
It does n't even have to go through the brain , what 's left of it ; it goes directly from the ears to the jaw .
That 's why it 's Zerothink .
It is also Obathink because whenever I see a vision of the Blessed O I instantly fall on my knees and drool in adoration .
I 've grown extra nerves going from my eyes directly to my knees and my salivary glands .
I had to , since Dr. Lecter managed to use that MotoTool enough during my excursions to Jiffi- Lobo that I keep a six - pack of Tree Frog 100 % Organic Beer in my head where my brain used to be .
Kulak , at your current rate of groveling I 'm quite sure that you 'll go far and soon be able to roll in lots and lots of OPM .
I see a new revision needs to be made to The Rules of Newspeak !
As Kommissarka of Secret Spelling and Grammar Organs ( per Red Square 's recent promotion of yours truly ) I will have my team of Newspeak experts crank out a new edition immediately !
Finally , I can get up and tell others to do some work !
We should also add a footnote saying that Olberthink = Obathink .
It is disgusting how our now departed arch thought criminal , George Orwell , realized that many in the proto - Proletariat ( middle ) , Kulak and Proletariat Classes could be duped by the Inner Party without even resorting to the use of conscious Doublethink on their part .
Party Newspeak by its self is often sufficient when dealing with the inferior minds of what amounts to lower classes of animals , because their minds will readily accept lies without bothering to correlate lies with truth .
“ The worldview of the Party imposed its self most successfully on people incapable of understanding it .
They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them , and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening .
By lack of understanding they remained sane .
They simply swallowed everything , and what they swallowed did them no harm because it left no residue behind ; just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird . ”
George Orwell , 1984
On the other hand , the more intelligent among the less equal classes must accept Newspeak with a conscious exercise of Doublethink .
Yes , after ceasing to love God ; substituting love of The Party ( or The One ) , the more intellegent ; by using Doublethink , will allow the extremely equal Inner Party to lie with near impunity ; thereby becoming their Priests of Power .
“ Those who have the best knowledge of what is happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is ; in general the greater the understanding the greater the delusion ; the more intelligent the less sane …
If human equality is to be forever averted ; if the " high , " as we have called them , are to keep their places permanently ; then the prevailing mental condition must be controlled insanity . ”
George Orwell , 1984
I have another confession to make .
I find myself loving God over and over again , and I keep feeling hatred for The Party , The One and the Priests of Power .
At the same time I keep having feelings of love for the proto-Proletarians ( middle class ) , Proletarians and Kulaks .
I keep having thoughts and feelings whereby those individuals could be seen as having equality before law ( along with the Priests of Power in the Inner Party ) and sacred unalienable rights to life , liberty and private property – pursuit of happiness .
Forgive me almighty State .
I need more re-education .
More importantly , I need my feelings re-adjusted .
Is it not possible for the Priests of Power in the Inner Party to provide me with the needed psychoanalysis , psychotherapy ; and , if necessary , the needed psychopharmacology ?
Surely though ; there is no need for room 101 .
I am at your mercy .
Ah , kulak , all is not lost if you understand your insanity .
( Now as for me , I 'm successfully paranoid because I never know if I had to be . )
Since you understand your insanity , you know that you are on a slippery slip to criminal insanity .
Criminally Insane Vodkof has staked out that territory pretty well , but there 's always room for more .
I would suggest , as I always do , a goodish time at Jiffi - Lobo .
Works a treat for me .
Then we can have you checked into the Felix Dzerzhinsky Psychiatric Hospital , where you will be treated for sluggish schizophrenia .
Do not let the fact that it does n't exist bother you ; I for one am not bothered by the nonexistence of integrity in the White House .
In fact I embrace it , as you should embrace sluggish schizophrenia .
Own the disease .
Make the disease yours .
Then you can tour AmeriKKKa talking about how you were cured of your bourgeois habits and bang the drum for Obamacare .
Olga , there is slight difference between Olberthink and Obathink .
Obathink is nurtured by His Exalted Highness , Barack Hubris Obama , and was created when he was editor of a law review and yet did n't have a single article appear in any law journal under his name .
Then he was hired by Madeline Talbot at ACORN in Chicago , where the glorious ACORN members threatened bankers ' wives and children into making bad loans .
Obamathink is listening to Jeremiah Wright say , " God DAMN America " and not hear anything wrong with it .
Olberthink is the thinking of a man who majored in communications in an agricultural college , and wrote his thesis about his experiences learning the language of cows .
Which he uses to this day on his television show .
Commissar Theocritus , and other Comrades of greater and lesser equality :
Having confessed fully and groveled in the most lowly manner , would it be possible for me to gain State absolution by saying 50 " Hail States , " plus 100 " Hail the Partys , " and 200 " Hail The Ones ? "
I am also prepared to construct something tantamount to a Rosary ; containing small multi-colored beads ; the largest for our Dear Leader , and with many more representing Holy Gore , Pelosi , Reid , Axelrod , Emanuel , Murtha , and the remaining Inner Party Priests of Power .
Will this do ?
Have I groveled sufficiently ?
Am I absolved by the Inner Party ?
Dammit , Kulak , I will NOT be out guilted !
I 've been scraping and bowing for about a month now ( which is more or less the extent of my memory ) and I will NOT rest until I 'm the top Sniveling Sycophant ( SS ) of The Party !!
I 'm WAY guiltier !
I recommend Animal Farm to my friends !
I think freedom of speech is worth dying for !
I want a strong Israel and a free Tibet !
I laughed at Drew Carey , and not in a scornful way !
I think G.K. Chesterton and C.S. Lewis were some of the most perceptive men who ever lived !
Al Gore bores me !
Ayn Rand inspires me !
I think political correctness is demeaning !
I'M DESCENDED FROM OKLAHOMANS !!!
O Commissar Theocritus , He Who Shows His Love with a Warm Pike , The Bulwark of Party Policy ,
He Who Makes Aristotle Look Like Ashton Kutcher , I ask not for forgiveness , I ask for a harsher punishment than Kulak so that I may later frighten infidels with my scars !
I DESERVE RECOGNITION !!
PAY ATTENTION TO ME !!!
Commissar Theocritus ,
Thank the Holy Party and the Holy State !
I shall immediately embrace my State - derived schizophrenia .
I shall renew my eternal commitment to the lies of Newspeak and the acceptance of lies inherent in Doublethink .
I shall say my list of absolutions and construct my State Rosary representing the Inner Party Priests of Power .
This amazing grace of the Inner Party and the Infallible State leaves me speechless - and on my knees .
Pay no attention to Pasternak ; he is a less equal Kulak .
Pasternak , my suggestion is that you be truly partitioned .
We shall at your next Jiffi Lobo sever your corpus callosum .
This will insure that the left part of your brain is not impugned by disloyal thoughts from the right part of your brain and vice versa .
Left - handed people have a larger corpus callosum , having to do I suspect with adapting to a dexterous world .
But with a severed corpus callosum , you will not have that problem .
After all , how much dexterity do you need to handle a shovel ?
I find myself now in the throes of feeling superior .
Well , I am of course ; I 'm a made progressive which is superior to all forms of life , save and except Lord Barack Hubris Obama .
My sin is just showing it .
It 's time for me to go onto Keith Olbermann and talk with the divinely greasy Janeane Gawdawfulo about how anything anyone says about me that I do n't agree with is racism .
Or sexism .
Or homophobia , and say that I 'm only doing it as a loyal party apparatchik .
Both of you can best better your positions , however , by demonstrating your willingness to get behind Nanski's Reach - Around Economics .
Media analysts have argued that a major factor in Barack Obama’s
political success is his nonthreatening demeanor , to counteract the
stereotype of the threatening black man .
Researchers wondered if there
might be a similar counter - stereotypical pattern for black CEOs , even
on a purely visual level .
They asked people to rate pictures of CEOs
for baby - facedness , warmth , and competence .
Relative to white CEOs ,
black CEOs were rated as more baby - faced – and , consistent with prior
research on baby - faced stereotypes , seen as warmer and less competent .
For blacks , being baby - faced meant earning more money , the study found ,
whereas white CEOs earned less money if they were baby - faced .
According
to the authors , this confirms that blacks need “ disarming mechanisms ”
to be successful in corporate America .
I was reading an article today in one of my favorite publications about how to get free trials without actually using your credit card by generating valid credit card numbers using a simple algorithm called the Luhn check .
So I wrote a little script that generates credit card numbers that will be deemed valid by most software checks .
This will work because the service wo n’t know that the credit card is invalid until they actually try to charge it .
Well , the card may be valid since my script uses random numbers .
Obviously this if for informational purposes only and should never actually be used .
Most credit card numbers are validated using an algorithm called the “ Luhn check ” .
This is a very simple algorithm that doubles the odd digits and does a sum to see if the number is divisible by 10 .
The credit card companies use a slightly different version that involves a check digit as the last digit .
To generate a credit card number that will pass most validation software ( as long as they do n’t actually try to process the credit card ) one only needs to follow these steps to make sure that the generated credit card is valid .
Choose 16 random numbers starting with a 3,4,5 or 6 .
Starting with the first digit , double every other number .
If doubling a number results in a two digit number , add those digits together to produce a single digit number
Replace the odd digits with the new ones just created .
You should now have 16 numbers consisting of all the new numbers and the original even numbers
Add up all sixteen numbers .
Manipulate the check digit so that the sum is divisible by 10 .
Replace the last digit of the original random string with the new manipulated check digit .
Thats really all there is to it .
Check out the source of my javascript credit card generator if you want to see how to generate and validate the credit card numbers .
The reason for starting with a 3,4,5 , or 6 is that different card types start with different digit .
The 3 is American Express , 4 is Visa , 5 is Master Card , 6 is a Discover Card .
Some companies use more digits to show that the card is from them .
For example 5254 is a Master Card from the Bank of America and 4013 shows that it is a Visa card from Citibank .
Also note that the expiry date has nothing at all to do with the card number .
After a flurry of activity over the past several weeks , the Solar Impulse team have finally taken their first steps towards solar flight .
The prototype of the aircraft designed to be the first to fly around the world powered only by the sun , has completed the first taxi tests down the runway at its home airport in Switzerland .
With the four electric motors running on sunlight , these first tests were slow , only getting up to about 10 knots .
Initially the team used safety gear to protect the aircraft in case of a failure of the landing gear .
But eventually the aircraft was able to taxi without the use of safety gear , just as it would for a normal takeoff .
Next up , according to the team , is taxi tests up to takeoff speed of about 20 knots for some short “ flea hops ” into the air .
First flights beyond the airport runway are expected early next year .
The videos are from the Solar Impulse team and include several closeup views of the solar - powered aircraft as well as commentary from Bertrand Piccard and some good aerial views of the Solar Impulse .

A lot of the problem is the fault of the Europeans themselves , said Hubert Védrine , a former French foreign minister .
“ Europe for Obama is not a priority , not a problem and not a solution for his problems , ” he said in an interview here .
“ Obama keeps a distance and has a kind of hauteur ” with European leaders , Mr. Védrine said .
“ But that ’s not a sufficient reason for Europeans to act like spectators ” as Mr. Obama tries to cope with his challenges .
“ I think it ’s necessary to help him , ” he said .
European nations have been slow to help Mr. Obama with the major points on his agenda .
They have so far agreed to take only a handful of detainees from the Guantánamo detention center , which Mr. Obama vowed to close within a year .
And European countries that belong to NATO have also been slow to provide Mr. Obama much extra help in Afghanistan , in part because many Europeans strongly oppose the war and Washington has not yet agreed upon a compelling new strategy to succeed in Afghanistan .
Jean - David Levitte , Mr. Sarkozy ’s diplomatic counselor and former ambassador to the United States , said that Europe nonetheless remained Washington ’s best ally .
Mr. Obama ’s election was enthralling to Europeans , he said , “ transforming the image of the United States in just several months . ”
He said , “ We all feel a stake in the U.S. ”
Is Europe ready to respond ?
“ Of course it is , ” he said , citing more than 35,000 European troops now in Afghanistan .
“ If not the Europeans , who would there be ?
No one else . ”
In a report to be published on Monday , the European Council on Foreign Relations , an independent research group , urged European Union governments to shake off illusions about the trans -Atlantic relationship if they wanted to avoid global irrelevance .
The report , written by the council ’s Nick Witney and Jeremy Shapiro of the Brookings Institution after interviews in all 27 members of the bloc , argues that Europeans retain key and damaging “ illusions ” they acquired over “ decades of American hegemony , ” which produces “ an unhealthy mix of complacency and excessive deference ” to a United States that has a “ rapidly decreasing interest ” in a Europe that can not pull its own weight .
The United States “ needs strong partners in a world it no longer dominates , ” the authors say , and while it would prefer a more united European Union , which can articulate and put into practice its own strategic interests , Washington no longer expects to see it .
When the European Union is united and strong , as on trade matters , Washington listens , the report says ; when it is split , as over Russia and many other foreign and defense issues , where national governments act individually , “ Europeans are asking to be divided and ruled . ”
While Mr. Obama is personally sympathetic and even “ European ” in his policy choices , the report argues , “ Europeans miss the implications of the self - avowed pragmatism ” of his administration , which wants “ to work with whoever will most effectively help it achieve the outcomes it desires . ”
Tailoring your resumé to include sections that reflect your specific skills and experience is the next step toward building a great resumé .
Regardless of the position or industry you are applying for , nearly every resumé should include an objective statement and a profile section .
The objective
The best resumés are targeted .
Creating a targeted objective is the basis for crafting a resumé that is applicable to the position you are applying for .
The objective is usually one to three lines in length and clearly outlines the position you are applying for .
This is your chance to show a potential employer that you are truly interested in the company and job position .
If you are applying for a position that you have read a job description for , ask yourself , “ Could this objective be written for any other job ? ”
If your answer is yes , keep tweaking your objective to make it more specific .
The profile
A well - written and detailed profile section will often determine whether or not an employer decides to read more of your resumé .
A profile section includes four to six points of relevant information , skills and experiences that directly relate to the position you are applying for .
Without detailing specific job titles or work places ( that ’s what the rest of your resumé is for ) , a profile section should include specific job skills , key characteristics or qualities related to the job position , achievement statements , important certifications , technical skills and relevant experiences .
For example , a great bullet point would be , “ Regularly beginning and completing written pieces in order to meet a strict deadline for various outlets such as newspapers and magazines . ”
A not - so - good bullet point for a profile section is too vague and does n’t show off your skills .
For example , “ Writing articles for a magazine . ”
When writing bullet points for your profile , ask yourself , “ Could anyone else could have written this exact point ? ”
Be creative , detailed and try to intrigue employers enough to find out more about the experiences you have had .
Other sections
Depending on your previous work or volunteer experience , you may want to include a separate Work and Volunteer section , a Relevant Experience section , or a Recent Experience section .
In each section , list experiences in reverse chronological order .
Other sections that might be important for your resumé include relevant technical skills , related courses or professional development courses .
A resumé is your personal advertisement .
Choose carefully the sections you want to include so that you can profile your skills and experience in the most clear and concise way possible .

Displaying a details view to show data after the user selects something from a table on the iPhone is pretty much the standard and it sure is useful in many cases .
Fact is that it ’s not always the fastest or correct way of showing details , specially if the amount of details left to show is low .
I ’ve thought in the past about making a UITableViewCell expand and collapse , something like OS X has , but while my ( quick and dirty ) efforts failed on iPhone OS up to 2.2.1
I recently came across the missing piece to make it work on iPhone OS 3.0 + .
As you ’ll probably know , there are only 2 ways of setting a cell ’s height inside a UITableView .
You can set the property for the default row height on the UITableView object or use the delegate .
The delegate is by far the most flexible of both solutions and is n’t hard at all to use :
- ( CGFloat ) tableView :( UITableView *) tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:( NSIndexPath *) indexPath { return 64 ; }
This delegate is rarely invoked however .
Without deep research I think it would only be called when refreshing the list of cells , data or changing the size / framing of the UITableView .
Those situations could be exploited to archive the final goal but depending on the number and type of data it could bring serious performance problems .
As far as iPhone OS 2.2.1 goes , I tried to find a way but in the end I gave up on it after finding a 3.0 + solution that worked better than I expected .
I say better because I was expecting to have to implement basic animation but out - the - box it gives us a fine default .
The implementation is fairly simple for a simple scenario , I ’ll demonstrate how to implement the simplest which is to expand the currently selected cell while collapsing all the other cells .
// Somewhere in your header : NSIndexPath * selectedCellIndexPath ; //
And in the implementation file : - ( void ) tableView : ( UITableView *) tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath :( NSIndexPath *) indexPath { selectedCellIndexPath = indexPath ; //
Forces the table view to call heightForRowAtIndexPath [ tableView reloadRowsAtIndexPaths :[ NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath ] withRowAnimation :UITableViewRowAnimationNone ] ; } - ( CGFloat ) tableView :( UITableView *) tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:( NSIndexPath *) indexPath { // Note : Some operations like calling [ tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath ] // will call heightForRow and thus create a stack overflow if ( selectedCellIndexPath != nil && [ selectedCellIndexPath compare : indexPath ] == NSOrderedSame ) return 128 ; return 64 ; }
It ’s that simple but understanding how it works will help you shape it better to your needs .
Basically the reloadRowsAtIndexPaths call makes sure the UITableView will reload those cells and invoke heightForRowAtIndexPath in the process .
The reloadRowsAtIndexPaths is the magic that the iPhone OS ’s before 3.0 do n’t have .
Another noteworthy subject is why I store the NSIndexPath the way I do , and the reason for that is simply because inside the heightForRowAtIndexPath we can’t call certain methods like cellForRowAtIndexPath without causing a stack overflow .
I ’m fully aware that this code is n’t on its most reusable form but depending on the application and objective there are just too many different ways of encapsulating it .
Perhaps the most useful and popular will be to inherit the UITableViewCell and implement a Height property on it .
Adjusting the didSelectRowAtIndexPath override ( or other points in the controller ) to simply set the Height property and finally adjusting the heightForRowAtIndexPath code to use that property instead of the variable .
That solution would enable for multiple expanded cells at the same time while my original snippet only allows for one .
How you do it depends on your needs alone .

In a petulant written statement Tomasi , identified in media reports as the Vaticans representative to the U.N. but known within the Vatican by the strange title of Ambassador to Nowhere , became the Ambassador from Hell , repeating nearly every shibboleth the Vatican and its apologists have used to minimize clergy sexual abuse over the past decade .
And Tomasi 's statement also exemplified the odd role that the Vatican plays in the U.N .
He was exercising the Vatican 's " right to reply " as a " Non-member State Permanent Observer " to a complaint brought by an NGO .
But is the Vatican really a state ?
For a long time , the Vatican has sought to have its cake and eat it too , enjoying the privileges of statehood without the responsibilities .
Now the issue of child abuse has laid the contradictions bare .
​
The 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States defined the four criteria of statehood -- permanent population , defined territory , government and the ability to enter into diplomatic relations .
On the first count , the Vatican fails miserably .
There is no permanent population at all .
There are fewer than 1,000 residents and " citizenship " is temporary .
One holds it only so long as one has a job or function related to the Vatican .
Its territory is defined , though it occupies less than half a square kilometer in the center of Rome , but its governing capacity is minimal .
The Vatican depends on the Italian government for most civic services , from garbage collection to healthcare and policing .
And while the U.N. has no requirement that governments be democratic , the idea of a government run by an infallible head of state elected for life by a small group of men is a bit strange .
​
n many areas , the Vatican uses its special privileges to obstruct more modern consensus on the usual issues -- contraception , condoms , womens rights and stem - cell research .
And although the Vatican signs some U.N. treaties and conventions , it refuses to be held accountable .
​
It will be interesting to see if the United Nations will have any greater success or even try to get the Vatican to comply with the Convention on the Rights of the Child .
Wasnt it Jesus who said " suffer the little children to come to me " and " what you do unto the least of mine , you have done unto me " ?
Who would have thought it would take the U.N. to get the Catholic church to listen ?

C hina is undeniably a global economic powerhouse .
While the global financial crisis was a catastrophe for most economies , it was more an opportunity than a challenge for China .
The Asian gaint too was hit by the crisis and its GDP growth rate slipped , but China still was largely unaffected .
Backed by its huge foreign exchange reserves , China first announced a massive stimulus plan to stir up its domestic economy and then began to focus on sealing deals that entailed natural resources -- oil and metals , primarily .
The private sector in China also decided to make hay while the sun shone and went on a major worldwide buying spree .
Times were ugly .
Companies , especially in the West , were finding it difficult to keep their head above the water : their business were drying up as customers vanished and with banks going belly up by the dozen , credit was impossible to get hold of .
These beleaguered companies were like beacons to the prowling Chinese .
They began to buy huge stakes into firms abroad , beating the competition hollow .
To be fair , China did not begin its acquisition binge only during the recession : it has been on a buying spree for almost a decade now .
Meanwhile , in a major shift in stance the United States is keen to allow Chinese investment into small and medium US banks .
America was earlier wary of investments from state - controlled Chinese companies .
In 2005 , the China National Offshore Oil Corp 's $ 18.5 billion investment in the US oil company Unocal fell through as American lawmakers opposed the deal .
But the current recession has changed all that .
America now realises that for its economy to come out of the crisis fully , foreign investment is badly required .
Meanwhile , China with its $ 2 - trillion foreign currency assets is on the prowl .

Just as happened in the Central Valley months earlier , PG&E ’s rollout of Smart - Meters in the Bay Area has generated a flurry of complaints from consumers of unusual spikes in bills and concern that the meters are malfunctioning and over - reading electricity usage .
PG&E is installing 10 million SmartMeters on homes and businesses throughout California .
This summer , hundreds of consumers in Bakersfield complained of skyrocketing electricity bills after SmartMeters were installed .
Now , as the rollout of SmartMeters gets under way in the Bay Area , similar concerns are being reported ; more than 30 consumers contacted the Mercury News after a report on the rollout appeared last week .
Jorg Aadahl of San Mateo says his September bill showed a 24 percent spike in kilowatt - hours used compared with the same month last year .
And in October , his usage was 14 percent higher than average when compared with Octobers over the previous decade .
“ I am very concerned about the accuracy of the new electric SmartMeter , ” Aadahl said .
“ I have been keeping track of energy usage for many years , so I have a solid base for comparison .
We are a senior couple with no substantial change in consumption profile . ”
PG&E insists there ’s absolutely nothing wrong with the SmartMeters , but acknowledges receiving hundreds of complaints .
“ We have investigated hundreds of bill complaints where customers felt higher bills were due to the SmartMeter meters , but in each case the meters are performing accurately , ” PG&E spokesman Matt Nauman said Monday .
“ Bills have been higher for a variety of reasons : rate hikes , increased usage due to weather , changes in lifestyle , aging appliances that draw more power , house guests . ”
Nauman said Monday that PG&E would be “ happy ” to field test individual meters for accuracy upon customer request , and customers should call PG&E directly if they have any questions or concerns .
But some consumers are not convinced .
San Jose resident Ron Adib , who lives in Almaden , says his monthly bill rose by $ 30 after he got a Smart - Meter six or seven weeks ago .
“ This is the time of year when we use the least amount of power , ” Adib said .
“ It ’s not hot , it ’s not cold , we are not running the air conditioning or the heat .
But the bill showed that our usage went up .
I do n’t think the meters are working .
I have called PG&E and they said ‘ No , no , no , there ’s no such problem . ’ “
Michelle Rush - Browne lives in Knightsen , near Brentwood .
She and her family have a propane tank for gas ; their electric bill is about $ 400 a month .
But after a SmartMeter was installed three months ago , Rush - Browne went for a few months without getting any kind of bill .
When it finally arrived , it was for $ 4,000 .
A technician came to check out the meter ; then PG&E swapped out the meter and installed a new one .
SmartMeters are designed to be read remotely ; PG&E says it ’s almost like adding a GPS system to your car .
A small radio , similar to a cell phone , on the meter transmits usage data to a “ data collector , ” which then sends it to PG&E via a secure wireless network .
As more features are added , the devices will be able to tell consumers how much power their refrigerator or other household appliances use .
The hope is that consumers will be inspired to conserve more energy once they are armed with more detailed information about their household energy use ; that in turn should decrease the overall demand on the power grid .
Michael Kelley , a Los Angeles trial lawyer , is representing one Bakersfield resident who saw his $ 200 - a- month bill rise to nearly $ 600 after he got a SmartMeter .
Kelley has been flooded with calls from other consumers hoping to be included as plaintiffs in the class - action lawsuit .
“ You have people who are retired and living on a fixed income , and they always pay their bills .
All of a sudden their energy bill is twice their mortgage , and now they are in danger of losing their home , ” said Kelley .
“ There must be some glitch in the system that is either not accurately transmitting the information , or is double counting it .
All of these people ca n’t be wrong . ”

Swine : Secret Weapon Against Islamic Terror ? ,
The suggestion is based on the fact that Islam regards the pig as an unclean animal and Muslim law bars any Moslem who touches a pig before dying access to heaven .
One of the basic motives for Islamic suicide terrorists is the assurance that as a ‘ shahid ’ or martyr , their place in paradise is guaranteed as they die in ‘ holy martyrdom ’ for the sake of Islam .
Although the idea has been vocally suggested for years , and was practiced in various forms by the British before 1948 , the Maariv report says that the police just recently “ thought of the idea , ” but wanted to obtain rabbinic assurance that the plan would not upset observant Jews .
Rabbi Eliezer Moshe Fisher , of the Jerusalem Rabbinical Court , issued his official ruling on Wednesday saying , “ there is no halachic ( Jewish legal ) ban on using bags of lard in buses and other places ” when saving lives is concerned .
The Jewish legal permit says that bags of lard may be placed in any place that might be a target for suicide bombings , such as schools , shopping malls , railway stations , and any other crowded area .
The rabbi also said that if the police do not use pig fat in buses , tens of thousands of Torah - observant Jews would arm themselves with spray guns filled with liquid lard , which they would then spray on terrorists as the need arises .
Deputy Defense Minister MK Yaakov Edri ( Likud ) came out in support of the new idea .
“ If bags of pig lard will prevent zealous Muslim terrorists from carrying out attacks , I ’m all for it ” , he said .
According to the Moskovski Komsomol newspaper , Russian security have been burying Chechen terrorists wrapped in pig's skin ever since the siege on a Russian theater last year .
Reportedly , the actions have become a deterrent amongst Chechen Muslims but have done nothing to deter nationalist terrorism .
Residents of Gush Katif have tried the formula in the past , inserting pig fat in the body of terrorists that have attacked their homes .
Residents told Arutz - 7 that a " right - wing kibbutz - nik " had supplied them with the swine tissues .
Arab MKs responded to a report of such actions with outrage .
Abdel Malek Dahamshe said , " The ethical inferiority and lowliness that the settlers have reached is intolerable .
This is an act of first - degree desecration of God 's name . "
MK Tzvi Hendel responded , " If these primitive murderers stuff their brains with nonsense about Paradise and who - knows - how - many virgins waiting only for them , then they certainly believe in the other nonsense that being buried with pigskin blocks their way to Paradise . "
A suggestion that has been made repeatedly since the start of the Oslo War is about to be adopted by Israel ’s police force .
According to a report by Maariv , the plan calls for the insertion of bags of pig fat in public buses and other central locations in the hope that it will deter Islamic terrorist suicide bombers aiming for martyrdom from detonating themselves there .
The suggestion is based on the fact that Islam regards the pig as an unclean animal and Muslim law bars any Moslem who touches a pig before dying access to heaven .
One of the basic motives for Islamic suicide terrorists is the assurance that as a ‘ shahid ’ or martyr , their place in paradise is guaranteed as they die in ‘ holy martyrdom ’ for the sake of Islam .

Writing at Christianity Today , University of Colorado historian Paul Harvey has some unkind words for the recent book Race & Liberty in America , which was edited by Southern Illinois University historian Jonathan Bean .
As I discussed in my review of the book , it 's a wide - ranging collection of speeches , articles , legal decisions , and other documents demonstrating the long and essential role that classical liberal ideas have played in America 's fight for racial equality .
Harvey takes a much dimmer view of that role , arguing that there is no coherent classical liberal tradition when it comes to race , and that Bean failed " to investigate the complexity and contradictions within classical liberalism with the same zeal that he applies ( especially in the conclusion ) to left liberalism . "
I 'll leave Bean to mount his own defense against those and other charges , but I would like to challenge Harvey on a few matters pertaining to the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass , whose writings feature prominently in the book , and whose status as a classical liberal Harvey calls into question .
Here 's Harvey :
Douglass certainly drew ( as did most antislavery activists ) from the classical liberal tradition , and the contribution of classical liberalism to the antislavery movement stands as its proudest moment .
But of course , the most representatives defenders of that classical liberal tradition were southerners such as Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens , who perceived the Republicans as the party of big government , conspiring to take away local authority , individual freedom ( especially property rights ) , and the proper Constitutional authority of the states .
The Confederate revolution was , in large part , a classical liberal one , an inconvenient truth for the thesis presented here .
There are some major problems with this .
First , Harvey confuses classical liberal ideas with the various individuals ( and governments ) who sometimes selectively espouse them .
So while Confederates like Davis and Stephens may have struck a libertarian note by complaining about the " tyrant Lincoln " trampling on state 's rights , the Confederacy itself violated the most basic and essential tenet of classical liberalism : the right of individual self - ownership , or as Frederick Douglass put it in his famous letter to his former master , " You are a man , and so am I … In leaving you , I took nothing but what belonged to me . "
To call the Confederate revolution " a classical liberal one " is to fundamentally misunderstand what classical liberalism is all about .
In fact , one of Douglass 's greatest achievements was to employ the classical liberalism of the Constitution and Declaration of Independence as weapons against slavery and against the Confederacy .
As an escaped slave and self - taught author and orator , Douglass understood better than most just how potent the promise of liberty , equality , and " unalienable rights " could be , and he never tired of pointing that potency out to his mostly white audiences .
In contrast , consider John C. Calhoun of South Carolina , who was perhaps slavery 's most eloquent defender , and who Harvey dubiously places in " a long line of classical liberal thinkers . "
Unlike Douglass , Calhoun hated the Declaration of Independence , denouncing its assertion that " all men are created equal " as " the most dangerous of all political error . "
As Calhoun put it in an 1848 speech , the Declaration 's false notion of equality " had strong hold on the mind of Mr. Jefferson … which caused him to take an utterly false view of the subordinate relation of the black to the white race in the South ; and to hold , in consequence , that the former , though utterly unqualified to possess liberty , were as fully entitled to both liberty and equality as the latter . "
In other words , both Calhoun and Douglass understood that slavery and classical liberalism were incompatible .
This led Calhoun to denounce classical liberalism , and led Douglass to embrace it .
So if anyone from that era deserves to be called classical liberalism 's " most representative defender , " it 's Frederick Douglass .
FAO 's latest forecast confirms a good 2009 world cereal production , slightly below last year 's record level , which coupled with large carryover stocks from the previous season have resulted in ample market supplies .
In the group of 77 Low - Income Food - Deficit countries the 2009 aggregate cereal production is forecast marginally below last year 's record level .
A sharp reduction in India 's rice crop is anticipated but generally good crops are estimated elsewhere .
International prices of wheat and maize , which had returned to normal levels by September , strengthened in October .
Rice export prices continued to decline from the 2008 peak but remain well above pre-crisis levels .
In LIFDCs food prices remain , in general , significantly higher than in the pre-food price crisis period of two years earlier , which continues to give rise to concern for the food security of vulnerable populations .
The ongoing weak to moderate El Niño will likely continue through the end of the year and into early 2010 .
The situation needs to be closely monitored particularly in regions prone to be affected by the event such as Latin America and Southern Africa .
Hurricane Ida in early November resulted in heavy rains , floods and landslides in Central America previously affected by El Niño related drought .
Loss of life , population displacement and damage to infrastructure and agriculture are reported in El Salvador and Nicaragua .
Despite a satisfactory global cereal supply situation , 31 countries around the world require external assistance because of critical food insecurity .
Of particular concern is the Eastern Africa subregion where more than 20 million people are estimated to be in need of emergency food assistance due to poor rainfall in parts , coupled with escalating conflicts and displacements , particularly in Somalia , Kenya and Ethiopia .
“ Good Hair ”
Directed by Jeff Stilson
2009 , 95 min. , PG - 13
Documentary films are often powerful in doing what typical mainstream media outfits can’t : accidentally reveal truths .
There ’s a moment in comedian Chris Rock ’s “ Good Hair ” when a group of young black women discuss the realities of having straightened hair in order to secure work .
When her friends express their concern for her , the lone woman with naturally styled hair has a look on her face that says more about the underlying tensions of black women and hair than do any other moment of the film .
But before the viewer can fully engage in the moment , there ’s a cut .
The filmic cut is emblematic of a truth evident in both the form and content of “ Good Hair , ” a practice of simultaneously exploiting and promoting black women all for a bottom line - be it in the male - dominated black female hair care industry or in a mainstream film about black women that does n’t have women of any race in principal production roles .
At the root of the colorful , fast - paced filmic spectacle that is “ Good Hair ” belies a $ 9 billion dollar global industry in which men , whether they are in the U.S. or Asia , control production , distribution , and ultimately are the major profiteers of black female hair products .
Female workers in Asia comb through the hair , Asian female clerks in the U.S. sell it , and ( reportedly ) black women pay upwards of $ 1,000 for hair weave .
So when black ( male ) business owners complain about Asian merchants impeding their “ right ” to control the industry , one wonders if it matters who ’s in control when all scenarios leave black women as the economically exploited .
How does this relate to the production choices in “ Good Hair ” ?
Consider an indie film about the same topic , “ In Our Heads About Our Hair , ” a lower budget , work in progress doc from first time filmmaker Anu Prestonia .
Within a few minutes of In Our Heads , black female scholar Farah Jasmine Griffin offers a succinct historical context to black women and hair care .
Griffin even says the R - word : racism .
( Rock has Al Sharpton and Paul Mooney offer up snappier analyses . )
While Rock relies on a white male scientist to explain the health impact of sodium hydroxide - laden hair perms , Anu actually finds a black woman , environmental activist Majora Carter to discuss the impact of those compounds on the earth .
You ’d need an entirely separate essay to review the misogyny inherent in the level of airtime afforded to the many men in the film ( rapper Ice - T being the most prominent ) who joke about the multiple costs of love and sex with women who straighten or weave in their hair .
In Our Heads provides a rich example of the black female subjectivity that should rightfully be central in a film about black women and hair .
And it ’s not coincidental that Prestonia worked with a largely female film crew .
Any successes that “ Good Hair ” may boast must be underscored by the fact that currently , a famous black male comedian will have a decidedly easier time making a film about black women than likely any black woman will , famous or not ( okay , Oprah could do it ) .
The question is , though , can he make it funny and non-exploitative ?
After seeing “ Good Hair , ” the answer is not yet .
I wo n’t deny Rock ’s comedic brilliance - you will laugh often .
Nor will I disregard his motives - he starts the film as an ode of sorts to his two daughters .
Perhaps Good Hair ’s popularity ( assumed due to a fairly rigorous promotional campaign ) will open the door for films like In Our Heads .
Until then , the film remains a sobering example of how a film about black women is not actually for us .

In April 2008 , we published an initial assessment of the Bakken Shale and compared it to the USGS estimates of the resource : “ The Bakken – How much will it help ? ” That piece covered production up to October 2007 ; the current article extends that analysis 18 months to March 2009 .
With this installment I would like to look at phases of development as they relate to geographical movement of the play , and discuss whether the Bakken is making an impact on total US production .
In other words , has the Bakken moved the needle on US production ?
Total production of the Bakken
The Bakken formation is one of many producing formations of the Williston basin in the northern US and southern Canada .
For this analysis we are concentrating on the US production only ( Figure 1 ) .
Production has been divided into three segments according to when and where the wells were drilled ; the detail of those segments is discussed below .
The black curve in Figure 1 represents the entire US Bakken production , and the three others show constituent incremental production streams that make up the total .
Figure 2 provides the same information as Figure 1 , but is a more detailed look at the period of 2001 to present .
The Bakken began production in 1961 with a few vertical wells .
Production remained flat until around 1989 when horizontal well technology became more widely adopted in the industry .
Horizontal well completions during the 1980s and 1990s were primarily of two types ; open hole or cased and cemented completions .
In open hole completions , no cemented casing was placed across the producing formation and the formation was allowed to produce naturally , or with minimal stimulation such as a small volume of acid .
In many cases , a perforated liner ( a piece of casing with holes in it ) was run across the producing formation to keep the wellbore open and allow future access if needed .
The other common completion option was to run casing , cement it in place , and then perforate it .
This was a more expensive option than an open hole completion , but would allow for more targeted stimulation either by pumping acid or by pumping sand to create a hydraulic fracture ( a “ frac ” ) .
In the 1990s hydraulic fracturing technology in horizontal wells continuously improved , but mass application of very large multi-stage frac jobs took off only in the late 1990s with the advent of shale plays such as the Barnett Shale in Texas .
This technology was applied to the Bakken in 2000 / 2001 and production increased tremendously , with an incremental increase of about 60,000 barrels per day ( the red curve ) .
This production increase mainly occurred from wells drilled in Montana , as we shall see below .
Beginning in about 2005 , the development focus began shifting to the North Dakota side , setting the stage for an even larger production increase ( the green curve in Figures 1 and 2 ) .
Figure 1 – Production from various phases of development
Figure 2 – Detail Production from various phases of development
Development up to 2001
The majority of wells up to 2001 mainly occurred in western North Dakota ( Figure 3 ) in the Bicentennial and Elkhorn Ranch areas .
Most of these wells were vertical , but beginning in the late 1980s horizontal wells became more common ( more on this topic later in the piece ) .
The production associated with the nearly 200 producing wells is shown in Figures 4 and 5 .
The wells produced about 10 million barrels up to 1988 and thereafter a significant production increase was created by new horizontal wells .
The new wells pushed production up to nearly 14,000 barrels per day , the peak occurring in 1991 , after which a steep decline ensued .
The production decline was about 45 % per year up to 1997 , after which the decline rate lessened to about 7 % per year .
This behavior is typical of fractured reservoirs – an initial steep decline followed by a long tail with a less serious decline .
We can estimate from Figure 5 that these wells together may ultimately produce around 50 million barrels .
It ’s likely that with workovers , recompletions , re-frac’ing of wells , and other techniques , that ultimate recovery will exceed 50 million barrels .

Development 2001 through 2006
In 2000 - 2001 , hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells greatly improved production rates in Elm Coulee field in Richland County , Montana ( Figure 6 ) .
The well count in the Elm Coulee area went from a few dozen wells prior to 2001 , to around 600 wells by December 2006 .
Looking at only the Bakken wells drilled from 1/2001 to 12/2006 , the corresponding production increase was tremendous ( at least relative to past success ) , adding an incremental 65,000 barrels per day at the peak , which occurred in 2007 ( Figure 7 ) .
Current production decline is in the neighborhood of 25 % per year .
On the current trend , the wells might produce at least 130 million barrels ( Figure 8 ) .
With the likely flattening of the decline curve , the recovery could be up to 200 million barrels , possibly more .
Figure 6 – Bakken Development 2001 through 2006
Figure 7 – Bakken production for wells drilled -1/2001 to 12/2006
Figure 8 – Bakken cumulative production for wells drilled -1/2001 to 12/2006
Development 1/2007 to 3/2009
Since 2007 , development has continued in Montana ’s Elm Coulee field , but the bulk of the activity has moved to North Dakota ( Figure 9 ) .
The production rate from wells drilled since 1/2007 ( Figure 10 ) shows a rapid increase in incremental rate to 160,000 barrels per day and rising .
( This includes wells drilled up to December 2008 ; production rate data for January to March 2009 was incomplete so estimates for those months were based on the previous trend . )
The cumulative production ( Figure 11 ) shows that about 50 million barrels were produced up to 3/2009 .
Comparing this phase of development to the previous phase ( Figure 12 ) , current phase is far exceeding production of the previous phase .
It is too early to predict what reserves may be recovered from this tranche of wells , but overall it is reasonable to think that they should be double or triple the reserves expected from the 2001 to 2006 group of wells .
On an individual well basis , ultimate recovery from the better recent North Dakota wells is reportedly in the range of 500,000 to 800,000 barrels , compared to 100,000 to 400,000 barrels per well in Elm Coulee .
The reasons for these astoundingly good wells are the topic of another discussion , but improved frac technology and more frac stages are likely to be big contributors .
In addition , the productive reservoir section on the North Dakota side is thicker and more widely distributed , typical of an unconventional resource play .
If the predictions prove to be accurate and are repeatable over a wide area , this would likely be the most prolific onshore play in the US , at least in the last 20 or 30 years .

A statistical look at well numbers
Figure 13 clearly shows the dramatic shift from vertical to horizontal wells that occurred in the 1990s .
( The horizontal well count Figure 13 is actually number of laterals and not strictly the number of horizontal wells ; that is , many wells are drilled where two or more subsurface laterals are connected to a wellhead .
Usually these are called multilaterals .
For purposes of this discussion , I ’ve used the terms horizontal well and horizontal lateral interchangeably . )
The Bakken formation is now developed almost exclusively with horizontal ( or multilateral ) well technology , and vertical wells are rarely drilled .
Figure 13 – The shift from vertical wells to horizontal laterals
The other big shift , mentioned above , is the geographical focus of development .
This can be seen in Figure 14 , which shows early focus in North Dakota ( the 1990s ) , later focus in Montana , and then a shift back to North Dakota starting in 2005 .

Comparison to the 2008 USGS estimate
The 2008 USGS study ( Figure 15 ) estimates 3,600 million barrels of “ undiscovered oil resources ” in the “ Bakken - Lodgepole Total Production System . ”
For a more detailed discussion of oil resources , and technically and economically recoverable reserves the reader is referred to my original post .
In that post I took a stab at what was meant by the USGS term of “ undiscovered oil resources ” by defining it this way : " the volume of hydrocarbons that theoretically could be produced if enough wells were drilled to drain the entire known area of Bakken oil accumulation . "
Figure 15 – Undiscovered resources from the USGS study
It is interesting to compare the phases of development outlined above , to the USGS map of Assessment Units ( AU’s ) in Figure 16 .
The majority of production from wells drilled up to 2007 came from the Elm Coulee - Billings Nose AU .
Ultimate recovery from those wells based on current information is in the range of 200 to 250 million barrels of oil ( MMBO ) .
That compares to a USGS mean ultimate recovery of 410 MMBO .
Since 2007 , development has been mainly in the Nesson - Little Knife Structural AU and the Easter Expulsion Threshold AU .
The post 1/2007 wells have recovered 50 MMBO and production is rising rapidly .
But production must increase for some time and many more wells are needed to approach the 1882 MMBO estimated technical reserves of the USGS study .
Figure 16 – Undiscovered resources from the USGS study
Bakken production – a drop in the bucket or a big boost to US production ?
So , let ’s put the Bakken production in perspective .
From the point of view of combining technology with geology to increase oil production , the Bakken is a shining example .
It ’s no mean feat to increase production as rapidly as is indicated in Figure 1 , and it ’s a credit to the oil industry , the free market system , and the serendipity of geology ; land owners , oil producers , service companies , and mother nature ( geology ) have all contributed to make this a top class oil development .
But what about from the perspective of US production and consumption ( Figure 15 ) ?
The EIA estimates that US oil consumption in 2008 was equivalent to 17.8 million barrels per day , declining from a high of 19.4 million barrels per day in 2005 .
US production continued its long slow decline to a level of 6.7 million barrels per day ( including natural gas liquids ) .
Bakken production in 2008 averaged about 118,000 barrels , or about 1.8 % of US domestic production , and about 0.7 % of US consumption .
The Bakken displaced about 1.1 % of the US net 2008 imports of 11.1 million barrels per day .
Domestic production with and without Bakken production is shown below ; graphically the change in US production due to the Bakken is barely perceptible .
( The dashed black line in figure 15 is US production without the Bakken ; the red line is total US production .
The divergence between the two lines is imperceptible except during at the very end of 2008 . )
To answer the question originally posed , the Bakken , even with its high and rapidly increasing production rate , has barely moved the needle on US production .
The longer term take away from the Bakken experience may be that indeed there are additional oil resources in the US that can be developed with technology , but the resource must be enormous and be pursued over a long period of time to have any impact .
It is not clear at this time whether there are other onshore oil plays that will match the Bakken .
It can be argued , though , that there is a good analogy in the development of US gas shales : development of the Barnet , Woodford , Devonian , Haynesville , and other gas shales the last 10 years has been extensive enough to “ move the needle ” on US gas production .
But the argument is diminished somewhat , when one considers the difference in properties between gas and oil ; the viscosity of oil is approximately 100 times more than gas , making it extremely challenging to recover oil from tight shales on the same scale as we have seen in gas development .
Nevetheless , the industry is doing what it can , with active oil shale developments : Tuscaloosa Marine Shale , the oil leg of the Barnett shale , and the Eagleford shale , to mention a few .
It ’s too early to tell whether these will be as prolific as the Bakken .

Conclusions
1 . The focus of Bakken Shale development has shifted from the Elm Coulee field in Montana to several counties in North Dakota .
2. Total Bakken production was approaching 200,000 barrels per day and rapidly increasing as of March 2009 .
Cumulative production was about 160 million barrels .
3 . The current phase of development has greater reserve potential than the previous two phases combined .
4 . The 2008 Bakken production rate of 118,000 barrels per day constituted 1.8 % of US domestic production and 0.7 % of total US petroleum usage .
5 . It ’s too early to say whether other shales as prolific as the Bakken can be developed in the US .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The United States lags far behind other nations in offering paid sick days , paid parental leave and other workplace benefits that proponents consider vital to public health and workers rights , according to research released on Tuesday .

The eight - year study found the most economically competitive nations offer forms of paid leave to workers that the United States does not , according to researchers at Harvard University and Canada ’s McGill University .
Of the world ’s 15 most competitive nations , 14 mandate paid sick leave , 13 guarantee paid maternal leave and 12 provide paid paternal leave by law , they said .
Eleven provide paid leave to care for children ’s health and eight provide paid leave for adult family care .
The United States legally guarantees none of these policies to workers , the authors note .
The findings are published in a new book , “ Raising the Global Floor : Dismantling the Myth that We Ca n’t Afford Good Working Conditions for Everyone . ”
The issue of paid employee leave in the United States has heated up .
Advocates argue paid leave allows sick workers to stay home without financial hardship and helps prevent workers from spreading such diseases as the H1N1 flu .
Advocates for women ’s rights argue paid family leave is essential for women , who tend to care more for family members than do men , to compete and advance in the job market .
Opponents argue that mandating such leave policies would cost jobs and be a financial burden on businesses .
“ One of the questions that ’s consistently asked in the United States is ... will we be able to compete if we have paid sick leave , paid maternity leave ? ” said author Jody Heymann of McGill ’s Institute for Health and Social Policy .
“ Will there be more unemployment ?
Will we lose jobs ?
“ What we found is that none of these policies in any way impede being highly competitive or having low unemployment , ” she said .
The 15 nations are Australia , Austria , Canada , Denmark , Finland , Germany , Iceland , Japan , Netherlands , Norway , Singapore , Sweden , Switzerland , Britain and the United States , all of which have been ranked most competitive over the last decade by the World Economic Forum , she said .
Co-authored by Alison Earle , who was a research scientist at Harvard ’s School of Public Health , the book is published by Stanford University Press .
Looking more widely at 190 countries , the researchers found 163 guarantee paid sick leave and 164 guarantee paid annual leave .
Also , 177 nations guarantee paid leave for new mothers , 74 nations guarantee paid leave for new fathers and 157 nations guarantee workers a day of rest each week , they said .
The United States has none of these , they said .
Facing the U.S. Congress is a proposed Healthy Families Act , which has the support of the Obama administration .
It would require businesses with 15 or more employees to provide up to seven days of paid sick leave per year .
Another proposed act , the Family Leave Insurance Act , would cover paid leave for care of a new child or ill family member .
Space shuttle Atlantis blasts off on space station supply run guardian .
co.uk
Britain 's aspirations to become a spacefaring nation inched a little closer tonight as thousands of microscopic worms boarded the Atlantis space shuttle at Cape Canaveral for a mission to the international space station .
The diminutive space travellers are being flown into orbit as part of research that scientists hope will help explain how astronauts build and lose muscle as they circle the Earth .
The test subjects , from a rubbish tip in Bristol , will be studied in the weightless confines of the Japanese Kibo laboratory , one of the most recent additions to the $ 100 bn space station .
Predecessors of the latest batch of worms made news in 2003 when they survived the Columbia space shuttle disaster .
They were discovered in a protective container several weeks after the craft was destroyed during re-entry .
Dr Nathaniel Szewczyk , a scientist at the University of Nottingham who has worked on three previous missions , said the nematode worms will be used to study biological signals that make muscle proteins degrade .
He said the worms are the perfect substitute for examining the long - term effects of weightlessness on humans .
" We can learn things in space that we would not be able to learn on Earth , " Szewczyk said .
" If we can identify what causes the body to react in certain ways in space we establish new pathways for research back on Earth . "
The worms have been carefully selected for the mission and will be exposed to conditions in space for four days and then frozen in preparation for the return journey .
The effect of this journey on their muscle mass will be investigated once the worms are returned to the university 's laboratories .
Boots boss admits they sell homeopathic remedies ' because they 're popular , not because they work '
Paul Bennett admits that Boots sells homeopathic remedies because they 're popular - despite a lack of scientific evidence that they work
It could go down as a Boot in Mouth moment .
Yesterday , the company that boasts shelf upon shelf of arnica , St John 's wort , flower remedies and calendula cream admitted that homeopathy does n't necessarily work .
But it does sell .
Which according to Paul Bennett , the man from Boots , is why the pharmacy chain stocks such products in the first place .
Mr Bennett , professional standards director for Boots , told a committee of MPs that there was no medical evidence that homeopathic pills and potions work .
' There is certainly a consumer demand for these products , ' he said .
' I have no evidence to suggest they are efficacious .
' It is about consumer choice for us and a large number of our customers believe they are efficacious . '
His declaration recalls Gerald Ratner 's infamous admission in 1991 that one of the gifts sold by his chain of jewellers was ' total crap ' .
Mr Bennett made his comments to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee , which is investigating the scientific evidence behind homeopathy .
This system of complementary medicine , which boasts Prince Charles as a fan , claims to treat and prevent disease by using greatly diluted forms of herbs and minerals .
It is based on the principle that ' like cures like ' - that an illness can be treated by substances that produce similar symptoms .
Boots sells a large range of homeopathic medicines including arnica , St John 's wort , flower remedies and calendula cream
For example , it is believed onions , which make eyes itchy and tearful , can be used to relieve the symptoms of hay fever .
Scientists , however - argue that the ' cures ' are so diluted they are unlikely to contain any of the original substance .
Popular homeopathic treatments include arnica , a plant - based remedy used to treat bruising , and malaria nosode , anti-malaria tablets made from African swamp water , rotting plants and mosquito eggs and larvae .
Arnica , sold by Boots , is a popular herbal treatment used to treat cuts and bruises
Since 2006 , manufacturers have been allowed to claim their products can treat specific ailments , as long as they can prove the treatment is safe .
Unlike conventional medicines , they do not have to show that the remedies actually work .
Instead , they only have to show that the remedy has a history of being used to treat an illness .
Critics fear that the new system could lead to life - threatening illnesses going undiagnosed , or to patients binning the tablets prescribed by their GP in favour of an unproven alternative .
Mr Bennett told the committee that it would be wrong to deny customers - access to homeopathic medicines .
' At the root of this is that these are regulated products which are safe , ' he said .
' Large numbers of customers will believe that they are efficacious through their own experience and to deny someone access to a product of that nature would be wrong . '
The committee also heard there is little evidence the remedies work other than as a placebo - making people feel better simply because they are being cared for .
But Robert Wilson , chairman of the British Association of Homeopathic Manufacturers , told the committee that there is ' strong evidence ' that homeopathy works .
Asked why he had not supplied Mr Bennett or Boots with the details , he said : ' He has n't asked us specifically about the efficacy of homeopathic medicine .
Boots are a very important retailer , they sell a great deal of these products .
If these products do n't work beyond the placebo effect , why do people keep buying them ? '

No , seriously .
For those unaware , Cartoon Network has an animated series called “ Batman : The Brave and the Bold , ” which usually features Batman teaming up with various other superheroes .
It ’s much lighter fare than “ Justice League Unlimited ” or “ Batman : The Animated Series . ”
And here we have NPH playing The Music Meister in the episode “ Mayhem of the Music Meister , ” as a singing villain who can bend people to his will .
It ’s one part Dr. Horrible , one part “ Once More , With Feeling , ” and one part Adam West - era Batman , rolled up into a giant ball of giggling glee .
Oh , NPH .

Federal Reserve Allowing Bailed Out TARP Banks To Restrict Commercial Lending
The following information may be the most important we have ever published .
One of our Intel sources , highly placed in banking circles , tells us that on 1/1/10 all banks that have received TARP funds have been informed by the Federal Reserve that they must further restrict any commercial lending .
Loans have to be 75 % collateralized , 50 % of which has to be in cash , which is a compensating balance .
The Fed has to do one of two things :
They either have to pull $ 1.5 trillion out of the system by June , which would collapse the economy , or face hyperinflation .
This is why the Fed has instructed banks to inform them when and how much of the TARP funds they can return .
At best they can expect $ 300 to $ 400 billion plus the $ 200 billion the Fed already has in hand .
We believe the Fed will opt for letting the system run into hyperinflation .
All signs tell us they cannot risk allowing the undertow of deflation to take over the economy .
The system cannot stand such a withdrawal of funds .
They also must depend on assistance from Congress in supplying a second stimulus plan .
That would probably be $ 400 to $ 800 billion .
A lack of such funding would send the economy and the stock market into a tailspin .
Even with such funding the economy cannot expect any growth to speak of and at best a sideways movement for perhaps a year .
We have been told that the FDIC not only is $ 8.2 billion in the hole , but they have secretly borrowed an additional $ 80 billion from the Treasury .
We have also been told that the FDIC is lying about the banks in trouble .
The number in eminent danger are not 552 , but a massive 2,035 .
The cost of bailing these banks out would be $ 800 billion to $ 1 trillion .
That means 2,500 could be closed in 2010 .
Now get this , the FDIC is going to be collapsed before the end of 2010 , which means no more deposit insurance .
This follows the 9/18/09 end of government guarantees on money market funds .
Both will force deposits into US government bonds and agency bonds in an attempt to save the system .
This will strip small and medium - sized banks and force them into shutting down or being absorbed .
This means you have to get your money out of banks , especially CDs .
We repeat get your cash values out of life insurance policies and annuities .
They are invested 80 % in stocks and 20 % in bonds .
Keep only enough money in banks for three months of operating expenses , six months for businesses .
Major and semi-major banks are being told to obtain secure storage for new currency - dollars .
They expect official devaluation by the end of the year .
We do not know what the exchange rate will be , but as we have stated previously we expect three old dollars to be traded for one new dollar .
The alternative is gold and silver coins and shares .
For those with substantial sums that do not want to be in gold and silver related assets completely you can use Canadian and Swiss Treasuries .
If you need brokers for these investments we can supply them .
The Fed also expects a meltdown in the bond market , especially in municipals .
Public services will be cut drastically leading to increased crime and social problems , not to mention the psychological trauma that our country will experience .
Already 50 % of homes in hard hit urban areas are under water , nationwide more than 25 % .
That means you have to be out of bonds as well , especially municipals .
As you can see , the Illuminist program is going to come quicker than we anticipated .
That in part is because they have had to expedite their program , due to exposure in the IF , other publications and especially via talk ratio and the Internet .
There is no doubt we have the elitists on the run .
We are reaching the masses .
On TalkStreamLive.com we were on the Rumor Mill this past week and out of 50 talk radio programs we were 5th behind , Rush , Hannity , Dr. Laura and we were tied with Beck .
On the Sovereign Economist on Wednesday night we were 5th behind Beck and Savage and ahead of Hannity .
Both these programs are not well known and the Sovereign Economist is only about a month old .
It shows you what you can do if you work hard enough at it .
The latest favorable events we are told are the seeds of recovery .
The green - shoots of spring are to be harvested before winter sets in .
We are skeptical of the strength and duration of such a recovery .
The underlying problems are still not being addressed .
The US government and the Fed cannot bail out banking , Wall Street , insurance and government indefinitely via monetization .
Impaired corporations , no matter what their size , have to be allowed to fail .
Stimulus cannot be used indefinitely .
Both have to be reigned in , because the longer this charade continues the worse the final outcome is going to be .
As we predicted six year ’s ago , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Ginnie Mae and FHA are the wards of American taxpayers , as is AIG .
All their financial conditions worsen every day .
They have again been insuring subprime mortgages by the thousands and when they begin to reset next year , we will be back to 60 % failure rates .
Even government admits already they ’ll see 20 % failure rates .
This , so that housing inventory can be cut from 11 - 1/2 - months inventory to 7 - months , again in order to bail out the lenders at the expense of taxpayers .
Government and the Fed have no exit plans for these sinking ships , particularly Fannie , Freddie , Ginnie and FHA , never mind their meddling in the economy guaranteeing everything is sight .
Benito Mussolini would be very proud of what they have done .
Then we have those on Wall Street , banking and corporate America who believe they are doing God ’s work by looting the American public making outrageous profits by in part using taxpayer funds , and allotting themselves disgraceful bonuses as unemployment hovers at 22.2 % .
Have n’t these people heard of the French Revolution ?
Their arrogance has no bounds .
The credit crisis has n’t ended ; the Fed has extended it by throwing money at problems .
We have a mortgage market that is worse than it was a year ago , only kept from sinking by a tax credit 3 % down .
As a result now we have more than $ 1 trillion of new mortgage failures on the way .
Our monetary base has more than doubled .
Interest rates will probably stay where they are for 18 months or more and we even have a dollar carry trade .
The 2009 fiscal budget deficit was $ 1.5 trillion and 2010 will be worse .
Government is not cutting expenses .
They are increasing expenses .
In addition making matters worse corruption is flourishing via the incestuous revolving door between Wall Street , the Treasury , in a multiplicity of other appointments and with the Fed .
Is it any wonder 75 % of Americans want the Fed audited and investigated .
That said , the present set of circumstances cannot be allowed to go on indefinitely .
We cannot keep insurance , Wall Street and banking on life support forever .
Not when we finance two occupations and an ongoing war , never mind our unfunded liabilities of Medicare , Social Security , etc. most all of these problems are being financed by debt to be paid by our great , great grandchildren .
We just created $ 12.7 trillion for bailouts and the Inspector General tells us we are presently on the hook for $ 23.7 trillion .
What happens if all the recipients need another $ 20 trillion ?
The situation is still dire and the solution is temporary and unworkable and Washington and New York are well aware of this .
The game will play out over the next few years .
In the meantime the dollar will move lower and inflation , gold and silver higher .
Economics is not complex ; it is very simple .
Professors and economists would like to have you believe it is complicated when in fact they make it opaque , so you cannot understand it .
The same is true with banking .
In normal times through the century ’s bankers using the fractional banking system usually lent 8 times their assets , or deposits .
It was only until recently that the privately owned Federal Reserve told banks within the system to lend 40 times assets or more in order to accommodate the system .
All this is to cover to confuse and hide the truth of fractional banking .
Bankers ’ indebt borrowers with money they made up out of thin air .
Debt is enslavement by the bankers upon the people by buying almost everyone off .
In the final analysis banking is a fraud unless money is interest free .
The Fed , and all the other banks are a fraud .
The game as we know it today began in 1694 when the Rothschild ’s formed the privately owned Bank of England and the production of bank notes began and circulated along with sterling silver coins .
The end result has been that the bankers own the world .
The system today is based on confidence and trust , something that has been worn thin .
A reflection of the loss of trust and confidence is that 75 % to 80 % of Americans want HR1207 and S604 passed by Congress , so that the Fed can be audited and investigated .
The public no longer trusts the Fed and the banks .
As a result the con game may well be coming to an end .
Fifty years ago we and a handful of other conservative warriors set out to inform the public of the giant scam that the Fed really was .
It has been a long hard road .
Gary Allen and Alan Stang are gone and of the originals all that are left are G. Edward Griffin , Stan Monteith , Anthony Hilder and us .
During our lifetimes we now probably will see the end of the Fed .
Because the people have finally been awakened .
It was a long hard battle that may soon come to fruition .
The final step will be the termination of the Federal Reserve and its monopoly on financial theft .
Unfortunately it will mean the demise of the only financial system we have known for 315 years .
We do not know as yet what the new system will be like , but the con game is over and most of the world ’s inhabitants are broke .
The debt that is owed simply cannot be repaid .
Japan , the US , the UK and Europe will be the first to go followed by most of the rest of the world .
You ask who will be the big winners ?
Gold and silver of course .
Just as we have been telling you they would for 9 - 1 / 2 years , since gold was $ 252.00 and silver $ 3.80 .
Look at the gains for those who listened .
And , we still have a long , long way to go to preserve our wealth .
Over all those years the gold suppression cartel fought to hold down gold prices by selling gold , using derivatives and futures and in collaboration with good producers such as Barrick Gold and others .
Hopefully HR3996 ( HR - 1207 ) will now pass unchanged and we can take a look at what the Fed and the Treasury were doing and who aided them .
What we are witnessing in the US and world economy is the result of the greed of central banks to make as much money as possible before they have to collapse the system to bring about World Government .

New - home sales unexpectedly climbed in October despite bad weather and uncertainty over a big tax credit for first - time buyers .
Sales of single - family homes increased 6.2 % to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 430,000 , the Commerce Department said Wednesday .
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires estimated a 1.0 % drop to a 398,000 annual rate .
Some analysts thought the looming expiration of an $ 8,000 tax credit for homebuyers would scare off buyers in October .
New - home sales , unlike sales of existing homes , are recorded with the signing of a sales contract and not the closing .
There was also unseasonable cool and wetness in parts of the U.S. last month .
The tax credit has since been extended by Congress through April , a move made earlier this month that is seen helping the housing market .
Wednesday 's report said sales in September fell 2.4 % to 405,000 .
Year over year , sales were up 5.1 % since October 2008 .
The median price for a new home fell in October , but not by much , dropping 0.5 % to $ 212,200 .
Inventories shrank some more .

In a glimmer of hope for the labor market , the number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits last week fell to the lowest level since September of 2008 .
Total claims lasting more than one week , meanwhile , also decreased .
Initial claims for jobless benefits declined by 35,000 to 466,000 in the week ended Nov. 21 , the Labor Department said in its weekly report Wednesday .
The previous week 's level was revised to 501,000 from 505,000 .
This represents the lowest figure for claims since September 13 , 2008 and it is the first time initial claims have fallen below the 500,000 mark since early January , according to Labor Department data .
Last week 's initial claims fell by more than economists expected .
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had predicted a decrease of 10,000 claims .
The four - week moving average of new claims , which aims to smooth volatility in the data , also fell by 16,500 to 496,500 from the previous week 's revised average of 513,000 .
That is the lowest figure since November 8 , 2008 .
Economists widely expected initial claims would fall in Wednesday 's report , and some believe that this the break away from the 500,000 mark will be sustained in the weeks to come .
" Taken as a whole , the labor market data for the US is suggesting we are in a gradual , steady improvement towards job growth at some point over the next three to six months and the decline in jobless claims is consistent with that , " said Zach Pandl , an economist at Nomura Global Economics .
" The trend has been very persistent since the end of August and we are expecting that to continue .
"
In the Labor Department 's Wednesday report , the number of continuing claims -- those drawn by workers for more than one week in the week ended Nov. 14 -- declined by 190,000 to 5,423,000 from the preceding week 's revised level of 5,613,000 .
The unemployment rate for workers with unemployment insurance for the week ended Nov. 14 was 4.1 % , a decrease of a 0.2 percentage point from the prior week 's unrevised rate of 4.3 % .
The largest increase in initial claims for the week ended Nov. 14 was in Florida due to layoffs in the construction , trade , service and manufacturing sectors .
The largest decrease in initial claims occurred in California .
Spending by Americans bounced back in October as their incomes rose slightly more than expected and inflation remained low , boding well for economic growth in the fourth quarter .
Commerce Department data Wednesday showed spending last month rose by 0.7 % compared with a September decline of 0.6 % , while personal income rose by 0.2 % for the second straight month .
Meantime , a key gauge of prices that is closely watched by the U.S. Federal Reserve to set monetary policy reiterated inflation was n't a threat as the economy recovers slowly .
The core price index for personal consumption expenditures , which excludes volatile food and energy , rose a monthly 0.2 % in October and by 1.4 % year - on - year .
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast consumer spending would rise by 0.6 % in October while income would increase by 0.1 % .
The core PCE index was seen rising by a monthly 0.1 % .
The U.S. economy 's rebound was softer than originally thought in the third quarter , the government said Tuesday in a revision to its gross domestic product estimate which showed less consumer spending than initially estimated .
U.S. GDP - the broadest measure of output of goods and services - grew at a 2.8 % annual rate during the July to September period , less than the 3.5 % rate calculated by the Commerce Department a month ago .
Consumer spending , which accounts for 70 % of U.S. economic output , increased at a 2.9 % annual rate during the third quarter - less than the 3.4 % estimated previously .
Wednesday 's report was an encouraging sign for growth in the fourth quarter , since both consumer spending and incomes rose by more than expected in October .
Economists currently expect slightly better economic growth in the fourth quarter compared to the previous three months .
One prominent forecaster , Macroeconomic Advisers , predicts GDP growth of 3.1 % .
Personal income data for the previous months was revised up slightly .
It rose by 0.2 % in September and by 0.3 % in August , the report showed , compared to previous estimates of a flat reading in September and a 0.1 % increase the previous month .
Still , with more than 10 % of the U.S. labor force out of work , the rise in incomes remains moderate .
Federal Reserve officials earlier this month raised their expectations for growth this year and in 2010 , but predicted the recovery will be so slow that unemployment will remain high and inflation low until the end of next year .
As for price gauges in Wednesday 's report , the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy , year over year , rose 1.4 % .
The year - over - year gain in September was 1.3 % .
The Fed watches this core PCE index closely for signs of inflation pressures .
Fed officials see core inflation around 1.45 % in 2009 , 1.25 % in 2010 , and 1.3 % in 2011 .
On a monthly basis , Wednesday 's report showed the core PCE index increased 0.2 % in October compared to a 0.1 % increase in September .
The PCE price index including food and energy prices rose 0.3 % in October compared to September .
It rose a monthly 0.1 % in September .
Year over year , the PCE price index was up 0.2 % in October after falling 0.6 % in September .
Demand for long - lasting goods unexpectedly fell in October , brought down by the defense sector , and a barometer of capital spending by businesses tumbled in another sign of the recovery 's sluggishness .
Manufacturers ' orders for durable goods decreased 0.6 % to a seasonally adjusted $ 166.17 billion , the Commerce Department said Wednesday .
Military goods demand plunged .
Excluding defense , all other durables increased by 0.4 % in October , after going 1.8 % higher in September .
Still , if not for a jump in commercial airpline bookings , the drop in overall durables would have been much greater .
While generally negative , the report Wednesday had a few bright spots .
September durables were revised way up , for instance .
A key number in the monthly data , orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft , fell , by 2.9 % , after increasing 2.6 % in September .
The orders are seen as a proxy for capital spending by businesses .
While the economy stopped shrinking last summer , the recovery is expected to be slow , because unemployment has topped 10 % .
Last week , the government said U.S. home construction fell sharply in October , an unexpected drop that erased months of gains .
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had projected overall durable goods orders would climb 0.5 % in October .
Some manufacturers have boosted orders to slow their inventory liquidation and rebuild depleted stockpiles of goods .
The Wednesday data showed manufacturers ' inventories of durable goods were unchanged in October , ending a string of declines .
The last three reports on the sector by the influential research group the Institute for Supply Management have showed manufacturing expanding .
Cars , radios , and coffee makers are durables , goods meant to last at least three years .
Coming out of the severe recession , durables year to date were down 23 % , in unadjusted terms , from the same 10 - month period in 2008 .
Overall durables in September rose 2.0 % , adjusted from a previously revised 1.4 % increase .
US Airways ( LCC ) said this week it plans to defer the delivery of 54 Airbus jets , in a bid to improve liquidity and ease its strained finances .
The deferral will reduce the company 's aircraft capital expenditure by about $ 2.5 billion over the next three years .
The economy has hurt airline revenues .
A sign within Wednesday 's data of future demand for durables , unfilled manufacturers ' orders , fell , by 0.4 % , the 13th drop in a row .
Durable - goods shipments of manufacturers fell 0.2 % last month .
Orders for transportation - related goods climbed 1.5 % , pushed by a 50.8 % jump in non-defense planes .
Motor vehicle orders dipped 0.1 % , despite the success of the government 's incentive program " cash for clunkers " last summer .

Yields on short - term US government debt have fallen into negative territory as banks and investors park their cash in havens before the end of the year .
Ted Wieseman , economist at Morgan Stanley , says : “ There has been a regular pattern during this crisis of bills being badly squeezed around quarter ends , but it ’s happening a lot earlier than normal this time around .
“ Even last year when the financial crisis was nintensifying so far ahead of the actual calendar turn .
” Q3 GDP clearly demonstrates that US bean - counters are manufacturing unreasonable economic data .
First , the initial 3.5 % gain was reduced to 2.8 % .
But the revised Q3 GDP is hokey because it ‘ estimates ’ that ‘ real gross domestic purchases ’ increased 3.5 % .
This is preposterous given the huge declines in sales taxes that have been reported nationally !
Q3 GDP would have been revised even lower if not for the .25 decline in the GDP price adjustment .
We have moaned about the understating of inflation in order to overstate economic ( GDP ) strength for years .
And then there is the bogus jobs and income that inflates GDP .
Given the decline in income taxes according to federal , state and municipal taxing agencies , how did income increase in Q3 ?
Real government spending increased 8.3 % ...
Auto production , due to ‘ Cash for Clunkers ’ , contributed 1.45 to GDP… GDI increased 2.0 % .
The price index for gross domestic purchases , which measures prices paid by U.S. residents , increased 1.4 percent in the third quarter , 0.2 percentage point less than in the advance estimate ; this index increased 0.5 percent in the second quarter .
Excluding food and energy prices , the price index for gross domestic purchases increased 0.4 percent in the third quarter , compared with an increase of 0.8 percent in the second .
Here ’s something else from the GDP report that caught our eye : Profits from current production ( corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments ) increased $ 130.0 billion in the third quarter , compared with an increase of $ 43.8 billion in the second quarter .
Taxes on corporate income increased $ 6.7 billion in the third quarter , compared with an increase of $ 35.6 billion in the second .
How do profits increase $ 130B while taxes only increase $ 6.7B ?
Here ’s the possible answer : Domestic profits of financial corporations increased $ 97.0 billion in the third quarter , compared with an increase of $ 28.5 billion in the second .
Domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations increased $ 12.9 billion in the third quarter , compared with an increase of $ 29.8 billion in the second .
[ Why would non-financial corporations make far less money in Q3 than Q2 if the economy was better in Q3 ?
How much of financial earnings are of market - to - model quality ? ]
“ The weakness in the non-financials tells you how limited this recovery is at this point , ” said Joel Naroff , chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors Inc. in Holland , Pennsylvania .
“ Businesses are going to be very cautious in increasing the cost side and the biggest part of the cost side is labor .
They are n’t going to rush out and hire .
” In the first three quarters of 2009 , profits at financial institutions soared 198 percent , the biggest nine - month gain since records began in 1948 .
Earnings were down 65 percent in the nine months ended in December 2008 , the biggest such decrease on record .
A
House bill still being drafted aims to raise $ 150 billion each year to pay for new jobs .
Under a bill being drafted by Democratic Reps. Peter DeFazio ( Ore. ) and Ed Perlmutter ( Colo . ) , the sale and purchase of financial instruments such as stocks , options , derivatives and futures would face a 0.25 percent tax .
The bill , a copy of which was obtained by The Hill , is titled the “ Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Act of 2009 .
” Banks have spent the past year dealing with a mountain of bad assets .
Now attention is turning to trillions of dollars of debt they have maturing over the next few years .
Banks unable to maneuver around the challenge could be forced to refinance their debt at sharply higher costs .
Citigroup has about $ 30 billion in 2010 of debt coming due next year , with an additional $ 39.5 billion in 2011 and $ 59.3 billion in 2012 .
Bank of America must deal with debts totaling about $ 55.4 billion in 2010 , $ 35.3 billion in 2011 and $ 58.4 billion in 2012 .
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. faces about $ 130 billion maturing through 2012 .
Rising borrowing costs for banks could spill into the broader economy at a time when consumer and corporate borrowers already are under stress .
Banks could pass on the costs in the form of higher interest rates .
The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Tuesday shows that 27 % of the nation 's voters Strongly Approve of the way that Barack Obama is performing his role as President .

U.S. banks are earning money again , but they 're writing fewer business loans , threatening a fragile economic recovery .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. reported Tuesday that U.S. bank loans fell by $ 210.4 billion or 2.8 % during the third quarter – the biggest drop since the FDIC started keeping records in 1984 .
Banks booked $ 2.8 billion in third - quarter profits , reversing a second - quarter loss of $ 4.3 billion .
" We need to see banks making more loans to their business customers , " says FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair .
" This is especially true for small businesses .
" Loans to businesses fell 6.5 % , and real estate loans plummeted 8.1 % .
" Until small businesses are able to borrow , we can't have a robust economy , because that 's your largest source of jobs , " says Richard Posner , a law professor at the University of Chicago and a federal circuit judge .
The Small Business Administration has said that small businesses created 64 % of new jobs in the past 15 years .
Banks are reluctant to make new loans until they 've cleared off the bad ones they made during the housing boom .
Back then , they paid " insufficient attention to certain kinds of risky loans , " says Edward Kane , finance professor at Boston College .
" You can't expect them to turn around and turn the lending machine back on .
" Non-current loans rose more than 10 % during the quarter to $ 366.6 billion or nearly 5 % of all loans , the highest rate on record .
Banks charged off nearly $ 51 billion in bad loans last quarter , the 11th straight quarterly increase and up more than 80 % from a year earlier .
" Loan losses will continue to climb as long as foreclosures keep rising and homeowners , builders and developers continue to hurt , " says Kate Monahan , banking analyst at Aite Group .
Banks do n't expect things to get better anytime soon :
Two out of three banks set aside more reserves for losses during the quarter , reserving a total of $ 62.5 billion , 22 % higher than last year .
Banks are hoarding money in super - safe Treasury securities , and , " Businesses were not as eager to take on debt , " says FDIC chief economist Richard Brown .
Increasing bank failures are feeding the worries : 124 banks have failed this year , up from 25 in all of 2008 , draining the FDIC 's deposit insurance fund , which fell below zero ( to minus $ 8.2 billion ) in the third quarter .
But the FDIC had earlier set aside $ 38.9 billion to cover losses , giving it total reserves of $ 30.7 billion to protect depositors in failed banks .
The FDIC has another $ 23.3 billion in cash .
The agency expects to collect another $ 45 billion at the end of the year when banks pay three years of deposit insurance premiums in advance .
Bair warns not to read too much into one quarter 's results , noting that banks wo n't return to full health until the economy improves .
" It really is all about the economy at this point , " she says .
" I do n't want to make any predictions .
" The International Monetary Fund said it will have access to a credit line of up to $ 600 billion to make loans during financial crises after contributing countries agreed to fold commitments into one pool .
The agreement , yet to be approved by the IMF board , adds as many as 13 members from the current 26 to the so - called New Arrangements to Borrow , including emerging nations China , Russia , Brazil and India , the IMF said in an e-mailed statement .
The decision “ marks an important moment for multilateralism and the fund , which will help the IMF ’s effectiveness in its response to crises , ” Managing Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn said in yesterday ’s statement .
The deal goes beyond a pledge by leaders of the Group of 20 nations to contribute up to $ 500 billion to a credit arrangement that ’s currently worth $ 54 billion , the IMF said .
The worst financial crisis since the Great Depression prompted more nations to seek aid from the fund , created after World War II to help ensure the stability of the global monetary system .
Connecticut plans to join
Ohio in suing credit- rating companies for “ negligent , reckless and incompetent work ” in grading debt purchased by state pension funds , according to Attorney General Richard Blumenthal .
Connecticut and “ a number of other states ” are preparing legal action against Standard & Poor ’s , Moody ’s Corp. and Fitch Ratings , Blumenthal said today in a Bloomberg Television interview .
Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray sued the debt raters this month on behalf of five Ohio public employee retirement funds , saying “ improper ” ratings cost the funds more than $ 457 million .
The state actions come amid criticism of the ratings services by investors and lawmakers including Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd , who has said the companies wrongly assigned top credit rankings to U.S. subprime - mortgage bonds just before that market collapsed in 2007 .
Defaults on the debt ignited a credit crisis that has led to more than $ 1.7 trillion in writedowns and losses since the start of 2007 .
“ We want money back for our taxpayers as a consequence of these mis-ratings , ” Blumenthal said .
“ They gave AAAs to financial instruments that deserved much , much less .
They were the enablers to this structured finance debacle .
” Blumenthal also sued the credit - rating companies last year , saying they unfairly gave municipal bonds lower ratings than comparable corporate or structured debt .
Dubai World , with $ 59 billion of liabilities , is seeking to delay debt payments , sending contracts to protect the emirate against default surging by the most since they began trading in January .

Moody ’s Investors Service said it would consider the plan a default should bondholders be forced to accept the terms .
A Long Island couple is home free after an outraged judge gave them an amazing Thanksgiving present -- canceling their debt to ruthless bankers trying to toss them out on the street .
Suffolk Judge Jeffrey Spinner wiped out $ 525,000 in mortgage payments demanded by a California bank , blasting its " harsh , repugnant , shocking and repulsive " acts .
The bombshell decision leaves Diane Yano - Horoski and her husband , Greg Horoski , owing absolutely no money on their ranch house in East Patchogue .
Spinner pulled no punches as he smacked down the bankers at OneWest -- who took an $ 814.2 million federal bailout but have a record of coldbloodedly foreclosing on any homeowner owing money .
" The bank was so intransigent that he [ the judge ] decided to punish them , " Greg Horoski , 55 , said about Spinner 's scathing ruling last Thursday against OneWest and its IndyMac mortgage division .
It erased up to $ 291,000 in principal and $ 235,000 in interest and penalties .
The Horoskis -- who had been paying only interest on their mortgage -- had no equity in the home .
Horoski , who had begged the bankers to let him restructure the loan , said , " I think the judge felt it was almost a personal vendetta . "
Dealing with the bank , he said , was " like dealing with organized crime .
"
OneWest said , " We respectfully disagree with the lower court 's unprecedented ruling and we expect that it will be overturned on appeal .
" It claimed it " has been extremely active in working with consumers on home loan modifications through the Obama administration 's Home Affordable Modification Program and other loan modification initiatives .
"
The bank is owned by a private equity group that purchased the failed IndyMac bank .
Yano - Horoski , a college professor of English and cognitive reason , and Horoski , who sells collectible dolls online , bought their 3,400 - square - foot , one - level house 15 years ago for less than $ 200,000 .
In 2004 , court records show , they refinanced , paying off their original mortgage with part of a $ 292,500 sub - prime loan from Deutsche Bank .
They used what was left for health care and for his business .
The loan carried an initial adjustable interest rate of 10.375 percent , which soared to 12.375 percent .
It eventually ended up being either owned or serviced by IndyMac , and the bank sued the couple in July 2005 when they began having trouble making payments because of Horoski 's health problems .
After a foreclosure was approved last January , Yano - Haroski successfully asked for a court settlement conference .
Spinner excoriated OneWest for repeatedly refusing to work out a deal , for misleading him about the dollar amounts at stake in the case , and for its treatment of the couple over months of hearings .
OneWest 's conduct was " inequitable , unconscionable , vexatious and opprobrious , " Spinner wrote .
He canceled the debt because the bank " must be appropriately sanctioned so as to deter it from imposing further mortifying abuse against [ the couple ] .
" The bank is involved in a similar case in California , where it 's trying to foreclose on an 89 - year - old woman , despite two court orders telling it to stop .
Rates for 30 - year fixed U.S. home loans fell for a fourth straight week , matching a record low of 4.78 percent set in April .
The rate dropped from 4.83 percent last week , mortgage buyer Freddie Mac of McLean , Virginia , said today in a statement .
The average 15 - year rate was 4.29 percent .
Low mortgage costs and a tax credit for first - time homebuyers helped increase demand for property , putting existing home sales on pace to hit 6.1 million this year .
Reduced inventory of unsold homes is beginning to stabilize prices .
The S&P / Case - Shiller home - price index rose 0.27 percent in September from August , the fourth consecutive month - to - month gain .
Federal Reserve bond purchases from Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae , which package home loans into securities , brought yields on the bonds down , allowing lenders to reduce rates on new loans while still selling the securities backed by them at a profit .
The central bank pledged to buy up to $ 1.25 trillion in mortgage - backed securities in a program scheduled to end the first quarter of next year .
Yields on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage securities fell to the lowest in more than six months yesterday .
Fed officials have agreed to gradually slow the central banks buying to promote a smooth transition in markets as the announced purchases are completed , according to minutes of their Nov. 3 - 4 meeting released yesterday .
President Barack Obama signed legislation this month to extend and expand a home buying tax credit , which may further boost property sales .
The tax credit for first - time buyers was set to expire Nov. 30 and may have sparked an increase in existing home sales in October .
Purchases of existing homes rose 10.1 percent to the highest level since February 2007 .
Spending by U.S. consumers rebounded in October more than anticipated , an indication that mounting unemployment has yet to stifle Americans willingness to buy .
The 0.7 percent increase in purchases was larger than the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and followed a 0.6 percent September drop , Commerce Department figures showed today in Washington .
Incomes climbed 0.2 percent , also exceeding expectations .
Not since Henry Kissinger fled a team of LaRouche organizers , in the back of a delivery truck in New York City 's Central Park in the early 1980s , has an obese fascist moved so fast to escape an angry crowd , as Al Gore did today in Chicago .
Appearing at a bookstore in the downtown Loop , Gore was confronted by a team of demonstrators from a grass roots group called " We Are Change , " as he was signing his latest fascist screed on the global warming swindle .
Gore bolted from the bookstore , raced down an alley , jumped into a waiting car , and tried to speed off , with protesters chasing after him and banging on the car .
Midwest LYM organizers , who were also on the scene to confront the global warming swindler , provided an eyewitness account of Fat Albert 's flight of fear .
Make no mistake about it .
This little encounter is typical of the kinds of things going on all over the country , as the fascists who brought you the near - destruction of the United States and an onrushing global Dark Age , are no longer walking the streets , smug in the belief that they are literally getting away with murder .
The mass strike dynamic is playing out in thousands of ways , every day , and the recent revelations about the " smoking gun " emails from the East Anglia University global warming propaganda center , have made Al Gore 's life a little more miserable .
As Percy Shelley wrote in " The Mask of Anarchy , " " We are many , they are few . " U.S. building permits for October were revised to down 4.2 % from September to a seasonally adjusted rate of 551,000 , the Commerce Department reported Wednesday .
October building permits were originally reported as being down 4.0 % at a seasonally adjusted rate of 552,000 .
The Federal Reserve 's latest weekly money supply report Friday shows seasonally adjusted M1 fell by $ 27.5 billion to $ 1.691 trillion , while M2 rose $ 2.7 billion to $ 8.392 trillion .
Dubai ’s debt woes may worsen to become a “ major sovereign default ” that roils developing nations and cuts off capital flows to emerging markets , Bank of America Corp. said .
“ One can not rule out -- as a tail risk -- a case where this would escalate into a major sovereign default problem , which would then resonate across global emerging markets in the same way that Argentina did in the early 2000s or Russia in the late 1990s , ” Bank of America strategists Benoit Anne and Daniel Tenengauzer wrote in a report .
A default would lead to a “ sudden stop of capital flows into emerging markets ” and be a “ major step back ” in the recovery from the global financial crisis , they wrote .
[ It is said that Dubai ’s total debt burden is about $ 90 billion , because of sizable off - balance sheet liabilities .
That means like European , British and US banks , they are running two sets of books .

Average rates for 30 - year fixed mortgages fell this week , matching a record low set last spring and more than a full percentage point below what they were a year ago , Freddie Mac said Wednesday .
Rates for 30 - year mortgages averaged 4.78 percent this week , down from 4.83 percent last week and equaling the record low reached the week of April 30 .
Freddie Mac has been tracking rates on 30 - year fixed mortgages since 1971 .
Last year at this time , the 30 - year fixed rate mortgage averaged 5.97 percent .
Interest rates began dropping last November , when the Federal Reserve began spending $ 1.25 trillion to buy up mortgage - backed securities in an effort to lower rates , loosen credit availability and bolster the long - suffering housing market .
Since April , rates have hovered near 5 percent , spurring refinance activity .
However , credit standards remain stringent , so the best rates usually are available only to borrowers with solid credit and a 20 percent down payment .
Rates for 30 - year fixed mortgages are now 0.8 percentage points below this year 's peak set in mid-June .
Refinancing at the current rate shaves roughly $ 100 off monthly payments on a $ 200,000 mortgage , said Frank Nothaft , Freddie Mac 's chief economist .
Freddie Mac collects mortgage rates on Monday through Wednesday of each week from lenders around the country .
Rates often fluctuate significantly , even within a given day , frequently in line with long - term Treasury bonds .
The average rate on a 15 - year fixed - rate mortgage fell to 4.29 percent , down from 4.32 percent last week , according to Freddie Mac .
The 15 - year rate has n't been this low since Freddie Mac started tracking it in 1991 .
Rates on five - year , adjustable - rate mortgages averaged 4.18 percent , down from last week 's 4.25 percent .
Rates on one - year , adjustable - rate mortgages were 4.35 percent for the second consecutive week .
The rates do not include add - on fees known as points .
The nationwide fee for loans in Freddie Mac 's survey averaged 0.7 point for 30 - year and one - year loans .
The fee averaged 0.6 point for 15 - year and five - year mortgages .
Commercial paper contracted for the third week in four , falling $ 10.7 billion to $ 1.257 trillion .
We should remind you that the runs in stocks and bonds have been almost completely driven by liquidity .
Now with Dubai ’s sovereign debt problems more liquidity could be lost and these markets could be in deep trouble .

" We do not know what the exchange rate will be , but as we have stated previously we expect three old dollars to be traded for one new dollar . "
Do n't you expect that the government will confiscate gold or pay $ 252.00 in new dollars ?
A Math Paradox : The Widening Gap Between High School and College Math
Joseph Ganem
We are in the midst of paradox in math education .
As more states strive to improve math curricula and raise standardized test scores , more students show up to college unprepared for college - level math .
The failure of pre-college math education has profound implications for the future of physics programs in the United States .
A recent article in my local paper , the Baltimore Sun : “ A Failing Grade for Maryland Math , ” highlighted this problem that I believe is not unique to Maryland .
It prompted me to reflect on the causes .
The newspaper article explained that the math taught in Maryland high schools is deemed insufficient by many colleges .
According to the article 49 % of high school graduates in Maryland take non-credit remedial math courses in college before they can take math courses for credit .
In many cases incoming college students cannot do basic arithmetic even after passing all the high school math tests .
The problem appears to be worsening and students are unaware of their lack of math understanding .
The article reported that students are actually shocked when they are placed into remedial math .
The article did not shock me .
It described my observations exactly .
In recent years I ’ve witnessed first hand the disconnect between the high school and college math curricula .
As a parent of three children with current ages 14 , 17 , and 20 , I ’ve done my share of tutoring for middle school and high school math and I know how little understanding is conveyed in those math classes .
Ironically much of the problem arises from a blind focus on raising math standards .
For example , the problems assigned to my children have become progressively more difficult through the years to the point of being bizarre .
My wife keeps shaking her head at how parents without my level of math expertise assist their children .
My eighth - grade daughter asked me one evening how to perform matrix inversions .
I teach matrix inversion in my sophomore - level mathematical methods course for physics majors .
It is difficult for me to do matrix inversions off the top of my head .
I needed to refresh my memory by pulling Boas ’ book : Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences off my shelf .
Not exactly eighth grade reading material .
On another night my eighth - grader brought home a word problem that read :
If John can complete the same work in 2 hours and that it takes Mary 5 hours to complete , how much time will it take to complete the work if John and Mary work together ?
That ’s an easy problem if you know about rate equations .
Add the reciprocals of 2 and 5 and reciprocate back to get the total time .
However it took me a lot of thought to arrive at an explanation of my method comprehensible to an eighth - grader .
My other daughter struggled through a high - school trigonometry course filled with problems that I might assign to my upper - class physics majors .
I certainly would n’t assign problems at such a high level to college freshmen .
I kept asking her how she was taught to do the problems .
I wondered if the teacher knew special techniques unknown to me that made solving them much easier .
Alas no such techniques ever materialized .
The problems were as difficult as I judged .
At least I could solve the problems , a feat the teacher could n’t manage in a number of cases .
For example one problem involved proving a complicated trigonometric identity .
My daughter brought it to me saying she had tried but could n’t find a solution .
I saw immediately that the textbook had an error that rendered the problem meaningless .
One side of the problem had a combination of trigonometric functions with odd symmetry and for the other side the symmetry was clearly even .
I told her it was not an identity and that fact could be proven with a simple numerical substitution on each side .
If it is an identity the equality condition must hold for all values of the angle .
A single numerical counter example proves that it is not an identity .
It only took one try to find a counter example .
The next day she reported to me that the teacher could n’t solve the problem .
“ Did you tell him that it is impossible ? ” I asked .
“ I told him it was not an identity and if he put numbers in he would find that out .
He did n’t believe me .
He just said ‘ We ’ll see ’ .
” The teacher never talked about that problem again .
He did teach the class about the symmetry properties of trigonometric functions but evidently he did n’t understand the usefulness of that knowledge .
At the same time I work the summer orientation sessions at Loyola College registering incoming freshmen for classes .
Time and again students cannot pass the placement exam for college calculus .
Many students cannot pass the exam for pre-calculus and that saddles them with a non-credit remedial math course — the problem described in the newspaper article .
Without the ability to take college - level math the choices students have for majors are severely limited .
No college - level math course means not majoring in any of the sciences , engineering , computer , business , or social science programs .
A colleague in the engineering department who also works summer orientation complained to me that many students who wanted to major in engineering could not place into calculus .
The engineering program is structured so that no calculus means no physics freshman year and no physics means no engineering courses until it ’s too late to complete the program in four years .
For all practical purposes readiness for calculus as an entering freshman determines choice of major and career .
The math placement test given to incoming freshmen at orientation has much higher stakes than any test given in high school .
But , the placement test has no course grade or teacher evaluation associated with it .
No one but the student has any responsibility for or stake in its outcome .
Through the years I ’ve found it discouraging as a faculty member to see so many high aspirations dashed at orientation before classes even begin .
I tell students with poor math placement scores to go home , review high school math over the summer and take the test again .
But , few take my advice .
Most students with poor placement scores switch to majors that do not have significant math requirements .
So if eighth graders are taught math at the level of a college sophomore why are graduating seniors struggling ?
How can students who have studied college level math for years need remedial math when they finally arrive at college ?
From my knowledge of both curricula I see three problems .
1. Confusing difficulty with rigor .
It appears to me that the creators of the grade school math curricula believe that “ rigor ” means pushing students to do ever more difficult problems at a younger age .
It ’s like teaching difficult concerti to novice musicians before they master the basics of their instruments .
Rigor–defined by the dictionary in the context of mathematics as a “ scrupulous or inflexible accuracy ” –is best obtained by learning age - appropriate concepts and techniques .
Attempting difficult problems without the proper foundation is actually an impediment to developing rigor .
Rigor is critical to math and science because it allows practitioners to navigate novel problems and still arrive at a correct answer .
But if the novel problems are so difficult that a higher authority must always be consulted , rigorous thinking will never develop .
The student will see mathematical reasoning as a mysterious process that only experts with advanced degrees consulting books filled with incomprehensible hieroglyphics can fathom .
Students need to be challenged but in such a way that they learn independent thinking .
Pushing problems that are always beyond their ability to comprehend teaches dependence –the opposite of what is needed to develop rigor .
2 . Mistaking process for understanding .
Just because a student can perform a technique that solves a difficult problem does n’t mean that he or she understands the problem .
There is a delightful story recounted by Richard Feynman in his book : Surely You ’re Joking , Mr. Feynman ! : Adventures of a Curious Character , that recounts an arithmetic competition between him and an abacus salesman .
( The incident happened in the 1950 ’s before the invention of calculators . )
The salesman came into a bar and wanted to demonstrate the superiority of his device to the proprietors through a timed competition on various kinds of arithmetic problems .
Feynman was asked to do the pencil and paper arithmetic so that the salesman could demonstrate that his method was much faster .
Feynman lost when the problems were simple addition .
But he was very competitive at multiplication and won easily at the apparently impossible task of finding a cubed root .
The salesman was totally bewildered by the outcome and left completely discouraged .
How could Feynman have a comparative advantage at hard problems when he lagged far behind at the easy ones ?
Months later the salesman met Feynman at a different bar and asked him how he could do the cubed root so quickly .
But when Feynman tried to explain his reasoning he discovered the salesman had no understanding of arithmetic .
All he did was move beads on an abacus .
It was not possible for Feynman to teach the salesman additional mathematics because despite appearances he understood absolutely nothing .
The salesman left even more discouraged than before .
This is the problem with teaching eighth - graders techniques such as matrix inversion .
The arithmetic steps can be memorized but it will be a long time , if ever , before the concept and motivation for the process is understood .
That raises the question of what exactly is being accomplished with such a curricula ?
Learning techniques without understanding them does no good in preparing students for college .
At the college level emphasis is on understanding , not memorization and computational prowess .
3 . Teaching concepts that are developmentally inappropriate .
Teaching advanced algebra in middle school pushes concepts on students that are beyond normal development at that age .
Walking is not taught to six - month olds and reading is not taught to two - year olds because children are not developmentally ready at those ages for those skills .
When it comes to math , all teachers dream of arriving at a crystal clear explanation of a concept that will cause an immediate “ aha ” moment for the student .
But those flashes of insight cannot happen until the student is developmentally ready .
Because math involves knowledge and understanding of symbolic representations for abstract concepts it is extremely difficult to short cut development .
When I tutored my other daughter in seventh grade algebra , in her words she “ found it creepy ” that I knew how to do every single problem in her rather large textbook .
When I related the remark to a fellow physicist he said : “ But its algebra .
There are only three or four things you have to know . ”
Yes , but it took me years of development before I understood there were only a few things you had to know to do algebra .
I ca n’t tell my seventh grader or anyone else without the proper developmental background the few things you have to know for algebra and send them off to do every problem in the book .
All three of these problems are the result of the adult obsession with testing and the need to show year - to - year improvement in test scores .
Age - appropriate development and understanding of mathematical concepts does not advance at a rate fast enough to please test - obsessed lawmakers .
But adults using test scores to reward or punish other adults are doing a disservice to the children they claim to be helping .
It does not matter the exact age that you learned to walk .
What matters is that you learned to walk at a developmentally appropriate time .
To do my job as a physicist I need to know matrix inversion .
It did n’t hurt my career that I learned that technique in college rather than in eighth grade .
What mattered was that I understood enough about math when I got to college that I could take calculus .
Memorizing a long list of advanced techniques to appease test scorers does not constitute an understanding .

Media creativity in the aftermath of the 28 June coup against Honduran President Mel Zelaya has generally been limited to such things as CNN ’s classification of the military coup as “ military - led , ” Honduran media classification of tomorrow ’s illegitimate elections as a “ fiesta cívica , ” and the publication of articles in mainstream Honduran newspapers with titles like “ Zelayista Guerrillas Train in Nicaragua . ”
This particular article , published by El Heraldo on 2 August , is accompanied by a photograph of a ragtag group of joggers — some of them barefoot , one in a cowboy hat , and one in all pink — and bears a caption announcing that “ Manuel Zelaya ’s followers have begun military exercises in fields in Nicaragua . ”
More substantive creative endeavors have been undertaken by Dan Archer and Nikil Saval , who have put together a graphic history of the Honduran coup in two parts thus far .
The latter part is based on Joseph Shansky ’s piece “ Smashing the Silence : Community Defiance in Honduras , ” first published on PULSE , and can be viewed below ( note : all annotations appear in the original version ) .
The first part of the graphic history can additionally be viewed here , and information on other projects can be found on Archer ’s website .
Panel 1 – Image in the background is from the Honduras Resists blog .
Panel 2 – For evidence , see a recent poll by Washington - based Greenberg Quinlan Rosner , which showed public support for deposed President Zelaya was still strong .
Panel 1 – The ‘ historic accord ’ quote from the previous panel is from Hillary Clinton , and the speech balloon quote in this panel is taken from here .

This series will cover current and projected land - based vehicle energy efficiency and a high level overview of the factors that determine it , such as aerodynamic drag , weight , efficiency of motive force ( e.g. , engine , motor ) , rolling resistance , driver behavior , drivetrain losses , parasitic losses , environmental factors , Passenger Miles Traveled ( PMT ) , etc .
In this first article of the series , we will focus on energy losses associated with aerodynamic drag losses , or more succinctly , “ drag ” .
As oil production falls and volatile oil prices in concert with a struggling economy induce a pattern of demand suppression / destruction , mobility choices will narrow and Vehicle Miles Traveled ( VMT ) will decline .
What should governments at all levels be proactively preparing for ?
What should individuals and their families be preparing for in advance ?
The choices are broad : at a high level , land use planners could refine cities into a series of compact , carfree urban districts interconnected with mass transit .
For the existing built - out suburban and exurban communities , however , such choices are limited .
Aside from telecommuting , transportation choices will increasingly include biking , carpooling / vanpooling , bus rapid transit , and other efficient means of transportation .
Travel between cities and countries will also undergo a transformation , with air travel becoming less and less affordable .
This is a guest post from Will Stewart .
Will is a systems engineer in the DC area and previously has written several guest posts on The Oil Drum , including a series on Passive Solar Design .
Drag is a force working against an object whenever that object moves through a fluid ( i.e. , a liquid or a gas ) and is highly dependent on the object ’s velocity , Coefficient of Drag ( Cd ) , and cross sectional area .
We can express these dependencies in a simple formula ;
F d = - 0.5 ρv2AC d
where ;
F d = the force of drag ,
ρ = the density of the fluid .
At sea level , dry air is 1.2 kg/m3 at 20 °C and 1.29 kg/m3 at 0°C .
v = the speed of the object relative to the fluid ,
A = the cross sectional area of the vehicle ,
C d = the drag coefficient
Multiple connected vehicular objects ( e.g. , trains , articulated buses , and trucks with multiple trailers ) have more complex calculations , due to the drafting effect of multiple objects in succession .
The distance between each is a major determinate for calculating the aggregate drag force . [ 1 ]
Coefficient of Drag ( Cd )
This is a dimensionless number that describes how ‘ smoothly ’ an object can move through a fluid .
The “ rougher ” the surface of the object , the more turbulence is induced , hence the higher the Cd ; conversely , the more streamlined the object is , the lower the number ( golfballs are an exception ) .
Table 1 has general values for many common objects .
Table 1 : Example Drag Coefficients
C d object or shape 2.1 rectangular box 1.0 ~ 1.4 skydiver ( horizontal ) 1.0~1.3 person standing 0.9 bicycle 0.7~1.1 formula one race car 0.7~0.9 tractor - trailer , heavy truck 0.6 bicycle with faring 0.6~0.7 tractor - trailer with faring 0.5 sphere 0.35~0.45 suv , light truck 0.25~0.35 typical car 0.05 airplane wing , normal operation 0.15 airplane wing , at stall 0.020~0.025 airship , blimp , dirigible , zeppelin
Air flow around a vehicle can be separated into laminar flow and turbulent flow .
Laminar flow is a steady movement of air in one direction .
Turbulent flow , on the other hand , is noted by swirling eddy pockets that increase drag .
A real world understanding of the difference can be realized by anyone who has held their hand out of a moving car window , changing the angle of their hand .
Cd will vary depending on the speed range , so we would want to focus on values that have merit in the ranges we are examining .
Since drag is proportional to the square of the speed , the faster a vehicle travels , the lower the efficiency of distance traveled vs. energy input .
Figure 1 shows where laminar flow separates from the vehicle shape , marking turbulent flow points .
Figure 1 : Example sources of vehicle frontal turbulence
While much design and marketing focus is placed on the streamlining of the vehicles front half , the rear half and undercarriage are equally important ( or more so ) .
Figure 2 shows the effects of different vehicle rear configurations and their affects on turbulence .
Figure 2 : Variation in drag of different rear configurations
Some manufacturers have been smoothing the underside of vehicles in order to further reduce Cd even further ( e.g. , Toyota Prius and Honda Insight ) , with aftermarket vendors offering similar products for several other models .
In order to predict a vehicle 's Cd , manufacturers often simulate wind turbulence with modeling software applications to quickly evaluate " what if " changes to a model design , allowing greater improvements before the physical prototying stage .
Figure 3 : Simulation of vehicle aerodynamics
Once the model has been simulated satisfactorily , production mockups are incrementally created and tested in the wind tunnel to collect actual data to validate the modeling and to zero in on any final improvements .
Figure 4 : Wind Tunnel testing of the new VW Polo
A significant leap forward in human powered vehicle Cd improvement came through the introduction of fully faired recumbent bikes , commonly called velomobiles [ 2 ] [ 3 ] , though their history has been fraught with obstacles .
Due to their aerodynamic superiority , fairings and recumbents were banned from bicycle racing for providing too much of an advantage , so they languished outside the borders of bicycle competition for decades .
The design of velomobiles now includes wind tunnels testing , with one example ( the Reflex 700 ) achieving a ' head - on ' Cd of 0.012 .
The designer of the Reflex ( Don Elliot ) reports that during wind tunnel testing at a 25 degree angle , it registered forces similar to a tacking sailboat .
This effect resulted in an apparent benefit during the 1999 World Solar Cycle Contest where " the riders said they actually stopped pedalling in the gusting cross winds and still maintained speed . "
Figure 5 : Velomobile fairings can reduce a typical cyclist 's Cd from 0.9 to 0.012
Figure 6 : Even freight bikes are becoming more aerodynamic
Area
Coefficient of drag is important , though only one aspect of the drag force equation .
Another equally important variable is cross sectional area of the vehicle with regard to the direction of the travel ( and prevailing wind ) .
This area is typically the frontal area of the vehicle , or the outline of the vehicle when viewed from the front .
Per the equation above , we see that drag is proportional to the cross sectional area , so vehicle designers and serious cyclists take measures to reduce this area as much as possible .
Figure 7 : Cross sectional area differences between car , SUV , and velomobile
A common indicator of the drag of a vehicle is the product of the coefficient of drag ( Cd ) and the cross sectional area ( A ) , which gives us CdA .
This term provides a quick means of assessing the aerodynamic qualities of a vehicular body or cyclist form .
Table 2 below shows the CdA of some selected vehicles .

The next part of this series will cover velocity and rolling resistance ( with at least one surprise ) ...

The other night I was outside smoking a cigarette and I noticed something over by the bedroom window crawling around in and out of things .
Well this is Florida so I figured it was just a lizard or frog or whatever .
A few days passed by without incident , then I saw it .
A fucking rat / mouse whatever , darted out from nowhere .
I was filled with disgust .
How could this be ?
My place is clean , the kind of clean that Adderall makes you obsess about .
All I knew was this fucker had to die .
I went out and bought mouse traps , feeling completely ashamed , hoping that the cashier would think I was using them for a prank or science project .
I put them out but all that would happen was the trap would go off little bastard would run away after eating the peanut butter .
This was not acceptable .
Those are the same fucking things that caused the plague and I ’m sure as hell dying from that .
This must be dealt with swiftly and with a fist made of so much iron that all of nature would fear me .
But what to do ?
How do you torture a rat or make them die the worst , most painful death possible ?
Furthermore , can you even send the message of a brutal dictator to a rodent ?
The next few days , I tried traps , poison , I even constructed a gas chamber that knocked a cup of bleach into a cup of ammonia and trapped the fucking thing but I got nothing .
Then it came to me , “ I should ask PETA the most humane way to deal with this . ”
I emailed them around 5 pm and was shocked at the turn around time .
I mean like in two minutes they were begging me to use a live trap and set it free in the wild .
What came next is exactly what I wanted and why I emailed them in the first place .
( I ’m shady and amazing at tricking people like that . )
“ Whatever you do , do n’t feed them anything that is carbonated !!
Rats do n’t have the ability to burp and their insides will burst ” I rushed out immediately and bought Pop - Rocks , Alka Seltzer and soda candy .
That night I mixed all that stuff together with some peanut butter and some tiny pieces of broken glass for good measure .
The next morning I found three dead bloody rats and have n’t seen another one since .
Thank you PETA !!!
I could n’t have killed them without you !!
Hadley CRU is n’t the only government agency that deletes web content related to climate .
NOAA / NWS Southern Region Headquarters has gotten into the act .
An interesting thing happened today .
NOAA deleted an educational web page about an experiment you can do with CO2 .
Ordinarily such a thing would go unnoticed , especially since it does n’t impact anything particularly important like policy , or climate data .
It ’s just an experiment for kids in the classroom .
Fortunately , I still had the web page open in my browser .
I had been looking at it yesterday , and I had been thinking I might try the experiment myself with a datalogging thermometer , just for fun .
Here ’s the web page as it was open in my browser :
And here is what the same URL looks like now :
You can try it out for yourself :
http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/jetstream/atmos/ll_gas.htm
What could cause NOAA to pull a web page like this on a moment ’s notice ?
Two things .
1 It was featured on Climate Depot yesterday .
2 It had this passage that must not have agreed with somebody higher up in the NOAA food chain :
It has been thought that an increase in carbon dioxide will lead to global warming .
While carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been increasing over the past 100 years , there is no evidence that it is causing an increase in global temperatures .
Or maybe it was this one :
The behavior of the atmosphere is extremely complex .
Therefore , discovering the validity of global warming is complex as well .
How much effect will the increase in carbon dioxide will have is unclear or even if we recognize the effects of any increase .
So rather than corrupt young minds with a simple science experiment with some inconvenient language attached to it , NOAA simply deleted it .
Of course nothing is really deleted on the Internet anymore .
NOAA looks pretty silly thinking it would go away with a simple delete .
The Wayback machine has the missing web page for posterity :
http://web.archive.org/web/20060129154229/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/jetstream/atmos/ll_gas.htm
Now it looks like I ’ll have to run their simple experiment .
Stay tuned .

Biochemist Peter Davies began investigating Alzheimer ’s disease in the 1970s , long before its full impact became clear .
By 2030 roughly 7.5 million Americans will have this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder .
Already Alzheimer ’s costs the country $ 148 billion a year ; we urgently need to find the cause — and a cure .
For years the prevailing theory was that memory loss was caused by protein fragments , so - called plaques and tangles , that accumulate in the brain .
Davies , now at the Litwin - Zucker Center for the Study of Alzheimer ’s Disease and Memory Disorders in Manhasset , New York , suspects a different culprit .
His hunch is that the mechanisms controlling cell division have gone wrong — somewhat like what happens in cancer — and that plaques and tangles are the result .
In the quest for answers , Davies has led hundreds of studies and examined more than 6,000 brains .
What is the central mystery of Alzheimer ’s ?
The two main abnormalities of the disease are microscopic lesions called plaques and tangles , which occur in the brains of patients .
This is how the disease was first recognized , in 1906 .
We want to know if these abnormalities are the result of the disease process or if they are abnormalities that cause the disease .
That ’s been the number - one question in the field for a long time , and there ’s a lot of debate and disagreement about it — are the plaques and tangles cause or effect ?
If we have known about Alzheimer ’s since 1906 , why do we still not understand it ?
By the time we get to look at the brain of a patient with Alzheimer ’s , it ’s really end - stage disease .
Alzheimer ’s is an agonizingly slow process , so by the time we get to study the disease itself during its late stages , all kinds of things have gone on that may be just consequences of disease rather than causal .
What is the most pressing issue today in the field of Alzheimer ’s research ?
It ’s really an issue of what comes first , the chicken or the egg .
The majority of people in this field today believe that the plaques , made of a protein fragment called beta- amyloid pep­tide ( BAP ) , come first , and that the accumulation of this material causes the rest of the disease .
We call them the BAPtists .
The other side of the disease is the tangle , made of a protein called tau .
TAUists believe that this protein comes first .
If you are a BAPtist , you believe that the amyloid is the most important , so you work on ways to prevent or block the production or formation of amyloid in the brain .
But you do n’t think Alzheimer ’s is caused by either plaques or tangles , right ?
I believe these abnormalities are results of the disease process .
We have looked at cancer cell processes in Alzheimer ’s disease to see if they might have the ability to cause the disease and the plaques and tangles that are such striking features .
I know it sounds off , that Alzheimer ’s disease might be similar to brain cancer .
But this came from work in my laboratory and others that suggested that nerve cells in affected regions of the Alz­heimer brain looked like they were trying to divide .
Several of the proteins characteristic of cancer cells seem to show up in these nerve cells , and this is very abnormal .
One research group [ led by a former student ] made mice with adult brain cells and forced them with a viral gene to turn on cell - division machinery .
What happened was dramatic :
The mice showed the same evidence that cell division mechanisms were turned on , and then showed cell death , tangles , and plaques — a lot like Alzheimer ’s disease .
We are trying to find out exactly how and why the nerve cells in the Alzheimer ’s brain decide to turn on their cell division system .
How will knowing the cause of Alzheimer ’s change the way we treat it ?
Right now the treatment we have is for the symptoms of the disease rather than the disease itself .
We really want to slow down the progress of the disease at an early stage .
If we understand the process , hopefully we can slow it down , prevent it , or stop it by interfering with the lesion formations .
Let ’s say I understand precisely what is going wrong in the brain of a patient .
The next thing I want to do is figure out how to accurately diagnose the disease very early , because that way I could save a patient who still had some functioning .
I do n’t want a treatment that simply stops the process in late stages and leaves me with an incapacitated patient .
We ’re working on ways to accurately diagnose the disease early .
That ’s not a trivial matter .
If we were working on something that was n’t quite so uniquely human , it might be an easier task .
When will we have a cure ?
This is an incredibly exciting time right now because the research community has more than 600 clinical trials going .
Hopefully one of them is going to hit .
There are a variety of creative approaches , from drugs to monoclonal antibodies , and it ’s hard to overstate the importance of that .
If the beta - amyloid hypothesis is correct , then the clinical trials we are doing right now might stop or prevent this disease .
One of the hundreds of trials in the field is actually going to provide an effective treatment for this disease ; that ’s my hope , anyway .
People say that Alzheimer ’s will soon swamp the health care system .
Do you agree ?
This is an epidemic in a very real sense .
Alzheimer ’s will kill you , but it will take its sweet time doing it .
You start with a kind of memory impairment where you forget where you put your car keys , but you end up with somebody completely nonfunctional , unable to speak or recognize their own kids .
We ’re not doing nearly enough .
I do n’t think this has really dawned on the health care system yet .
The pharmaceutical industry is heavily invested in Alzheimer ’s now , but it took a long time to get that attention .
In 2050 there will be something like 16 million patients with the disease .
There ’s no way we can afford that .
Most of those patients will end up in a nursing home costing at least $ 40,000 a year .
Multiply that by 16 million .
There ’s no health care system in the developed world that can afford that .
It ’s outrageous .
The emergence of the Anarchist Workers Group at the start of the 1990's was something the WSM welcomed .
Most of the people involved initially with the AWG came from the South London branch of the Direct Action Movement .
At least one founder member of the Anarchist Communist Federation ( ACF ) was also involved initially in the AWG .
This meant they also had a branch in the North of England made up of people from Manchester and Liverpool .
Our welcoming of the AWG was mainly based on a number of reasons .
Their experience within DAM had led them to reject Syndicalism , specifically as a rejection of DAM 's policy of seeking to build revolutionary trade unions .
They also accepted the basis of the Platform of the Libertarian Communists , i.e. they wanted to build an organisation which would have a high degree of theoretical and tactical unity .
[ This article in French ]
On Ireland they took a firm anti-imperialist line , and actually took place in activity around this .
No other anarchist group in England had done so at the time and if anything the other organisations have retreated on this issue since .
On a more incidental level the AWG seemed not to be suffering from the Trot - phobia that prevents most English anarchist groups taking part in anything but their own fronts or local groups where no other left tendency is represented .
Now just over two years later the AWG no longer exists .
In the course of those two years they published four magazines and grew from 12 to 30 members , before shrinking back down to 10 .
Last May the survivors changed the name of the organisation to Socialism from Below and decided they were going beyond anarchism .
What I want to talk about is why this happened and what can we learn from this experience .
The WSM is in a unique position to do this as not only do we have the benefit of hindsight but we also have the advantage of having all their internal documents and bulletins .
In addition WSM members including myself attended two of their national conferences .
On two occasions a couple of their members came over to Ireland and in addition one of their members was an ex-member of the WSM who visited Ireland on a regular basis .
The AWG got off to a promising start although the first issue of Socialism from Below trod on many toes particularly in its excellent analysis of all that was wrong with British anarchism .
Alongside it a pamphlet called " In place of compromise " set out a strategy for anarchists in the trade unions .
This represented an advance of other anarchist positions at the time which either ignored the unions ( Class War ) , attempted to build alternative unions ( DAM ) or rejected any participation in the unions ( ACF ) .
In place of compromise in fact shared many common features with the WSM policy on trade unions .
The problems of the AWG fell into two major categories , political and organisational .
I will deal with the organisational end first .
Throughout its short life the AWG never managed to regularly produce internal bulletins or keep the members informed of decisions made by the national committee .
People had to be forced to act as national officers e.g .
Treasurer and nearly always resigned after 6 months of half doing the job .
As a result subs were never regularly collected from the members and money from sales of Socialism from Below was rarely recovered .
Leaflets and publications were being constantly produced at the last moment , sometimes resulting in serious if humorous mistakes .
One leaflet on abortion for instance included a call for " Free women on demand " .
This was a disastrous way for an organisation to operate and left many members confused and demoralised .
Yet no real attempts were made to sort the mess out , instead at every conference new people would be forced too manage the mess .
Any attempt to discuss solutions was brushed off as " An organisational solution to a political problem " .
There was a political problem all right , the failure to treat organisation as a serious task in itself .
The political problems of the AWG came from a number of sources , some to do with the background of the members some connected with the general climate at the time .
I will deal with them one by one .
Anarchist Theory
The AWG was aware like ourselves of the fact that anarchist as a set of ideas is a bit impoverished .
Its core ideas on the state , the Russian revolution and the role of a revolutionary organisation are the best on the left , if perhaps they lack development .
However on imperialism , women 's oppression , racism and a host of other issues there is either no theory or one that has been lifted from somewhere else in the hope that no - one will notice .
In addition most anarchist organisations do not seem to mind .
Within all the British anarchist groups contradictory positions are held by different people and no attempt is made to resole this fundamental problem .
Instead blind activism is substituted in the hope that if you are busy enough the holes will not show .
This is fine until you met up with another left organisation .
In this case you bailed out and left it to them , this perhaps reached its high point with the anti-poll tax and anti-war campaigns .
The anarchists incapable of challenging the trots on their domination of the existing groups or campaigns instead set up their own .
This was an obvious problem , the AWG 's solution to it however degenerated from the comical to the dangerous .
Initially a load of areas were pin pointed and commissions set up to develop theory in these areas .
None of these commissions completed their however as most members were on two or three of them at once .
They collapsed under their own workload .
Individuals still had a strong commitment to theoretical work so it settled out that informal groups would meet socially and discuss a particular set of ideas .
As there was seldom an internal bulletin there work did not reach the organisation as a whole .
This resulted in the rapid unofficial promotion of a small group of people to the " leadership " of the organisation .
By June of 1990 this resulted in a National conference where almost all the motions had come from this small group and it was obvious to us that the rest of the membership could not follow a fair proportion of the arguments or realise the full effect of what was being debated .
On at least one occasion a motion was passed despite their being serious factual errors in the argument of those arguing for it , errors that no one else picked up on .
Internal education
The AWG because it was not afraid to face the Trots on their own ground succeeded in winning over several members of other left groups , including at least two SWP branch committee members .
These people had however come from a background where anarchists were presented as a group of middle class wallies without two ideas to rub together ( If this sounds familiar it should ) or as dropouts , incapable of dealing with modern society and wishing for a return to living on the land .
Within the AWG however there was no formal educationals on the anarchist tradition but a fair few articles slagging off green anarchists
At the last conference I was shocked to discover that one person who had been in the AWG for over a year knew by his own admission virtually nothing about the anarchists in the Spanish revolution .
Not surprisingly many of these ex-trots came to believe that the AWG must be a radical departure from anarchism for it seemed radically different then what they had been told anarchism was .
Other Anarchists
One feature which the emergence of the AWG demonstrated was that Anarchist groups are capable of being just as sectarian and childish as the mass of Trotskyist groups .
Most other organised anarchists refused to communicate with the AWG .
Members of DAM for instance made an attempt to disrupt an AWG meeting at the Anarchist Book fair in 1991 .
The distinguishing feature was the complete lack of serious argument , instead debate between the groups was restricted to nasty if funny cartoons and smart alekey articles along with a large measure of rumour .
This of course had the effect of making several members of the AWG who were anarchists into people who thought there was no hope of rescuing anarchism from its muddle headed swamp and they were better off striking out alone .
After a while it also meant that the AWG gave up on seriously addressing itself to anarchists at all .
The articles were still there in the paper up to issue 3 but in practise they claimed that after the Gulf War it was almost impossible to get any anarchists to listen to them at all .
To us it was also clear that in London at least they were no longer trying .
In our opinion this sectarianism on behalf of the British anarchist movement towards the AWG was fundamental in the " going beyond anarchism faction " winning over the rest of the organisation .
Far from being smug about the AWG 's demise anarchists in England need to consider their part in convincing several long time anarchists that anarchism no longer had anything to offer them .
The current period
The short period in which the AWG existed was also a period of enormous change for the left .
The collapse of the Soviet Union , its communist parties and of labourism happened in the space of a few short years .
Anarchists for the first time in decades are finding that we can no longer define ourselves in opposition to the rest of the left alone .
In one sense the existence of the myriad Leninist groups was a crutch for us but also a limit on our development .
Anarchists could be sloppy about our attitudes to imperialism , women 's oppression or the unions because we attracted people who were left wing but rejected the authoritarianism of the other revolutionary groups .
One effect of these changes on the AWG was in recognising that all other socialist ideas were redundant they also came to see anarchism as also being redundant .
The prevalent view by the last conference was that we are in a new period of history .
All the traditions that have gone before are redundant and the main task of socialists is to build a new set of ideas .
For a small organisation , isolated from all but one other smaller organisation in another country such an idea has a certain attraction .
We have however decided not to embark on that path , yes anarchism needs to be transformed but we are still anarchists .
The lessons for those of us in Ireland interested in building mass anarchist group (s ) in Ireland should be clear .
The danger of the collapse of the AWG is that it will make us overly cautious , that it will lock us into the same swamp that British anarchism is in .
It has probably already driven British anarchists further into the swamp .
The lessons they will probably draw from the AWG 's demise is that its dangerous to go near the rest of the left , its foolhardy to try and do some original theoretical work and its irresponsible to suggest that anarchism does not already have all the answers that are needed or worse that some of its accepted answers are wrong .
The lessons we draw are somewhat different and are also based on the fact that we made many of the same mistakes initially and nearly met the same fate between 1986 and 1989 .
The first lesson is to make sure that people getting involved with us are not just joining because we are a good organisation but also understand that our politics and methods are good because we are anarchists .
We need to constantly re-examine the anarchist tradition and educate newer members about what that tradition was and is .
Although we recognise that anarchism has its weaknesses in most areas of theory we want to walk before we can run .
Development of theory will only be useful where it is based on the full understanding of the membership .
We have no use for Gerry Healys ( EXPLAIN ) .
This means that such development will be slow and commonly frustrating .
It must be constantly carried out and developed , we must never allow ourselves to fall asleep on a bed of old certainties .
We need to recognise that organisational work is at least as valuable as any other sort of work .
The success of the WSM to date has owed something at least to the fact that a huge amount of effort goes into background work of maintaining a bookservice , communicating regularly with comrades overseas , distributing the magazine etc , etc .
We still fall behind and fail to do stuff on occasion however but its this note I am going to end on .
An organisation is only as good as its ability to get things done and this should never be put to the bottom of the agenda .

* More than 800 people tried to register for FDA event
* Lilly : hesitant to use social media without FDA clarity
* FDA urged to communicate with Wikipedia , other sites ( Recasts with meeting under way ; adds Eli Lilly , other comments , background )
WASHINGTON , Nov 12 ( Reuters ) - Drug makers , Internet companies and nonprofits packed a hearing into what is a gray area for U.S. health regulators : how far Twitter , Wikipedia , blogs and other social media can go in promoting drugs .
The two - day public hearing , convened Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration , aims to find out if the agency needs to specifically regulate how drugs and medical devices under its oversight are promoted on the Internet .
“ Consumers turn to the Web more often than the traditional channels they historically relied on ” such as family , friends and doctors , Wayne Gattinella , chief executive of WebMD , a site for health information , said during a presentation .
The FDA already has strict rules governing what drug makers can say in magazine , newspaper and television advertisements , but the fast - evolving online world is a Wild West when it comes to what is -- and is not -- possible to regulate .
Some frequently used websites have inaccurate or incomplete information , and there is a lack of consistency about the quality of information on websites like Wikipedia and Drugs.com , Diana Zuckerman , president of the National Research Center for Women and Families , said in her remarks .
“ Because the risk of providing inaccurate information on medical products is so high , the FDA needs to establish ongoing relationships with ... websites consumers are relying on , ” she said .
Other speakers slated for the event included representatives of drug companies such as Eli Lilly & Co LLY.N and Pfizer Inc PFE.N , as well as Internet heavyweights like Google Inc GOOG.O and Yahoo Inc YHOO.O .
More than 800 people tried to register for the FDA event , which was held in a meeting room that seats 350 , said Thomas Abrams , director of FDA ’s direct marketing arm .
Abrams was one of a dozen FDA officials who will analyze the public comments to decide what action , if any , the agency needs to take .
An Eli Lilly executive for regulatory affairs told the FDA panel that lack of clarity about the agency ’s guidelines have prevented the company from participating heavily in social media and discussing its products online .
John Mack , editor of online newsletter Pharma Marketing News , and a blogger , said the FDA should require drug makers apply certain “ tags ” or ID codes to Twitter posts to monitor conversations about a product .
TRICKY QUESTIONS
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America industry group this week urged the FDA to adopt a standard safety logo for Web content that would link to FDA - approved information about a drug or device .
[ ID :nN09273270 ]
The logo suggestions attracted much interest from FDA officials , who peppered Jeffrey Francer , PhRMA ’s assistant general counsel , with questions .
Francer said the logo ’s use should be governed by the FDA .
The FDA announced the meeting , called the “ Promotion of Food and Drug Administration - Regulated Medical Products Using the Internet and Social Media , ” in September .
Among questions the FDA asked presenters to address was : what criteria should be used to determine when third - party conversations are subject to “ substantive influence ” by companies that market the products being discussed .
The FDA also asked speakers to discuss what online messages drug makers are responsible for , how companies can achieve balance in ads within the confines of a 140 - character Twitter message and when linking is appropriate or misleading .
The hearing comes after the FDA sent warning letters about drug marketing online to 14 companies in April , including Eli Lilly and Merck & Co Inc MRK.N.
The agency told both companies that its ads online for certain products were misleading because they did not contain any risk information .

MELBOURNE ( Reuters ) - Adult fans at one of Australia ’s most popular motor sport races , the Bathurst 1000 , will be limited to one “ slab ” of beer a day -- or 24 375 ml cans -- as police focus on reducing alcohol - related crime .

The 24 - can rule would also be placed on mixed drinks for the V8 car race starting Thursday which draws thousands to the rural town of Bathurst in eastern New South Wales state , the NSW police said Tuesday .
But more restrained spectators would be able to slake their thirst , if not their craving for alcohol , with up to 36 cans of low or mid-strength beer .
Wine lovers must make do with no more than four liters of cask wine per day and combinations of the options would not be allowed , the police statement said .
“ This is one of the greatest motorsport events in Australia and for some it is a pilgrimage that they make every year , ” Assistant Commissioner Alan Clarke said .
“ Police respect people ’s rights to enjoy the race weekend , but will promptly act when the law is broken .
“ Every year thousands of race fans attend and enjoy the event and Police will not allow their safety to be compromised by a drunken few .
“ As such we will once again be focusing on alcohol related behavior , ” he said .
Police were also urging people traveling to Bathurst to drive safely and closely monitor their speed and fatigue .
The race runs from Thursday to Sunday .
Last fall , I had a unique opportunity to visit Amazon and learn more about their web services ( AWS ) strategy .
From where I sit as a VC , it was obvious they were winning .
You could see it in the number of startups that were building on their platform , and you could see it in the number of startups that were adding to their platform .
All that said , at the time it still was n’t obvious to me what Amazon ’s strategy was to differentiate itself from the others certain to rush into the business — folks like IBM , Microsoft , and Google .
Amazon suggested that the strategy was two - fold , and that it borrowed heavily from the ethos the company has nurtured as the leading web retailer .
First and foremost , as a “ retailer ” Amazon was comfortable running a low - margin business .
This may sound more like a capitulation than a strategy , but think about the competition here .
Do you really think Microsoft or IBM wants to run a low margin business ?
Recent stories , like this one last week on Gigaom , suggest that neither of them do .
The more I read about these larger companies trying to “ add extra value ” to avoid the obvious low margin structure inherent in the cloud business , the more I think that Jeff Bezos is crazy like a fox .
The second piece of the strategy leverages the company ’s prowess in customer support .
One may ask , “ how would a platform company differentiate with customer support ? ”
The answer is that they would have the best developer relations attitude and execution in the business .
This also appears to be playing out in the marketplace .
No cloud platform vendor is more communicative and more of a “ listener ” than Amazon .
In my mind , this is where Amazon has a huge advantage specifically over Google .
While Google is slowly opening up their App Engine these days , it feels like they are being pulled into this mind set , especially when compared to Amazon ’s approach .
I think back to the glory days of Microsoft , and the immense effort that Tod Nielsen put into wooing the developer community .
To me Amazon is executing right out of that playbook .
One last comment on Amazon ’s cloud strategy .
Many in the IT world are quick to point out that its only small businesses and rouge developers in large organizations are using AWS .
This is exactly how these markets develop .
Amazon is simply selling to the innovators and early adopters in the market — the exact customers that are prescribed in Crossing the Chasm .
These are the customers that others will follow , and by the time the laggards come into the market , the game will be over .
At Benchmark , we were lucky enough to have a front row seat during the growth of some of the most successful Open Source companies ever ( Redhat , MySQL ) .
And their early customers were these exact same early adopters .
The huge irony is that the Fortune 500 does n’t know that their rogue developers are already using AWS inside their company without approval , simply because its easier than traversing the red tape inside their organization .
In two years , when they officially decide to “ be ” a cloud customer , they will find that they already “ are ” a cloud customer many times over .
As is common practice , I should disclose that I am a shareholder of Amazon in my personal account , and that I was inspired specifically after learning of their AWS strategy .
It is truly amazing to see a company the size of Amazon successfully launch a new product initiative so different than its core product offering .
Remarkable .

Venerable Brethren ,
Greetings and Apostolic Benediction
Disagreement and error among men on moral and religious matters have always been a cause of profound sorrow to all good men , but above all to the true and loyal sons of the Church , especially today , when we see the principles of Christian culture being attacked on all sides .
2 . It is not surprising that such discord and error should always have existed outside the fold of Christ .
For though , absolutely speaking , human reason by its own natural force and light can arrive at a true and certain knowledge of the one personal God , Who by His providence watches over and governs the world , and also of the natural law , which the Creator has written in our hearts , still there are not a few obstacles to prevent reason from making efficient and fruitful use of its natural ability .
The truths that have to do with God and the relations between God and men , completely surpass the sensible order and demand self - surrender and self - abnegation in order to be put into practice and to influence practical life .
Now the human intellect , in gaining the knowledge of such truths is hampered both by the activity of the senses and the imagination , and by evil passions arising from original sin .
Hence men easily persuade themselves in such matters that what they do not wish to believe is false or at least doubtful .
3 . It is for this reason that divine revelation must be considered morally necessary so that those religious and moral truths which are not of their nature beyond the reach of reason in the present condition of the human race , may be known by all mean readily with a firm certainty and with freedom from all error . [ 1 ]
4 . Furthermore the human intelligence sometimes experiences difficulties in forming a judgment about the credibility of the Catholic faith , notwithstanding the many wonderful external signs God has given , which are sufficient to prove with certitude by the natural light of reason alone the divine origin of the Christian religion .
For man can , whether from prejudice or passion or bad faith , refuse and resist not only the evidence of the external proofs that are available , but also the impulses of actual grace .
5 . If anyone examines the state of affairs outside the Christian fold , he will easily discover the principle trends that not a few learned men are following .
Some imprudently and indiscreetly hold that evolution , which has not been fully proved even in the domain of natural sciences , explains the origin of all things , and audaciously support the monistic and pantheistic opinion that the world is in continual evolution .
Communists gladly subscribe to this opinion so that , when the souls of men have been deprived of every idea of a personal God , they may the more efficaciously defend and propagate their dialectical materialism .
6 . Such fictitious tenets of evolution which repudiate all that is absolute , firm and immutable , have paved the way for the new erroneous philosophy which , rivaling idealism , immanentism and pragmatism , has assumed the name of existentialism , since it concerns itself only with existence of individual things and neglects all consideration of their immutable essences .
7 . There is also a certain historicism , which attributing value only to the events of man 's life , overthrows the foundation of all truth and absolute law , both on the level of philosophical speculations and especially to Christian dogmas .
8 . In all this confusion of opinion it is some consolation to Us to see former adherents of rationalism today frequently desiring to return to the fountain of divinely communicated truth , and to acknowledge and profess the word of God as contained in Sacred Scripture as the foundation of religious teaching .
But at the same time it is a matter of regret that not a few of these , the more firmly they accept the word of God , so much the more do they diminish the value of human reason , and the more they exalt the authority of God the Revealer , the more severely do they spurn the teaching office of the Church , which has been instituted by Christ , Our Lord , to preserve and interpret divine revelation .
This attitude is not only plainly at variance with Holy Scripture , but is shown to be false by experience also .
For often those who disagree with the true Church complain openly of their disagreement in matters of dogma and thus unwillingly bear witness to the necessity of a living Teaching Authority .
9. Now Catholic theologians and philosophers , whose grave duty it is to defend natural and supernatural truth and instill it in the hearts of men , cannot afford to ignore or neglect these more or less erroneous opinions .
Rather they must come to understand these same theories well , both because diseases are not properly treated unless they are rightly diagnosed , and because sometimes even in these false theories a certain amount of truth is contained , and , finally , because these theories provoke more subtle discussion and evaluation of philosophical and theological truths .
10 .
If philosophers and theologians strive only to derive such profit from the careful examination of these doctrines , there would be no reason for any intervention by the Teaching Authority of the Church .
However , although
We know that Catholic teachers generally avoid these errors , it is apparent , however , that some today , as in apostolic times , desirous of novelty , and fearing to be considered ignorant of recent scientific findings , try to withdraw themselves from the sacred Teaching Authority and are accordingly in danger of gradually departing from revealed truth and of drawing others along with them into error .
11 . Another danger is perceived which is all the more serious because it is more concealed beneath the mask of virtue .
There are many who , deploring disagreement among men and intellectual confusion , through an imprudent zeal for souls , are urged by a great and ardent desire to do away with the barrier that divides good and honest men ; these advocate an " eirenism " according to which , by setting aside the questions which divide men , they aim not only at joining forces to repel the attacks of atheism , but also at reconciling things opposed to one another in the field of dogma .
And as in former times some questioned whether the traditional apologetics of the Church did not constitute an obstacle rather than a help to the winning of souls for Christ , so today some are presumptive enough to question seriously whether theology and theological methods , such as with the approval of ecclesiastical authority are found in our schools , should not only be perfected , but also completely reformed , in order to promote the more efficacious propagation of the kingdom of Christ everywhere throughout the world among men of every culture and religious opinion .
12 . Now if these only aimed at adapting ecclesiastical teaching and methods to modern conditions and requirements , through the introduction of some new explanations , there would be scarcely any reason for alarm .
But some through enthusiasm for an imprudent " eirenism " seem to consider as an obstacle to the restoration of fraternal union , things founded on the laws and principles given by Christ and likewise on institutions founded by Him , or which are the defense and support of the integrity of the faith , and the removal of which would bring about the union of all , but only to their destruction .
13 .
These new opinions , whether they originate from a reprehensible desire of novelty or from a laudable motive , are not always advanced in the same degree , with equal clarity nor in the same terms , nor always with unanimous agreement of their authors .
Theories that today are put forward rather covertly by some , not without cautions and distinctions , tomorrow are openly and without moderation proclaimed by others more audacious , causing scandal to many , especially among the young clergy and to the detriment of ecclesiastical authority .
Though they are usually more cautious in their published works , they express themselves more openly in their writings intended for private circulation and in conferences and lectures .
Moreover , these opinions are disseminated not only among members of the clergy and in seminaries and religious institutions , but also among the laity , and especially among those who are engaged in teaching youth .
14 .
In theology some want to reduce to a minimum the meaning of dogmas ; and to free dogma itself from terminology long established in the Church and from philosophical concepts held by Catholic teachers , to bring about a return in the explanation of Catholic doctrine to the way of speaking used in Holy Scripture and by the Fathers of the Church .
They cherish the hope that when dogma is stripped of the elements which they hold to be extrinsic to divine revelation , it will compare advantageously with the dogmatic opinions of those who are separated from the unity of the Church and that in this way they will gradually arrive at a mutual assimilation of Catholic dogma with the tenets of the dissidents .
15 . Moreover , they assert that when Catholic doctrine has been reduced to this condition , a way will be found to satisfy modern needs , that will permit of dogma being expressed also by the concepts of modern philosophy , whether of immanentism or idealism or existentialism or any other system .
Some more audacious affirm that his can and must be done , because they hold that the mysteries of faith are never expressed by truly adequate concepts but only by approximate and ever changeable notions , in which the truth is to some extent expressed , but is necessarily distorted .
Wherefore they do not consider it absurd , but altogether necessary , that theology should substitute new concepts in place of the old ones in keeping with the various philosophies which in the course of time it uses as its instruments , so that it should give human expression to divine truths in various ways which are even somewhat opposed , but still equivalent , as they say .
They add that the history of dogmas consists in the reporting of the various forms in which revealed truth has been clothed , forms that have succeeded one another in accordance with the different teachings and opinions that have arisen over the course of the centuries .
16 .
It is evident from what We have already said , that such tentatives not only lead to what they call dogmatic relativism , but that they actually contain it .
The contempt of doctrine commonly taught and of the terms in which it is expressed strongly favor it .
Everyone is aware that the terminology employed in the schools and even that used by the Teaching Authority of the Church itself is capable of being perfected and polished ; and we know also that the Church itself has not always used the same terms in the same way .
It is also manifest that the Church cannot be bound to every system of philosophy that has existed for a short space of time .
Nevertheless , the things that have been composed through common effort by Catholic teachers over the course of the centuries to bring about some understanding of dogma are certainly not based on any such weak foundation .
These things are based on principles and notions deduced from a true knowledge of created things .
In the process of deducing , this knowledge , like a star , gave enlightenment to the human mind through the Church .
Hence it is not astonishing that some of these notions have not only been used by the Oecumenical Councils , but even sanctioned by them , so that it is wrong to depart from them .
17 .
Hence to neglect , or to reject , or to devalue so many and such great resources which have been conceived , expressed and perfected so often by the age - old work of men endowed with no common talent and holiness , working under the vigilant supervision of the holy magisterium and with the light and leadership of the Holy Ghost in order to state the truths of the faith ever more accurately , to do this so that these things may be replaced by conjectural notions and by some formless and unstable tenets of a new philosophy , tenets which , like the flowers of the field , are in existence today and die tomorrow ; this is supreme imprudence and something that would make dogma itself a reed shaken by the wind .
The contempt for terms and notions habitually used by scholastic theologians leads of itself to the weakening of what they call speculative theology , a discipline which these men consider devoid of true certitude because it is based on theological reasoning .
18 . Unfortunately these advocates of novelty easily pass from despising scholastic theology to the neglect of and even contempt for the Teaching Authority of the Church itself , which gives such authoritative approval to scholastic theology .
This Teaching Authority is represented by them as a hindrance to progress and an obstacle in the way of science .
Some non-Catholics consider it as an unjust restraint preventing some more qualified theologians from reforming their subject .
And although this sacred Office of Teacher in matters of faith and morals must be the proximate and universal criterion of truth for all theologians , since to it has been entrusted by Christ Our Lord the whole deposit of faith - Sacred Scripture and divine Tradition - to be preserved , guarded and interpreted , still the duty that is incumbent on the faithful to flee also those errors which more or less approach heresy , and accordingly " to keep also the constitutions and decrees by which such evil opinions are proscribed and forbidden by the Holy See , " [ 2 ] is sometimes as little known as if it did not exist .
What is expounded in the Encyclical Letters of the Roman Pontiffs concerning the nature and constitution of the Church , is deliberately and habitually neglected by some with the idea of giving force to a certain vague notion which they profess to have found in the ancient Fathers , especially the Greeks .
The Popes , they assert , do not wish to pass judgment on what is a matter of dispute among theologians , so recourse must be had to the early sources , and the recent constitutions and decrees of the Teaching Church must be explained from the writings of the ancients .

Although these things seem well said , still they are not free form error .
It is true that Popes generally leave theologians free in those matters which are disputed in various ways by men of very high authority in this field ; but history teaches that many matters that formerly were open to discussion , no longer now admit of discussion .
20 .
Nor must it be thought that what is expounded in Encyclical Letters does not of itself demand consent , since in writing such Letters the Popes do not exercise the supreme power of their Teaching Authority .
For these matters are taught with the ordinary teaching authority , of which it is true to say : " He who heareth you , heareth me " ; [ 3 ] and generally what is expounded and inculcated in Encyclical Letters already for other reasons appertains to Catholic doctrine .
But if the Supreme Pontiffs in their official documents purposely pass judgment on a matter up to that time under dispute , it is obvious that that matter , according to the mind and will of the Pontiffs , cannot be any longer considered a question open to discussion among theologians .
21 . It is also true that theologians must always return to the sources of divine revelation : for it belongs to them to point out how the doctrine of the living Teaching Authority is to be found either explicitly or implicitly in the Scriptures and in Tradition . [ 4 ]
Besides , each source of divinely revealed doctrine contains so many rich treasures of truth , that they can really never be exhausted .
Hence it is that theology through the study of its sacred sources remains ever fresh ; on the other hand , speculation which neglects a deeper search into the deposit of faith , proves sterile , as we know from experience .
But for this reason even positive theology cannot be on a par with merely historical science .
For , together with the sources of positive theology God has given to His Church a living Teaching Authority to elucidate and explain what is contained in the deposit of faith only obscurely and implicitly .
This deposit of faith our Divine Redeemer has given for authentic interpretation not to each of the faithful , not even to theologians , but only to the Teaching Authority of the Church .
But if the Church does exercise this function of teaching , as she often has through the centuries , either in the ordinary or in the extraordinary way , it is clear how false is a procedure which would attempt to explain what is clear by means of what is obscure .
Indeed , the very opposite procedure must be used .
Hence Our Predecessor of immortal memory , Pius IX , teaching that the most noble office of theology is to show how a doctrine defined by the Church is contained in the sources of revelation , added these words , and with very good reason : " in that sense in which it has been defined by the Church . "
22 . To return , however , to the new opinions mentioned above , a number of things are proposed or suggested by some even against the divine authorship of Sacred Scripture .
For some go so far as to pervert the sense of the Vatican Council 's definition that God is the author of Holy Scripture , and they put forward again the opinion , already often condemned , which asserts that immunity from error extends only to those parts of the Bible that treat of God or of moral and religious matters .
They even wrongly speak of a human sense of the Scriptures , beneath which a divine sense , which they say is the only infallible meaning , lies hidden .
In interpreting Scripture , they will take no account of the analogy of faith and the Tradition of the Church .
Thus they judge the doctrine of the Fathers and of the Teaching Church by the norm of Holy Scripture , interpreted by the purely human reason of exegetes , instead of explaining Holy Scripture according to the mind of the Church which Christ Our Lord has appointed guardian and interpreter of the whole deposit of divinely revealed truth .
23 . Further , according to their fictitious opinions , the literal sense of Holy Scripture and its explanation , carefully worked out under the Church 's vigilance by so many great exegetes , should yield now to a new exegesis , which they are pleased to call symbolic or spiritual .
By means of this new exegesis of the Old Testament , which today in the Church is a sealed book , would finally be thrown open to all the faithful .
By this method , they say , all difficulties vanish , difficulties which hinder only those who adhere to the literal meaning of the Scriptures .
24 . Everyone sees how foreign all this is to the principles and norms of interpretation rightly fixed by our predecessors of happy memory , Leo XIII in his Encyclical " Providentissimus Deus , " and Benedict XV in the Encyclical " Spiritus Paraclitus , " as also by Ourselves in the Encyclical " Divino Afflante Spiritu . "
25 .
It is not surprising that novelties of this kind have already borne their deadly fruit in almost all branches of theology .
It is now doubted that human reason , without divine revelation and the help of divine grace , can , by arguments drawn from the created universe , prove the existence of a personal God ; it is denied that the world had a beginning ; it is argued that the creation of the world is necessary , since it proceeds from the necessary liberality of divine love ; it is denied that God has eternal and infallible foreknowledge of the free actions of men - all this in contradiction to the decrees of the Vatican Council . [ 5 ]
26 . Some also question whether angels are personal beings , and whether matter and spirit differ essentially .
Others destroy the gratuity of the supernatural order , since God , they say , cannot create intellectual beings without ordering and calling them to the beatific vision .
Nor is this all .
Disregarding the Council of Trent , some pervert the very concept of original sin , along with the concept of sin in general as an offense against God , as well as the idea of satisfaction performed for us by Christ .
Some even say that the doctrine of transubstantiation , based on an antiquated philosophic notion of substance , should be so modified that the real presence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist be reduced to a kind of symbolism , whereby the consecrated species would be merely efficacious signs of the spiritual presence of Christ and of His intimate union with the faithful members of His Mystical Body .
27 .
Some say they are not bound by the doctrine , explained in Our Encyclical Letter of a few years ago , and based on the Sources of Revelation , which teaches that the Mystical Body of Christ and the Roman Catholic Church are one and the same thing .
[ 6 ]
Some reduce to a meaningless formula the necessity of belonging to the true Church in order to gain eternal salvation .
Others finally belittle the reasonable character of the credibility of Christian faith .
28 .
These and like errors , it is clear , have crept in among certain of Our sons who are deceived by imprudent zeal for souls or by false science .
To them We are compelled with grief to repeat once again truths already well known , and to point out with solicitude clear errors and dangers of error .
29 .
It is well known how highly the Church regards human reason , for it falls to reason to demonstrate with certainty the existence of God , personal and one ; to prove beyond doubt from divine signs the very foundations of the Christian faith ; to express properly the law which the Creator has imprinted in the hearts of men ; and finally to attain to some notion , indeed a very fruitful notion , of mysteries .
[ 7 ]
But reason can perform these functions safely and well only when properly trained , that is , when imbued with that sound philosophy which has long been , as it were , a patrimony handed down by earlier Christian ages , and which moreover possesses an authority of an even higher order , since the Teaching Authority of the Church , in the light of divine revelation itself , has weighed its fundamental tenets , which have been elaborated and defined little by little by men of great genius .
For this philosophy , acknowledged and accepted by the Church , safeguards the genuine validity of human knowledge , the unshakable metaphysical principles of sufficient reason , causality , and finality , and finally the mind 's ability to attain certain and unchangeable truth .
30 .
Of course this philosophy deals with much that neither directly nor indirectly touches faith or morals , and which consequently the Church leaves to the free discussion of experts .
But this does not hold for many other things , especially those principles and fundamental tenets to which We have just referred .
However , even in these fundamental questions , we may clothe our philosophy in a more convenient and richer dress , make it more vigorous with a more effective terminology , divest it of certain scholastic aids found less useful , prudently enrich it with the fruits of progress of the human mind .
But never may we overthrow it , or contaminate it with false principles , or regard it as a great , but obsolete , relic .
For truth and its philosophic expression cannot change from day to day , least of all where there is question of self - evident principles of the human mind or of those propositions which are supported by the wisdom of the ages and by divine revelation .
Whatever new truth the sincere human mind is able to find , certainly cannot be opposed to truth already acquired , since God , the highest Truth , has created and guides the human intellect , not that it may daily oppose new truths to rightly established ones , but rather that , having eliminated errors which may have crept in , it may build truth upon truth in the same order and structure that exist in reality , the source of truth .
Let no Christian therefore , whether philosopher or theologian , embrace eagerly and lightly whatever novelty happens to be thought up from day to day , but rather let him weigh it with painstaking care and a balanced judgment , lest he lose or corrupt the truth he already has , with grave danger and damage to his faith .
31 . If one considers all this well , he will easily see why the Church demands that future priests be instructed in philosophy " according to the method , doctrine , and principles of the Angelic Doctor , " [ 8 ] since , as we well know from the experience of centuries , the method of Aquinas is singularly preeminent both of teaching students and for bringing truth to light ; his doctrine is in harmony with Divine Revelation , and is most effective both for safeguarding the foundation of the faith and for reaping , safely and usefully , the fruits of sound progress . [ 9 ]
32 . How deplorable it is then that this philosophy , received and honored by the Church , is scorned by some , who shamelessly call it outmoded in form and rationalistic , as they say , in its method of thought .
They say that this philosophy upholds the erroneous notion that there can be a metaphysic that is absolutely true ; whereas in fact , they say , reality , especially transcendent reality , cannot better be expressed than by disparate teachings , which mutually complete each other , although they are in a way mutually opposed .
Our traditional philosophy , then , with its clear exposition and solution of questions , its accurate definition of terms , its clear - cut distinctions , can be , they concede , useful as a preparation for scholastic theology , a preparation quite in accord with medieval mentality ; but this philosophy hardly offers a method of philosophizing suited to the needs of our modern culture .
They allege , finally , that our perennial philosophy is only a philosophy of immutable essences , while the contemporary mind must look to the existence of things and to life , which is ever in flux .
While scorning our philosophy , they extol other philosophies of all kinds , ancient and modern , oriental and occidental , by which they seem to imply that any kind of philosophy or theory , with a few additions and corrections if need be , can be reconciled with Catholic dogma .
No Catholic can doubt how false this is , especially where there is question of those fictitious theories they call immanentism , or idealism or materialism , whether historic or dialectic , or even existentialism , whether atheistic or simply the type that denies the validity of the reason in the field of metaphysics .
33 .
Finally , they reproach this philosophy taught in our schools for regarding only the intellect in the process of cognition , while neglecting the function of the will and the emotions .
This is simply not true .
Never has Christian philosophy denied the usefulness and efficacy of good dispositions of soul for perceiving and embracing moral and religious truths .
In fact , it has always taught that the lack of these dispositions of good will can be the reason why the intellect , influenced by the passions and evil inclinations , can be so obscured that it can not see clearly .
Indeed St. Thomas holds that the intellect can in some way perceive higher goods of the moral order , whether natural or supernatural , inasmuch as it experiences a certain " connaturality " with these goods , whether this " connaturality " be purely natural , or the result of grace ; [ 10 ] and it is clear how much even this somewhat obscure perception can help the reason in its investigations .
However it is one thing to admit the power of the dispositions of the will in helping reason to gain a more certain and firm knowledge of moral truths ; it is quite another thing to say , as these innovators do , indiscriminately mingling cognition and act of will , that the appetitive and affective faculties have a certain power of understanding , and that man , since he cannot by using his reason decide with certainty what is true and is to be accepted , turns to his will , by which he freely chooses among opposite opinions .
34 .
It is not surprising that these new opinions endanger the two philosophical sciences which by their very nature are closely connected with the doctrine of faith , that is , theodicy and ethics ; they hold that the function of these two sciences is not to prove with certitude anything about God or any other transcendental being , but rather to show that the truths which faith teaches about a personal God and about His precepts , are perfectly consistent with the necessities of life and are therefore to be accepted by all , in order to avoid despair and to attain eternal salvation .
All these opinions and affirmations are openly contrary to the documents of Our Predecessors Leo XIII and Pius X , and cannot be reconciled with the decrees of the Vatican Council .
It would indeed be unnecessary to deplore these aberrations from the truth , if all , even in the field of philosophy , directed their attention with the proper reverence to the Teaching Authority of the Church , which by divine institution has the mission not only to guard and interpret the deposit of divinely revealed truth , but also to keep watch over the philosophical sciences themselves , in order that Catholic dogmas may suffer no harm because of erroneous opinions .
35 .
It remains for Us now to speak about those questions which , although they pertain to the positive sciences , are nevertheless more or less connected with the truths of the Christian faith .
In fact , not a few insistently demand that the Catholic religion take these sciences into account as much as possible .
This certainly would be praiseworthy in the case of clearly proved facts ; but caution must be used when there is rather question of hypotheses , having some sort of scientific foundation , in which the doctrine contained in Sacred Scripture or in Tradition is involved .
If such conjectural opinions are directly or indirectly opposed to the doctrine revealed by God , then the demand that they be recognized can in no way be admitted .
36 .
For these reasons the Teaching Authority of the Church does not forbid that , in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology , research and discussions , on the part of men experienced in both fields , take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution , in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter - for the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God .
However , this must be done in such a way that the reasons for both opinions , that is , those favorable and those unfavorable to evolution , be weighed and judged with the necessary seriousness , moderation and measure , and provided that all are prepared to submit to the judgment of the Church , to whom Christ has given the mission of interpreting authentically the Sacred Scriptures and of defending the dogmas of faith . [ 11 ]
Some however , rashly transgress this liberty of discussion , when they act as if the origin of the human body from pre-existing and living matter were already completely certain and proved by the facts which have been discovered up to now and by reasoning on those facts , and as if there were nothing in the sources of divine revelation which demands the greatest moderation and caution in this question .
37 .
When , however , there is question of another conjectural opinion , namely polygenism , the children of the Church by no means enjoy such liberty .
For the faithful cannot embrace that opinion which maintains that either after Adam there existed on this earth true men who did not take their origin through natural generation from him as from the first parent of all , or that Adam represents a certain number of first parents .
Now it is in no way apparent how such an opinion can be reconciled with that which the sources of revealed truth and the documents of the Teaching Authority of the Church propose with regard to original sin , which proceeds from a sin actually committed by an individual Adam and which , through generation , is passed on to all and is in everyone as his own . [ 12 ]
38 . Just as in the biological and anthropological sciences , so also in the historical sciences there are those who boldly transgress the limits and safeguards established by the Church .
In a particular way must be deplored a certain too free interpretation of the historical books of the Old Testament .
Those who favor this system , in order to defend their cause , wrongly refer to the Letter which was sent not long ago to the Archbishop of Paris by the Pontifical Commission on Biblical Studies . [ 13 ]
This letter , in fact , clearly points out that the first eleven chapters of Genesis , although properly speaking not conforming to the historical method used by the best Greek and Latin writers or by competent authors of our time , do nevertheless pertain to history in a true sense , which however must be further studied and determined by exegetes ; the same chapters , ( the Letter points out ) , in simple and metaphorical language adapted to the mentality of a people but little cultured , both state the principal truths which are fundamental for our salvation , and also give a popular description of the origin of the human race and the chosen people .
If , however , the ancient sacred writers have taken anything from popular narrations ( and this may be conceded ) , it must never be forgotten that they did so with the help of divine inspiration , through which they were rendered immune from any error in selecting and evaluating those documents .
39 .
Therefore , whatever of the popular narrations have been inserted into the Sacred Scriptures must in no way be considered on a par with myths or other such things , which are more the product of an extravagant imagination than of that striving for truth and simplicity which in the Sacred Books , also of the Old Testament , is so apparent that our ancient sacred writers must be admitted to be clearly superior to the ancient profane writers .
40 .
Truly , we are aware that the majority of Catholic doctors , the fruit of whose studies is being gathered in universities , in seminaries and in the colleges of religious , are far removed from those errors which today , whether through a desire for novelty or through a certain immoderate zeal for the apostolate , are being spread either openly or covertly .
But we know also that such new opinions can entice the incautious ; and therefore we prefer to withstand the very beginnings rather than to administer the medicine after the disease has grown inveterate .
41 . For this reason , after mature reflexion and consideration before God , that We may not be wanting in Our sacred duty , We charge the Bishops and the Superiors General of Religious Orders , binding them most seriously in conscience , to take most diligent care that such opinions be not advanced in schools , in conferences or in writings of any kind , and that they be not taught in any manner whatsoever to the clergy or the faithful .
42 . Let the teachers in ecclesiastical institutions be aware that they cannot with tranquil conscience exercise the office of teaching entrusted to them , unless in the instruction of their students they religiously accept and exactly observe the norms which We have ordained .
That due reverend and submission which in their unceasing labor they must profess toward the Teaching Authority of the Church , let them instill also into the minds and hearts of their students .
43 .
Let them strive with every force and effort to further the progress of the sciences which they teach ; but let them also be careful not to transgress the limits which We have established for the protection of the truth of Catholic faith and doctrine .
With regard to new questions , which modern culture and progress have brought to the foreground , let them engage in most careful research , but with the necessary prudence and caution ; finally , let them not think , indulging in a false " irenism , " that the dissident and the erring can happily be brought back to the bosom of the Church , if the whole truth found in the Church is not sincerely taught to all without corruption or diminution .
44 . Relying on this hope , which will be increased by your pastoral care , as a pledge of celestial gifts and a sign of Our paternal benevolence , We impart with all Our heart to each and all of you , Venerable Brethren , and to your clergy and people the Apostolic Benediction .
Given at Rome , at St. Peter 's , 12 August 1950 , the twelfth year of Our Pontificate .

US authorities expanded a probe Monday into health impacts of drywall imported from China , saying an initial study found a “ strong association ” with indoor pollution in homes using the product .
The Consumer Product Safety Commission said it would be leading an investigation into the relationship between the drywall and the reported health symptoms , and electrical and fire safety issues reported by some home owners .

Some of the drywall linked to the problems was used in rebuilding in southern states after damage from hurricanes .
The agency said it would also examine the origin and distribution of the drywall , which are sheets of plaster used for home interior .
The announcement came after months of complaints from consumers and local officials that defective drywall from China was leaking chemicals that caused illness and safety problems .
“ Results from a major indoor air study of 51 homes are being released today along with initial reports from two studies of corrosion in homes with Chinese drywall , ” the CPSC said in a statement .
“ We now can show a strong association between homes with the problem drywall and the levels of hydrogen sulfide in those homes and corrosion of metals in those homes . ”

The agency contracted with a private health and engineering firm for the initial study of 35 homes using Chinese drywall and additional “ control ” homes .
CPSC said it is “ leading the federal investigation and is working with other federal and state agencies to determine exactly what substances are in the drywall , what substances are emitting odors into the air and whether identified substances found in the air pose a safety or health hazard to families . ”
“ This is a complicated investigation and the data must be evaluated before conclusions are made ; nonetheless , the agencies and states involved share a sense of urgency in informing the public of their findings and developing safe and effective solutions , ” the statement said .

Federal and state officials had received some 2,000 complaints about the drywall for health impacts as well as corrosion of electrical components .
“ We now have the science that enables the Task Force to move ahead to the next phase — to develop both a screening process and effective remediation methods , ” said Consumer Product Safety Commission chairman Inez Tenenbaum .

The study concluded that hydrogen sulfide gas “ is being created in homes built with Chinese drywall , ” although the exact methods were unclear .
Compleat : Bash completion for human beings
Compleat is an easy , declarative way to add smart tab completion for any shell command .
It 's written in Haskell but requires no programming knowledge .
See the GitHub repository for a quick description , or read on for a complete explanation .
Background
I 'm one of those programmers who loves to carefully tailor my development environment .
I do nearly all of my work at the shell or in a text editor , and I 've spent a dozen years learning and customizing them to work more quickly and easily .
Most experienced shell users know about programmable completion , which provides smart tab - completion for supported programs like ssh and git .
You can also add your own completions for programs that are n't supported .
So I read the fine manual and started writing completions .
You can see the script I made for three commands from the Google Android SDK .
It 's 200 lines of Bash code , and fairly straightforward if you happen to be familiar with the Bash completion API .
But as I cranked out more and more case statements , I felt there must be a better way ...
The Idea
It 's not hard to describe the usage of a typical command - line program .
There 's even a semi- standard format for it , used in man pages and generated by libraries like AutoOpt .
For example , here 's the usage for android , one of the SDK commands supported by my script :
android [ -- silent | -- verbose ] ( list [ avd|target ] | create avd ( -- target < target > | -- name < name > | -- skin < name > | -- path < file > | -- sdcard < file > | -- force ) ... | move avd ( - - name < avd > | -- rename < new > | -- path < file > ) ... | ( delete|update ) avd -- name < avd > | create project ( (-- package|--name|--activity| -- path ) < val > | -- target < target > ) ... | update project ( ( - - name| -- path ) < val > | -- target < target > ) ... | update adb )
My idea :
What if you could teach the shell to complete a program 's arguments just by writing a usage description like this one ?
The Solution
With Compleat , you can add completion for any command just by writing a usage description and saving it in a configuration folder .
The ten - line description of the android command above generates the same results as my 76 - line bash function , and it's so much easier to write and understand !
The syntax should be familiar to long - time Unix users .
Optional arguments are enclosed in square brackets ; alternate choices are separated by vertical pipes .
An ellipsis following an item means it may be repeated , and parentheses group several items into one .
Words in angle brackets are parameters for the user to fill in .
Let 's look at some more features of the usage format .
For programs with complicated arguments , it can be useful to break them down further .
You can place alternate usages on their own lines separated by semicolons , like this :
android < opts > list [ avd|target ] ; android < opts > move avd ( - - name < avd >| -- rename < new > | -- path < file > ) ... ; android < opts > ( delete|update ) avd -- name < avd > ;
... and so on .
Rather than repeat the common options on every line , I used a parameter named " opts " .
I can define that parameter to be a sub-pattern , which will be used wherever < opts > appears :
opts = [ -- silent | -- verbose ] ;
For parameters whose values are not fixed but can be computed by another program , we use a ! symbol followed by a shell command to generate completions .
For example , we can run shell commands to suggest names of Android Virtual Devices or target types whenever < avd > or < target > appears in a pattern :
avd = !
android list avd | grep ' Name : ' | cut - f2 -d : ; target = !
android list target | grep ' ^id : '| cut - f2 - d' ' ;
Any parameter without a definition will use the shell 's built - in completion rules , which suggest matching filenames by default .
The source code is on GitHub .
I 've been using it for just a week and I 'm now writing new usage files for myself almost every day .
The README file has more details about the usage syntax , and instructions for installing the software .
Give it a try , and please send in any usage files that you want to share !
( Questions , bug reports , or patches are also welcome . )
Future Work
For the next release of Compleat , I would like to make installation easier by providing better packaging and pre-compiled binaries ; support zsh and other non-bash shells ; and write better documentation .
In the long term , I 'm thinking about replacing the usage file interpreter with a compiler .
The compiler would translate the usage file into shell code , or perhaps another language like C or Haskell .
This would potentially improve performance ( although speed is n't an issue right now on my development box ) , and make it easy for usage files to include logic written in the target language .
Another idea for the future :
What if option - parsing libraries like AutoOpt or the Ruby / Perl / Python equivalents generated completion scripts for every program you wrote ?
Final Thoughts
I realized recently that some things I do are so specialized that my parents and non-programmer friends will probably never get them .
For example , Compleat is a program to generate programs to help you… run programs ?
Sigh .
Well , maybe someone out there will appreciate it .
Compleat was my weekends / evenings / bus - rides project for the last few weeks ( as you can see in the GitHub punch card ) , and my most fun side project in quite a while .
It 's the first " real " program I 've written in Haskell , though I 've been experimenting with the language for a while .
Now that I 'm comfortable with it , I find that Haskell 's particular combination of features works just right to enable quick exploratory programming , while giving a high level of confidence in the behavior of the resulting program .
Compleat 1.0 is just 160 lines of Haskell , excluding comments and imports .
Every module was completely rewritten at least once as I compared different approaches .
( This is much less daunting when the code in question is only a couple dozen lines . )
I do n't think this particular program would have been quite as easy to write — at least for me — in any of the other platforms I know ( including Ruby , Python , Scheme , and C ) .
I had the idea for Compleat more than a year ago , but at the time I did not know how to implement it easily .
I quickly realized that what I wanted to write was a specialized parser generator , and a domain - specific language to go with it .
Unfortunately I never took a compiler - design class in school , and had forgotten most of what I learned in my programming languages course .
So I began studying parsing algorithms and language implementation , with Compleat as my ultimate goal .
My good friend Josh and his Gazelle parser generator helped inspire me and point me toward other existing work .
Compleat actually contains three parsers .
The usage file parser and the input line tokenizer are built on the excellent Parsec library .
The usage file is then translated into a parser that 's built with my own simple set of parser combinators , which were inspired both by Parsec and by the original Monadic Parser Combinators paper by Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer .
The simple evaluator for the usage DSL applies what I learned from Jonathan Tang 's Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours .
And of course Real World Haskell was an essential resource for both the nuts and bolts and the design philosophy of Haskell .
So besides producing a tool that will be useful to me and hopefully others , I also filled in a gap in my education , learned some great new languages and tools , and kindled an interest in several new ( to me ) research areas .
It has also renewed my belief in the importance of " academic " knowledge to real engineering problems .
I 've already come across at least one problem in my day job that I was able to solve faster by implementing a simple parser than I would have a year ago by fumbling with regexes .
And I 'll be even happier if this inspires some friends or strangers to take a closer look at Haskell , Parsec , or any problem they 've thought about and did n't know enough to solve .
Yet .
The good news is that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , a k a the Obama stimulus plan , is working just about the way textbook macroeconomics said it would .
But that ’s also the bad news  because the same textbook analysis says that the stimulus was far too small given the scale of our economic problems .
Unless something changes drastically , we ’re looking at many years of high unemployment .
And the really bad news is that “ centrists ” in Congress are n’t able or willing to draw the obvious conclusion , which is that we need a lot more federal spending on job creation .
About that good news : not that long ago the U.S. economy was in free fall .
Without the recovery act , the free fall would probably have continued , as unemployed workers slashed their spending , cash - strapped state and local governments engaged in mass layoffs , and more .
The stimulus did n’t completely eliminate these effects , but it was enough to break the vicious circle of economic decline .
Aid to the unemployed and help for state and local governments were probably the most important factors .
If you want to see the recovery act in action , visit a classroom : your local school probably would have had to fire a lot of teachers if the stimulus had n’t been enacted .

( CNN ) --
Newly released text messages reportedly from the morning of September 11 , 2001 , show panicked family members trying to contact loved ones and officials frantically trying to grasp what was happening .
More than half a million messages , released by whistleblower site Wikileaks , reveal the panic , horror and pain of what happened that morning in the words of those who experienced it .
On September 11 , 2001 , 19 hijackers commandeered four commercial jetliners , loaded with fuel for cross-country flights .
Two were flown into the World Trade Center 's Twin Towers in New York , one crashed into the Pentagon , and another , headed for an unknown location , crashed in Pennsylvania when it was disrupted by passengers .
A total of 2,976 people -- not including the hijackers -- were killed in the attacks .
Some people witnessing the attacks reached out to loved ones out of fear there might have been more attacks coming and they might die .
" The only thoughts I have are of Nicholas , Ian and you , " read one text message .
" I am terrified .
I needed to tell you that I truly love you .
always , diane . "
" I want to hold you now , " one text message a minute later reads .
" I know you have a new relationship and do not care about me .
But just in case anything happens know I love you hon .
Missed Ya good bye . "
The first indication of a problem comes at 8:50 a.m. , five minutes aft.er the first plane hit the World Trade Center .
" An aloha call is starting .
This is for a fire at 2wt ... "
Another text message references " a bomb detonation " in the World Trade Center and asks recipients of the message to report back assessments of their areas .
A minute later , firsthand reports started flooding in .
" The world trade center has just blow up , we seen the explosion outside our windows .
Teresa ... "
At 8:53 a.m. a message from the New York Police Department 's operations division mobilizes officers toward the World Trade Center , telling them to meet at Church and Vessey streets .
At 9:03 a.m. the second plane hit the World Trade Center .
" It 's a deliberate attack ... a second plane just few into the second tower , " a message said 52 seconds later .
By 9:25 a.m. the personal messages have grown more frequent and more frantic .
Companies begin sending out messages asking for head counts on all employees .
People begin sharing reports of what they are seeing and hearing on TV,­ including early reports of people jumping from the World Trade Center .
Family members panicked , struggling to get through jammed phone lines to find out if their loved ones were OK .
9:25:40 a.m .
" Please call my work as soon as you get in the office .
Need to know you 're safe . "

" Wondering where you are .
Are you okay .
Give me a call back asap .
I just need to know these things .
Even if it 's collect .
Call me .
Darryl "
11:32:56 a.m .
" if i do not hear from you by high noon , i am going to pick laura up at school and tell her her father is dead . "
" goodbye my sweety ..... im going to miss yo , " another said .
" Honey wanted to tell you how much i love you , " one sender wrote .
" I was a little worried .
I Do n't want to lose you now that I got you back .
You mean everything to me .
You have my whole heart and life .
I love you so much . "
Some texts brought relief .
" My dad survived !
I got a call from stepmom 's coworker saying my dad is alive , although that is all the info I have .
I do not know if he is injured or unscathed . "
" Abroer 's father is alive , " one text proclaims .
" survived WTC collapse .
I am trying to contact family members to find out more . "
" urgent .
It 's tim .
I 'm okay .
Call me at home ... i was outside the building when it exploded , but i'm fine . "
Others have to wait and worry .
Numerous messages simply read : " Are you okay ? " " Where are you ? " or " CALL ME NOW ! "
" pete is ok .
He can't find his brother who works in the world financial center next to the trade center ..... " one message read .
The messages also give insight to the federal government 's scramble to evacuate buildings , bases and high - level officials .
" Jim : DEPLOY TO MT .
WEATHER NOW !
Tom " reads one message , referring to Mount Weather , the underground bunker where high - level officials are taken in a national emergency and a command facility for the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
A message at 10:24 a.m. appears to show authorities working to secure the first family .
" TWINKLE AND TURQ ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AND SAFE , " the message says .
Twinkle and Turquoise were the code names used for then - president George W. Bush 's twin daughters Jenna and Barbara .
At 10:32 a.m. a Secret Service message said " ANONYMOUS CALL TO JOC REPORTING ANGEL IS TARGET " -- referring to a call to the Joint Operation 's Center refering a threat made against Air Force One , which used a code name of Angel .
A message from FEMA at 12:37 p.m. notes " we have no mission statements yet . "
A message from the Secret Service 's New York field office sent conflicting messages about where agents should report .
The messages also frantically pass along reports of more attacks .
Some turned out to be rumors , others real .
Rumors were rampant :
" There is a hijacked plane circling dulles airport .
Please call me ! "
" unconfirmed reports of plane crash at camp david now . "
" think one more plane may have been hijacked and headed toward the capitol building ... not sure . "
Wikileaks says it has verified some of the texts and says they all appear to be authentic .
" I fully understand that this is very emotional material , but this does not mean that this is not part of our historic record , " said spokesman Daniel Schmitt .
" And from the publishing perspective of the Wikileaks perspective , that is what counts .
We are helping to maintain an uncensorable part of this day 's record in more detail than has ever been provided before . "
Wikileaks will not say if the source was in government , law enforcement , industry or was a private citizen with the capability to intercept messages .
Nostalgia can be a double edged sword .
It can fill you with glee as you mentally transport yourself to an enjoyable part of your past .
However , when you awake from the temporary dream - like state , you can sometimes realize that your tastes have evolved , matured .
Whether for the better or worse , your tastes have changed , because you personally have changed over the past 20 years .
Mario , on the other hand , has not .
Whether or not that ’s a good thing is in the eye of the beholder .
Unfortunately , in the eyes of this beholder , it ’s more of a bad thing than good .
Before everyone flies off the handle for me not bowing down and kissing Mario ’s sacred ancient butt , I need to make it absolutely clear , there is nothing wrong with New Super Mario Bros .
Wii .
For gigantic Mario fans , fear not , you wo n’t be disappointed with your purchase .
It ’s everyone else that should be wary before purchasing New Super Mario Bros .
Wii .
If you ’re anything like me , a gamer of the better part of 30 years who has seen the rise and fall of the side - scrolling platform genre , you might want to hold off on dropping $ 50 for Mario ’s latest adventure .
Instead , I recommend a rental .
New Super Mario Bros .
Wii is too much of the same for the common elder geek .
Sure , there are new power - ups , and now you can play with your friends , but honestly , how long do you honestly think a few new suits will keep you occupied ?
In reality , probably about a few hours .
Recently I had the golden opportunity to play New Super Mario Bros .
Wii with my adult family .
We all had a wonderful time for a little while .
But after a short amount of time , we were digging for different co-op family games like Mario Kart .
I was even asked the question , “ did n’t you bring anything else ? ” a few times .
Ouch .
Moving on with the review …
Graphically , I feel that Nintendo took the easy way out with New Super Mario Bros .
Wii .
The game is n’t as beautiful as it could or should be .
While the 2.5D approach was admirable for New Super Mario Bros .
DS , the Wii is a graphical powerhouse compared to its handheld little brother and any visual polygons on characters as simple as Mario and Luigi are unacceptable .
An honest - to - god straightforward 2 - dimensional sidescrolling platformer would have been a better way to approach the game .
The controls are exactly the same as they have always been with the exception of adding a few instances of waggle control and tilt control .
Anyone who has picked up a Mario game in the past will not have to enlist in extensive control boot camp to understand the layout of the controller .
Most people who purchase New Super Mario Bros .
Wii are going to be doing so out of curiosity for the unique multiplayer option that has been added into the game .
All the fun of the original Mario adventures but instead of waiting for your turn to come , you can now all play together !
Again , I have incredibly mixed feelings about the multiplayer function .
While some levels feel tailor made for playing cooperatively with more than one person .
Other levels would be cake - easy if played alone , but the inclusion of other players sometimes makes the challenge infinitely more difficult as platforms become too crowded and players get accidentally pushed into obstacles .
Order quickly becomes chaos .
There does n’t seem to be a proper balance between multi-player friendly and single - player friendly levels .
More often than not , gamers will become more frustrated with the other players than they will at the challenges placed before them .
While playing with my family , we all dreaded going into castles since we knew that it was much easier for one person to tackle the castle levels than it was for four .
As far as the challenge goes , New Super Mario Bros .
Wii is definitely one of the most challenging sidescrolling Mario adventures to date .
Whether that is a check or a minus in your book depends on the gamer .
As far as the special suits go , the penguin suit is OK .
The ice flower suit is fun for a short while , but I ’d much prefer fire flowers ( which are in much shorter supply ) .
The helicopter hats make some of the harder jumping levels easier , but I do n’t care much for the shake - to - activate mechanic and then the involuntarily slow decent that follows .
Making an appearance from the DS version is the shrink mushroom as well which is functional for obtaining secret exits .
Yoshi is present in the game , but he appears entirely too infrequently .
I ’m very disappointed by the lack of a “ true ” flying powerup like the winged hats from Mario 64 , the cape from Super Mario World , or the raccoon suit from Super Mario Bros .
3 .
But I am nitpicking .
When you boil down New Super Mario Bros .
Wii , whether you enjoy it or not depends on what you want in your next Mario game .
If you ’re just pining for a trip down memory lane and enjoy some side scrolling adventures , then I ’d only recommend a weekend rental .
A full priced purchase may leave you with buyer ’s remorse especially since you can purchase other , and in my opinion , superior Mario games in the Virtual Console marketplace .
On the other hand , if you know for a fact that you are going to play this game until you master every level and find every single secret , then by all means , purchase this title .
For everyone else , rent this title .
It ’s just another Mario game .
It ’s really nothing worthy to write home about .

As we reported last week , it seemed as if the Hayabusa asteroid explorer mission was dealt a fatal blow when the third of its four ion engines failed .
But the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) announced yesterday that it may have come up with a solution to that problem to get Hayabusa back home by using components from two different inoperable thrusters in combination .
The Hayabusa mission has been rather plagued with problems throughout the entire mission .
Its goal was to land on the asteroid Itokawa and return a sample to the Earth .
It orbited the asteroid for three months in late 2005 , and took near - infrared and X - ray spectral data .
The landing , unfortunately , may or may not have gathered up a sample of the asteroid – though the container that the sample was supposed to go into may contain dust kicked up by the landing .
After taking off from the asteroid , communication was temporarily lost with the craft .
Communication was re-established with the craft , but the ion thrusters that propel it began to have problems , and as we reported last week , 3 of the 4 thrusters on Hayabusa were no longer operational .
Thruster D , which has been the sole source of propulsion for the craft since February 2009 , gave out due to a voltage spike .
The remaining thruster , C , was shut down to avoid damage .
Things were starting to look pretty grim for a mission that has overcome a lot of problems so far .
In an announcement made by JAXA yesterday , a solution has been proposed to use part of two different thrusters in combination to propel the craft .
Ion engines work ionizing a neutral gas – in Hayabusa ’s case , xenon – and forcing them out of an electrified grid on the back of the craft .
When this is done , though , there is a negative charge imbalance in the craft which would attract the ions right back into the engines .
To compensate , a neutralizer ejects electrons into the ionized gas that has been released , so that they do n’t come back into the craft and the charge of the craft remains neutral .
To fix the current problem , the JAXA engineers have proposed using the ion propellant from thruster B and the neutralizer from thruster A , effectively combining them into one complete thruster .
Thruster A was deemed “ unstable ” after launch , and remains unused .
Thruster C will remain shut off , and only be used in case of failure of this rigged - up system .
Its neutralizer is operating poorly , and given that the cause of failure for thrusters B and D was due to a neutrializer problem , the mission engineers want to be cautious .
Combining the engines will consume twice as much fuel and power as they would consume alone , but Hayabusa apparently has plenty of both in spades .
5 kg of fuel will be required to gain 200 meters per second acceleration over 2000 hours , but Hayabusa still has 20 kilograms of fuel in reserve .
This system was n’t tested on the ground , but apparently has worked in space for over one week ( 180 hours ) .
This thrusting combination will continue to propel the craft ( barring further problems ) until March 2010 .
If any other problems crop up , though , the team will have to delay the return of Hayabusa until 2013 .
If you want to see a cool – though somewhat cheesy – video of the Hayabusa mission so far , there ’s a 30 minute one available on the mission site here .

The Kucinich bill would allow states to form their own single - payer systems :
As reported earlier , House leaders have stripped the Kucinich amendment from the House health care reform bill .
This amendment would help nullify legal challenges against efforts by individual states to enact their own single - payer systems .
[...]
According to Tim Carpenter of Progressive Democrats of America , one avenue of appeal remains regarding these efforts :
Democratic
House leaders can insert what is called a “ Manager ’s Amendment ” into legislation , even when it is closed to any other amendments .
The managers are the majority and minority members who “ manage ” debate for the bill on each side .
Today , tomorrow , and beyond , we need to call these “ managers ” and insist that the Kucinich Amendment is restored into the healthcare bill .
The “ gang ” that holds our future in their hands includes :
* Speaker Nancy Pelosi : Washington , DC , office ( 202 ) 225-4965 ; San Francisco office ( 415 ) 556-4862
* Majority Leader Steny Hoyer : Washington , DC , office ( 202 ... ; Greenbelt office ( 301 ) ... ; Waldorf office ( 301 ) ...

Content Management Systems ( CMS ) have evolved into more than just publishing content , but managing your workflow as well .
CMS ’s nowadays allow you to easily conceive , edit , index , and publish content , while giving designers and developers more flexibility in customizing their look and functionality .
Although there are many that require advanced skills to operate successfully , this article is going to cover a select few that offer a balance between design , code , and end - user usability .
This article will help you make an informed decision on what CMS is right for you .
Evaluating Content Management Systems
Evaluating content management systems can be an overwhelming task , not because it ’s rocket science , but simply because there are tons of them to choose from .
However , with a structured approach to your evaluation , things can be much easier and less intimidating .
Let ’s talk about the things you should look at when deciding what CMS to use ; here are eight characteristics that a good CMS should have .
1. Intuitiveness : easy to understand and use
Your CMS should have a GUI ( Graphical User Interface ) that ’s easy on the eyes , does n’t have overly complicated options , and offers simplicity in its administration interface .
A good interface means that tasks pertaining to creating and managing your content will be quicker , saving you a lot of time and increasing your productivity .
You should also look at it from an end user ’s perspective : if you ’re building a content management system for a client who ’s not “ technology - savvy ” and you choose a solution that requires a Ph. D. in computer science , it ’s less likely that they ’ll be able to use the system ( thus , defeating the whole purpose of a CMS , which is to empower its users ) .
2. Flexibility and Ease of Customization
When taking into consideration a content management system , make sure that you ’re not obligated to use their design templates .
A large quantity of CMS solutions allows you to customize your own design without major restrictions .
If your CMS forces you to choose a fixed and unalterable design template , then you ’re stripped of creative license and your website will look like everyone else’s .
CMS ’s that offer customizations on templates are Expression Engine , WordPress , and Joomla just to name a few ; these content management systems boast and promote their ability to be easily modified .
3. Extensibility via Plugins and Modules
A good CMS will allow you incorporate helpful site features into your site by letting you extend the default configuration with plugins .
Plugins / extensions / modules ( their terminology varies between different platforms ) make a difference in terms of enhancing your site ’s ability to provide your site users with useful options for interfacing with your site .
Look for a CMS with a powerful Application Programming Interface ( API ) in case you need to write your own extensions .
Make sure that the CMS you ’re considering already has a huge list of plugins .
Though you might not need plugins right away , it ’s important that this is available to you , later down the road .
4. No Need for Programming Knowledge
If you ’re more “ design - oriented ” than anything else , make sure you select a CMS where you wo n’t need to have extensive programming abilities to publish and maintain your site .
There is a wide selection of CMS ’s that have WYSIWYG editors , letting you edit content without the need for code .
Having to edit text through HTML markup can be time consuming and takes you away from other aspects of your managing and building your site .
Complex sites , however , can require a CMS that will let you type in some code , edit files with extensions such as .php , .css , .html , and make changes without that need for a third - party source code editor .
5. Optimized for Performance and Speed
Taking into consideration the speed your pages load on the browser , and how fast your site can make a connection to a server , is vital .
Choosing a CMS that is bulky will drive away visitors rather then bring them in .
By visiting examples of live sites , you ’ll be able to gauge somewhat how fast pages load .
Keep in mind that you can increase the load time of your site by choosing a good host , and adding plugins that cache / compress / minify feeds , CSS , JS and also caches your database objects .
A case study on this subject can be found here .
A simple and free tool that you can use to evaluate page response times of your CMS candidates is YSlow .
Install it and head on over to demo sites of your CMS ’s to see how well it ’s front - end performs .
6. Security
Adequate security for your site is very important and must be in place in order to protect your content .
There are CMS ’s that allow you to install specific plugins and edit files / permissions in order to increase security levels .
Make sure you choose a management system that offers modules to protect the integrity of your site .
You can also protect your site by selecting a CMS that allows you to easily assign a different username and password to each user .
This will let you view and control what each user has access to .
For WordPress , be sure to read about essential security tips and hacks for WordPress .
7. Documentation and Community Support
Nothing ’s more frustrating than trying to figure out how to do something , and not have references online that you can take advantage of .
One way to ensure that you wo n’t be running into this problem is by reading through the documentation of your candidate CMS’s .
Also , a quick Google search will tell you how popular and well - documented a content management system is .
The availability ( or lack thereof ) of support from users of the system can be a deal maker or deal breaker .
When users are active and proud of being part of the community , you not only have access to individuals that are more familiar with the system , but also , you can be assured that the project will be developed continually .
Nothing ’s worse than investing your resources and effort on a dead ( or soon to be dead ) project .
8. Emphasis on Web Standards and Best Practices
Content Management Systems developed under web standards guidelines and best practices will ensure that you wo n’t get burned later down the road .
When applications are designed with best practices in mind , you can be assured ultimate cross - browser compatibility , lean - and - mean code , and ease of maintenance .
Look for content management systems that promote the use of web standards , and those that put it at the forefront of their development and design philosophy .
Some Key Content Management Systems to Consider
Now that you know the key characteristics of a good content management system , let ’s take a look at a handful of major CMS ’s that excel in most , if not all , of those areas .
ExpressionEngine ( EE ) is a flexible CMS for any scope of project .
Within a few minutes , you ’ll understand how to easily begin creating content .
EE ’s templating system lets you quickly see instant changes live .
EE also has a multi- layered caching system to try and minimize the database usage .
In addition , EE lets you embed and run PHP directly within its templates , very similar to WordPress .
ExpressionEngine has various features such as allowing you to have multiple sites with just one installation of their software .
Just as we spoke in the above section dealing with connections and load times , EE has a unique template caching , query caching and tag caching keep the site running at a pretty quick pace by storing database queries in memory to reduce database connections when generating web pages .
WordPress is one of the most popular publishing platforms currently available in the market , and it ’s known for being an excellent blogging platform .
WordPress is free and open source , and it can be downloaded and installed as many times as you want .
WordPress is great for sites of all industries and sizes , such as a hotel chain ’s site or a local auto mechanics , because it has a ton of features for both simple and sophisticated design .
WordPress installations are very quick and easy .
It only takes a few minutes for your admin panel to be operational .
If coding is not your strong suit , then no worries , WordPress offers its users a WYSIWYG editor ( called Visual Editor ) .
Business Catalyst / Goodbary ( owned by Adobe ) is a powerful ecommerce CMS for developers .
This content publishing platform has an array of useful features such as email marketing and in - depth site analytics .
Business Catalyst gives you an easy way for your business to gain an online presence in no time .
GB allows you to easily keep track of a customer ’s actions , build and manage a customer database of any size , and sell your products and services online .
Business Catalyst integrates well with a lot of popular payment systems such as PayPal , Google Checkout and pre-integrated gateways .
Joomla ! is an advanced CMS with excellent function and content management .
The installation process is pretty quick and easy .
Joomla ! is a complete CMS allowing you to build simple to advanced sites .
Joomla also has super support for access control protocols like LDAP and OpenID , and can interface with popular and open API ’s such as Google APIs .
With Joomla ! , you ’ll have more then 3,500 extensions at your disposal along with the support of an entire community .
With a simple extension , you can add almost any needed functionality to your site .
One downside to Joomla !
is that their heavy - artillery list of extensions often require you to purchase them .
Hopefully , in the future , they will make their plugins free in order to aid users on a tight budget .
Drupal
Drupal , a great open source CMS supported by a very active community , lets users publish content through any time with very little restrictions .
Once the installation is finalized , you will discover features such as forums , user blogs , OpenID sign - ons , profiles and more .
This CMS was written in PHP / MySQL for ease of customization and has one of the highest - regarded API ’s in the open source content management system field .
Cushy CMS is a hosted and free content management system that ’s lightweight , though powerful enough to jumpstart your site in a jiffy .
With Cushy CMS , you have to add CSS styles to the sections that you will eventually change or edit .
This CMS allows you to access and store content while it uploads this same data to server .
Cushy was built for content editors and designers and so it ’s very simple and easy to manage .
Being a SaaS , you do n’t need to install or self - maintain the CMS .
TYPOlight is great for site builders that will be maintaining multiple sites and is an ideal solution for web developers .
If you ’re thinking about creating a simple or advanced site design with great functionality , then TYPOlight CMS can definitely get the job done for you .
RadiantCMS
RadiantCMS is a Ruby on Rails app .
Radiant has a very active community for core support and updates .
If you are a RoR developer , it ’s right up your alley .
Radiant has concentrated on making things much more user - friendly for end users and web designers .
RadiantCMS also contains an innovative custom tagging language ( called Radius ) that ’s easy to pick up .
SilverStripe is an open source application written on top of PHP and was designed with emphasis on flexibility .
SilverStripe has many configurable options and is geared towards content - heavy websites .
This CMS was completely built on its own PHP framework , called Saphire .
SS offers content version control and great SEO support .
All users alike are welcome to customize the administration area for their clients or themselves .
The only downside with SS is that the default templates are garbage ; however , that ’s nothing a little elbow grease would n’t fix .
Textpattern CMS is a very popular system for many designers due to its simplicity .
Textpattern strives to provide great content management that produces quick , easy , and desirable web standards - compliant pages .
There is no WYSIWYG editor because Textpattern utilizes textile markup for content generation .
The backend is very easy to use and follow .
New users will learn the administration section with super speedy ease .
Alfresco is a JSP enterprise content management solution that ’s quick and easy to install .
Alfresco lets you drop files into folders and convert those files into interactive web documents .
This CMS is n’t as easy to become familiar with when compared to others , however , with a little bit of time investment , you ’ll definitely get the hang of it .
Alfresco could be targeted more towards the intermediate developer , although its pure functionality allows it to become very usable .
The administration GUI is very organized , well maintained , and easy to navigate through .

Tiger Woods had a " Kobe Special " on his brain hours after what looks like a domestic dispute with his wife , Elin Nordegren -- this according to someone who spoke with Tiger on Friday .
During the phone conversation on Friday , Tiger told his friend , " I have to run to Zales to get a ' Kobe Special . ' "
The person on the other end of the phone asked Tiger what a " Kobe Special " was .
The reply -- " A house on a finger . "
During the conversation , Tiger said his wife had " gone ghetto " on him .
As we first reported , Tiger told the friend his wife had scratched his face up during an argument over a report that the golf great had cheated on her .
The " other woman " named in the story -- Rachel Uchitel -- calls the report " bulls * *t . "
Of course , the Kobe reference is the now - famous house / ring he gave his wife Vanessa after the whole Colorado thing .
We 're assuming Tiger was joking , though he can certainly afford it .
Well - known fringe freak show Rammesh Ponnuru published a childish screed in 2006 attacking Democrats as " The Party of Death . "
It was a ( deliberately ) provocative title -- and we should thank him , because it 's a perfect moniker for these troubling times .
Only not for Democrats , but for Republicans .
Indeed , in the simultaneous health care and Afghanistan debates , Republicans are really going on record as being objectively pro-death -- and frankly , the message is even more blatantly pro-death than even Rep. Alan Grayson ( courageously ) made it out to be .
Think about it :
On health care , Republicans are arguing that Democrats are " rushing " legislation through Congress -- legislation that would bring down the astronomical number of deaths that occur thanks to our broken health care system .
At the same time , they are attacking President Obama for not more quickly escalating the Afghanistan War -- an escalation that would likely result in a large number of American and Afghan deaths .
Clearly , it 's mathematically absurd to insist that Democrats are moving too fast on a universal health care initiative that 's been debated for 50 years * but too slow on a 2 - month - old plan for an Afghanistan escalation .
But that discrepancy is not nearly as important a point as Republicans ' very clear message :
They want to block the effort to stop 45,000 Americans from dying every year for lack of health care , and move forward a plan that would potentially result in 40,000 more American soldiers dying in Afghanistan .
And so , I 'll just say it again : The Republican Party has turned into the Party of Death -- a party that is , in sum , advocating a twin health care and war agenda that would almost certainly result in more American deaths .
Indeed , if , as the GOP wants , health care does not pass , and the Afghanistan War is escalated , the number of American deaths will almost certainly rise in the short term , and probably continue rising in the long term .
That 's not an interpretation of speculation -- and I defy anyone to try to make an argument to the contrary .
* Or , even the most conservative estimate , for 16 years since the Clinton health care initiative .

He also was known for performing experiments on the inmates .
He was called the Angel of Death .
He liked to do experiments on twins and dwarfs .

Eye Color
He thought he could change the eye color of the children by injecting chemicals into their eyes .
He would take a set of twins and use one of them to test his theory of eye color change on .
Although , it never worked he kept trying .
Siamese Twins
He wanted to see what would happen if he created is own set of conjoined twins .
He took a set of twins and sewed them together .
He supervised the surgery , which included a resection done on the twin ’s hands .
Their hands became infected and caused them to have gangrene .
Sterilization
He wanted to test methods to sterilize young women .
He subjected a number of them to shock treatments and surgeries .
Most of them died , due to the infections the surgery caused or during the procedures .
Blood Transfers
He would drain the blood from one twin and transfer it to the other .
He wanted to see if it would change anything in the other twin .
He killed a number of them this way , because he would drain them too much .
Germs
He would inject a child with a lethal germ .
He wanted to study the various stages of how they would react to it .
Sex Change
He would perform a sex change operation on one twin .
He wanted to see if they would react differently being of the opposite sex then as the same sex .
Pregnancies
He wanted to see what kind of children would come from a brother / sister pair .
He was interested in knowing if it was even possible to happen .
Every girl that became pregnant while in the concentration camp , under Dr. Mengele ’s care , was due to incest .
Isolation Endurance
He wanted to know if twins could survive without each other .
He would separate them to see which one could go the longest without the other one .
He would lock them up separately without the company of anyone and wait it out .
Removal
For some reason the thought of twins fascinated him .
He wanted to study every aspect of twins .
He was known to pick a pair and put them on surgery tables , then he would inject their hearts with chloroform , instantly killing them both .
He would then begin the removal of their limbs and organs for the purpose of studying them to the fullest extent .

In the wake of the new Japanese Prime Minister having a doctorate in operations research , David Curran ( iamreddave on twitter ) pointed out that there was a previous effort of having a country run by operations research ( or operational research , in this case ) .
Stafford Beer was one of the founding people in British operational research .
He was one of the people who saw operational research in World War II and adapted those methods to work in practice , in his case at United Steel , followed by some consulting companies .
He ended up founding many aspects of systems science and “ cybernetics ” ( a term I rarely hear these days ) .
The ( British ) Operational Research Society gives out a medal in his honor :
Stafford Beer Medal
This award is named in memory of Stafford Beer , a world leader in the development of systems ideas , especially management cybernetics , and President of the OR Society 1970 - 71 .
The Stafford Beer Medal is awarded in recognition of the most outstanding contribution to the philosophy , theory or practice of Information Systems and / or Knowledge Management published in the European Journal of Information Systems or Knowledge Management Research & Practice within the relevant year .
In 1970 , Beer got hooked up with Salvador Allende ’s Chilean government ( an elected , socialist one ) and he had the great idea of hooking up offices all around the country through unused telex machines .
By setting up these telex machines in factories around the country , linked at a central control room , Allende ’s ministers could guide production and distribution at a country - wide level .
The system , named Cybersyn , had its greatest success in reaction to a country - wide strike .
There is a fascinating article from the Guardian a few years ago on this whole episode :
Across Chile , with secret support from the CIA , conservative small businessmen went on strike .
Food and fuel supplies threatened to run out .
Then the government realised that Cybersyn offered a way of outflanking the strikers .
The telexes could be used to obtain intelligence about where scarcities were worst , and where people were still working who could alleviate them .
The control rooms in Santiago were staffed day and night .
People slept in them – even government ministers .
“ The rooms came alive in the most extraordinary way , ” says Espejo .
“ We felt that we were in the centre of the universe . ”
The strike failed to bring down Allende .
There is also a wikipedia page on Cybersyn .
The story has a sad ending , of course .
A military coup took over , assassinated Allende and destroyed Cybersyn .
Beer , out of the country at the time , was clearly affected :
Soon after the coup , Beer left West Byfleet [ his home at the time ] , his wife , and most of his possessions to live in a cottage in Wales .
It is a great story , and I highly recommend the Guardian article ( and thank Dave for the pointers ) .
I both love and fear the idea of operations research running a country .
There are many times I look around and think “ If only we could get organized , we could run this much more efficiently ” .
I particularly think this when waiting in line or looking at a set of transportation schedules that do n’t interact correctly .
But , given the trouble I have getting something like a sports schedule together , I do n’t think having an OR model run a country is particularly realistic .
Cybersyn did show the value of having free information flow , and the coup ’s response showed how threatening that flow can be to entrenched interests .
Limbaugh : Obama does n't care about war
President Barack Obama does n’t care about the war in Afghanistan , conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh said on " Fox News Sunday . "
“ I do n’t think he cares much about it , ” said Limbaugh about the eight - year war ,
Fox had an exclusive interview with Limbaugh in the midst of an ongoing spat between the network and the Obama administration .
This week , Obama traveled to Dover Air Force Base to salute the remains of Americans killed in Afghanistan .
And Limbaugh said the trip was a media event , organized to distract the public from the ongoing debate within the administration over the war in Afghanistan .
“ It was a photo - op precisely because he ’s having big time trouble on this Afghanistan dithering situation , ” he said .
Under President George W Bush , media was banned from the receiving ceremonies .
Critics say that Bush refused to allow photos in order to hide the human cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But Limbaugh said that the previous administration did not take photos with the fallen returning home from war because they did not want to “ use ” military families .
“ I have the benefit of knowing George Bush a little bit and I ’ve seen him cry talking about missions that he ’s ordered , ” Limbaugh said .
Editor ’s note :
Then NFL player Kevin Tillman joined the Army with his brother Pat ( left ) in 2002 , and they served together in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Pat was killed in Afghanistan on April 22 , 2004 by American troops under questionable circumstances .
Kevin , who was discharged in 2005 , later wrote a powerful , must - read document .
The following essay was first published in Truthdig on Oct. 19 , 2006 , and is being reprinted on the occasion of yet another Memorial Day many of our troops are spending in foreign lands , fighting America ’s forever wars .
It is Pat ’s birthday on November 6 , and elections are the day after .
It gets me thinking about a conversation I had with Pat before we joined the military .
He spoke about the risks with signing the papers .
How once we committed , we were at the mercy of the American leadership and the American people .
How we could be thrown in a direction not of our volition .
How fighting as a soldier would leave us without a voice … until we got out .
Much has happened since we handed over our voice :
Somehow we were sent to invade a nation because it was a direct threat to the American people , or to the world , or harbored terrorists , or was involved in the September 11 attacks , or received weapons - grade uranium from Niger , or had mobile weapons labs , or WMD , or had a need to be liberated , or we needed to establish a democracy , or stop an insurgency , or stop a civil war we created that ca n’t be called a civil war even though it is .
Something like that .
Somehow our elected leaders were subverting international law and humanity by setting up secret prisons around the world , secretly kidnapping people , secretly holding them indefinitely , secretly not charging them with anything , secretly torturing them .
Somehow that overt policy of torture became the fault of a few “ bad apples ” in the military .
Somehow back at home , support for the soldiers meant having a five - year - old kindergartener scribble a picture with crayons and send it overseas , or slapping stickers on cars , or lobbying Congress for an extra pad in a helmet .
It ’s interesting that a soldier on his third or fourth tour should care about a drawing from a five - year - old ; or a faded sticker on a car as his friends die around him ; or an extra pad in a helmet , as if it will protect him when an IED throws his vehicle 50 feet into the air as his body comes apart and his skin melts to the seat .
Somehow the more soldiers that die , the more legitimate the illegal invasion becomes .
Somehow those afraid to fight an illegal invasion decades ago are allowed to send soldiers to die for an illegal invasion they started .
Somehow American leadership , whose only credit is lying to its people and illegally invading a nation , has been allowed to steal the courage , virtue and honor of its soldiers on the ground .
Somehow faking character , virtue and strength is tolerated .
Somehow profiting from tragedy and horror is tolerated .
Somehow the death of tens , if not hundreds , of thousands of people is tolerated .
Somehow subversion of the Bill of Rights and The Constitution is tolerated .
Somehow suspension of Habeas Corpus is supposed to keep this country safe .
Somehow torture is tolerated .
Somehow lying is tolerated .
Somehow reason is being discarded for faith , dogma , and nonsense .
Somehow American leadership managed to create a more dangerous world .
Somehow a narrative is more important than reality .
Somehow America has become a country that projects everything that it is not and condemns everything that it is .
Somehow the most reasonable , trusted and respected country in the world has become one of the most irrational , belligerent , feared , and distrusted countries in the world .
Somehow being politically informed , diligent , and skeptical has been replaced by apathy through active ignorance .
Somehow the same incompetent , narcissistic , virtueless , vacuous , malicious criminals are still in charge of this country .
Somehow this is tolerated .
Somehow nobody is accountable for this .
In a democracy , the policy of the leaders is the policy of the people .
So do n’t be shocked when our grandkids bury much of this generation as traitors to the nation , to the world and to humanity .
Most likely , they will come to know that “ somehow ” was nurtured by fear , insecurity and indifference , leaving the country vulnerable to unchecked , unchallenged parasites .
Luckily this country is still a democracy .
People still have a voice .
People still can take action .
It can start after Pat ’s birthday .

The fourth episode was the first originally produced for College Sports Television ( CSTV ) .
They wanted a cartoon that focused on college students playing sports .
It seemed a little generic to do a basketball or football story , so instead we picked an even more generic sport and went with bowling .
Actually , we spent a great deal of time in college bowling , so it seemed like a natural fit .
The eventual version that CSTV aired was radically different .
It cut significant parts of the episode , including any scenes with Mr. Mittens .
The resulting piece was kind of a mess .
This full version includes Mr. Mittens and one incredibly dated reference to the Chicago Cubs ’ postseason failures .
Trivia
This episode was produced exclusively for College Sports Television ( CSTV ) .
Mr. Rat is quite the entrepreneur ; he owns the liquor store in town and the bowling alley .
The Chicago baseball fan is , of course , a reference to the 2003 post - season of the Chicago Cubs and Steve Bartman .

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration has formulated a new policy for Sudan that proposes working with that country ’s government , rather than isolating it as President Obama had pledged to do during his campaign .
In an interview on Friday , President Obama ’s special envoy to Sudan , Maj. Gen. J. Scott Gration , retired , said the policy , to be announced Monday by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , would make use of a mix of “ incentives and pressure ” to seek an end to the human rights abuses that have left millions of people dead or displaced while burning Darfur into the American conscience .
General Gration said the administration would set strict time lines for President Omar al - Bashir of Sudan to fulfill the conditions of a 2005 peace agreement that his government signed with rebels in southern Sudan .
Under that agreement , independence for southern Sudan is to be put to a vote in 2011 .
“ To advance peace and security in Sudan , we must engage with allies and with those with whom we disagree , ” said a statement of the policy that was obtained by The New York Times .
The physical distance between Capitol Hill and K Street is only about a mile .
But armed with the knowledge that walking that path can be lucrative , many lawmakers decide to make the trek — and stay put .
Some even do so regardless of whether their congressional terms are over .
Sen. Mel Martinez ( R - Fla . ) is the most recent example .
Within two weeks of announcing his early resignation from Congress last month , Martinez had landed a job at lobbying firm DLA Piper .
Under federal law , Martinez will have to wait two years before he can lobby his former colleagues , but in the meantime , he ’ll be advising the firm ’s clients based on the inside knowledge he gained after five years on the job .
At least 44 lawmakers have left their congressional seats mid-term since 1990 , and at least 16 of them went on to work at lobbying firms or at companies that hired lobbyists , the Center for Responsive Politics has found .
Of these 16 , three are former senators and 10 are Republicans .
Here , we take a closer look at a few of these individuals , examining which industries and clients they ’re now representing .
We also explore the campaign cash they received while in Congress from the industries and organizations they now represent .
Note :
The individuals listed below all currently work for a lobbying firm or for an organization that lobbies and were in Congress for some period of time after 1998 .
This excludes current Oakland Mayor Ronald Dellums , who was a member of Congress between 1971 and 1998 and founded Dellums & Associates ; and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , who served in Congress between 1982 and 1997 , worked for Fleishman - Hillard Inc. and ran for president in 2008 .
Name : Rep. Richard Baker ( R - La . )
Year Elected : 1986
Year Resigned : 2008
Life After Congress : Baker resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives in February 2008 specifically to become the top lobbyist of the Managed Funds Association as president and chief executive officer .
“ MFA is the voice of the global alternative investment industry , ” according to the group ’s website .
“ Its members are professionals in hedge funds , funds of funds and managed futures funds , as well as industry service providers . ”
Since the start of 2008 , the MFA has spent $ 5.1 million on lobbying .
Congressional Career :
As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives , Baker sat on the House Financial Services Committee through the 2006 election cycle .
But “ [ Baker ] has not been a high - profile player on issues dealing with hedge funds , ” the Washington Post wrote last year .
“ In 1999 , he did introduce a measure that would have required hedge funds to disclose more about their operations , but that legislation did not succeed . ”
Congressional Cash :
The industries to contribute the most to the congressman between 1989 and the year he left Capitol Hill include commercial banks ( $ 892,100 ) , securities and investment companies ( $ 679,000 ) and insurers ( $ 677,450 ) .
Many of his top donors were finance - related : JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( $ 151,400 ) , American Bankers Association ( $ 99,200 ) and Bank of America ( $ 87,750 ) .
The broad finance sector gave Baker $ 3.5 million — more than all other members of the U.S. House of Representatives , past or present , but 15 .
In His Own Words : “ The reason the [ hedge fund ] industry came to me was because of my work in the subject area , ” Baker said in an interview with WJBO Radio in Baton Rouge , according to the New Orleans Times - Picayune .
“ I have put my life into developing considerable knowledge in this area . ”
Name : Rep. Larry Combest ( R - Texas )
Year Elected : 1984
Year Resigned : 2003
Life After Congress : Combest began his own lobbying firm , Combest Sell & Associates , after abruptly resigning from Congress to spend more time with his family .
The firm ’s clients are primarily focused on agriculture and include the American Sugar Alliance , the Minnesota Corn Growers Association and the Southwest Council of Agribusiness , all of which paid $ 120,000 for the firm ’s lobbying services in the first nine months of this year .
Since Combest founded the firm , it has made $ 3.4 million in lobbying income .
Congressional Career :
The lobbying stint does n’t mark Combest ’s first time working with the agricultural sector .
Between 2000 and 2003 he served as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee .
When he announced his resignation just a week after winning his 10th term , it came as a surprise to his fellow lawmakers and his Texas constituents alike .
“ Larry Combest has been a statesman and a tireless advocate for agriculture during his service in Congress , ” Texas Farm Bureau president Donald Patman told the Southwest Farm Press in 2002 .
“ Larry ’s leadership in agriculture reached far beyond his own district , touching the lives of farm and ranch families everywhere .
His leadership during the debate on the 2002 farm bill was indispensable , and he deserves much credit for its passage .
This legislation will stand as a large part of his legacy . ”
Congressional Cash : Combest ’s popularity with farmers and ranchers translated into campaign cash during his time in Congress .
Between 1989 and the year he left , crop production and basic processing companies and agricultural services and products companies contributed more than any other industry to Combest , giving a total of $ 639,200 .
The agribusiness sector as a whole donated $ 1.1 million , which is nearly four times more than what he collected from his next most generous sector — finance , insurance and real estate .
At least half of Combest ’s top 20 donors are related to the agricultural sector , including the American Farm Bureau ( $ 47,950 ) , the Western Peanut Growers Association ( $ 41,000 ) and the National Cattlemen ’s Beef Association ( $ 39,150 ) .
One of his current lobbying clients , the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association was also among his top donors at $ 27,850 .
In His Own Words : ” If the Senate has the desire to be seen as slowing this process , then it is certainly possible they simply do not intend to act , ” Combest said in 2001 when the administration and Senate were concerned about the price - tag of the farm bill .
” I do not intend for the House to neglect its duties to the American farmer . ”
Name : Rep. Dennis Hastert ( R - Ill . )
Year Elected : 1986
Year Resigned : 2007
Life After Congress :
This former speaker of the House did n’t have far to jump between Capitol Hill and K Street .
As a senior adviser at Dickstein Shapiro , Hastert brought with him a resume padded with the type of access to Congress that lobbying firms covet .
At the end of his congressional career , Hastert became a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce , likely a perk for Dickstein Shapiro , which reported lobbying on energy and nuclear power in the year Hastert resigned .
With health care reform and energy debates in full swing this year , the firm has some notable clients :
The Biotechnology Industry Organization , which paid Dickstein Shapiro $ 80,000 in the first nine months of the year , Kansas Bioscience Authority ( $ 170,000 ) , Peabody Energy ( $ 360,000 ) and Covanta Energy Corp. ( $ 330,000 ) , a subsidiary of Covanta Holding .
The firm collected $ 5.6 million between January and September , putting its reported revenue far behind the larger lobby shops .
Its highest paying client was Lorriard Tobacco , a subsidiary of Loews Corp. ( nearly $ 2 million ) .
Congressional Career : Hastert was House speaker between 1999 and 2006 , when he lost the leadership position to the new Democratic majority .
During his time as House speaker , the chamber passed financial services deregulation policy , the Bush energy program that included drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and a bill that provided prescription drugs for seniors .
Hastert was popular in his district — he was always re-elected with at least 64 percent of the vote .
Congressional Cash : During his congressional career , Hastert raised $ 19.6 million , with AT&T , the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the American Medical Association among his most generous contributors .
During his career he also maintained an active leadership PAC , called Keep Our Mission PAC , through which he gave nearly $ 3.5 million to other candidates and lawmakers .
The PAC most recently reported having $ 427,150 in the bank , money that Hastert could continue to dole out to lawmakers , even though he ’s not their leader anymore .
A number of Dickstein Shapiro ’s clients belong to the industry ’s that contributed heavily to Hastert while he was in Congress , including Time Warner ( entertainment industry ) and Dey LP ( pharmaceutical industry ) .
In His Own Words : “ The time has now come to spend more time with my family which sacrificed for so long to enable me to serve , ” Hastert said in a statement when he officially submitted his resignation to current Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) .
“ By selecting this specific time to resign , it allows Gov. [ Rod ]
Blagojevich the opportunity to announce a special primary to select candidates from my unexpired term on February 5 , 2008 , an already established primary day . ”
It also allowed Hastert to skirt the pending rule requiring lawmakers to wait two years before taking up lobbying positions , forcing him to wait only one year before he could lobby his former colleagues .
Name : Rep. Robert Livingston ( R - La . )
Year Elected : 1977
Year Resigned : 1999
Life After Congress :
In 1999 , Livingston left Congress to start his own firm , aptly named the Livingston Group .
Every year since Livingston Group opened , the firm has focused its lobbying efforts primarily on issues related to appropriations and the budget and touts its connections to Congress through former lawmakers .
“ Members of the TLG team have proudly served under both Republican and Democrat Administrations , and include former Members of Congress of both parties , Congressional staff , state representatives , staff of Governors and former corporate executives , ” the firm ’s website states .
In the first nine months of 2009 , Livingston Group ’s highest - paying clients have included contractor Bovis Lend Lease Holdings ( $ 360,000 ) , a subsidiary of Lend Lease Corp. ; chemical manufacturer Sasol North America ( $ 310,000 ) , a subsidiary of Sasol Std. ; and real estate company Merscop Inc ( $ 270,000 ) .
European Aeronautic Defence & Space has also hired the firm to do its bidding on Capitol Hill to the tune of $ 210,000 this year .
In the first nine months of 2009 , Livingston Group ’s lobbying income was $ 5.5 million .
Congressional Career :
It is perhaps no coincidence that Livingston ’s firm deals primarily with appropriations and budget issues — in 1995 , Livingston took the helm of the powerful House Appropriations Committee .
He announced his resignation from Congress , however , when calling for then - President Bill Clinton ’s impeachment for lying in a sworn deposition about his extramarital affair .
The reason for Livingston ’s resignation ?
He was having numerous extramarital affairs .
This confession cost him a shot at becoming speaker of the House and prompted him to end his political career — at least in Congress .
Congressional Cash :
In the 1998 and 2000 election cycles , the former congressman raised $ 3.1 million .
The industries most generous to him during that time were defense aerospace companies , which gave him $ 178,200 over those two cycles ; oil and gas companies ( $ 151,950 ) and lawyers and law firms ( $ 136,000 ) .
His top donors included a number of defense companies : Lockheed Martin ( $ 30,900 ) , Northrop Grumman ( $ 29,600 ) , General Dynamics ( $ 22,500 ) and Raytheon ( $ 15,750 ) .
In addition to European Aeronautic Defence & Space , Raytheon has also hired Livingston ’s firm to lobby .
In His Own Words : ” I feel lighter .
I do n’t have to worry about all the problems , all over the world , all the time .
And I just have to worry about the next paycheck , ” Livingston said on his last day in Congress , before announcing that his next paycheck would come from his attempts to influence his former colleagues .
Name : Sen. Trent Lott ( R - Miss . )
Year Elected : 1972 ( to the House )
Year Resigned : 2007
Life After Congress : Former Senate Majority Leader Lott was busy in the months after he left Congress in 2007 , swiftly demonstrating the value of a former lawmaker to various industries seeking access on Capitol Hill .
First Lott joined with former Sen. John Breaux ( D - La. ) to open a bipartisan lobbying firm , and most recently he accepted a position on the board of the North American arm of the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company ( EADS ) .
The Breaux Lott Leadership Group has a number of clients with big issues on the docket this year — AT&T , which is vigorously battling net neutrality rules and paid the lobbying firm $ 450,000 between January and September ; PhARMA , which has been actively lobbying lawmakers on health care reform this year and paid Lott ’s group $ 450,000 in the first nine months of the year ; and a number of energy companies , including Chevron , which doled out $ 400,000 to the firm in that time .
Defense companies , too , have also hired Lott ’s firm , including Northrop Grumman ( $ 450,000 ) and Raytheon ( $ 215,000 ) .
In the first nine months of the year , the Breaux Lott Group made $ 8 million , which is what it made total all of last year .
Congressional Career : Lott started his congressional career in the House in 1972 and was elected to the Senate in 1988 .
He served as the Senate majority leader between 1996 and 2001 .
As a lawmaker , Lott ’s beliefs were “ reminiscent of the mostly unarticulated beliefs of the coalition of Southern conservative Democrats and small - town conservative Northerners , ” according to the Almanac of American Politics .
This means he was “ against increased taxes , hostile to federal regulation of business and local government , for an assertive foreign policy and strong defense , for traditional rules of moral conduct . ”
Lott served on a number of committees , including Senate Finance ; Senate Commerce , Science and Transportation ; Senate Select Intelligence and was the chairman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee for a number of years .
Congressional Cash :
At least four of Lott ’s top donors between 1989 and when he left Congress are among his lobbying firms current clients , including AT&T , which gave the former senator $ 46,500 in that time ; Northrop Grumman ( $ 38,000 ) , Chevron ( $ 36,500 ) and FedEx Corp ( $ 28,000 ) .
Employees of lobbying firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers , now one of his competitors , gave Lott $ 30,000 , making his top 20 most generous donors list .
His total haul was $ 11.2 million , of which he spent $ 10 million .
Insurers , oil and gas companies and health professionals top his list of industry donors , together giving him $ 1.1 million over nearly two decades .
In His Own Words : Lott said in a press conference in 2007 that he did not resign from Congress early to skirt the pending ethics rules prohibiting lawmakers from lobbying their former colleagues for two years , according to the Washington Post .
“ And , ” he added , “ as I ’ve talked to my former colleagues , they say that a lot of what you do anyway is involved with consulting rather than direct lobbying . ”
Name : Sen. Mel Martinez ( R - Fla . )
Year Elected : 2004
Year Resigned : 2009
Life After Congress :
Within two weeks of announcing that he was resigning from Congress , Martinez had taken up a job at lobbying firm DLA Piper .
But he has n’t been at this post long — Martinez only resigned from the Senate last month .
“ Senator Martinez is highly respected on both Capitol Hill and in his home state of Florida , ” the firm said in a press release .
“ He also has vast experience and a significant network of international contacts , particularly in Spain and in Latin America which will be a major area of growth and expansion for DLA Piper over the next year . ”
Last year DLA Piper was among the highest paying firms on K Street , bringing in $ 11.9 million for its services .
In the first nine months of 2009 , the firm has collected nearly $ 8 million total from clients such as pharmaceutical company Sanofi - Aventis ( $ 100,000 ) , defense companies Lockheed Martin ( $ 30,000 ) and Raytheon ( $ 220,000 ) and financial services firm Morgan Stanley ( $ 120,000 ) .
Under ethics law , Martinez wo n’t be able to lobby his former colleagues for two years .
Congressional Career :
As a member of the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee , Martinez supported legislation to overhaul the mortgage process for consumers and focused on local issues in his home state .
On the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee , he pushed to open up the Gulf of Mexico to offshore drilling but supported a ban on such activity along Florida ’s Panhandle .
Martinez , who is Cuban - American , was also active in shaping immigration policy and sat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
Congressional Cash :
In his short time in Congress , Martinez raised $ 16.1 million .
His standing on the Senate Banking Committee appeared to be lucrative as far as campaign cash goes — he collected $ 2.9 million from the finance , insurance and real estate sector , which is nearly twice what his next most generous sector , lawyers and lobbyists , contributed to him .
His top donors ranged from JPMorgan Chase ( $ 49,950 ) to Pediatrix Medical Group ( $ 29,800 ) to Florida Crystals ( $ 28,500 ) .
None of his top 20 donors , however , are currently clients of DLA Piper .
In His Own Words : “ My priorities have always been my faith , my family and my country and at this stage in my life , and after nearly 12 years of public service in Florida and Washington , it ’s time I return to Florida and my family , ” Martinez said in August in announcing his retirement , according to Politico .
“ I did this on my own free will .
There ’s no reason – this is just my desire to move on and get on with the rest of my life . ”
Name : Rep. Bud Shuster ( R - Penn . )
Year Elected : 1972
Year Resigned : 2001
Life After Congress : Since he left Congress , Shuster has worked as a principal for lobbying firm Strategic Advisory Group , bringing with him a few clients who were likely interested in the legislation before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee , which Shuster chaired .
Over the years , the firm has been hired by sea transport company FastShip , the Association of American Railroads and UAL Corp. , the parent company of United Airlines .
Since Shuster started there , the firm has brought in a lobbying income of $ 5.6 million .
Congressional Career : During his time in Congress , Shuster gained a reputation for requesting appropriations funds for transportation projects , which other lawmakers criticized as wasteful spending .
But in the midst of finding money to direct to the nation ’s infrastructure , Shuster became the target of an ethics investigation alleging that he had become too close to and accepted improper gifts from former aide and transportation lobbyist Ann Eppard .
He also faced allegations that he inappropriately helped a client of his brother , who was also a lobbyist .
In 2000 , three years after the investigation began , the House Ethics Committee rebuked the congressman , but issued no additional punishment .
In 1998 , Eppard had been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of stealing from Shuster while she was an aide and accepting payoffs during that time .
Congressional Cash : Shuster ’s top - donating industries were far and away related to the construction and transportation sectors , which gave him $ 2.1 million collectively between 1989 and 2001 .
This includes building materials and equipment companies ( $ 405,100 ) , air transport companies ( $ 338,300 ) , transportation unions ( $ 217,500 ) and sea transport companies ( $ 110,100 ) .
His top donors included UPS ( $ 49,000 ) , the Aircraft Owners & Pilots Association ( $ 45,500 ) and the American Road and Transportation Builders Association ( $ 38,750 ) .
“ More than anyone else in federal government , Bud Shuster understands the deep connection between dynamic transportation investment and economic growth , ” said ARTBA President Peter Ruane when Shuster announced his resignation .
“ He leaves a legacy of vision , leadership and achievement in the transportation arena that sets a very high standard for those who follow him . ”
In His Own Words : “ I ’m not a big spender , ” Shuster said in 1998 after the House passed his $ 217 billion transportation legislation that year and members of both parties criticized parts of the bill as needless pork spending .
“ I ’m a fiscal conservative .
But there ’s a fundamental difference between spending money to build assets and pouring money down a rat hole . ”
Name : Rep. Al Wynn ( D - Md. )
Year Elected : 1992
Year Resigned : 2008
Life After Congress :
Wynn ’s resignation came on the heels of a losing Democratic primary campaign against now - Rep. Donna Edwards .
After he left Capitol Hill , he became a partner of lobbying firm Dickstein Shapiro ( and a colleague once again of Hastert ) .
Because his resignation came before new ethics rules were put into place , Wynn only had to wait one year before he could lobby his former colleagues , rather than two .
As noted in Hastert ’s profile , the firm has a number of clients with a lot at stake this year :
The Biotechnology Organization , which paid Dickstein Shapiro $ 80,000 in the first nine months of the year , Kansas Bioscience Authority ( $ 170,000 ) , Peabody Energy ( $ 360,000 ) and Covanta Energy Corp. ( $ 330,000 ) , a subsidiary of Covanta Holding .
The firm collected $ 5.6 million between January and September , and its highest paying client was Lorriard Tobacco , a subsidiary of Loews Corp. ( nearly $ 2 million ) .
Congressional Career : If Wynn had won the Democratic primary–and stayed in Congress–he would have been busy this year helping the House Energy and Commerce Committee shape its version of health care reform legislation .
( Instead , he now has to do this from outside the halls of power . )
The former congressman was generally on board with his party ’s priorities , but typically sided with the GOP when energy issues were involved .
In both 2003 and 2005 he was the only Maryland Democrat to support the energy bills , according to the Almanac of American Politics .
Interestingly , he also opposed the provision in the McCain - Feingold campaign finance bill that banned soft money .
Congressional Cash :
The labor sector proved to be Wynn ’s most generous sector , giving him $ 1.1 million during his time in Congress .
This is reflected in his list of top donors , which includes the Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union ( $ 65,000 ) , United Auto Workers ( $ 61,500 ) and the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , or AFSCME ( $ 60,600 ) .
Although none of his top donors appear to be clients of Dickstein Shapiro this year , the Teamsters contributed $ 57,500 to Wynn ’s candidate committees over the years and hired Dickstein Shapiro in 2008 .
In His Own Words : Once Wynn announced that he’d be leaving Congress to work for Dickstein Shapiro , he stepped down from his committee assignments for the remainder of his time in Congress .
” While I believe I ’ve complied with both the letter and spirit of the ethics laws , as well as engaged in the appropriate recusals , I am stepping down so that this issue will not be a distraction from the critical work of the committee to combat climate change , achieve energy independence and protect our environment , ” he said in a statement , according to the Washington Post .

Windows 7 is " better than Vista " — but are the differences important enough to switch ?
In this article , Windows expert Mark Edward Soper , author of Easy Microsoft Windows 7 , gives you 10 important reasons to make the move from Windows Vista to Windows 7 .

If you 're planning to upgrade from Windows Vista to Windows 7 , you 're probably wondering , “ How does Windows 7 differ from the Windows I 'm running now ? ”
There are plenty of ways to answer that question , but let 's look right now at 10 ways that Windows 7 is , quite clearly , better than its predecessor .
# 10 : Better Notifications If Your System Has a Problem
In Windows 7 , you no longer need to jump between the Security Center and other parts of the Control Panel to find out if you have security or maintenance problems that you need to deal with .
The new Action Center ( see Figure 1 ) makes it easy to find and fix problems , tweak User Account Control settings , troubleshoot your computer , and run System Restore if your system is seriously clobbered .
Figure 1 Windows 7's Action Center gives you quick access to troubleshooting , security , and maintenance tools .
# 9 : More Options for Onscreen Gadgets
While Windows Vista made onscreen gadgets for viewing current weather , RSS news feeds , and other helpful features a part of Windows , it confined them to one edge of the screen .
Windows 7 has turned onscreen gadgets loose , enabling you to position them anywhere you like , and to " hover " them over program windows when necessary .
In Figure 2 , we 're using the Clock gadget set to Pacific " eBay " time while we shop the eBay website .

# 8 : More Control over the Aero Desktop
Windows Vista introduced the snazzy Aero desktop with its translucent window edges and cool 3D effects , but Windows 7 makes Aero work hard as well as look good .
The Aero Snap keyboard controls let you move the current window to any edge of the screen and maximize it or minimize it .
Aero Peek provides one - click hiding and one - click restoration of all program windows .
# 7 : Getting Started Is Easy and Unobtrusive
Windows 7 has replaced the overbearing " Welcome Center " with Getting Started ( see Figure 3 ) .
You can launch it from the Start menu or from Control Panel , and choose what you 'd like to do .
It 's the easiest way to download Windows Live Essentials , Microsoft 's web - enabled suite of email , messaging , photo editing , and other utilities ; transfer files from your old PC to your new PC ; add users ; and configure backup .
Figure 3 Use the Getting Started menu to choose what you want to do to get started with Windows 7 .
# 6 : More Powerful Taskbar
Windows 7 has remodeled the Taskbar to make it easier , faster , and more versatile .
Not only can you see live thumbnails of each program window ( see Figure 4 ) , but you can also open recently - used files direct from the Taskbar .
You can pin programs you use frequently to the Taskbar and pin frequently - used files to the Taskbar .
In Windows 7 , the Taskbar works harder so you do n't have to .

# 5 : Easy , Secure Networking with Homegroups
Until Windows 7 , Windows networking has typically been a " choose easy or secure choose one only " proposition .
Now , the new Homegroups feature ( see Figure 5 ) enables Windows 7 computers to belong to a secure , yet easy to administer , home network .
A single secure password protects homegroup computers , and computers in a homegroup can stream media between their PCs .
However , computers in a homegroup can also connect to non-Windows 7 computers using standard workgroup networking at the same time .

# 4 : Better Wireless Connections
Windows 7 makes connecting to different types of wireless networks much easier than in Windows Vista , thanks to its completely reworked wireless connection wizard .
Whether you 're connecting to an open cybercafe or hotel network or a secure network at the office , Windows 7 shows you which networks are insecure and which ones are secure and prompts you for the security key when needed ( see Figure 6 ) .
Figure 6 Connecting to an insecure wireless network .
# 3 : Better File and System Backup
Windows Vista finally kicked the old NTBackup program overboard , but wound up confusing a lot of users with its replacement , the Backup and Restore Center .
Windows Vista Home Premium users could back up files , but not the system image , while Windows Vista Business , Enterprise , and Ultimate users could back up the system image and files , but needed to run two separate operations to do so .
Windows 7 makes backup a lot less confusing by using a single backup process for both system image and file backup ( see Figure 7 ) and makes Home Premium users safer by providing image and file backup for them as well as for Professional , Enterprise , and Ultimate users .
Users of those versions can also back up to network shares .
Figure 7 Windows Backup in operation .
# 2 : Better File Management with Libraries
Windows 7 is the first version of Windows to make viewing files on multiple locations as simple as viewing a single folder , thanks to its new Libraries feature .
When you open Documents , Photos , Music , or Videos from the Start menu , Windows 7 opens the appropriate library .
A library lists the contents of folders in multiple locations in a single view , and you can add locations such as external drives and network shares to a library whenever you want and remove them from the library view just as easily ( see Figure 8 ) .
If you 're tired of clicking your way across your computer to view and manage photos , music , or other media in multiple locations , Libraries solves your problem .
Windows 7 's
Backup program also backs up all library locations on local drives , so the contents of your libraries stay safe .

# 1 : Better Performance on Systems from Netbooks to High - Performance Desktops and Laptops
Windows Vista can be a performance hog that slows down even newer PCs .
While Windows 7 is available for both 64 - bit as well as 32 - bit processors , it can run on netbooks , desktops , and laptops something that Windows Vista cannot do .
For organizations looking for a single operating system family to simplify training and security , Windows 7 is a great choice .
And , because of throughput improvements and how it manages processes , Windows 7 helps systems boot faster and enable users to get to work ( or play ) more quickly than Vista .
Summary
Windows 7 provides a great combination of more power , easier access to your information , and better protection for your system and your information .
It 's better than Windows Vista , and you can upgrade directly from Vista to Windows 7 .
What 's not to like ?
Scientists in the Netherlands have successfully synthesized some real - deal pork meat without having to kill any pigs .
Sure , it 's not quite edible yet , but they predict you 'll be eating labmeat in a mere five years .

What they made this time is what they 're calling " soggy pork , " which is fake pig muscle that 's pretty gross because it 's never been exercised .
But once they figure out how to tone it up in the lab , you 'll be looking at guilt - free pork chops .
And it 's amazing news , really .
Not only will vegetarians get to enjoy the deliciousness that is meat without guilt , but it 'll do wonders for the environment .
Do you realize how horrible the beef industry is for ol ' Mother Nature ?
Very , very horrible .
If we could replace all those factory farmed animals with slabs of meat rolling off an assembly line , we'd be doing the planet and animals a whole lot of good .

That is , provided it tastes good .
If it does n't , no one will eat it , and this will all be for naught .
So make sure it 's succulent , scientists !

Finally , renminbi revaluation would reduce the risk of potentially serious international friction over trade .
The problem is that as the dollar weakens against other world currencies  notably the euro and the Japanese yen  so does the renminbi , magnifying China ’s already large advantage in global export markets .
The burden of post - crisis adjustment falls disproportionately outside Chimerica .
Unless China ’s currency is revalued , we can expect an uncoordinated wave of defensive moves by countries on the wrong side of Chimerica ’s double depreciation .
Already we are seeing the danger signs .
Last month Brazil imposed a tax on “ hot money ”  large , volatile flows of foreign investment that may exit an economy as quickly as they appeared  to try to slow the appreciation of its currency , the real .
A number of Asian economies last week intervened to weaken their own currencies relative to the dollar .
Similar currency games were a feature of the worst economic decade of the 20th century , the 1930s .
Historically , as production costs and income levels in countries have risen , their currencies have adjusted against the dollar accordingly .
From 1960 to 1978 , for example , the deutsche mark appreciated cumulatively by almost 60 percent against the dollar , while the Japanese yen appreciated by almost 50 percent .
The lesson is that exporters can live with substantial exchange rate revaluations so long as they are achieving major gains in productivity , as China still is .
To be sure , China ’s central bank has suggested that it might be willing to switch from the dollar peg to some form of exchange - rate management , taking account of “ international capital flows and movements in major currencies . ”
But , like the recent Chinese comments about replacing the dollar as the premier international reserve currency , this may be no more than rhetoric .
During his visit to China this week , President Obama must resist the temptation to respond to these overtures with rhetoric of his own .
This is not the time for big speeches , but for subtle diplomacy .
Right now , Chimerica clearly serves China better than America .
Call it the 10:10 deal : the Chinese get 10 percent growth ; America gets 10 percent unemployment .
The deal is even worse for the rest of the world  and that includes some of America ’s biggest export markets and most loyal allies .
The question is :
What can the United States offer to make the Chinese abandon the dollar peg that has served them so well ?
The authorities in Beijing must be made to see that any book losses on its reserve assets resulting from changes in the exchange rate will be a modest price to pay for the advantages they reaped from the Chimerica model : the transformation from third - world poverty to superpower status in less than 15 years .
In any case , these losses would be more than compensated for by the increase in the dollar value of China ’s huge stock of renminbi assets .
It is also in China ’s interest to kick its currency - intervention habit .
A heavily undervalued renminbi is the key financial distortion in the world economy today .
If it persists for much longer , China risks losing the very foundation of its economic success : an open global trading regime .
And this is exactly what President Obama can offer in return for a substantial currency revaluation of , say , 20 percent to 30 percent over the next 12 months : a clear commitment to globalization and free trade , and an end to the nascent Chinese - American tariff war .
For as long as the People ’s Republic has existed , the United States has been the principal upholder of a world economic order based on the free movement of goods and , more recently , capital .
It has also picked up the tab for policing the oil - rich but unstable Middle East .
No country has benefited more from these arrangements than China , and it should now pay for them through a stronger Chinese currency .
Chimerica was always a chimera  an economic monster .
Revaluing the renminbi will give this monster the peaceful death it deserves .

Becoming a Font Embedding Master
I 've spent a couple days worth now trying to figure out the best and most complete approach to font embedding using @font - face .
It really is a dark art that must be mastered .
It is by no means a straightforward process .
Font Formats
Generally speaking , these days , a font on our system is going to be one of two formats : TrueType ( with a .ttf file extension ) or OpenType ( with a .otf file extension ) .
While it would be nice to be able to just throw a font like this on the web and link it up , we 're hit with two major limitations .
Licensing , and Browser Support
Licensing
Licensing is one of the biggest hurdles .
It can be difficult to find a font that really works within the overall aesthetic of a design .
It 's the reason we 've had to resort to exporting images , sIFR or Cufon .
Even many free fonts have limitations on how they can be used , often times requiring specific directions on linking back to the original source or only using them in non-commercial sites .
These days , a number of resources are popping up — especially those dedicated to font embedding .
A good start to finding the right font for your project would be Font Squirrel .
Font Squirrel even provides @font - face kits to make implementation on your web site easy .
However , even these kits do n't provide as complete of browser support as what I 'm covering here .
Browser Support
Which leads me into the other major issue , browser support .
Font embedding with a TrueType or OpenType font only works as of Firefox 3.5 , Safari 3.1 , and Opera 10 .
( You can enable it in your copy of Chrome 2 by using a command line switch . )
Okay , that 's decent already but we can do better .
We can get Internet Explorer 4 + , Chrome 0.3+ , Opera 9 + and even a little mobile Safari action .
EOT
Internet Explorer supports a particular type of format called Embedded OpenType that provides some control over where and how the font is allowed to be embedded .
You 'll need to convert your TTF into an EOT format .
Microsoft provides a tool called WEFT but it is ancient and I 'll be damned if I can get it working .
Thankfully , there is a command line tool called TTF2EOT that can convert your font .
If you have an OTF file , you 'll need to convert it into a TTF file before you can convert it into an EOT .
FontForge is the application that I use to do it and has provided me with the most consistent results .
I urge you to check out my screencast on OTF to TTF conversion using FontForge as it is a surprisingly tricky process .
As you 'll soon see , having the file in a TTF format will help us with the next step .
SVG
With TTF / OTF and EOT , we have decent browser coverage but the coup de grace is to add one more font format to the mix : SVG .
SVG fonts are supported by Chrome 0.3 + without having to use a command line hack , along with Opera 9 and ( with testing provided by the Twitter folk ) iPhone OS 3.1 .
Additional mobile browsers may support it as well but I have been unable to get thorough confirmation on this .
FontForge has an option to export to an SVG format but I was seeing odd behaviour in Opera with missing characters .
Alternatively ( and thankfully ! ) , I found a Java application that can be run from the command line called Batik .
When running the conversion , you must specify the ID parameter .
You wo n't get an error if you do n't but the ID is important at the CSS stage .
java - jar batik - ttf2svg.jar ./MuseoSans-500.ttf -o museo.svg - id museo
One of the concerns in exporting to SVG is file size .
Immediately I had noticed that my 29 k font was now sitting in well over 100k .
The biggest reason was the number of hkern elements that , I guess , are meant for kerning .
( I 'm smart like that . )
However , you should be able to delete them without greatly impacting the display of your font but greatly impacting the file size .
The other thing I noticed was glyph - name = " null " on all of the glyph nodes .
I was able to remove them with , once again , no impact to the display of the font .
Having done so brought my SVG fonts to the point where they were smaller than the original TrueType font I had converted from ( 29 k to 20 k in one case and 18 k to 12 k in another case ) .
CSS
Now that we have our three files — TTF ( or OTF ) , EOT and SVG — it is time to get our CSS mojo on .
Starting with Paul Irish 's bullet - proof base , I 've added an additional entry for the SVG font .
@font - face { font - family : ' GothicCustom ' ; src : url ( " LeagueGothic.eot " ) ; src : local ( ' League Gothic ' ) , url ( " LeagueGothic.svg#lg " ) format ( ' svg ' ) , url ( " LeagueGothic.otf " ) format ( ' opentype ' ) ; }
The font - family name that you specify here is arbitrary and I like to choose a unique name to make it clear in my other declarations that I 'm using an embedded font .
The SVG syntax has one particular thing of note , and that is the ID anchor after the font name .
Specify the ID that you used when doing the SVG conversion .
Alternatively , open up the SVG font and make sure that the font element has an ID .
< font id = " lg " >
Specifying font - family works as it normally would .
Just specify the font name that you used in your @font - face declaration .
font- family : ' GothicCustom ' , ' Arial Narrow ' , sans - serif ;
Subsetting
In the screencast , I gave a quick demo of how to subset a font by clearing glyphs that are n't to be used in the final font .
Why would you want to subset a font ?
It makes the file smaller .
Some font files can easily weigh in at 200k .
That 's a lot to download when people do n't need to .
For example , the masthead on this site is — as of this writing — using Museo Sans .
A great font that weighs in at around 65 k .
Since the masthead only uses a limited set of characters , I was able to remove anything I did n't need and brought the file size down to 20k .
If you optimize your images , why not optimize your fonts ?
Text Transform Bug
There is one caveat to be aware of when subsetting .
In my case , I assumed that I could quickly do without most of the lowercase glyphs .
A text - transform : uppercase statement was all I really needed .
< div > About </ div > div { text - transform : uppercase ; }
This works fine in Firefox and Safari but Opera and Internet Explorer both seem to decide whether to use a font for a particular character by looking at the lowercase character first .
This meant it was using the uppercase characters from a fallback font .
That 's certainly less than ideal .
Of course , you can always just change the HTML source to be uppercase , if you were dead set on removing those glyphs .
Print Style Sheets
When I first set out to use @font - face , I did n't even foresee this added bonus : the custom fonts also work just fine with print style sheets .
It was n't like using image replacement techniques and having to fall back to a boring browser font for print .
It felt good printing off a page of my site that still used the same fonts as what I saw on screen .
Never Going Back
While Uranium prices have fallen from 2008 levels , there 's reason to believe they could potentially be back on the upswing .
World uranium consumption outstripped production in 2008 and could do the same in 2009 and 2010 .
According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics ( ABARE ) this could send uranium prices up 22 % from a forecast average of 46.4 US $ in 2009 to $ 56.7 in 2010 .
Meanwhile , Nymex Uranium futures for December 2010 delivery appear to be around $ 48.50 .
Thus ABARE 's last commodities outlook might not yet be priced into the market consensus for this radioactive metal .
One potential uranium - related play might be Canada 's Cameco ( CCJ ) , though we caution investors to due their own due diligence on any stock .
The author does not own shares in Cameco ( CCJ ) .
Attorneys for the motorist accused of killing a married couple riding a tandem bicycle last month have filed court documents denying allegations in a wrongful death lawsuit .
Gilbert John Sullaway Jr. , 40 , is distraught over the Oct. 1 accident that killed Gregory and Alexandra Bruehler , so much so that he has sought counseling , his attorney , Aric Garza , said Friday .
But Garza denied that his client was grossly negligent or that he " completely lost control of the vehicle " in a manner described in the lawsuit .
" This was the result of a tragic accident , but ' accident ' is the operative word here , " Garza said .
Thomas Harmon , who represents the family of Gregory and Alexandra Bruehler , remained skeptical .
" I have not heard an excuse yet from the defendant as to why the vehicle went off the road , " Harmon said .
" We just know the vehicle left the roadway , and it should not have . "
The Bruehlers were pedaling along a wide shoulder of the highway when Sullaway 's Ford F - 150 King Ranch struck them after veering off the road just north of Helotes , according to a Bexar County Sheriff 's Office accident report .
Although the wreck outraged the local bicycling community , no citations or criminal charges have been filed against Sullaway .
A criminal investigation by the Sheriff 's Office is ongoing , attorneys acknowledged , but so far nothing has been forwarded to the district attorney 's office .
Garza cited the ongoing investigation Friday in declining to discuss the specifics of what happened during the wreck .
He did say , however , that his client was not distracted .
The fathers of the couple said they filed the wrongful death suit earlier this month on behalf of the Bruehlers ' 7 - year - old daughter , Kylie .
The suit also names Sullaway 's business , Advanced Detection Security Services Inc. , as a defendant .
Sullaway 's attorneys said they " remain committed " to helping the child .
But Sullaway has been unfairly maligned by critics , Garza added , explaining that his client 's heart has been broken by what happened .
He described Sullaway as a devout Catholic who volunteers as a regional director of a religious retreat for men .
" Our thoughts and prayers of course go out to the Bruehler family , but it should n't be forgotten that Mr. Sullaway is a good person as well , " Garza said .
" He , too , will have to struggle with this situation every remaining day of his life . "
Through his attorney , Sullaway declined to comment directly .
Have the Rich Won ?
Maybe not .
A new approach to capping income at the top is starting to gain momentum .
By Sam Pizzigati
This article is from the November / December 2009 issue of Dollars & Sense : Real World Economics available at http://www.dollarsandsense.org
This article is from the November / December 2009 issue of Dollars & Sense magazine .
Back in 1974 , the inaugural year for Dollars & Sense , young economic justice activists — like me — felt we had our hands full .
I was working , at the time , in upstate New York , helping mobile home owners organize against trailer park landlord extortion .
I had one friend active on a campaign to win bargaining rights for the local university ’s food service workers , another pushing for public housing , still another advocating for a badly needed primary health care clinic .
Everywhere we all looked , we saw people hurting , we saw unfairness , we saw economic injustice .
Now today , 35 years later , I ’ve come to understand what we did n’t see : the big picture .
Yes , back then in 1974 , we certainly did face injustice at every turn .
But we were living , thanks to years of struggle — and success — by our activist forebears , in a society where politics actually revolved around confronting those injustices and making change that could really help average working people .
And , even better , we had a realistic shot at achieving that change .
The reason ?
Our activist forbears had sliced the single greatest obstacle to social progress — the rich and powerful — down to democratic size .
In 1974 we were living in a society with an enfeebled wealthy , and we did n’t know it .
Shame on us .
By not understanding — and not appreciating — the equality our progressive predecessors had battled so hard to achieve , we failed to defend it .
We let the wealthy come back .
We let grand concentrations of private wealth reconstitute themselves across the American economic landscape .
We let the super rich regain their power to dictate and distort America ’s political discourse .
How rich — and powerful — have today ’s rich become ?
Some numbers can help tell the story .
In 1974 , the most affluent 1 % of Americans averaged , in today ’s dollars , $ 380,000 in income .
Now let ’s fast - forward .
In 2007 , the most recent year with stats , households in America ’s top 1 % averaged $ 1.4 million , well over triple what top 1 % households averaged back in 1974 — and , remember , this tripling came after adjusting for inflation .
Americans in the bottom 90 % , meanwhile , saw their average incomes increase a meager $ 47 a year between 1974 and 2007 , not enough to foot the bill for a month ’s worth of cable TV .
The bottom line : top - 1 % households made 12 times more income than bottom - 90 % households in 1974 , 42 times more in 2007 .
The numbers become even more striking when we go back a bit further in time and focus not on the top 1 % , but on the richest of the rich , the top 400 , the living symbol of wealth and power in the United States ever since America ’s original Gilded Age in the late 19th century .
In 1955 , our 400 highest incomes averaged $ 12.3 million , in today ’s dollars .
But the top 400 in 1955 did n’t get to enjoy all those millions .
On average , after exploiting every tax loophole they could find , they actually paid over half their incomes , 51.2 % , in federal income tax .
Today ’s super rich are doing better , fantastically better , both before and after taxes .
In 2006 , the top 400 averaged an astounding $ 263 million each in income .
These 400 financially fortunate paid , after loopholes , just 17.2 % of their incomes in federal tax .
After taxes , as a group , the top 400 of 2006 had $ 84 billion more in their pockets than 1955 ’s top 400 , $ 84 billion more they could put to work bankrolling politicians and right - wing think tanks and Swift Boat ad blitzes against progressive candidates and causes .
How could America ’s super rich have so little , relatively speaking , back in 1955 and so much today ?
What has changed between the mid 20th century and the first decade of the 21st ?
We have lost , simply put , the economic checks and balances that so significantly discouraged grand concentrations of private wealth in the years right after World War II .
Among the most important of these checks and balances : steeply graduated progressive tax rates .
Over most of the quarter - century between the early 1940s and the mid 1960s , America ’s richest faced at least a 91 % federal tax rate on “ earned ” income over $ 400,000 .
By 1974 , that top rate had dropped , but only to a still steep 70 % .
The top rate today : 35 % .
Tax rates on income from the sale of stocks , bonds , and other property — capital gains — have traveled the same trend line .
In the postwar years , the wealthy paid a 25 % tax on capital gains .
The current rate : just 15 % .
So what should today ’s activists for economic justice do about all this ?
Hit the repeat button and re-fight the struggles of our activist forbears ?
That course certainly seems reasonable .
Our forbears , after all , pulled off quite a stunner .
They faced , a century ago , a super rich every bit as rich and powerful as the super rich we confront today .
Over the course of the next half - century , they leveled that super rich .
By the 1950s , the incomes of America ’s richest had been “ hacked to pieces , ” as best - selling author Frederick Lewis Allen would marvel in a 1952 book .
The grand estates of the super rich , jubilant postwar progressives would add , had become housing tracts and college campuses for the first mass middle class nation the world had ever seen .
But this triumph would not stand the test of time .
The 20th century would end as it began , with phenomenal wealth and power concentrated at America ’s economic summit .
By century ’s end , the leveling institutions our progressive predecessors had fought so hard to win — progressive tax rates , a vital trade union presence , regulatory restrictions on corporate behavior — had all come unraveled .
Maybe we ought to ask why , before we rush to re-fight the struggles our forbears so nobly waged .
Why , for instance , did the single most potent leveling instrument of the mid 20th century , the steeply graduated rates of the progressive income tax , prove unsustainable ?
These steep rates , in their time , certainly did work wonders .
In the mid 20th century , with these rates in effect , the U.S. economy essentially stopped generating colossal new concentrations of wealth and power .
Of the 40 richest individuals in U.S. history , not one made the bulk of his fortune during the years of this progressive tax rate heyday .
The big fortunes that did amass in these years mostly belonged to oil magnates .
They enjoyed what the rest of America ’s rich did not : a super loophole , the oil depletion allowance , that essentially shielded them from the stiff tax rates that applied to every other deep pocket .
But steeply graduated tax rates have an Achilles heel .
The rich hate them with an incredibly intense passion .
That would n’t matter , of course , if everyone else loved these rates with equal fervor .
But they do n’t — because high tax rates on high incomes only impact the wealthy directly .
The wealthy feel the “ pain . ”
They also see no benefits — because they do n’t need or use the public services high taxes on high incomes make possible .
Those who do benefit from these public services , on the other hand , do n’t automatically connect the availability of these services to progressive tax rates .
The end result of these political dynamics : Steeply graduated tax rates — as traditionally structured — have never been able to stand the test of time , anywhere .
The rich attack these rates with far more single - minded zeal than the general public supports them .
High tax rates on high incomes typically only come into effect during periods of great social upheaval , during wars and severe economic downturns that knock the wealthy off their political stride .
But after these upheavals , amid “ normalcy , ” the wealthy ’s fervid and focused opposition to high rates eventually wears down the public political will to maintain these rates .
The rates shrink , wealth re-concentrates .
Today ’s mainstream policy makers and politicos seem to have concluded , from this history , that any attempt to tax the rich significantly make no sense .
The Obama White House , for instance , wants to up the top income tax rate on the wealthy , but just to the 39.6 % rate in effect before the George W. Bush tax cuts .
If the top U.S. tax rate does rise to 39.6 % , America ’s rich would be paying taxes at less than half the rate they faced in the 1950s under President Dwight D. Eisenhower , a Republican .
Even worse : Merely repealing the Bush tax cuts , as current White House economist Lawrence Summers himself acknowledged in a 2007 Brookings Institution paper , would only wipe away one - sixth of the income inequality the nation has experienced since 1979 .
Similar tax games are playing out in Britain , where the current government is upping the top tax rate on some high incomes from 40 to 50 % .
The new rate would still constitute a bargain , by historical standards , for the British rich , who , at one point last century , faced a 97 % top rate .
Progressives in the UK , not surprisingly , are challenging their government ’s tax - the - rich timidity .
But they ’re not stopping there .
These progressives are also arguing that we need to go well beyond the traditional progressive tax remedies previous progressive generations put in place , beyond taxing the rich to actually capping their income .
And this capping , these British progressives believe , ought to be done in a manner that gives average working families a clear and powerful vested self - interest in keeping the caps in place .
How do they propose to accomplish this goal ?
They ’re suggesting we link income ceilings at the top to income floors at the bottom .
In effect , they seek a “ maximum wage ” tied to a minimum .
With a “ maximum ” set as a multiple of a minimum , society ’s richest and most powerful would only be able to increase their incomes if the incomes of society ’s poorest and least powerful increased first .
These rich , to become richer , have historically sought to depress wages .
A maximum coupled to the minimum would instantly create a counter - incentive : the higher the wage at the bottom , the better for the rich — and the better , of course , for the bottom , too .
In this new maximum wage environment , unions and other traditional advocates for higher wages at the bottom might suddenly find quite a few new — and distinctly wealthy — people in their corner .
Leading UK progressives have opened a campaign to inject these notions into Britain ’s mainstream political discourse .
This past August , 100 British progressive luminaries — all - stars who included three dozen members of Parliament , veteran activists and economists , and the UK ’s most important labor leader , Trades Union Congress general secretary Brendan Barber — called on their government to establish a “ High Pay Commission ” and “ launch a wide - ranging review of pay at the top . ”
This High Pay Commission , the progressive luminaries urged , “ should consider proposals to restrict excessive remuneration such as maximum wage ratios . ”
Thousands of British grassroots activists have since signed on to the High Pay Commission call .
And one party in the British parliament , based in Wales , has already made advocacy for a UK - wide “ maximum wage ” part of its official platform .
How exactly could a “ maximum wage ratio ” principle be implemented ?
Top - bottom ratios could be tied directly to the expenditure of tax dollars .
A government could , for example , insist that all publicly owned enterprises limit the pay between their top executives and their workers .
Late in 2007 , delegates to Ecuador ’s Constituent Assembly enacted legislation along this line .
They created a remuneraci�n m�xima — a “ maximum wage ” — for all agencies and enterprises that take in over half their financing from tax dollars .
The cap limits the pay of top executives in Ecuador ’s publicly subsidized sector to 25 times the Ecuadorian minimum wage .
Executives at Ecuador ’s Banco del Pacifico , a huge bank nationalized after a 1999 financial crisis , have been able to exploit and expand exceptions in the original legislation .
But the principle still stands .
Governments could also apply that principle much more broadly , by mandating top - bottom pay ratios for any enterprises that seek government contracts or subsidies or tax breaks .
The British government , as campaigners for a High Pay Commission note , could insist on “ reasonable pay structures ” within private enterprises that gain “ public procurement contracts . ”
Under current law , in both Britain and the United States , private enterprises that win government contracts can pay their top executives as much as they please .
The CEO at Lockheed Martin , a company that feeds almost exclusively off government contracts , last year took home $ 26.5 million .
That ’s over 700 times the take - home of the average American worker .
Lockheed , of course , only represents the tip of the taxpayer - subsidized iceberg .
Almost every major corporation and bank in the United States is currently raking in big - time taxpayer dollars , either through government contracts , economic development subsidies and tax breaks , or , most recently , outright billion - dollar bailouts .
These taxpayer dollars are making rich people richer .
Since the beginning of 2008 , the Institute for Policy Studies recently reported , the 20 U.S. banks that have received the most bailout dollars have laid off 160,000 workers .
The 100 top executives at these 20 banks , in 2008 alone , collected a combined $ 791.5 million in personal compensation .
Our tax dollars , in short , are increasing economic inequality in the United States .
They are growing the gap between our richest and everyone else .
That need not be .
If we leveraged the power of the public purse — as we already do in the struggle against gender and racial inequality — our tax dollars could be helping us narrow , not expand , the economic gaps that divide us .
Under existing U.S. law , companies that discriminate against women and minorities in their employment practices cannot gain government contracts .
As a society , we ’ve decided that we do n’t want our tax dollars subsidizing companies that increase gender or racial inequality .
So why should we let our tax dollars subsidize companies that increase economic inequality — by compensating top executives at levels that dwarf the pay that goes to average workers ?
Rep. Jan Schakowsky , a progressive Democrat from Illinois , does n’t think we should .
Schakowsky has introduced legislation , the Patriot Corporations
Act , that would give tax breaks and a preference in the government contract bidding process to companies that pay their executives less than 100 times what they compensate their lowest - paid workers .
That standard , suitably expanded and strengthened , could become a progressive principle worth rallying around :
No tax dollars , in any way , shape , or form , for any companies or banks that pay their executives at over 25 times what their workers receive .
Why 25 times ?
The President of the United States currently makes just under 25 times the annual pay of the lowest - paid federal worker .
Why then should we let our tax dollars go to executives who demand — and get — hundreds of times more than their own workers ?
Back in 1974 , in a far more equal United States , we never needed to ponder questions like these .
Now we do .

The book went to No. 1 on Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com just after the publisher announced in late September that it was moving up the release date for 1.5 million copies .
Yesterday it was at No. 6 on Amazon.com and No. 11 on Barnesandnoble.com .
The Archdiocese of Philadelphia recently announced that it is closing two of its high schools , only months after announcing a five - year , $ 200 million fundraising campaign .
At the time that campaign commenced , Auxiliary Bishop Joseph McFadden was quoted as saying , “ Right now , we ’re making ends meet . ”
To me , that comment , juxtaposed with the high school closings , sounds inconsistent with a $ 50,000 contribution by the Archdiocese to the effort sponsored by the Diocese of Portland , Maine to nullify marriage for same - sex couples in that state .
But , Philadelphia was hardly alone .
Records required to be filed under the government ethics and election practices laws of the state of Maine reveal that as of October 20th , Catholic archdioceses and dioceses throughout the United States had contributed over $ 200,000 to the Ballot Question Committee ( “ BQC ” ) organized by the Diocese of Portland to overturn a statute passed by the Maine legislature and signed by its governor , a Catholic , authorizing same sex partners to marry .
On last November 3 , the initiative was approved .
Those same records indicate that the Diocese reported that more than $ 250,000 raised by the BQC was categorized as “ General Treasury Transfers , ” which seems to indicate that those funds came directly from the Diocese of Portland .
Whatever we as Catholics may think of the premise of this legislation , I wonder whether any of us knew that our diocese was sending money to Maine to overturn this law ?
Did our bishop tell us that he was sending a portion of our contributions out - of - state to lobby on behalf of a political initiative ?
Does he do this on other matters ?
If so , what might they be ?
In the interests of openness , accountability and transparency , we as Catholics have the right , perhaps even the obligation , to ask these questions , and demand an answer .
Another interesting question to ask is whether this is a way to divert dollars from an organization that is qualified to receive tax - exempt contributions , such as the Catholic Church , to an organization that does not itself enjoy that status .
In addition to Philadelphia , the Diocese of Phoenix also contributed $ 50,000 .
Other dioceses , among them St. Louis , Newark and Youngstown , each contributed $ 10,000 .
Two other entities , the Catholic Foundation of Northeast Kansas , and the Diocesan Assistance Fund , of Providence , RI , each also contributed $ 10,000 .
In the case of these last two contributions , it seems pertinent to ask whether or not any disclosure was ever made to those who were solicited to support these organizations that part of their donations would be sent out of state to support political activities , rather than to support the poor , the schools and the other social justice works typically carried out by such organizations .
While these are some of the larger donations , the records through late October indicate that almost fifty dioceses sent funds to Portland to aid in this effort , as well as many clergy and bishops who appear to have contributed out of their own resources .
Among these were Bishop William Lori of Bridgeport , CT and Bishop William Lennon of Cleveland , who was formerly assigned to Boston , both of whom sent $ 1,000 .
Such a widespread , coordinated effort raises the question of whether this campaign was orchestrated by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops .
Additionally , the Knights of Columbus contributed over $ 50,000 to Stand for Marriage Maine , the principal organization that worked to overturn this law and the sole direct recipient , other than for incidental expenses , of the more than $ 550,000 raised by the Portland Diocese to promote an agenda that is , at its core , profoundly discriminatory .
For a list of those who contributed to the Portland Diocese ’s BQC through 10/20/09 , see :
http://www.mainecampaignfinance.com/public/entity_financial_transactions.asp?TYPE=BQC&ID=4528
Please check it , to see whether your diocese participated in this effort .
And think twice , before you write that next check to your parish church or annual bishop ’s appeal .

Viktor Fankl , the Austrian psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor , wrote in Man ’s Search for Meaning , ‘ Between stimulus and response there is a space , and in that space lies all our freedom . ’
In the most extreme conditions of privation imaginable , Frankl discovered that he was , remarkably , free to choose his response to any situation .
I love this quote because it sums up the essence of my philosophy .
I believe it is the cornerstone of a happy and effective life .
A real , experiential understanding of this radical freedom is life changing , liberating and empowering .
To suddenly come upon the realization that we have always been free , not in some abstract sense , but in a real , personal and imminent way , is like being let out of prison .
We are not free to control others
The point is that we are free .
And so is everyone else .
That means we cannot impinge on the freedom of others .
This is not some moral statement .
I ’m not saying we should not interfere with other people ’s freedom – it is simply impossible to do so .
You can not make another person do anything .
Even putting a gun to someone ’s head cannot make them do anything .
If someone is threatened to the extent that they fear for their life , they are likely to comply with whatever is being demanded of them , but this compliance is not a result of the threat – it is still a choice they make .
If you doubt it , think about the people who have been threatened and not complied – think about people who have died for what they believe in rather than comply with an external demand .
The belief that we can control and coerce others , bending them to our will , is the cause of a great deal the misery in the world .
This belief , springing from the external control psychology that we have overwhelmingly been conditioned to accept , is the cause of much of our pain .
To let go of our belief that we can control others is astonishingly liberating .
To accept other people as they are , to make no demands on them , simply to dance our own dance , as Anthony de Mello would have put it , and to accept that we cannot but allow everyone else to do the same , is not only the only choice that makes any sense , but is also the only way we can make any difference in the world .
We have a choice
In every situation , there is a choice .
Accept that we cannot control other people or try to force , coerce , manipulate and bully to get our own way .
The latter course of action damages relationships and , in the end , leads to pain and dysfunction .
Or , we can accept people as they are , accept they are utterly free agents , accept that we cannot force them , and concentrate instead on building relationships with them and on building the inner world which echoes back to us as our experience .
When we have good relationships , things work .
Perhaps not in the way we might have expected , or even in the way we would have preferred , but things will work .
The world is not ours to control , so let it go , and let it work in its own miraculous way .
This is the effortlessness to which Lao Tzu alluded when he wrote , ‘ The world is a mysterious instrument , not meant to be handled .
Those who act on it never , I notice , succeed . ’
We are responsible
We are responsible for ourselves .
We make our choices and then we must live with them , not blaming others or circumstances , and not cowardly abdicating responsibility to some external forces .
We are not victims !
We are in control .
By the same token , we are not responsible for other people .
Their fear , their anger , their pain , their misery – it ’s all a choice they make , as freely as we make ours , and they need to shoulder the consequences of these choices – they are not our crosses to bear .
Their happiness , their success , their joy – it ’s all their doing , not ours .
Being proactive
So here lies our freedom – it is inside us every moment and we can recognize it and live our lives according to the truth of this freedom , or we can continue to behave in the way we have been conditioned by society and try to force our way through life , pushing and coercing others into doing our will .
One way is peace and happiness , the other way is pain and madness .
Being proactive is the first of Steven Covey ’s Seven Habits and is the cornerstone of a truly effective life .
I believe that living a proactive life , centered in the self , accepting that we can change nothing but ourselves , and choosing to focus on the good in our life and seeking to attract more it to ourselves is the purpose of our existence .
The idea that our experience is an ‘ echo ’ of our inner world is a theme I will explore further in another post .

The Pentagon ’s Office of Inspector General is conducting a new investigation into a covert Bush administration Defense Department program that used retired military analysts to produce positive wartime news coverage .
Last May , the Inspector General ’s office rescinded and repudiated a prior internal investigation ’s report on the retired military analyst program , which had been issued by the Bush administration , because it “ did not meet accepted quality standards for an Inspector General work product . ”
Yet in recent interviews with Raw Story , Pentagon officials who took part in the program were still defending it by referencing this invalidated report .
ADVERTISEMENT
Gary Comerford , Inspector General spokesman for the Defense Department , told Raw Story last week that his office is conducting an investigation into the retired military analyst program and confirmed that the investigation began during the summer .
Asked when his office expects to conclude the investigation , Comerford said , “ As a matter of policy we do not set deadlines since any number of variables or factors could result in a delay . ”
He did confirm that investigators in his office have read Raw Story ’s recent articles on the topic .
Congressman John F. Tierney ( D - MA ) , Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs , issued a press release ( cache link ) this past June , announcing that Pentagon Inspector General Gordon Heddell had begun the new investigation .
Yet Raw Story and Comerford could find no other news outlet that has yet reported on the matter .

Rep .
Tierney confirmed that Inspector General Heddell had reassured him that he was continuing to pursue a new investigation .
“ I spoke with Gordon Heddell about his investigation of the DOD ‘ Pentagon Pundits ’ program yesterday , and he assured me that his office is making good progress on its investigation , ” Tierney said in a recent statement to Raw Story .
“ I again expressed my expectation that his office pursue this investigation with all diligence and speed . ”
“ I look forward to receiving updates on his progress as well as his final report , ” Tierney added .
“ I , along with my staff , will remain in close contact with the IG ’s office as the investigation continues . ”

Pentagon officials defend program by citing rescinded report
Former Pentagon public affairs chief Lawrence Di Rita and current deputy assistant secretary of defense for media operations Bryan Whitman continue to defend the retired military analyst program by referencing the discredited Pentagon Inspector General ’s report released in the final days of the Bush administration .
ADVERTISEMENT
In an interview with Raw Story , Di Rita , now a chief spokesperson for Bank of America , called the Pentagon propaganda project “ an important program ” and asserted that “ there ’s nothing related to it that ’s worth talking about ” because the “ IG ’s report debunked ” and “ utterly invalidated ” the findings of David Barstow ’s New York Times expose .
Di Rita then incorrectly suggested that this investigation and report had been conducted and released by the Obama administration .
In fact , the Inspector General ’s report that Di Rita cited as evidence exonerating the program and discrediting Barstow ’s reporting was not only later rescinded after an internal audit but also removed from the Defense Department ’s website .
ADVERTISEMENT
In a May 5 , 2009 memorandum , Pentagon Inspector General deputy director Donald Horstman wrote , “ The internal review concluded that the report did not meet accepted quality standards for an Inspector General work product . ”
It found inadequacies in “ the methodology used to examine RMA [ retired military analysts ] relationships with Defense contractors ” and “ a body of testimonial evidence that was insufficient or inconclusive . ”
“ In particular , ” Horstman added , “ former senior DoD officials who devised and managed the outreach program refused our requests for an interview ” and that only “ 7 out of 70 ” military analysts were interviewed during the investigation .
Investigators also failed to interview retired Army General and military analyst Barry McCaffrey , the conspicuous subject of David Barstow ’s 5,000 - plus - word follow - up Times expose on the military analyst program , whom Barstow proved “ consistently advocated wartime policies and spending priorities that are in line with his corporate interests . ”
In the internal audit ’s conclusion , Horstman stated expressly , “ We are notifying you of the withdrawal of this report so that you do not continue to rely on its conclusions .
The report has been removed from our website . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Nevertheless , Di Rita flatly denied these facts when Raw Story brought them to his attention .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman — who Raw Story revealed was a senior official and active participant in the program – also attempted to downplay the Bush Pentagon ’s report ’s inaccuracies and omissions .
He failed as well to acknowledge that the document has been invalidated .
Additionally , Whitman reaffirmed his assertion that the “ intent and purpose of the [ program ] is nothing other than an earnest attempt to inform the American people . ”
In defending the program , Whitman also cited the Government Accountability Office ’s report , which was released last July .
ADVERTISEMENT
The report acknowledged that “ [ c] learly , DOD attempted to favorably influence public opinion with respect to the Administration ’s war policies in Iraq and Afghanistan through the RMOs [ retired military officers ] , ” but “ did not violate the ban ” against domestic propaganda .
A central supporting point for drawing that conclusion , however , was “ [ w ] e found no evidence that DOD attempted to conceal from the public its outreach to RMOs or its role in providing RMOs with information , materials , access to department officials , travel , and luncheons . ”
The key evidence cited to support this conclusion was an April 2006 New York Times article , “ Pentagon Memo Aims to Counter Rumsfeld Critics , ” which was based on a leak .
The article noted that the memorandum had been sent to “ a group of former military commanders and civilian analysts , ” offering “ a direct challenge to the criticisms made by retired generals about Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld . ”
But much of the article ’s focus was fixed on the political drama swirling around Rumsfeld ’s fight to retain his job amid a growing firestorm of criticism .
ADVERTISEMENT
In fact , Defense Department officials at the time , such as then - press secretary Eric Ruff , rushed to spike any notion that the Pentagon had fed military analysts talking points .
The idea that there might be an elaborate , systematic Pentagon talking points operation involving the retired generals was never specifically raised in the article .
Ruff told the Times the memo was simply a “ fact sheet ” and that , as the Times paraphrased Ruff saying , “ In no way was it meant to enlist retired officers to speak out on behalf of Rumsfeld . ”
Mazzetti and Rutenberg reported : “ One retired general who regularly attends the Pentagon meetings said Saturday that he found it unusual for the Pentagon to send such a memorandum in the middle of a heated debate , because it was almost certain to appear politically motivated . ”
This account also suggested to readers that supplying Pentagon - approved talking points for the retired generals to disseminate on the airwaves would have been out of the ordinary when , in fact , records would later show that ’s exactly what was happening .
ADVERTISEMENT
Records would also eventually reveal Pentagon officials working behind - the - scenes to stamp out this fire before it had time to spread and to ensure that it could be contained .
In an email ( p. 117 ) the day after the Times article was published , Dallas Lawrence , then director of the community relations office , warned a colleague ( whose name is redacted ) that “ this is very very sensitive now .
I need you to be protected .
This email directly contradicts something Larry [ Di Rita ] said to a reporter , you ’d have no way of knowing that unless you checked with me . ”
When the Defense Department ’s Office of the Inspector General issued the May memorandum invalidating the Bush Pentagon ’s investigation of the military analyst program , it also noted that no further probe would occur because the program “ has been terminated and responsible senior officials are no longer employed by the Department . ”
Yet Raw Story ’s months - long investigation has revealed that some “ responsible senior officials , ” including Whitman , are still employed by the Defense Department and that the retired military analyst program may not have been terminated .

The Pentagon 's mad -science division has a new way to deal with the 70,000 + troops diagnosed with traumatic brain injury : Freeze 'em .
Darpa , the military 's far - out research arm , is looking for research projects that would create a " therapeutic hypothermia device " to prevent traumatic brain injuries from causing permanent molecular damage to the brain .
The idea is based on successful studies that used cortical cooling to treat survivors of strokes and cardiac arrest .
According to Darpa 's solicitation , cooling down the brain after trauma can offer " dramatic neuroprotection " that will prevent long - term harm to cognition and motor skills .
So far , Darpa - funded studies suggest that traumatic brain injuries are caused by repeated exposure to blasts , specifically the " supersonic wave " of highly pressurized air they emit .
Within a fraction of a second after impact , brain cells , tissues and blood vessels are stretched , torn and distorted .
Over the hours , days and months that follow , altered brain processes create a snowball effect of damage – which is why symptoms often do n't show up until troops come home .
Those secondary changes to the brain are responsible for the long - term physical and cognitive symptoms endured by TBI sufferers , and they 're what Darpa wants to curb .
But once the processes set in , around 90 minutes after impact , they 're hard to reverse .
That 's why a quick dose of hypothermia might come in handy : a portable brain - cooling unit , deployed in the field , could " extend the golden hour of patient survivability and increase the chances for full recovery . "
That is , if researchers can get the thermostat right .
The right degree of cortical cooling has proven effective , but cortical hyperthermia can actually worsen cortical trauma .
And no two brains are the same : Darpa 's solicitation notes that the ideal cooling temperature will " differ across individuals and injury . "
Darpa 's asking for a prototype , complete with internal " temperature - calibration technology " to optimize cooling temp and avoid " rewarming [ the brain ] too quickly . "
And a portable brain freezer will be a boost for civilians too : Americans are about as likely to suffer a TBI as heart disease .

A man who was bitten by a shark south of Adelaide at the weekend says the shark released him when he punched it repeatedly in the mouth .
Dean Brougham , 25 , is recovering in hospital from arm and leg injuries .
He has had an operation on his hand and he is awaiting surgery on his leg .
He told reporters from his hospital bed he had been spear fishing in the water at Second Valley for just seven minutes when the shark attacked .
He thinks it may have been a white pointer .
" I came up , as soon as I got to the surface I felt someone , something pulling my leg and I thought it was just someone being a smart arse , and I turned around and just saw the big face looking at me , " he said .
" It was unimaginable , just freaky , just seeing this big monster 's head just looking at you . "
Mr Brougham said the shark fled when he punched it in the mouth .
" I just started beating it , just trying to get rid of it , and then it let me go and then I was just straight towards the cliffs , " he said .
" I can't believe first of all I got attacked by a shark , I can't believe second of all that I got out of the water , and I can't believe that I 've still got everything attached . "
Family relieved
Mr Brougham 's mother , Gloria Battistella , says she was overcome with relief to see her son alive .
" We 're a very lucky family to have him still with us , " she said .
Mr Brougham 's sister Laura flew from Melbourne to see her brother .
" It was amazing ; I came in with all little gifts for him and everyone else was saying hello , and I felt like it was just Christmas , and I was waiting to hug my brother , " she said .
Mr Brougham , who is recovering in Adelaide 's Flinders Medical Centre , says he will take a shark protection device the next time he goes into the water .

Has anyone actually read The God Delusion ?
I have , and am now reading Dawkins ' new " The Greatest Show on Earth . "
Dawkins is a brilliant scientist and makes some fantastic scientific observations about the physiological human tendency toward religion , being that we are the only animals aware of our own mortality - and all religions are essentially DEATH CULTS trying to explain the post - mortem ( and use people 's fear of death to gain earthly power and wealth . )
So to put Dawkins in the same boat as the Religious Right , which bases their arguments on NOTHING scientific is ludicrous .
Schaeffer should not be taken seriously based on this observation alone .
I see that he is on Flanders ' show , promoting his book .
Preaching to the choir about the evils of the Religious RIght , as if we did n't already know .
When Schaeffer is on with the " enemy " , taking it directly to them , let me know .
Until then , he 's just a hack trying to schlep his wares to suckers .

Personally I have n't seen any atheists proselytizing anyone .
Atheists have a right to not believe , express their non-belief and present evidence of their findings ... that 's not proselytizing .
I have to wonder why religious folks are offended by someone not believing or challenging their religious belief ?
I mean ... should n't all beliefs be challenged ?
Is n't that how the truth is found ?

Seriously , though , spend the time on those Eagleton lectures .

Agent 99 @3 Honestly I know nothing of Dawkins .
I 've never hear of him .
You may be correct .
I have seen Chris Hitchins ... he comes off an angry egotist with major issues .
My point is that any beliefs not challenged is bound to become shackles for the mind ....
For the record ... I too believe in the Divine ... I reject how the Divine is characterized in most religions .
I will listen to the Eagleton link ... thanks ...

I was pointing all that out mostly to take issue with the hero Soul Rebel 's pronouncements on this subject , but also to everybody .
Dawkins knocked everybody 's socks off with his The Selfish Gene , including mine , oh , seeeeeeriously , including mine , but it went to his head .
He 's an insufferable prig behind this outright vicious effort to out - vicious the hardline lying Christofascists , and Daniel Dennet and Christopher Hitchens are his avid compatriots in this overbearing reification of Science .
I am an atheist .
I do n't find anything particularly laudable about faith in anything ... except that it 's just nice and sometimes even encouraging of good things ... but otherwise , pfeh , so what ?
I do really have a problem with deriding people 's beliefs to the extent that you cease making a point and abandon reason in favor of purely brutal invective ... especially when the most it is doing is selling your books or popularizing your blog .
Fuck that .
It 's evil .
And , while I have NO wish to support religion , " Ditchkins " and many others have turned science into their religion , as avidly , as devotedly , as unreasoningly , and maybe even more rabidly than most of their fellow religionists .
One can be tolerant of others ' beliefs and work effectively to make sense prevail .
If it 's at all possible for you , try to drop your biases in favor of science , and his rockstar status from that one transcendentally good book , against Haggard 's unfortunately extreme creepiness .
I know it 's hard , but it 's a great thought experiment and only takes a few moments .
If you manage that brief objectivity , you can see here that Dawkins is being seriously insufferably antagonistic , just dripping with the sense of superiority , and that Haggard makes some good points , especially the one near the end where he mentions " intellectual arrogance " .
That last point is KEY to the entire polemic .
It is the one thing that insures millions of should - be - Democrats will race to the polls to vote for the plutocrats , EVEN when you tell them it 's against their own best interests .
Of course , nowadays , voting Democratic is just about as lethal , but if you 're wanting to SOLVE the problems arising from fanatical religious fundamentalism , you DON'T feed the very basis for the fanaticism .
I do n't care how smart Dawkins is : He FLUNKS on this one .
We are continually dropping into the pit of polemicizing issues to the point where all it does is feed the opposition 's energy and fatten politicians and plutocrats .
IT 'S DRIVNG ME STARK RAVING MAD .

And that crap about humans ' physiological tendency toward religion is just that : C - R - A - P .
We are all , even the very stupidest of us , radically more intelligent than we let ourselves be , and even when we do n't know we 're doing it , we sense stuff from our own greater intelligence and we want it .
This really puts the spin and velocity on the big questions , and on a hot desire to be able to rely on something .
It drives some to organized religion , others to science , others to the arts , others to violence , others to healing , others to addiction , others to shut out everything else on earth in favor of family ... just about everything ... an obsession with nature ... an obsession with sex ... horses ... sports !
It 's purely how much we really do sense but cannot credit because of needing to function in consensual reality , no matter what , no matter on which side of any of these rabid debates one might find oneself .
It 's only physiological insofar as it's our physiology doing the sensing , being so much better than we consciously allow it to be .
It 's the very intellectual prowess about which men like Dawkins are so vain that actually cuts them off from real understanding .
The mind is much more competent than its computational faculty alone , but the ego , especially the huge egos , will have none of it .

I had not heard of Dawkins or Harris or other atheists until tonight and did watch the Dawkins / Haggart video and read a bit of Harris to be able to put some of this in context .
Yeah so Dawkins was being arrogant , but you know what ?
Haggart used this as an excuse to change the subject away from what Dawkins was saying .
Very neatly done .
One minute , Dawkins was skewering Haggart about science and exchange of ideas , having called Haggart out ( appropriately to my mind ) on his hypocrisy in saying that he wants his flock to think for themselves .
Next minute , Haggart had scolded Dawkins for arrogance , sidestepping the points Dawkins had made .
And with the full fervor of righteous indignation in his voice , Haggart was arrogant himself , but he got away with it because he was prepared .
It was a ploy to defuse Dawkins and throw him off guard .
Nice piece of religious right psy-ops .
Of course we can't possibly listen to people like Dawkins .
They 're just arrogant .
Classic ad hominem .
And arrogant or not , it does n't matter how people like Dawkins approach a dialogue , there will always be the ad hominem attack that distracts from the actual ideas .
Next I checked out Harris 's " Response to controversy . "
Harris states that he has been taken out of context in many instances .
He says he has been taken out of context on the " killing people for what they believe " quote .
From his article :
The following passage seems to have been selectively quoted , and misconstrued , more than any I have written :
The link between belief and behavior raises the stakes considerably .
Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them .
This may seem an extraordinary claim , but it merely enunciates an ordinary fact about the world in which we live .
Certain beliefs place their adherents beyond the reach of every peaceful means of persuasion , while inspiring them to commit acts of extraordinary violence against others .
There is , in fact , no talking to some people .
If they can not be captured , and they often cannot , otherwise tolerant people may be justified in killing them in self - defense .
This is what the United States attempted in Afghanistan ... ... Some critics have interpreted the second sentence of this passage to mean that I advocate simply killing religious people for their beliefs .
Granted , I made the job of misinterpreting me easier than it might have been , but such a reading remains a frank distortion of my views .
Read in context , it should be clear that I am not at all ignoring the link between belief and behavior ...
Now , I ask is the distortion deliberate ?
Not , I think , by Frank here .
But that 's the beauty of the psy -op .

We ahould all be so lucky as to get a chance to assault Ted Haggard viciously .
As I wrote in a previous response to Schaeffer on this - I can accept that people have many strange beliefs , of which belief in a deity is but one .
I can accept , indeed , be thankful , that we live in a country where ( theoretically ) these strange beliefs are protected ( not that my quasi- religious " belief " in hallucinogenics would ever stand up in court ) by the First Amendment .
But I do not have to respect them .
I do not have to respect the idiots on the Dover School Board , and the many like them , who would teach creationism alongside evolution ( being that evolution is " just a theory . "
I do not have to respect that the least likely demographic to be elected to public office is an atheist ( only a single confirmed atheist holds a congressional seat , CA - 18 , Pete Stark , yet atheists / nonbelievers are around 15 % of the US population . )
So yeah , I 'm a little combative around ignorance , especially when that ignorance is often hateful and destructive .
It 's a catch - 22 always with this kind of thing .
I 'm intolerant of the intolerance of religious idiocy .
Anyway , Dawkins ' new book is n't about religion , it 's about evolution , certainly something he has every qualification to write about , and if you have n't read it you should .

Would that a vicious assault would actually work ... but it actually fuels the problem .
The recognition that most of these people , by their own lights , are acting in good faith , respecting that much , even when it 's clear that it is fantasy , at least gets you to the point where you can work out differences , find the common ground to begin working through the ideological clashes .
Obviously many make their living off the ideologies continuing to clash and so anyone who actually wants to turn this around needs to do it on a grassroots level ... and , also obviously , that means a whole lot of people need to turn into adults with their hearts and minds set on effectiveness instead of just letting it frustrate us so much all we do is vent our spleen .

Do n't get me wrong , 99 , it 's not like I do n't understand what you are saying - nor do I wish to debate the merits or the maturity of your position vs. mine .
However , the more one speaks out against idiocy , the more it recedes ( and the more one appeases idiocy , the more one gives it . )
I guess I just have expectations that eventually human civilization as a whole will grow up .
Could happen , maybe .
This is the first thing I 've disagreed with you over in a long time , 99 , maybe ever .

Thanks .
I find myself listening to Eagleton all over again , and now I have a better sound system for it and can hear it really well on the Real Player links I made of it .
I hope you get the time ... four lectures at Yale , a little over an hour each , and it 's just dazzlingly good stuff .
He gets right to the kernel of it , through these lectures .
I think you might even provisionally stop disagreeing with me if you listen to him ... or at least feel a little more patient with religious people .
The link above was to my post about it , and the image link takes you to the YouTube versions , but here are links to the whole shootin ' match ...
Q&A and all ... just in case you want to dive in at some point .
It 's really very entertaining , and dazzlingly well put ... sublime in its implications ... and while he very thoroughly mops the floor with " Ditchkins " , he also says stuff all Christians and atheists should hear .

Soul Rebel and Agent 99 Great exchange by you two .
That is exactly the type of well thought , mature respectful encounters I would love for society at large to have .
Sadly it seems only heated invective and spittle flying conflict gets any attention now .
Both of you present coherently your thoughts and beliefs .
99 I have n't finished the Eagleton vids yet ... but I like what I 'm hearing so far .
As I stated earlier I too believe in and commune with the Divine .
Yet it 's nothing that I can concretely prove exists , all I have is personal experience which lacks perspective for the outside listener .
I also believe that Universal Intelligence ( God as it were ) does n't need to be worshipped , donated to or proselytized as much as it wants to be simply left to it's own devices to heal and express the Love that fuels it .
Most religious folks are acting from an egoic sense of duty that excludes the very Love that that powered creation .
I say creation not to diminish evolution .... the Genesis creation story is just that A STORY .... evolution is creation in progress , everything evolves ; from stars to single cells .
To get a sense of God in action ... I invite you to study Gandhi , MLK and Mother Theresa .... there are many many others but those three typify God 's Love .
I also invite you to read Mother Theresa 's statement about her doubts of God 's existence and her faith
I think both sides could benefit from reading that ... especially preachers and christian apologists that demand fidelity to doctrine .
If Mother Theresa , a woman who dedicated her life to compassion and healing doubted ... then anyone 's doubts are valid .
Atheists who ridicule another 's beliefs are n't much better ... Mother Theresa acted on her belief , despite he doubts .
Bradblog rocks .... the most intelligent discourse on the web .

Thanks for your points of view on my interview and Hitchens , Dawkins etc .
One point : my beef is n't with atheism at all .
Atheists may well be correct about the so - called big questions .
My beef is with the silly tone Dawkins and Hitchens take re their superiority to all lesser beings , say religious people .
Do atheists live long enough to KNOW anything ?
Has science never fucked up ?
( Atom bomb and global warming anyone ? )
Does rationalism always work ?
I think the problem is that we humans are all a mess , whatever our excuse for bad behaviour be that God or Stalin or Mao .
I do n't know anyone who does KNOW .
We all hope , think , read a little and pass on .
It 's just silly to claim any final knowledge about the cosmos .
That goes for the Jesus Saves crowd and for atheists too .
The point is you can deny or affirm spirituality , but words describing things are n't the things themselves .
So the Bible is no less and no more a metaphor for reality than say Hitchens ' books are or , for that matter , A " Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy " .
Reading comments here --- and especially in places I 've written on this subject like Alternet recently --- one thing is for sure : the Dawkins / Hitchens groupies react just as defensively and irrationally to criticism of their heroes as the evangelicals do when you take on Billy Graham or one of their other icons .

I might believe it of a Haggard follower , but from Haggard himself ?
He is a consummate showman , and I have no doubt he had that " arrogant " argument ready to haul out when needed .
If all of his little speech was extemporaneous , I 'll eat my Unitarian Universalist chalice pin .
Dawkins , though hardly vicious , was deliberately provoking Haggard .

And , no , I do n't think Haggard was ready for him .
I think it was all he could do to keep from hauling off and punching him , and I do n't think many would have blamed him if he did .
Even if it were a stock phrase of his , it 's salient , and it certainly applied on the spot .

Haggard did n't bat an eyelash at the Goring comment .
That was provocative , not vicious .
Haggard was approaching vicious when he threw Dawkins off his property and threatened to destroy his videotape .
And after googling arrogant atheist , I conclude that calling atheists arrogant is the religious right 's attempt to defuse the entire group .
Take a gander at : Militant atheist arrogance and pride More atheist arrogance
The arrogance of atheists
Also the atheist 's rebuttal in the form of claiming the title :
The arrogant atheist I call the labeling of atheists as arrogant a deliberate attempt to discredit them masked as righteous indignation .

Come on , come on , come on , I just watched that clip of Dawkins vs Haggard .
Dawkins does n't get in the least bit " arrogant " ( if we must call it that ! ) until about 5 minutes in , where he says that scientific evidence shows that the earth is 4.5 billion years old .
The arrogance comes from Haggard when he says " your children may end up laughing at you . "
I mean COME ON !
Are we seriously to abandon real science to placate these foolish evangelicals ??
This is not some knee - jerk defense of Dawkins .
Haggard does n't know jack shit about science , he has no scientific training , and yet he deigns to spout off to an Oxford biologist and Fellow of the Royal Society about the evolution of the eye using the classical creationist IDIOT argument that the eye is too complex to have evolved ... WHERE is the intermediary eye , they ask , without recognition that the evolution of the eye IS ALL AROUND US , and that the human eye is far from perfect when compared with that of an eagle .
And Haggard himself is being perfectly arrogant when he tells Dawkins not to be arrogant .
Haggard is the insufferable fool here , not Dawkins .

I asked you to do a thought experiment where you did n't make judgments about science over religion or renown scientist and rabid fundamentalist asshole ... where you just tried to look at it from the point of view of a guy with his church and this know - it - all coming in with a video camera and some nasty stuff to say .
What I 'm driving at is how easy it really is to see why these people are so pissed off .
No judgment on the quality of either world view , just looking at the interaction , stripped of our biases momentarily .
The first time I saw that clip I started to freak about what Dawkins said to Haggard , but then I thought I was going to barf over how creepy Haggard was , and forgot about just how big a fucker Dawkins was being .
Then I thought about it .
Then I played it over .
Does n't matter if Haggard is a complete mess and all the awful things we think of him , from his point of view , or an objective one , Dawkins ' behavior was vicious and outrageous , utterly uncivil , thuggish without putting up his dukes .
It 's amazing Dawkins did n't get cold - cocked on the spot .
Most men do n't take that sort of thing face - to - face and leave you standing .
That was way worse than the filthiest troll coming in and taking a shit on one of our threads .
I do n't think Dawkins called Haggard and asked to come video at his church and get his reactions to being smacked with horrific references to war criminals and mass murderers , even if he might have warned him that he intended to argue evolution against creation .
Dawkins seems to suffer under the delusion that his grasp of science makes him superior to Haggard .
Sneers at Haggard 's grasp of the Bible as though it and he were ludicrous .
Spoze if he keeps it up long enough and hard enough all those people will just decide to believe him ... want to slink off somewhere and hide ... stop thumping on us with their Bibles ?
What binds groups together like no other thing is the feeling of persecution , the need for fellowship to hold up against persecution , and Dawkins is just heaping coals on that fire .
I agree that something needs to be done about how aggressive religious fanatics have become , but I hardly think being more aggressive than they are --- that way --- is going to cut it .
Accusing billions of people across the globe of keeping an imaginary friend would be insulting if it were not so deluded .
I remind you that I am an atheist , and I remind you that Martin Luther King was not , was transcendentally not , and if there is no other reason on earth for people like Dawkins to want not to be total jackasses , utterly insufferable prigs , about this , that one should have done it , but no .

Stuff people are sneered at for insisting all of a sudden gets picked up by a big name or big university and , pft , all that sneering just evaporates and we 've taken science up another , probably temporary , notch .
Science is riddled with outrageous weaknesses , despite its many strengths ... but a bunch of us are really ill from its application on our food supply and its application in our environment ... so ... well ... this really boils down to a school yard us vs. them thing , does n't it ?

99 , I think you are in contradiction with yourself , or maybe I have misinterpreted the many times you have railed against the Democratic Party .
" The Democratic Party is spineless , bought , corporatist , and almost completely a part of the mechanism that perpetuates economic slavery , racial inequalities , class warfare , environmental scorched earth policies , illegal war , " and so on , ad infinitum .
( I did get that right , did n't I ?
And if so , I am in agreement . )
I like politicians like Kucinich , Sanders , and now our new hero , Floridiot # 2 , Grayson .
Because they have an intellectual arrogance and they lack fear .
Now Sanders and Kucinich understand the way the power games are played in D.C. , you have to stroke the right shafts every now and again or nobody gives you the time of day - but you do n't think for one second if they could " get away with it " that either of them would n't be up in the faces of some Bach - asswards Boehner who is dishonest , stupid , incites people 's fears - Jesus H I hope they would .
And that 's what we all loved about Grayson - he put aside all of the candy - ass bullshit and said " Enough of this .
You , you , you , and you : Go Fuck yourselves . "
These people are better because they are smarter .
Not on a human level , I believe we are all equal there .
But they are better equipped to make public policy because they have brains and they tend to use them in the direction of good rather than bad .
That 's a real plus in my book .
The Dawkins - Haggard conflict is no different .
Frankly , people like Dawkins - scientists - are better equipped by virtue of their intelligence and their study , to shed light on the origins of the universe and of man , and not some circus freak like Ted Haggard .
That science has not solved all of the world 's problems nor answered all of the world 's questions is a straw man - it is by far the best information we have , and the unethical use of science is NOT the fault of science itself but the folly of man .
Hubble looking 13 billion years backwards in time inspires awe and humility in me , and drives a desire to know more .
In Haggard 's flock the Pillars of Creation are a fanciful painting put on Earth by Satan to confuse the poor soft - headed followers of Jesus .
It simply is not to be taken seriously on any level .
But what is a political party other than a belief system .
Some are better than others , some are downright evil and hateful - yet I do n't think any of us mind calling a spade a spade ( arrogantly at that ) when it comes to calling out the GOP or the Democrats on their nonsense .
So why should a belief system that involves the supernatural be any different .
Yeah , so Dawkins went to Haggard 's church and called him out .
So what ?
What 's the difference between that and picketing the Republican National Convention , or the G - 8 / G - 20 / WTO ( yet another belief system ) ?
They are getting their parties crashed .
And back to my original point about contradiction - should n't we stick it to people in the Democratic Party who sit on their thumbs while people die from inadequate healthcare and depleted uranium ?
Why ?
Because we think their voting record is stupid , or their legislation is stupid , or their rationale for being on this side or that side of a debate is stupid , and on top of it people are dying .
We do it all the time , and it's not arrogance , we just think we 're right and they 're wrong - and regardless of evidence to one point or the other , they can dismiss it and say " Well , I get my facts and figures from somewhere else " ( i.e. I know different scientists than your scientists ) .
" Oh yeah , well I get my facts and figures from the CBO and the GAO and the WHO , and you get yours from The Drudge Report . "
Not unlike " Oh yeah , well I get my facts and figures from decades and decades of peer - reviewed scientific literature and discovery , and you get your from the scientific equivalent of a Crackerjack box . "
I mean , COME ON !!

I 'm sorry , Soul Rebel , my good friend .
I think we have to try to stop putting so much emphasis on who 's right and who 's wrong on questions that can't be settled .
We have questions that HAVE to be settled and calling each other out does n't seem to work .
I am convinced that the only way out of the bottomless polemics is to abandon them , to remember our common humanity and rise to the challenges by rising above our own urges to vent our wrath against people who should not be our opponents .
I mean , it almost amounts to a kind of avoidance tactic by now ... subconscious as it may be .
We have so much house cleaning that all the fighting is just avoidance of the hard work ... and making a bigger mess .
I 'm not talking appeasement .
I 'm not talking compromises .
I 'm talking identifying the real culprits and rooting them out .
They 're the ones getting rich off all these wedges driven .
[ I realize that Haggard was one of the wedge drivers , and my use of him here was only to illustrate where these people have real points . ]
It 's either get strong enough to find solidarity on vital matters with people whose lifestyles , beliefs , opinions are radically different , or revolution , or succumbing to frank fascism .
We can't really talk our ways around that ... though we sure are trying to .... I hope you decide to listen to Eagleton .
That was really good stuff , and I think it will give you good ideas and help relieve your irk .
I wanted badly to keep respecting Dawkins , because I loved that book , and because we have mutual friends and it would make it much easier on me if I could be more approving .
But he fell into the trap of becoming what he reviles ... and can't see himself doing it .
The impulse to counter the dangerous surge from religious fanatics was sound , and warranted , but Dawkins has gone way too far , shockingly stupidly for a man of his mental gifts , and I really think he now hurts the cause more than he helps .
Grayson is dazzling , but he 's giving his full - throated support to this crap mandatory health insurance bill and I caught his Democrats - have - conscience shtick and , well , clearly , we should spit in his eye when he pulls that crap .
He ’s new and so HE might actually take it , let the lightbulb snap on , and become a great leader ... but ... for as much of a relief as it has been to hear him actually pressing witnesses and standing up on the House floor ... he 's full of shit .
He 's a politician .
If he were half the man he 's trying to sound like , that bill would not be so awful .
He 's got goddam nerve reading the names of the dead in the Republicans ' districts JUST to get this piece of crap passed .
I think I might have actually heard him semi-admitting that his sudden thunder these past few weeks is what helps him put this outrageously corporate - friendly bill across .
I have to gather the strength to go find that clip and listen again , but I think I heard him say that .
Even if he did n’t , he ’s still throwing all his weight behind it , and so that is an indication we ca n’t trust him .
Oh , man , am I punchy ...
I 'm hearing Tina Turner in my head .

Agent 99 , I started listening to Eagleton 's lectures and quickly decided I 'm not as enthralled as you were and am not willing to spend the 3 hours seeing it through .
PZ Myers spent 8 hours reading Eagleton 's book , " Reason , Faith , and Revolution : Reflections on the God Debate " , which is based on Eagleton 's Yale lectures .
Myers read the book twice and has many specific criticisms of it which seem to refute your opinion of Eagleton 's lectures .

I think that 's the fork in the road this nation has come to .... right will be right no matter who screams the loudest , makes the worse allegations or smears the opposition the " best " .
Right does n't have to be defended ... it does however need acknowledgement .
We 're not acknowledging righteousness when we engage to a higher degree in the tactics of our * opponents *... arrogance only begets more arrogance , attack only begets attack .
Maybe we should just * be " the change we want to see ( thank you Gandhi ) ; and stop trying to tear down the other side of the issue ... let them become tangled in their own web of deceits , arrogance and intellectual dishonesty ... if we engage them in the same way , we 'll only have our own web to disentangle .

Thanks for the link , denvike , but while I 'll check it out , it almost certainly will be something of a brilliant dud .
I am immovably atheistic and have spent about twenty years learning how to drop what I only think , no matter how well - supported , in favor of SEEING and I can see the elegance of Eagleton 's arguments too well .
It 's a damn struggle to endure the perfidies of organized religion , and to listen to hokum out the mouths of the unenlightened in any one of them , but Eagleton gave strong , strong evidence of understanding deeply some of the most important concepts that underlie most religious schools .
And BlueHawk 's point above ---
Do you want to be right or do you want to be healed ?
--- comes close to encapsulating the point I 'm trying to make .
Insofar as a lunatic fringe might take over America it will only be because the fascists deem it optimal to maintain their hold , so the fight for reason over superstition needs to be aimed at the plutocracy , the oligarchy , not at the people who might end up wanting a theocracy .
We always pick easier targets than the truly guilty , those at the heart of the problems , because they are too powerful .
We risk our lives when we fight the real fight .
We so hate to think it , we just wo n't and shift our ire onto safer targets ... like the hapless hungry people the plutocrats abuse on the job instead of us ... like the Bible thumpers they 've found to be useful idiots for their never - ending wedge issues and cannon fodder ... like the have nots who threaten to eat up all our tax money because the haves wo n't let them have enough ....
So ... well ... thanks for the link anyway .

I live in a little town , one I could swear has more churches than houses , and most of the population consists of pissed off Hispanics who are staunchly Catholic , and not very bright white people who fuss over stuff like if The Lord will be angry with them for eating extra dark chocolate or buying a Lotto ticket .
The immigrant population will barely speak to the citizen population , scowl , cross the road rather than have to pass you on the street and acknowledge you , and the Spanish they speak to us is usually filthy invective most of us do n't understand enough Spanish to catch .
Even so , a few of them finally do smile at me now in passing , dropping the ' tude at last .
The locals usually endure my barely discernible to them lefty pronouncements with a faint smile and worried look in their eyes .
Mystified .
But they go about looking for things like videos they think will matter to me and risk their skins to save the homeless guy under the bridge being attacked by transients .
The very smartest of those I 've met , the one with whom I can have the best conversations , did n't know where Honduras is , despite being able to speak Spanish fluently , and did n't know what a coup is , which ruined my whole tirade about Obama 's first coup .
But , then , I think I ruined him because he up and quit his job at the grocery store in favor of college .
The post master was a raging anti-Democrat Republican who fought with me over politics all the time .
He had adopted SEVEN troubled boys to give them a good home and a good start in life , so , obviously , was n't a selfish jerk .
I finally started really talking to him about his political views , about what he wanted for our country , and the guy was a stone cold Democrat across the board ... a real one , not just in name like so many Democrats in office .
Turns out the thing that made him such an obnoxious Republican was his thing about abortion .
He was adamant , above everything else in the world , that abortion is murder ... and we are talking a guy who could barely keep himself from invoking The Lord every other sentence , except for Post Office rules against that stuff .
I said , " Fer crapsakes !
Yer a Democrat through and through .
The Republicans tease you with your heart 's desire and you fall for it !
You 're helping them ruin the whole country because they keep seeming to be promising something they do n't dare deliver because it will wipe out at least half of their base .
Would n't it be better to vote for stuff that might make a better country and just work your ass off to get the abortion legislation you want ? "
I swear I saw a little thought bubble with a lightbulb switching on in it show up above his head .
He was converted !
Except . , he died of a heart attack about a week before he could finally go to the polls to vote in the Democratic Primary .
So ... do n't tell me these people can't be reasoned with .
That 's wrong .
That 's just an excuse .

denvike I have given your pharyngula link a hard scan and either the book is nothing like the lectures or PZ is on another planet .
The idea that " Ditchkins " would never read the book being a point that leapt out as darn ludicrous .
Dawkins , Hitchens , Dennett and others I can't name because I know them , were glued to it and , even though I have withdrawn most of my attention , feel it has actually tempered some of their thunderously ill - considered attacks ... made a couple of them feign humility at odd moments ... so ... well ....
Thanks for the link , and maybe I should try to get my hands on the book since I appreciated those lectures so thoroughly .

I think we do n't have to give up being right to be healed ; we just have to give up wanting to impress opponents with how right we are ... stop beating them over the head with it and start interacting with them like compatriots in this hell hole we call the world .

If Dawkins were talking that way to any run -of - the - mill Bible - thumping average Joe or Joan I 'd agree with 99 --- totally inappropriate and out of control --- arrogant if you will .
But Haggard ?
Mr. Mega-church Bush Family advisor and manipulator extraordinaire ?
No .
You can't have a dialogue with the likes of him .
It 's war and Dawkins attacked .
A bit nasty - the Goebbels reference .
Vicious , hardly .
But straight to the gut with the science .
I do n't blame him --- I applaud him , actually .
He shook the hypocritical two - faced willfully ignorant deliberately misinforming religious leader and I 'm glad because any other language would have slipped off like water off teflon .
I do n't buy any poor - wittle - Haggard , - he - was - abused - by - the - nasty - atheist line .
How much of Bush policy did Haggard promote or even help orchestrate ?
How many Bush followers and voters did he bring to the polls ?
I have NO sympathy for the man and I have no problem with Dawkin 's tactics .
Again , for your average God-fearing evolution - hating neighbor it would be inappropriate and would do more harm than good .

I was n't stumping for anyone to have sympathy for Haggard .
The point actually was that any average Joe or Joan does take blinding offense to people being arrogant about their supposed mental superiority .
I 'm glad you caught me going off down the garden path , mixing my Goebbels with my Göring , but I 'm mystified that you do n't seem to think the Goebbels reference was all that bad .
Hello !
Welcome to the United States , welcome to our church ....
Thank you .
That was an impressive show .
Goebbels would have been impressed ....
Yeesh .
Maybe I 'm just too used to country boys , but even the most progressive of them would have clocked the fucker on the spot .
End of conversation .
And , it just occurred to me , what makes Haggard 's willful ignorance any worse than Dawkins ' willful arrogance ... especially when a great deal of his arrogance really is based on ignorance ?
I can so agree that Haggard is / was pretty awful in a lot of ways and has done a lot of damage , but , honestly , I do n't think he did more than Dawkins is doing by steeling the minions against his antagonism instead of finding some way to infuse a little mutual tolerance into the game ....
I mean , I guess , we agree that it 's awful for regular people , and only disagree on the point about him saying it to Haggard .
I think Haggard , from his own point of view , is pretty much like everyone else , and gonna flip when some guy comes in and smacks him upside the head with that ... so not going to slow him up on the anti-science gig ... but , truly , might have contributed to pushing him over the edge , and off the pulpit .

I guess I 'm not so willing to think that Haggard is an honest guy who is just preaching the word of the Lord ; if so , I agree Dawkins was pretty harsh .
However , if he can't tolerate having his belief system challenged sharply , then I should think either he is very vulnerable as a person , or there is something wrong with his belief system .
I do n't know the details of his going over the edge .
Maybe Dawkins gave him that extra push ; if so , he must have been pretty unstable already .
While I wish no one , not even Haggard , harm , I think he was doing a great deal of harm by spreading his lies about science to his flock , and much less harm when not in the pulpit .

I think you keep missing a crucial nuance to what I 'm saying .
From Haggard 's perspective , he 's an honest guy who 's trying with all his might to preach the Word .
From the perspective of those on the receiving end of our harshness , our ridicule , we are intellectually arrogant ... ergo probably dangerous , not to be trusted , people to be fought ... for the good of all they hold dear .
Many in these ranks are not very bright , not very educated , pretty tired of the world kicking them in the teeth and looking to the church to give them stability and community .
Dawkins ' crusade is completely the wrong way to deal with the problem .
Attack mode , here , is just making things worse .
In a real sense , they 're already entrenched , in defense mode from the mundane cruelties of the modern world , and this just helps convince them they were right to take refuge in this mentality and feel a big sense of justice in defending it .

99 , I get it .
The problem I have with it is that I do n't believe Haggard IS an honest guy .
And in trying to look at it from his perspective I keep channeling a shrewd , calculating power - hungry ruler who is outwardly benevolent but inwardly iron - fisted ( maybe I 'm just too vividly recalling scenes from the Jonestown documentary I watched recently ) .
He 's too slippery for ordinary civil friendly dialogue .
Not only slippery , he 's dangerous .
Tactics are justified , IMO .
Why do I think so ?
I have no proof , but anybody closely associated with GW Bush and his policies is extremely suspect .
Anybody willfully ignorant of scientific fact and into spreading that ignorance to thousands is also extremely suspect .
HIs flock will not take kindly to atheists no matter how they present themselves to the head hypocrite .
In battle you have to bring down the generals .

RE : Haggard ....
He sure as hell was n't honest with himself as regards to his sexuality .
I 'm not privy to his conflicted torturous delusions about his being gay .
But it 's pretty apparent the guy was in major destructive denial .
I do n't know if he felt his sexuality something he could change or what ....
But he injured his wife and children because he could n't be honest with himself .
Sadly that 's the plight of some homosexuals who are taught to be self - loathing .
Who knows what mental - emotional - intellectual contortions Haggard put himself through to keep the illusion afloat ...
Whether it was willful or not ... it was utterly dishonest .

Almost nobody in history has ever been consciously evil in the Snidely Whiplash sense .
We all have what we feel are decent reasons for doing what we do , or what we feel are righteous excuses for it .
In this , one 's religious ideas and political leanings are immaterial .
If you could stand and accuse Hitler of being Hitler he would resist you to his dying breath , might even kill himself , or you , before giving you a chance to prevail in such a thing .
Rarely does anyone just capitulate to aggressive accusations of their ideals or morals or strongly - held beliefs being less than laudable .
Usually the mere chance that these might be cast in an unflattering light causes people to feel threatened , and they become preëmptively defensive .
If this does not derail the possibility of being made to look wrong , or bad , or stupid , or in some way shameful , they become outright hostile and begin groping around for allies to help obliterate this unhappy turn of intercourse , try to cite historical good guys who exemplify their good qualities , grasp at straws to use as cudgels ... and stupidly frequently succeed in this .
No matter how progressive .
No matter how conservative .
No matter how religious .
No matter how scientific .
People modify their nasty behavior when their fellows , people in their circles , begin making it the companionable thing to do .
One does not necessarily have to condone or excuse any of it in order to befriend them , help them feel they 're going to live through taking their heads out of their asses .
The Dawkins side of the instant polemic is as nefarious as the Haggard side , and neither , clearly , shows the slightest inclination to budge .
No. Certainly both wish to escalate .
It 's as though recognizing their common humanity and wishes for a better world and caucusing from this basis is completely out of the realm of feasibility ... something space aliens do in sci - fi novels ... or lunatics mutter about in the bin ... but not , fates forfend , within a real world " civilization " ....
Nope .
Never that .

99 , you should write a book .
Seriously .
I understand fully your intent on Dawkins , and it is a cause for introspection .
Now , without tooting my own horn , I happen to have an IQ that is either genius or very close to it .
I am often fully convinced of the merits of my positions because of this .
All things being equal , the truth is I 'm probably right about 99 % of the time when dealing with the average person ( family , friends , coworkers , spouse - dare I ? ) and I can out - debate ( sometimes it is just ' outlast ' ) them , point our glaring errors in their arguments , knock their feet out from under them ( figuratively speaking . )
Plus , I do n't tend to enter debate which I can't " win . "
However , the result is more often than not a pissed - off ( family , friends , coworkers , spouse - yikes ! ) rather than a " converted " one .
So your positions make perfect sense in a personally applicative way to me .
What is left for me to decide , or at least mull over , is what do I want in the end .
I loathe the whole notion of having to choose between " being right and being healed . "
I have long made the connection that the two are one and the same .
Anyway , I may be budging .
Write that book .
Anecdote : I got into one of these right vs. healed battles with my father - in - law over Brad , of all things .
I asked him if he'd read such - and - such story that was a BradBlog headline , and he told me that he'd taken Brad off of his favorites because he did n't like Brad 's self - promoting tone ( apparently Brad should't advertise so much where he will be appearing , who he will be filling in for . )
Anyway , I thought his reason was stupid .
( It should be known that there a very few individuals whom I will publicly defend under any circumstances : Dennis Kucinich , Michael Moore , Randi Rhodes , and Brad .
That 's about it . )
So I tore him apart over breakfast , and the only thanks I got was " You are an asshole . "
I was a correct asshole , but an asshole nonetheless .
But then again , another comment was " Why ca n't you just let people have their opinions ? "
And my problem then is where the responsibility lies , or is it the tact of the presentation , to let people know that they are full of shit ( when they are of course - which is most of the time ) and there is a better way of thinking available to them if only they 'd just listen to reason .
It is doubly a conundrum for those who do have a much higher IQ than the average , and again , I do n't say that to sound superior .
BTW , did some shit go down between Brad and Randi after he filled in for her a little while back ?
I used to listen to her religiously , but then NovaM tanked and I did n't get the podcasts any more , but I caught the tail end of her saying soemthing that I thought was a snipe against Brad , and I never did figure out what it was all about .

Microsoft will soon release a Windows 7 tool under the GPL , after admitting the product violated the terms of the popular open - source license .
On Friday , the company said it will release the ImageMaster USB / DVD source code and binaries under GPL v2 next , following an internal investigation into the matter that found it had indeed violated the license .
The free tool was available for download through te Microsoft Store for customers to create bootable USB drives or DVD backup media from the electronic software edition of Windows 7 .
ImageMaster had violated the GPL because it contained modified code that had been distributed without the corresponding source - code and because Microsoft had bolted on its own , restricted licensing terms .
Microsoft called the violation a mistake , and while the code had been supplied by a third party , it took responsibility for not having caught the violation during its own code review process .
The company said it has conducted a review of other code on the Microsoft Store site and found this was the only such incident .
Further , Microsoft promised , it 's taking measures to " apply what we have learned from this experience for future code reviews we perform . "
Ironically , licensing specialist Black Duck this week reported 22 per cent of the average software product or application - or 700 MB of code - contains open - source code .
Black Duck surveyed 175 customers .
The chances of running into GPL v2 are also high : Black Duck earlier this year reported GPL v2 accounts for 50.06 per cent of open source projects .
Company chief executive and president Tim Yeaton said in a statement organizations are using to open source to gain what he called significant competitive advantage in a " multi- source " development process .
" The ' not invented here ' mentality is rapidly disappearing , " he said .
It seems Microsoft was unaware of this changing reality and the implications on its relationship with those outside the company building code for is products . ®
The stigma of being a male employed in childcare puts off potential nursery workers .
This is despite the claim that most adults believe that men in the nursery are good for a child 's development .
Male workers consist of as few as 2 % ( 3,000 ) of all early - years childcare staff currently working in the UK .
Ray Alexander examines why there is a lack of male childcare workers .
Low pay
The idea of more male nursery workers has been welcomed Most West of Scotland men still find the idea of working with children in nurseries beneath them .
Another factor preventing more men entering childcare is the low level of pay offered to staff which can be as little as just above the national minimum wage .
There is also the issue of how men are perceived by the public and the huge stigma that is attached .
When I underwent my training I can recall one parent saying to my manager : " I do n't want a man to change my daughter 's nappies " .
This contrasts starkly with findings from The Daycare Trust who say that 84 % of parents would be happy to leave their children with male carers .
Challenging and enjoyable Ross Adams , who has been a childcare worker for eight years and is now deputy manager of a Cheshire nursery , said he found the job challenging and enjoyable - but understood why he had few male colleagues : " I think the reason why more men are n't doing this kind of work is to do with social attitude and prejudice towards it ... it's viewed as a female environment . "
With the large number of children brought up by single mothers there can be a lack of male role models within these families which can lead to social problems in adult life according to many .
Survey results
A survey conducted on behalf of The Children 's Workforce Development Council in England in 2008 revealed that 66 % of single mothers said they would like a man to be involved in their child 's development .
However , of the parents questioned , 59 % said there was not a single man employed at the nursery to which they sent their child .
The survey also suggests 17 % of children have fewer than two hours of contact time per week with a male adult , and 39 % have less than six hours a week .
Just over half of those surveyed , 57 % , said they believed men and women had different skills to offer young children in their care .
Female dominated workplace Children 's Workforce Development Council is calling for more men to consider working in early years settings .
They say it is crucial for children under the age of five to have contact with a responsible male adult .
A lack of information and advertising towards men has also kept nurseries a female dominated workplace despite the huge emotional rewards to be gained by helping children develop in their infant years .
According to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg : " There is still a huge stigma attached to men wanting to work in childcare , even just for men who want to take a more hands - on role in providing care for their own children .
For men wanting to actually work in the field , the social disapproval , even hostility that they often feel is a huge deterrent . "

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - One American industry is booming amid the slump and job losses : mortgage rescue scams that prey on homeowners in financial straits .
Homeowners Salvador and Blanca Jimenez are interviewed at the offices of the Los Angeles Center for Law and Justice in Los Angeles September 24 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Mario Anzuoni
The scammers have low start - up costs and expert market knowledge , many of them having learned their predatory tricks in the boom in providing subprime mortgages a few years ago .
Experts say they will thrive as long as the nation remains in the throes of its worst housing crisis since the Depression with millions of Americans unable to pay their mortgages .
“ Rescue scams are the real growth industry , ” said Keith Slotter , special agent in charge at the San Diego office of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation .
“ All you need to target people is a computer and know - how to set up a website and you ’re in business .
These groups can set up quickly , target people across multiple states , shut down and move on before they ’re detected . ”
Mortgage fraud was easy during the fast and loose years of the real estate boom .
Some analysts say fraud played a big role in triggering the subprime crisis that pushed America into recession in 2007 and wiped out trillions of dollars in property values .
Now , rescue scams are costing homeowners money and wasting valuable months when they could be talking to their lenders about saving their homes -- delays that can cause unnecessary foreclosures and prolong the U.S. housing crisis .
“ There are a lot more people we could help if it were n’t for rescue scams , ” said Melinda Opperman of housing counseling agency Springboard in Riverside , California .
“ This could end up slowing down any potential recovery . ”
Out of desperation to hold onto their piece of the American dream , couples like Salvador and Blanca Jimenez in Los Angeles become easy prey .
The couple bought their first home in 2005 for $ 430,000 with an adjustable rate mortgage .
When their monthly payment jumped by $ 800 to $ 2,691 in early 2008 , Salvador ’s wages as a driver for a seafood company were stretched to the limit .
“ We were barely able to make the payments , ” Salvador said .
He said that shortly after a late payment , he received a letter from a firm called Direct Lender , offering help to get a loan modification with a lower monthly payment , for a $ 3,995 fee .
The couple were greeted at Direct Lender ’s offices by friendly and smartly dressed staff speaking Spanish .
“ When they explained to us in Spanish how they were going to save our house , we felt comforted , ” Salvador , 46 , said through an interpreter .
“ We believed in them . ”
The couple stopped paying their mortgage and paid Direct Lender instead .
Soon afterward , they received notice from their bank demanding payment .
“ I called the bank and told them Direct Lender was taking care of everything and the bank said they ’d never heard from any third party , ” Salvador said .
“ Often operations like this open and shut so fast it ’s hard to track them down . ”
Salvador and Blanca turned to the Los Angeles Center for Law and Justice , which provides free legal services to low - income families .
The center has filed a complaint against some Direct Lender executives , as has the U.S. Federal Trade Commission , which prohibits deceptive business practices .
In a complaint to a U.S. District Court in California , the FTC said Direct Lender was a fictitious business name operated by another company that engaged in “ deceptive acts and practices . ”
Along with a second firm , it “ participated in a common scheme to deceive consumers , ” the civil complaint said .
“ This is a rare case because we actually have the name of someone we can file suit against , ” said Steve Arrodondo , an attorney at the center who is representing the couple .
Daniel Nassie , an attorney at Nassie Law representing Aaron Cuha -- one of the defendants named in the center ’s complaint , which seeks damages -- said his client was a “ fine gentleman and upstanding businessman ” but could not discuss the case .
Other defendants could not be reached .
As millions of Americans face losing their homes over the next few years , the U.S. government and law enforcement agencies are gearing up to tackle what Arrodondo ’s fellow attorney Michael Chung calls a “ tidal wave ” of rescue scams .
“ We were set up to help people deal with various legal issues , ” he said .
“ But almost every single call I get is related to rescue scams . ”
MORE FRAUD TO COME
Not so long ago the real growth area for scams in the U.S. housing market was quite different .
During the boom , banks engaged in years of loose , irresponsible lending that allowed borrowers to obtain mortgages with no money down and with no proof of income , providing fertile ground for fraudsters .
This subprime bonanza allowed criminals to team with mortgage brokers and property appraisers to inflate property prices , then buy and sell or “ flip ” homes at huge profits -- often to “ straw ” or nonexistent buyers .
“ Subprime fraud played a huge role in the housing crisis , ” said Todd Lackner , a mortgage fraud investigator in San Diego .
“ Bank employees must have recognized individual cases of fraud but no one was looking at the whole market and realizing this was an epidemic . ”

That epidemic helped cause the housing crisis that in turn pushed the world ’s largest economy into recession in 2007 .
There have been some recent signs of a nascent recovery in housing prices but rising unemployment and a potential flood of foreclosed homes coming on to the market could bring further falls and more pain . [ n N1185085 ]
In April alone , the FBI in San Diego charged 24 people with racketeering involving 220 properties for a total sales price of more than $ 100 million .
Nationwide , the FBI said in September it has 300 agents working on 2,600 open fraud cases -- eight agents in the San Diego office alone .
As the housing crisis mushroomed , targeting vulnerable borrowers has become a gold mine .
The amounts per person are relatively small -- anywhere up to $ 8,000 -- but they add up quickly .
In its 2008 Mortgage Fraud Report the FBI said total losses due to mortgage fraud are unknown but at least 63 percent of cases in 2008 involved losses of more than $ 1 million covering multiple counts .
“ We expect rescue scams to continue rising over the next three to four years as we work our way through this crisis , ” Slotter said .
“ In many ways this is the most despicable kind of fraud , ” he added .
“ These criminals target people who are about to lose everything they have and take thousands of dollars from them . ”
Counselors say many behind the scams are the same former mortgage brokers who sold bad subprime loans during the boom .
“ They know exactly whom to target and when because they know how the market works , ” said Antonio Hicks , an attorney at nonprofit group Legal Services of Los Angeles County .
“ They look to see who ’s in default and they go after them . ”
The situation is often worse in minority communities where scammers abuse bonds of trust .
“ We ’ve even seen cases where people were targeted in church by members of their own community , ” Arrodondo said .
“ There is no limit to how low they ’ll go . ”

TREASURY , CITIES SOUND ALARM
Describing the proliferation of fraudulent mortgage rescue schemes as an “ epidemic ” on September 17 , the U.S. Treasury , Department of Justice , the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the FTC announced they would work together to target investigations and increase their efficiency .
“ A clear lesson of this financial crisis is that American consumers need better protection against fraud , ” U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said in a statement .
The city of Los Angeles now bans upfront fees for mortgage loan modification services in a bid to combat rescue scams .
Ultimately , educating homeowners about scams is more effective than trying to catch smart and mobile thieves , said John Brady , housing policy coordinator in the office of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa .
FTC spokesman Frank Dorman said the commission is considering a possible nationwide ban on advance fees for loan modification and foreclosure rescue services .
“ Combating mortgage relief scams is one of the FTC ’s top priorities , ” he said .
Lori Gay , president of nonprofit lender Neighborhood Housing Services of Los Angeles , welcomed moves to target rescue scams and increased attention from the FBI .
“ More than half of the people who walk through our door seeking help have given money to criminals , ” she said .
“ Those frauds even advertise on television and the radio .
If you hear five commercials an hour offering help , four will be fake .
“ It ’s become a big business .
I ’m just glad that the authorities are waking up to the problem and doing something about it .
I want more of these people behind bars . ”

Anyway : today ’s K&T blogosphere hit comes from Matt Latimer , a former speechwriter for George Bush .
It ’s got plenty of good stuff about Bush ’s nearly complete lack of understanding of the economic crisis , including this amusing bit about TARP :
As Treasury started to use the bailout funds to invest directly in financial institutions , Ed [ Gillespie ] wanted to come up with a name for the plan that made it sound better to the public , particularly conservatives who thought this was nothing more than warmed - over socialism .
Yes , a catchphrase would solve everything .
As we were working on this , Ed called a few of the writers on speakerphone with the idea he ’d come up with : the Imperative Investment Intervention .
“ Oh , that sounds good , ” one of us remarked , as the rest of us tried not to laugh .
We decided that if a catchphrase must be deployed , surely we could come up with something better than a tongue twister with the acronym III .
We started out with dark humor : the “ I Can’t Believe It ’s Not Capitalism ” Plan ; the MARX Plan .
I suggested that we also apologize to the former Soviet Union and retroactively concede the Cold War .
Then one of the writers got serious and came up with the Temporary Emergency Market Protection Program , or TEMP .
Not bad as gimmicks go , and Ed liked it .
But he decided that instead of dropping it into a speech , we ’d leak it to the press that this was the phrase we were using internally .
Ed ’s logic was that anything Bush said would be ignored , but if the press thought they ’d got it from a leak , they ’d find it more interesting and newsworthy .
TEMP never made it as a catchphrase regardless .
More substantively , Latimer reports that up until someone finally told him directly that he was wrong , Bush was convinced that TARP was a way for Treasury to make a killing by buying cheap bank assets and then making a quick profit off them as soon as the economy recovered .
On the other hand , it turns out that Bush also had a pretty shrewd analysis of Sarah Palin .
Which does n’t surprise me .
Bush never had much interest in how things actually worked , but he was always the ultimate political animal .
If a mastery of Mayberry Machiavellianism had been enough to get things done , he would have had the most successful presidency of the past century .
The housing crash has come to this :
With so many Americans owing more than their homes than they 're worth - in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars - more are debating walking away , or halting payments they can afford and waiting for foreclosure .
Statistics do n't exist because no one declares their reasons for walking away , but a handful of papers have suggested that there 's something to the anecdotal reports about borrowers " strategically " defaulting on their mortgages .

Not if you ’re California ’s Pacific Gas & Electric , according to a recent report .
Utility provider PG&E , in documents filed with the state , is seeking a five percent rate increase for its most energy - efficient customers .
The increase is reportedly so the company can give it ’s highest - volume customers a price break .

“ [ The ] company , with profits up 4.6 percent in the third quarter of this year , said they ’re just trying to be fair , ” California blog Mission Local noted .
“ It ’s necessary to avoid the continued shifting of costs associated with utility services to a limited set of residential customers , ” PG&E spokesperson told blogger Heather Duthie .
That “ limited set of residential customers ” the company refers to are those who use between 131 and 300 percent of average customers , Mission Local added .
Under the proposal , they can expect future savings between 2.5 and 5.7 percent on their electric rates .
Meanwhile , the company is promoting energy efficiency through its residential Web portal , even launching a flash - based renewable energy promotion on the domain wecandothis.com .
If approved by the California Public Utilities Commission , the rate increases for energy efficient users would take effect on Jan. 10 , 2010 .

The Utility Reform Network , otherwise known to Californians as TURN , filed a protest on Thursday with the utilities commission , objecting to the rate increases .
When PG&E went bankrupt in 2001 , the company was carrying over $ 9 billion in debt and had listed assets of up to $ 36 billion .
A Midsummer Night 's Dream has been updated for the 21st century with seven small robots playing fairies alongside carbon - based co-stars .
Beyond being a cool thing to do , researchers saw bringing bots to the Bard as a chance to introduce robots to the public and see how people interact with them .
Their findings could influence how robots are designed and how they 're used in search - and - rescue operations .
" It 's now possible for these unmanned aerial vehicles to be used for evacuation or crowd control , " said Robin Murphy , a computer science and engineering professor at Texas A&M University , which staged the production .
" But what 's missing is an understanding of what makes a person trust or fear the robot . "
Murphy can change that .
She leads the Center for Robot - Assisted Search and Rescue , and her bots have combed the rubble of the World Trade Center , crawled into caved - in mines and searched collapsed buildings around the world .
But this is the first time they 've taken to the stage , and it provided some interesting insights .
The play was a collaboration between the university 's computer science , electrical engineering and performance studies departments .
Purists may balk at reworking one of Shakespeare 's most popular plays to include robots , but director Amy Hopper jumped at the chance .
" What 's great is that they have been part of the production from the beginning , and the robots seem more and more like characters that have always been part of the story , " she said .
" To see them flying , spinning and bouncing through the air just adds to the magic and mystery of the world Shakespeare created . "
The biggest of the mechanical stars was an AirRobot with four rotors .
It 's about the size of a large pizza .
Cops and soldiers use them for surveillance , and they 've been deployed in Iraq .
It was joined by a squadron of E - Flight micro helicopters about the size of your fist .
Casting them in a play was a great chance to see how man and machine interact and what can be done to make robots more like humans .
" There 's all this potential for robots to play a more affective role , " Murphy said .
" There is n't a book we can go to that says ' Do this . '
But performing - arts people know all about this . "
During several months of rehearsals and eight performances that ended Sunday , Murphy and her colleagues Dylan Shell and Takis Zourntos found the actors and audience had little fear of the robots but scant understanding of how they work or how delicate they are .
People invariably would handle them roughly , leading to occasional damage and crashes – one reason Murphy provided three AirRobots and 22 micro-copters .
" People 's expectations of robots do n't match those of roboticists , " Murphy said .
" When the little robots would crash during rehearsal , the actors would just pick it up and throw it into the air thinking it would fly .
We saw the audience do similar things . "
The rough handling softened , however , when the actors were told to think of the bots as baby fairies .
After that , the actors began showing concern if the bots crashed .
In other words , they bonded with the machines .
That could have big implications for the design of search and rescue robots , which might be the first thing to reach , for instance , someone trapped in a collapsed mineshaft and their only contact with the outside world for hours .
If it were you in that hole , would you want to be stuck with a cold machine like T - 1000 or a friendly one like WALL-E ?
" That robot is your medium to the world , " Murphy said .
" If it behaves in a way that 's disrespectful or frustrating or creepy , you 'll stop listening to the directions coming through it from a search and rescue crew , a doctor or anyone else . "
Murphy discovered something else about the robots , particularly the micro-copters .
People trusted them and wanted to follow them around .
That 's perfect for , say , search and rescue situations where you 're leading people to safety .
It 's not so good when you 're using aerial vehicles to control a rioting crowd .
That suggests engineers and roboticists should consider what purpose a bot will serve , and thus adjust its appearance , color and sound accordingly .
" We need additional research on how to make them move like friendly hummingbirds or angry bees to get the desired effect , " Murphy said , offering two examples of how a robot might be tailored to match its purpose .
The play closed Sunday , but the work continues .
Murphy would like to see more plays starring robots and said NASA is interested in similar research to see how people interact with machines .
In the meantime , she and her colleagues are sifting through their findings .
" We 're going to continue looking over our results to codify what we 've learned , " she said .
" Hopefully this will lead to robots that are more trustworthy and can convey the information they need to get across to help you . "

In NYC , there are way more 3 year olds than there are prestigious kindergarten slots , so parents are doing everything they can to give their toddlers an edge .
This now includes hiring test - prep companies and tutors to prepare kids for the dreaded ERB , OLSAT , and BRSA exams .
Meanwhile , heads of admissions at the city 's private schools are fuming .
" It 's unethical , " one sniffs , apparently having never had to worry about getting her own kids admitted to any of these schools .
Sharon Otterman , NYT : Test preparation has long been a big business catering to students taking SATs and admissions exams for law , medical and other graduate schools .
But the new clientele is quite a bit younger : 3 - and 4 - year - olds whose parents hope that a little assistance — costing upward of $ 1,000 for several sessions — will help them win coveted spots in the city ’s gifted and talented public kindergarten classes .
Motivated by a recession putting private schools out of reach and concern about the state of regular public education , parents — some wealthy , some not — are signing up at companies like Bright Kids NYC .
Bright Kids , which opened this spring in the financial district , has some 200 students receiving tutoring , most of them for the gifted exams , for up to $ 145 a session and 80 children on a waiting list for a weekend “ boot camp ” program .

The dust has settled , the ink on the deal has dried , and one of the biggest sideshows in Silicon Valley this year appears to be over .
The litigation between eBay , the buyers of Skype and its original founders has been dropped , and the deal , which values Skype at $ 2.7 billion , should close soon .
This means it ’s time to start reflecting on the lessons of the whole skirmish .
Here are three initial thoughts .
( You ’ll need an understanding of the primary characters and dynamics , so check our previous articles . )
Please add your own thoughts on lessons learned in the comments .
When you buy a company , buy all of the underlying technology .
Lots of folks are flatly condemning Meg Whitman , the former eBay chief executive ( and current candidate for governor in California ) , for failing to buy a crucial piece of Skype ’s infrastructure in 2005 .
The founders kept ownership of the so - called Global Index , a peer - to - peer system that was at the center of their lawsuits against eBay this year .
Back in 2005 , eBay was bidding for Skype primarily against Google , with Yahoo and the News Corporation in the wings .
Buying the Global Index would have greatly complicated the purchase for eBay ; it had other shareholders , and the Skype founders were already thinking about their next video venture , Joost , which would also use the technology .
It appears Ms. Whitman simply trusted the Skype founders to continue to make the Global Index available to Skype .
That left eBay vulnerable .
2. Litigation can create valuable leverage in deals , even if its merits are questionable .
We will never know whether the Skype founders would have won their lawsuits , and it is doubtful they could have halted the sale of Skype .
EBay was prepared to claim that it was Niklas Zennstrom , one of Skype ’s founders , who inextricably linked the Skype code and the Global Index while he worked for eBay .
It is also not clear whether Michelangelo Volpi , the Index Ventures partner whose allegiances were at the heart of the lawsuits , really had any fiduciary obligations to Joost by early 2009 , when the online video firm had so clearly failed .
His employment contract was actually governed by state law in New York , which gives employees plenty of leeway to seek new employment .
Nevertheless , the lawsuits aired embarrassing details and put pressure on the dealmakers and on eBay , which needed to show the stock market it could close the sale as promised .
“ One hates to see the kind of litigiousness the founders practiced here rewarded so handsomely , ” said Kirk O. Hanson , executive director of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University .
“ Unfortunately , the time value of new technologies creates an opportunity for harassment and bullying simply by creating delay . ”
3. Silicon Valley is a small place .
Watch out for conflicts of interest ( and claims of conflicts ) .
The web of relationships in the Skype saga is dense .
Danny Rimer was the underwriting analyst for Netscape , where Marc Andreessen began his career .
Mr. Volpi and Charles Giancarlo , a partner and key figure in the deal at Silver Lake , worked together at Cisco .
And Mr. Volpi was a board member of the old Skype before he became chief executive and chairman of Joost , and then the chief architect of the buyout of Skype .
All this created a thicket of overlapping fiduciary responsibilities , which the Skype founders exploited in their lawsuits .
“ Silicon Valley deals have always been messy , and this is one more episode that demonstrates that , ” Mr. Hanson said .

Schoolgirl , 15 , watches in horror as hoodie stamps on her tiny puppy 's head and kills it
A teenage girl told of her ‘ devastation ’ yesterday after yobs killed her ten - week - old puppy by stamping on its head .
The sickening attack happened as April Alderton , 15 , was carrying her dog through a park .
When she put Sandy the Jack Russell down for a moment , the dog walked up to a group of youths nearby .
Puppy love : April Alderton with her tiny dog Sandy who died from a fractured skull
One of the three boys , who were all wearing hooded tops , then kicked out and stamped on its head .
April tried to give the dog mouth - to - mouth resuscitation before taking it to a vet , but Sandy died from a fractured skull .
The attack has been condemned by animal welfare groups .
Miss Alderton , of St Neots , in Cambridgeshire , who was given Sandy four weeks ago to help her attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , said : ‘ I was devastated .
It was such a shock – Sandy was a lovely puppy .
Loved : Sandy was just ten weeks old
‘ She wandered over to three boys wagging her tail and one of them just put his foot out and trampled on her head .
‘ She was very well behaved and one of those things you ca n’t replace .
I am very angry . ’
The incident happened in a park not far from Miss Alderton ’s home .
Her mother , Loretta , 45 , heard April screaming and crying , and found her sitting on the kerb sobbing .
She said : ‘ It is unbelievable .
How could someone do something like that ?’
Miss Alderton ’s grandmother Norma Peachey , 72 , from Cambridge , added : ‘ It is despicable .
Sandy was such a little dear – so tiny she could have fitted in a coffee cup . ’
Police and RSPCA officers are appealing for information about the incident , which happened between 11.15 am and 11.50 am in Priory Park .
PC Amanda Foreman of Cambridgeshire police said : ‘ This has upset the entire family who are finding it hard to understand how someone can do this to a puppy .
‘ If anyone saw what happened , or knows something about this , they should get in touch . ’
RSPCA inspector Cherry Evans also condemned the attack .
She said : ‘ This is an absolutely shocking and sickening incident which has caused a great deal of pain to this small puppy and left her owners devastated .
‘ It is difficult to understand how anyone could be so deliberately cruel and it is vital that anyone with information comes forward . ’
Anyone with information can contact police on 0345 4564564 or the RSPCA on 0300 1234 999 .
An anonymous donor has offered a £ 200 reward for information which leads to the arrest of the thug who stamped on the puppy .
I was abused by a woman and it haunts me every day
It seems unthinkable , but ChildLine says calls from boys abused by women have doubled in a year .
This deeply disturbing investigation reveals the terrible impact of a crime that society has never dared to confront .
Victim : Bill Jenkins , now 55 , was abused when he was a six - year - old
Bill Jenkins 's memories of the childhood abuse he suffered are as sharp as the pain that accompanies them .
He remembers the diamond pattern on the linoleum bathroom floor tiles , the Moby Dick mural on the wall , the door handle which seemed so high up next to his six - year - old frame .
He vividly remembers , too , how he was expected to bath and touch his naked abuser , an ordeal which left him confused and ashamed , and changed the course of his life .
' The vision in my head is crystal clear , ' he says .
What took place in the bathroom of that house in Sussex 50 years ago is shocking enough , but what makes it even harder to comprehend is that Bill 's abuser was his foster mother - a woman entrusted with caring for him when his own parents could n't .
' My lasting feelings about my childhood are feelings of fear , ' says the 55 - year - old from Thorpe in Surrey .
' I was always frightened of her and what she forced me to endure affected the rest of my life , but as a society we have a mental block about female abusers .
We are shocked when we see it happens .
We can't believe that women are capable of such things . '
But the stereotypical belief that sex abuse is a male crime was shattered last week by an astonishing report from ChildLine which revealed that the number of children reporting sexual abuse by women has doubled over the past year .
The latest figures from the children 's telephone helpline show a 132 per cent rise in complaints of female sexual assaults .
Where the children specified the gender of their abuser , nearly a quarter of all calls involved women assailants and the majority of those involved the callers ' own mothers .
And while girls are still more likely to be sexually abused by a man than a woman , the opposite is true for boys .
Research for the helpline found that boys were more likely to say they had been abused by a woman than by a man .
' This report has shattered common myths about sexual abuse , ' says ChildLine founder and president Esther Rantzen .
' We 're trying to reach out to boys because we 've always been concerned about two things : one is that four times as many girls were ringing ChildLine as boys , and the other is that suicide is the most common reason for young death among late teenage boys and early 20s young men .
' The obvious conclusion is that they are allowing really distressing problems to build up without actually being able to ask for help .
' So it became very important to ChildLine that boys felt able to ring us - and more of them are .
But what it 's revealing is how many of them are being sexually abused by women . '
The case of nursery worker Vanessa George and Angela Allen , who admitted a string of child sex offences , shocked the nation
Historically , of course , it has been hard for society to accept that women abuse children at all .
This is something which , according to Bill Jenkins , makes it even harder for boys to come forward and speak about what happened to them .
' What chap , regardless of age , wants to admit his abuser is a woman ? ' he says .
' It 's not something that men will readily admit to .
It implies you are a wimp . '
This emotional conflict is echoed by the voices of more recent victims , desperate boys and young teenagers who turn to ChildLine for help .
Many of them fear being seen as unmasculine and worry that what is happening to them will be dismissed as a teenage rite of passage .
' I 've been having sex with my aunt - she 's 28 , ' says one 15 - year - old caller , in a harrowing transcript of his call .
' I want it to stop ' cos I know it 's wrong and my mother would go crazy if she knew but we keep doing it . '
' Experts have known for years that women are just as able to abuse children as men are '
And another 15 - year - old : ' Sometimes when Mum is very drunk she touches me and tries to get me to touch her .
It makes me feel really weird .
It 's not right . '
Following the case of Vanessa George , who pleaded guilty last month to seven counts of sexual abuse and distributing pornographic pictures of children at the nursery where she worked , the traditionally - held image of women as carers and nurturers , incapable of behaving in such a despicable fashion with a child , is being challenged as never before .
' Years ago , people were very shocked to hear that children were abused at all , ' says child psychotherapist Diana Cant , who works with the victims of female sex abuse .
' The same is now true about female sex abuse .
People can hardly bear to think about it or get their minds around it .
We want to push it away .
It flies in the face of the image of mothers as carers .
' It 's important for people to realise that it does happen and , as we do that , it becomes easier for survivors to talk about it .
Many children go through life believing they are the only people to whom this has happened .
There 's an enormous therapeutic benefit in realising that they are not alone .
' For it to be more publicly recognised is enormously important in helping people get help . '
Experts have known for years that women are just as able to abuse children as men are .
Detective Chief Inspector Graham Hill , of the Child Exploitation And Online Protection Centre in London ( CEOP ) , has interviewed several female sex abusers .
' There 's this cultural perception of women as the home - makers , and that men are the sexually aggressive ones , ' he explains .
ChildLine has reported double the number of calls from boys who 've been abused by women in the last year
' Society as a whole has bought into that and the law has been shaped around that .
The reality is very different .
But those attitudes are ingrained .
' When you start to talk about this subject , people tend to not want to know .
They shut off because it's a subject they do n't think is very common .
They do n't think it 's something that warrants serious debate .
As such , women tend to fly under the law enforcement radar . '
Yet DCI Hill insists ' ChildLine 's findings are very much in line with our own ' .
He adds : ' We come into contact with lots of female sex offenders and we know that there are a number of women who have a sexual interest in children and that they do sexually abuse children .
The idea that 's it 's always a woman being coerced by a man is a myth .
' Although the number of female sex abusers is still very low compared to men , their offences tend to be of a more serious nature - at the top end of the spectrum .
' Although the number of female sex abusers is still very low compared to men , their offences tend to be of a more serious nature '
' At the same time , women abusers are far more likely to operate alone as opposed to being part of large - scale paedophile networks .
' Their offending tends to start earlier in life in childhood .
It 's not usually of a violent nature .
They will start as children with other children .
' Many female offenders we have spoken to are claiming they were victims of long - term physical and sexual abuse in childhood .
But that 's quite a common claim for all sex offenders to make .
' We do n't see large - scale networks with loads of women , ' says DCI Hill .
' We see lots of men and sometimes a smattering of women who become involved . '
Disturbingly , he adds : ' The majority of women we speak to will have abused their own children .
Women tend to sexually abuse women who are close to them . '
This makes reporting such crimes even more difficult for child victims , who know that by doing so they may be kick - starting a process which will ultimate tear apart their family and , in all likelihood , see them being put into the care system .
' If you are being sexually abused by your mother , there 's such a profound and primitive confusion , ' says Diana Cant .
' It completely confuses sex and care - giving for both boys and girls .
' They stand to lose everything and they fear that , if they report it , everything they know , their family , will be taken away .
' And it 's not just their lives , it 's the lives of their siblings .
There is also the issue that while one child may feel ready to disclose abuse , their brothers or sisters may not and may deny it , so there 's guilt and confusion there . '
ChildLine has received a 132 % increase in calls from children who have been abused by women
Peter Bradley , an adolescent psychotherapist from the children 's protection charity Kidscape , adds : ' The last thing a child wants is to be taken away from their mother - even if they 're in an abusive relationship .
' That 's a huge obstacle when it comes to turning to any kind of authority for help .
The message we need to give is that the intervention will be appropriate to the level of abuse and in conjunction with the child . '
And when youngsters do summon the courage to talk about it , the devastation caused by such abuse becomes clear .
' ... when youngsters do summon the courage to talk about it , the devastation caused by such abuse becomes clear '
Bill Jenkins , who channelled his anger about his own experiences into setting up Securus , a company selling internet protection software for schools and businesses , admits the abuse he suffered as a child had enormous implications in adulthood .
' I did n't realise for a long time that by instinct I was a woman hater , because my experience of this woman meant that I thought women were just to be used for sex , ' he says .
' In my early years , that was it .
I got married and had two children , but I could n't understand that a large part of marriage is based on friendship .
I was never able to give myself totally to my wife .
I always held back . '
Bill 's first marriage broke up and he has been married to his second wife for 20 years .
' I was very open with her from the start , ' he says .
' But even so , even being aware of that , I find it hard to give myself totally . '
He lives with the memory every day , but adds : ' Being able to confront your demons is important .
That 's the only way to put them behind you .
I can't change what went on , but accepting it helps you cope .
' The past loses its power over you .
I am happy to talk about it now because it helps me and I hope it helps others to seek help . '
It has been discovered that a large percentage of female child abusers abuse theiir own children
The true scale of the problem is as yet unclear .
It is thought that highprofile media cases - such as that of Vanessa George - encourage victims to speak out .
' When the public hears a story being told they feel they 're not alone , and because they feel less isolated they feel more able to talk about something which is a hugely taboo topic , ' says Peter Bradley .
' We are not saying the number of offences of female sexual abuse are necessarily increasing , but that the number of reported cases have increased . '
Pointing out that the Vanessa George story really hit the headlines last month , Mr Bradley adds : ' We 're sure that in this next 12 months the numbers of children reporting abuse by females will increase dramatically .
' We are just at the tip of the iceberg . '
And while organisations such as ChildLine , which receives twice as many calls from girls as it does from boys , continue to try to encourage boys to speak out , experts are also agreed that more research is essential to protect children and understand what leads women to abuse in the first place .
According to DCI
Hill : ' We are sadly lacking in research in relation to female offenders .
Only now , as more women are charged and are subject to sexual offenders ' treatment programmes and to academic research , will we start to understand the subtle differences between male and female offenders .
' But that is still five or ten years away .
What we are saying is that the debate needs to be out there .
We need to talk openly about female offenders . '
No doubt many will still struggle with the idea that women are capable of such despicable behaviour .
But until attitudes change it is also clear that female abusers will continue to hide behind the benign image of mother , aunt or family friend and that this tiny minority of wrongdoers will escape notice .
This is an extract from a letter written by Tony , an adult struggling to come to terms with the abuse he suffered at the hands of his aunt from the age of three .
' I know that the experts say that female sexual abuse is rare , ' he writes .
' Do n't believe it .
There are many out there like me who were abused and who are now causing more abuse .
' I sometimes wonder how different my life might have been had my mother or someone else listened to the pain of a small boy . '
Scam Phone Calls & Text Messages : How to Spot & Report Them
Scam phone calls associated with COVID - 19 have been rampant in 2020 , and the FTC says that they 're just getting started .
Numerous other phone scams have been around for a while and show no sign of easing up .

Jonathan Turley 's op - ed in USA Today casts some deserved scorn on the Obama administration for helping push through a UN resolution that lends support to theocratic governments who punish people for criticizing religion .
While attracting surprisingly little attention , the Obama administration supported the effort of largely Muslim nations in the U.N. Human Rights Council to recognize exceptions to free speech for any " negative racial and religious stereotyping . " …
The Egyptian ambassador to the U.N. , Hisham Badr , wasted no time in heralding the new consensus with the U.S. that " freedom of expression has been sometimes misused " and showing that the " true nature of this right " must yield government limitations .
His U.S. counterpart , Douglas Griffiths , heralded " this joint project with Egypt " and supported the resolution to achieve " tolerance and the dignity of all human beings . "
While not expressly endorsing blasphemy prosecutions , the administration departed from other Western allies in supporting efforts to balance free speech against the protecting of religious groups .
Thinly disguised blasphemy laws are often defended as necessary to protect the ideals of tolerance and pluralism .
They ignore the fact that the laws achieve tolerance through the ultimate act of intolerance : criminalizing the ability of some individuals to denounce sacred or sensitive values .
We do not need free speech to protect popular thoughts or popular people .
It is designed to protect those who challenge the majority and its institutions .
Criticism of religion is the very measure of the guarantee of free speech — the literal sacred institution of society .
Turley then ticks off a litany of recent blasphemy prosecutions the resolution would ostensibly support , including a British teen charged for insulting Scientology , an Italian comedian prosecuted for insulting the Pope , and prosecutions in Austria , India , and Finland for calling Mohammed a pedophile .
As Turley explains , the UN resolution is only symbolic .
But the Obama administration deserves condemnation for aligning itself with religious sensitivity and religious extremists over free expression .
Reason has covered this issue before , including the U.K.'s banishment of Dutch politician Geert Wilders and Ezra Levant 's battle with Canada 's human rights commissions over his publication of Muhammed cartoons in the Western Standard .
Elevator number 14 on the second floor of Christus St. Joseph Hospital 's George W. Strake building was closed for four days .
Since the elevator was being repaired , physician 's assistant Karin Leah Steinau took the stairs on Thursday and Friday .
On a mid-August Saturday , around 9:30 a.m. , the elevator 's out - of - order sign was gone , so Steinau pressed the call button .
A few yards away , surgery resident Hitoshi Christopher Nikaidoh was waiting for an elevator beside the doctor 's lounge .
Steinau moved to join him .
Since the hospital elevators are slow , she usually waits midway between the two for whichever comes first .
The elevator nearer Steinau arrived .
She stepped onto the double - wide elevator with faux wood walls , and pressed six , Steinau told Houston Police Department officers in a taped interview the next day .
" Is it working today ? " Nikaidoh asked .
" I hope so , " she replied .
As Nikaidoh stepped onto the elevator , the doors closed , pinning his shoulders .
" He tried to pull back and he could n't , " Steinau told HPD officers .
" The doors would n't open . "
She was n't able to find the Door Open button before the elevator started moving upward .
" When you get on an elevator , if it closes on you , it 's supposed to open back up , " she told officers .
" There was n't any of that .
There was no hesitation .
The doors shut and it went . "
Nikaidoh struggled , trying to shrug out of the elevator , or possibly pull himself inside , she said , but the elevator kept moving upward .
The ceiling sliced off most of his head .
His left ear , lower lip , teeth and jaw were still attached to his body , which fell to the bottom of the elevator shaft , as the elevator continued moving upward .
Steinau frantically pushed every button ; the elevator stopped four feet below the fifth floor .
She was trapped inside the elevator with his head for more than an hour .
" I just keep seeing the look in his eyes , " she told officers .
People trust elevators to be safe .
But Nikaidoh 's decapitation is not necessarily a freak accident .
It 's not even the first elevator decapitation in Texas .
On a mid-April afternoon four years ago , a 19 - year - old Dallas construction worker stuck his head in a shaft to see where the elevator was , according to an accident investigation report by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation .
The descending elevator was just above him .
And the month before Nikaidoh 's death , 76 - year - old L.A. Brown , a retired railroad and construction worker , was crushed and killed on a hospital elevator outside New Orleans .
Brown was about to have exploratory surgery for a tumor above his colon .
As he was being wheeled off the elevator , it suddenly dropped , killing him , The Times - Picayune reported .
In fact , as it turns out , this is n't the first time questions have been raised about the elevators at St. Joseph .
A Houston Press review of Harris County court records revealed that nearly ten years ago , two lawsuits accused St. Joseph Hospital and Otis Elevators of knowing in 1994 that the hospital 's elevators were dangerous , defective and unsafe .
The suits alleged that the elevators were not properly inspected or maintained .
In September 1994 , 40 - year - old Pamela Scott slipped in an elevator that was not level with the floor and twisted her left knee .
Scott 's Houston attorney , Donald DeSimone , went to the scene to examine the elevator with an expert .
DeSimone remembers seeing sparks fly from the elevator .
" It was in such bad shape that he ordered it shut down , " DeSimone says .
Two months after Scott 's accident , 61 - year - old Cecil Wilcox was injured in an elevator while visiting her husband , a patient in the hospital .
When Wilcox stepped onto a second - floor elevator , the cab was about six inches lower than the floor .
She fell , injuring her back , knee and shoulder , says her Carrizo Springs attorney , John Petry .
Wilcox 's accident occurred in elevator 15 , directly beside the elevator on which Nikaidoh died .
Elevator 14 was also tested extensively during that lawsuit .
When Nikaidoh died , elevator 14 was one month past its annual inspection due date .
The state 's chief elevator inspector , Ron Steele , recently documented 22 code violations ranging from dirty , oil - soaked rags in the elevator machine room to open connections and a missing generator guard .
Steele 's investigation report states that the elevator operated with the doors open , and notes burned resistors , loose and unmarked wires , and excessive wear on brushes and contacts .
The report concludes that misconnected wires most likely caused the elevator safety system to fail .
Because two wires were placed in one connector , the elevator believed that the doors were closed when they were n't .
There were 256 elevator - and escalator - related accidents in Texas last year , according to the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation .
Over the past four years , the department has records of four elevator - related deaths : the two decapitations , and two elevator maintenance workers who each died while working on top of elevator cabs .
In the first , a maintenance man was working on top of an elevator in Fort Worth when the cab started moving ; he became stuck between the elevator and the hoistway , according to Kevin Ketchum , spokesperson for the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation .
In the second , a man was working on top of an elevator in San Antonio ; he was stepping on top of another elevator when one of the cabs began moving .
His body was jammed between the moving cab and the bar between elevators in the shaft , Ketchum says .
Nationally , elevators and escalators kill about 30 people a year and seriously injure 17,100 , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Consumer Product Safety Commission .
Houston is the only city in Texas that is exempt from Texas elevator safety laws , because for the past 30 years , the city has had more stringent rules than the state .
Still , there are more than 300 lawsuits on file at the county courthouse against four of the biggest names in the elevator industry .
Since 1978 , nearly 200 lawsuits have been filed against Otis Elevators ; approximately 100 suits against Schindler Elevators since 1983 ; around 20 against ThyssenKrup Elevators since 2000 ; and about a dozen against Kone Inc. since 1998 .
The majority of locally owned and operated elevator service companies are not facing any lawsuits .
One case concerns a condominium concierge who died five days after falling down an elevator shaft at the historic Beaconsfield condominiums , located in downtown Houston at 1700 Main .
There is also a case detailing an instance where a pharmaceutical technician at Texas Children 's Hospital was squashed between elevator doors for three hours .
Another suit says an electrician replacing lights inside an elevator shaft was injured when the elevator fell , crushing the ladder he was standing on , wedging him between the elevator and the wall in the Millennium Tower on Richmond .
" No one understands why he was n't killed , " says Houston attorney Steve Kamel .
The electrician , Joseph Fortner , has had two knee surgeries since the accident on January 17 , 2002 .
" When elevators go wrong , they go very wrong , " says Howard Nations , the Houston attorney representing Nikaidoh 's family in the wrongful death lawsuit filed August 28 .
The majority of elevator accidents involve someone tripping when getting off an elevator not level with the ground , or passengers scraping a hand when a door closes .
" Many accidents that people attribute to elevators have absolutely nothing to do with the equipment " itself , says Edward Donoghue , code and safety consultant for the National Elevator Industry Inc. , based in Salem , New York .
If someone riding an elevator reaches into a bag of glass and cuts his finger , it counts as an elevator accident , Donoghue says .
Donoghue and other members of the elevator industry maintain that elevators are the safest way to travel .
Elevators make 12 billion trips every year , carrying people 100 million miles , Donoghue says .
Considering how far they travel , the number of accidents is minuscule , he insists .
More Americans are injured in garage door accidents than in elevators , according to data from the Consumer Product Safety Commission .
" The safety record of the elevator industry is beyond reproach , by anyone and any standard , " says Ron Marchal , owner of Houston 's Marchal / Stevenson Elevator Inc. , who says only one lawsuit has been filed against him in 25 years .
" The elevator fell a little bit , nobody got hurt , " he says .
John Quackenbush , a North Carolina - based elevator consultant who campaigns nationally for elevator safety laws , begs to differ .
The elevator industry has spent too many years believing its own public relations campaign , Quackenbush says .
" If it was the safest form of transportation , why would all these people be getting killed or getting hurt ?
Codes are not being enforced .
Safety slips , and people are getting killed .
This is needless ; it does n't have to happen . "
In April , Otis Elevators celebrated the 150th anniversary of the modern elevator .
Primitive elevators have existed since the building of the pyramids .
However , in early models , it was common for the cord carrying the cab to break and kill people .
This year , the company re-enacted Elisha Graves Otis 's safety demonstration at P.T. Barnum 's 1853 Crystal Palace Exhibition in New York City .
Otis rode a platform in an open shaft and had the cables cut , but instead of his falling , safety gears kicked in and held him .
Otis installed the first commercial passenger elevator on March 23 , 1857 , at a New York City department store .
By the 1870s there were 2,000 Otis elevators in service .
There are no federal mandates on elevator safety .
The U.S. government does n't require elevators to be inspected , or that elevator inspectors know what they 're doing .
It 's up to individual states .
Over the past five years , there has been a national movement to strengthen state elevator safety laws .
Most states did n't have or did n't enforce rules and regulations regarding elevator inspection and repair , Quackenbush says .
Many states also did n't require elevator - related accidents or fatalities to be reported , he says .
Quackenbush wrote the model elevator safety legislation in use in several states .
He based it on elevator safety laws Denmark enacted in 1971 .
Because Denmark has national health insurance , every elevator accident and death is reported , so the problem is more noticeable there than in the United States , where only employee deaths are documented .
Denmark 's law requires elevator mechanics to be licensed and enforces mandatory maintenance .
The country has had only two elevator fatalities in more than 30 years .
Recently , Indiana , Alabama and California made major improvements in state elevator laws , Quackenbush says .
Three years ago , he says , Vermont did n't have any elevator safety rules ; now it does .
Today , most states have some degree of enforcement , Quackenbush says , except for North and South Dakota , Mississippi and Oklahoma .
He says he would be very wary getting onto an elevator in those states .
In July , the much - touted self - funded Illinois elevator program went into effect , requiring elevator inspectors to obtain a state license .
The problem is , the license does n't exist .
The Illinois Fire Marshal 's Office reports that the license will be available in October 2004 .
January 14 , 1993 , was Andy Gomez 's 17th wedding anniversary .
Formerly University of Houston vice president of Academic Affairs , Gomez was serving as the Massachusetts undersecretary of education .
He ate breakfast with his wife before giving a friend a ride to work .
Driving the gray Buick Century he bought at a River Oaks dealership , Gomez dropped his friend off at the front steps of Boston 's executive building because she walked with crutches .
Normally , he took the three flights of stairs from the parking garage to the lobby , and then rode the elevator to his office on the 14th floor .
But that day , he was loaded down with his bags , and his friend 's bags , and since it was snowing , he was wearing heavy boots and carrying his dress shoes .
He stepped into the parking garage elevator , but before he was all the way inside , the doors closed and shot upward , throwing him to the floor .
He noticed huge gashes in both his head and his elbow -- then he realized his leg was trapped outside the door .
" I can remember my leg just basically exploding , " he says .
Bones and blood burst through his pants and winter coat .
" My whole left leg was crushed , " he says .
" My heart stopped .
I was clinically dead . "
Blood streamed down the outside of the elevator doors in the lobby .
The building nurse fell backward when he saw Gomez .
A surgeon arrived at the scene to amputate the leg .
Instead , Gomez was lifted out of the elevator with flotation devices , the way sunken submarines are raised .
Gomez was hospitalized for a month and had eight surgeries to save his leg , which is held together with rods and screws .
He lost half the muscle in his leg and can't feel anything from his knee to his groin .
After his accident , the Boston Globe reported that despite existing state laws , only half the elevators in Massachusetts were inspected .
Because Gomez was a public official , his story was used to illustrate the need for elevator safety laws to be strengthened and enforced .
They were .
Gomez was unable to work for a year and a half .
He left Boston and returned to his native Miami , where he served as dean of the University of Miami's School of International Studies .
Currently , he is the special assistant to the provost .
Had he not been in the elevator accident , Gomez believes , he would have become a university president , as he had planned .
But now he says he is n't physically capable .
Gomez is 49 years old , and when he travels he has to wear support hose .
Because he's had a couple of bouts of phlebitis , he injects anticoagulants into his leg to prevent blood clots .
He can't sit still for long periods of time , and some days he has to walk with a cane .
The accident caused herniated and slipped discs in his back , but doctors say they can't operate because they might damage his leg .
If he hears a strange noise or feels an out - of - the - ordinary movement when he's on an elevator , Gomez panics .
The nightmares where he 's back on the elevator reliving the accident occur less and less .
Still , some days he can't get on an elevator at all .
" My mind just wo n't let me , " he says .
Around the same time as Gomez 's accident , Texas created an elevator safety advisory board .
But the state did n't have any power to enforce elevator inspections .
Two years ago , Representative Charlie Geren , a Republican from Fort Worth , authored House Bill 656 to amend the Texas Health and Safety Code , and require elevators to be annually inspected .
" Some building owners had never had their elevators inspected at all , " Geren says .
Geren 's legislation failed .
This year the bill passed in the Texas House but was n't signed .
However , in June , Senate Bill 279 , which incorporated most of Geren 's bill , was signed into law .
" Mine was more powerful , " Geren says .
The number of Texas elevators inspected has more than doubled in the last three years , from about 15,000 in 2000 to nearly 33,000 the department registered this past fiscal year .
This excludes elevators in federal buildings , says the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation 's Ketchum , because state law is n't applicable to U.S. property .
It also excludes buildings in Houston , which are exempt from state law .
State law also grants exemptions to other buildings such as factories , where elevators are mostly used by employees only .
Before the new law went into effect , about a month ago on September 1 , Texas elevator inspectors were inspecting elevators with the outdated 1994 Society of Mechanical Engineers elevator code book .
Currently , inspectors use the 2002 edition .
In other states , elevator inspectors report having shut down thousands of unsafe elevators .
Texas inspectors do n't do that , says Ketchum .
The department does n't have any records of a Texas elevator being shut down .
However , if an elevator provides an immediate danger to the public , or the elevator has n't been inspected for more than two years -- and the building owner has been repeatedly notified that it needs to be inspected and repaired -- the state can issue an emergency order to shut the elevator down .
But that has n't happened either , Ketchum says .
If a Texas elevator is n't inspected , it is n't sealed off or forced to stop running .
The department does n't issue that building a certificate .
State law allows the department to fine building owners up to $ 5,000 per day , per safety code violation .
But the fines do n't seem to make a big difference .
Looking at 169 pages of fines issued , in several instances elevators were not inspected for four to six years .
" The fine is cheaper than getting it inspected , " Quackenbush says .
" It 's gonna cost $ 4,000 to get it fixed .
And the fine is only $ 1,000 .
Well , I 'll pay the $ 1,000 and maybe they wo n't catch me again for four or five years . "
The department requires building owners to report accidents involving serious bodily injury within 48 hours , Ketchum says .
Records are not thorough .
The state has more than 300 elevator - related accident reports , which Ketchum says document all elevator fatalities and injuries in Texas for the last ten years .
For Houston , the state has on file only 11 reports of minor accidents occurring at Foley's , the doctor 's decapitation and an incident August 26 where 14 people spent an hour trapped in an elevator at IntraCare Hospital , a psychiatric facility in the Texas Medical Center .
In the IntraCare elevator accident , a few people had broken bones , and most complained of neck and back pain .
Not one of the many local personal injury lawsuits involving elevator accidents is on file at the department .
Ketchum explains the dearth of documentation by saying that Houston is out of the state 's jurisdiction , therefore Houston officials keep accident records .
City officials say they do n't keep accident reports , they send them to the state , because the state conducts accident investigations .
Houston employs only one elevator inspector , and he does n't inspect elevators .
Individual building owners hire private elevator inspection companies .
The city inspector , Mike Dorosk , files annual inspection reports and ensures that the more than 8,200 elevators inside city limits get inspected .
" If one goes overdue , we 're gonna know .
And it 's not going to be six months or six years later , " says Dan Pruitt , spokesperson for Houston 's Code Enforcement division .
" We go to greater lengths to ensure elevator safety than any other city in the state .
The overwhelming majority of other cities around the state of Texas have no idea whether elevators are being inspected or not .
They do n't have any records whatsoever . "
If the building owner fails to fix a code violation within ten days , the city can issue a citation that is a class B misdemeanor and carries a fine ranging from $ 800 to $ 2,000 a day .
But that has n't happened in the past six years , says Richard Vrana , chief inspector for the city 's mechanical inspection section , which includes the elevator subsection .
Most building owners voluntarily shut elevators down and promptly fix things , Vrana says .
" We 're talking about a piece of equipment that you can't take any chances on , " Pruitt says .
" There 's too much liability .
You can't have spotty compliance . "
If an elevator has only a minor code violation , it 's given conditional approval to operate -- as in the case of the service elevator located in the downtown Beaconsfield condominiums .
It had 26 code violations on its 1996 inspection , says Houston attorney Craig Keener .
Although repairs were n't made after subsequent inspections , city officials allowed the elevator to continue operating .
" They do n't follow up well , " Keener says .
The building owner knew that the elevator , installed in 1911 , was a " death trap , " Keener wrote in his third amended original petition .
For the past 25 years , the owner was told to replace the elevator , which stopped and started on its own , the petition says .
On August 30 , 2000 , the mesh - gate door on the eighth floor jammed and would n't close .
Then the elevator stopped dead on the first floor .
George Canales , the 54 - year - old concierge , did n't want to leave an open gate into an empty elevator shaft , so he went to the eighth floor to fix it .
While he was trying to pull the gate closed , Canales fell down the shaft .
He died five days later .
The case was settled last week .
Colby Dillin , a first - grader at Trinity Valley School in Fort Worth , was vacationing at his best friend 's beach house in Pensacola , Florida .
It was spring break March 1998 ; the six - year - olds Jet Skied , jumped waves , and that morning they visited the Naval Air Museum so Colby could see the airplane exhibition .
Colby loved airplanes .
He was scheduled to fly home the next day .
Colby , his older sister and his best friend climbed onto the first - floor elevator inside the beach house .
The door opened while the elevator was moving .
Colby stuck his head out and peered over the edge .
His head got caught and was crushed between the ceiling of the first floor and the elevator .
There were safety devices that could have saved Colby 's life , says his father , Fort Worth orthopedic surgeon Linden Dillin .
But they were optional .
" This kid never should have died , " Dillin says .
Dillin vowed to use the $ 5.7 million settlement he gained from the elevator company to create laws regulating private elevators .
" In most states , there are no regulations related to elevators in private homes , " he says .
" There 's not even any codes that are enforced .
At the time Colby died there were no laws in Texas . "
Dillin and his now - 14 - year - old daughter , who was in the elevator with Colby , testified in both Tallahassee and Austin .
The argument he met was that the government should n't control what happens inside private homes .
" We 're going to value the absolute right to run things in our house over the right of other people to come into our house and be safe , " Dillin says .
" The state needs to step into people 's houses and say , ' No .
You do n't rule here . ' "
Despite the Dillins ' efforts ,
Texas laws are fairly lax .
In Houston , a private elevator has to be inspected when it 's installed -- but never again after that .
While acknowledging that recommending homeowners regularly maintain and inspect elevators is akin to telling people it's a good idea to check the batteries in smoke detectors , Pruitt still says that what happens inside a private home is not within the city 's jurisdiction .
" It 's not our business . "
The state requires only that contractors inform homeowners that having an elevator inspected is a good idea .
But it 's left to the homeowner 's discretion .
" There should be inspections for everyone -- regardless of where you 're at , " says Elie Graustein , a partner at Lone Star Elevator Company , which installs 60 to 70 private elevators in Houston each year .
" There 's a lot of people installing elevators that are not really elevators . "
For example , Graustein says , a Galveston man used to install homemade elevators that did n't have any safety devices -- they were just attached to a chain hoist on the ceiling .
" He called them dumbwaiters , " Graustein says .
" But they were big enough to ride in .
If there were inspections for stuff like that , that would not have been allowed to be installed . "
Another problem is that many do - it - yourself homeowners try to fix their own elevators , Marchal says .
" We can't stop them , " he says .
" No more than anyone can stop you from going to work on your air conditioner .
It 's in your house .
If you want to work on it , have at it . "
Home elevators usually have an outside door to make the elevator look like a closet , in addition to a gate that rides up and down with the elevator .
Many homeowners remove the inside gate because it's a hassle to open and close .
But that violates safety codes -- and often makes the elevator safety device kick in and stop the elevator .
If a homeowner decides he wants the elevator to run , despite safety issues , most local repair companies the Press interviewed say they refuse -- because if they work on an elevator and it does n't meet the safety code and someone later gets hurt , they can get sued .
" We always say , ' Look , if you want us to work on it , we 're gonna put it back , ' " Graustein says .
Still , he adds : " We have no control over what they do after we leave . "
As part of the Dillins ' settlement agreement , the manufacturer of the elevator on which Colby died was required to send Linden Dillin a letter documenting exactly what safety changes the company has implemented since Colby 's death .
" I still have n't received that letter , " Dillin says .
" They sent us some brochures . "
Both elevators 14 and 15 at St. Joseph are now boarded up , covered in peach - painted plywood , which blends into the hospital 's peach walls .
Black duct tape covers the call button .
A pink - and - purple sign directs visitors to the elevator down the hall .
Nikaidoh , 35 , made sushi with the youth group at St. Vincent de Paul and volunteered on Sunday mornings giving free health care to the homeless .
He ran marathons , competed in triathlons , played violin and memorized opera scores at the library .
His stepmother was hosting a yard sale the morning he died .
His father , a Dallas pediatric cardiovascular surgeon , was at the office doing paperwork .
The couple never considered suing , says his stepmother , Lynn Nikaidoh , until they received a call from the medical examiner 's office .
She says her husband was informed that alcohol was found in his son's blood , and if the family planned to sue , it was going to look bad .
Four nurses and the priest who worked with Nikaidoh in the intensive care unit until 30 minutes before he died told the family they did n't see any evidence Nikaidoh was intoxicated .
Regardless , plaintiffs ' attorney Nations says it does n't matter if Nikaidoh was drinking .
" He was n't driving the elevator , " he says .
HPD officers received a statement conflicting with Steinau 's from a physician who had just finished his morning rounds and stepped off a nearby elevator .
The doctor , Canaan Harris , told officers in a taped interview that the elevator doors did not crush Nikaidoh , as Steinau claims .
The physician says Nikaidoh forced the closing elevator doors open , and as the elevator moved upward , Nikaidoh tried to climb onto it .
That 's how his head got cut off , Harris told officers .
Nations says Harris is mistaken .
He argues that Steinau 's account is the most likely because she was standing on the elevator watching it happen , whereas Harris was walking down the hall in the opposite direction .
The weekend after Nikaidoh 's death , a memorial service was held in the chapel directly beside the elevator in which he died .
A few feet down the hall , in the walkway to the emergency center across the street , hangs a picture of the Sisters of Charity and eight - by - ten glossies of the hospital 's medical executive committee .
Beside that are wallet - sized photos of the staff surgeons .
In the bottom right - hand corner is Nikaidoh 's picture .
He has bright red cheeks , a lopsided grin and is wearing a white coat and his trademark bow tie .
Beneath his name , " 1968 -2003 " has been added .

A special wedding was held at Zhengzhou Funeral Parlor on the morning of November 10 .
Yu Liang finally married the girl he loves , but she was lying in a coffin .
The bridegroom looks at his wife 's parents .
A red ribbon , traditionally
worn by the bridegroom on his chest , has never been seen in the funeral
parlor before .
The priest pronounces them husband and wife
A special wedding
The priest 's voice was very clear in the empty funeral parlor , " Yu , do you take Zhang for your lawful wedded wife and love her forever ? "
" I do . "
At about 9:30 am on November 10 , when Yu , wearing a suit and red ribbon , said " I do , " his bride was not standing beside him , but lying silently in a coffin behind him .
This was a special wedding held at Zhengzhou Funeral Parlor .
A large image of the Chinese character " Dian , " meaning to pay homage to the dead , and a wreath hung behind Yu .
He could not put a ring on the bride 's finger and kiss her , but only gently look at a photo of his bride placed in front of the coffin .
They did not even get the chance to take wedding photos .
Gaze upon the greatness that is Tribe member " Reenie 's " geeky , silly , timely , comic book - style wedding invitation !
Reenie sez ,
" The wording [ on the back ] is my favorite part .
It reads : ' [ We ] request the honor of your presence as two geeks save the princess , resist the dark side and pledge their lives ( extra , or otherwise ) to each other . '
And we snuck a Hyrulian crest in there too ! "
With adorableness like that can you believe she actually had doubts about using these invitations !?
Mostly for fear that the older generations would n't " get it . "
But then she realized , " if people do n't like the invites then they probably wo n't get the ' Mario Kart Love Song ' that plays on our wedsite , or the lightsaber duel mid-ceremony , or the gaming stations or my Death Cab for Cutie inspired wedding tattoo , or any of the other stuff that is 'us . ' "
So in featuring these invites we both hope that it inspires someone else to let their inner geek flag fly !
The man arrested in connection with the murder of gay Puerto Rico teenage Jorge Steven Lopez Mercado will reportedly use the ‘ gay panic ’ defence .
A police report said that Juan A Martinez Matos , 26 , murdered the 19 - year - old after finding out he was a man .
Police say Lopez Mercado was picked up in a red light district by Matos while dressed in women ’s clothes .
Newspaper El Nuevo Dia said that Matos confessed to taking Lopez Mercado to a house but “ the suspect ( allegedly ) found out that Lopez was a man , after Lopez made sexual advances , and as a result of the rage , Matos did what he did ” .
Lopez Mercado ’s body was found on Friday by a road in the city of Cayey .
He had been burnt and dismembered .
The gay panic defence is a controversial plea which is used by a suspect who claims they were violent because of a moment of temporary insanity .
It often sparks outrage from the gay community around the world because it places the burden of blame on the victim .
It has also been used in cases of violent against trans people .
There is also no equivalent defence relating to heterosexual encounters .
The defence is most frequently used in the United States , particularly in areas where homophobia is widespread .
In the UK , where it is also referred to as the “ Portsmouth defence ” or “ guardsman ’s defence ” , the Crown Prosecution Service states that :
“ The fact that the victim made a sexual advance on the defendant does not , of itself automatically provide the defendant with a defence of self - defence for the actions that take place .
“ Often , the sexual advance made by the victim will not involve any physical act of touching , and the reaction of the defendant is borne out of anger rather than any real belief that they were acting to protect themselves from an assault . ”
The Militarization of Sex
Mohammad , a 40 - year old Lebanese Shiite who lives in Hezbollah ’s stronghold in Beirut ’s southern suburbs , was holding forth on the virtues of resistance , loyalty , and sex .
" You could create the most loyal army by providing political power , social services and fulfilling the desires of your men — namely , sexual ones , " he declared .
" And Hezbollah has been very successful in this regard , " Mohammad continued .
It is hard to disagree .
Hezbollah liberated South Lebanon from Israeli occupation , expanded the Shiite community ’s political power within the country , and has provided social services , such as health care and education , to its constituency since the 1980s .
Today , it is also working to fulfill the sexual needs of its supporters , though a practice known as mutaa marriage .
Mutaa is a form of " temporary marriage " only acceptable within Shiite communities , one that allows couples to have religiously sanctioned sex for a limited period of time , without any commitments , and without the obligatory involvement of religious figures .
In conservative Muslim societies known for their strict sense of propriety , mutaa offers an escape clause .
The contract is very simple .
The woman says : " I marry myself to you for [ a specific period of time ] and for [ a specified dowry ] " and the man says : " I accept . "
The period can range between one hour and a year , and is subject to renewal .
A Muslim woman can only marry a Muslim man , but a Muslim man can temporarily marry a Muslim , Christian , or Jewish woman , as long as she is a divorcée or a widow .
However , those interviewed for this article confirmed that Hezbollah - the " Party of God " - has allowed the practice to spread to virgins or girls who have never married before , as long as the permission of her guardian ( father or paternal grandfather ) is obtained .
Temporary marriage has long been practiced by Shiites around the world .
However , it has recently become more commonplace in Lebanon , notably within Hezbollah strongholds in Beirut ’s southern suburbs and in southern Lebanon after the 2006 war with Israel ,
Hezbollah ’s recent encouragement of this phenomenon highlights the compromises it had been required to make in order to remain the preeminent force among its domestic Shiite constituency .
As the party gained strength due to its effectiveness in fighting Israel , it was forced to cope with the reality that many Lebanese Shiites did not share the Iranian - inspired religious beliefs of Hezbollah ’s leaders .
They came to dominate a community that was shaped by the secular leftist trends of the 1970s and 1980s , and the cosmopolitan culture embodied by Beirut .
Today , Lebanese Shiites are exposed to pop icons such as sexpot singer Haifa Wehbe , countless Western advertisements and programs , and technological innovations such as online dating .
Allowing these Shia to balance their sexual desires with their support for the " Resistance " against the " Zionist entity " is a vital ingredient to Hezbollah ’s staying power .
According to Shiite writer and activist Lokman Slim , Hezbollah party members are not allowed to practice temporary marriage for security reasons , unless assigned by the party to do so .
" We should make a clear distinction between Hezbollah as an organization and Hezbollah as it runs the community ’s culture and social affairs , " Slim said .
But for everyone else , Hezbollah apparently decided to expand its support for this practice after the 2006 war , to maintain its support base and keep the Shiites in Lebanon under its control .
" After the 2006 war , Iranian money came to Lebanon in abundance , and money opened the door to sexual luxury that could not be ignored or controlled , " noted Slim .
" Therefore , Hezbollah decided it is easier to allow sex under certain religious titles in order to keep the control over the community . "
The havoc wreaked by the 2006 war and a more difficult domestic political situation also encouraged Hezbollah to shift its position in order to consolidate support .
Sheikh Mohammad Ali Hajj , imam of the Imam Ali Mosque in the Sad Bouchrieh district of Beirut , remarked that after 2006 , Hezbollah had to strengthen its support among its communities .
" They created a military group , The Resistance Saraya , which took in anyone ready to join , religiously and ideologically committed or not , " he said .
" They had to contain the Shiite community around it with all its aspects , the good and the bad , and found measures to control it , including the temporary marriage , " he added .
Hezbollah is in charge of enforcing resolution in the event unpleasant scenarios arise , such as pregnancy or disagreements between couples .
" It is only a matter of more control rather than being tolerant , " Slim explained .
There is no doubt that Hezbollah ’s legitimization of mutaa has created semi-official channels that Lebanese Shiites use to hook up .
Hassan , a 30 - year old Shiite from Beirut ’s southern suburbs , is a high school teacher .
He graduated from the Lebanese University with a bachelor ’s degree in mathematics , and considers himself secular but supports the resistance as a political , not a religious , movement .
He is enthusiastic about the initiative taken by a number of Hezbollah party members and supporters to act as matchmakers between couples , and sometimes turn their shops , bookstores and workplaces into meeting places for young men and women .
" My cousin , a hard - core Hezbollah supporter , finds pleasure in using his mini-market as a hub where both men and women refer to him to hook them up in a temporary marriage .
He even has Excel sheets to help him organize and control the contacts , and of course he practices temporary marriage himself , " he added with a smile .
Nevertheless , Hassan remains very critical of those in the community who use this kind of marriage as a cover for prostitution networks functioning inside the suburbs .
" Some made it a trade and Hezbollah usually turns the blind eye to these networks because they do not want the Lebanese Internal Security to interfere in its stronghold . "
However , once the sex trade got out of control , Hezbollah finally requested the ISF to enter the southern suburbs to help control some of the community ’s illegal practices , such as traffic , drugs , and prostitution .
This month ,
The ISF began coordinating with Hezbollah and the heads of local municipalities in the southern suburbs under the slogan " Order comes from Faith , " initiated by Hezbollah , to control these crimes .
There is also no shortage of ways that Shiite men and women make contact to form a temporary marriage ; sometimes , the experience ends up bringing them closer to Hezbollah .
Ali , for example , is a 26 - year old man from southern Lebanon who has " temporarily married " a number of girls in the last two years .
" I usually meet them in Hezbollah ’s public library or the center , where young men and women gather to attend religious and political preaching , " he explained .
The men and women are put in separate rooms , but he finds a way to communicate .
" If I want to approach a girl , I ask her for her number and call her later , but mostly I get approached by girls who directly ask me if I am interested in temporary marriage , " Ali said .
" Although they are veiled from top to bottom , you can always guess how she looks like from her face and eyes , " he added with a wink .
With his designer jeans , trendy haircut , and sharp sense of humor , Ali seems to be an unlikely Hezbollah supporter .
He has always supported the resistance and what Hezbollah has achieved in this regard ; however , in the last couple of years , he has developed a strong support for Hezbollah on issues he was previously critical of , such as its affiliation with Iran , involvement in domestic politics , and its religious rhetoric .
Coincidently or not , these developments took place as he was drawn to practice temporary marriage .
In his southern village , it is difficult to meet girls and have normal relationships with them , and he acknowledges that getting closer to the party ’s social network has helped him meet more girls who were open to this kind of marriage .
Gradually ,
Ali stopped drinking alcoholic beverages , took up praying and fasting , and never skipped a Hezbollah ’s rally or village events , where he also meets potential " wives . "
However , it is obvious that the slickly dressed Ali never gave up his love of fashion .
It is , of course , not only men who take advantage of mutaa .
Zahra , a fully veiled 25 year - old Shiite woman who is completing her master ’s degree in English literature , comes from a family of Hezbollah supporters and party members , and has been a lifelong Hezbollah member herself .
She explained that she practices temporary marriage because it is a religious duty .
" I take good care of myself , and make sure I look perfect every time I go into a mutaa marriage because I should please my husband , temporary or not , " she said .
" It is my religious duty to do so .
God allowed this kind of marriage for a reason , and I never question God ’s wishes . "
Zahra is divorced and believes that Islam has acknowledged sexual desires for both males and females , which is why temporary marriage is permissible .
" It is also a religious duty to fulfill your sexual desires , " she insisted , noting that temporary marriages with women whose husbands had been killed fighting Israel were especially encouraged .
" [ T ] hose who satisfy widows of martyrs have more reward in heaven , " she said .
While the practice of mutaa may sound exceedingly strange to those outside of these communities , it is an important outlet for many Lebanese Shiites .
As the community is increasingly defined by Hezbollah ’s conservative ideology and isolated by the increasing sectarian divisions in Lebanon , it is more and more difficult to form relationships with people from different backgrounds .
In this sense , mutaa marriage has become a convenient and practical solution .
However , it comes with a cost : Hezbollah has increasingly been able to harness the appeal of mutaa to bolster its support within its constituency .
And there should be no doubt that Hezbollah ’s increased control over Lebanese Shiites comes with consequences that are anything but temporary .
The Amazing Grace Baptist Church in Canton , North Carolina grabbed headlines in mid-October when it announced a “ Halloween Book Burning . ”
It was going to be anything but your typical book burning , assuming there is such a thing .
To be sure , they planned to burn heavy metal music and smutty movies .
But they also had country , gospel , and Christian contemporary music and videos about Jesus in their crosshairs .
Most shockingly , they said that they would burn all non-King James versions of the Bible — aka “ Satan ’s bibles . ”
They also announced a long list of “ Satan ’s popular books written by heretics ” which would be burned .
And to top it all off , they offered “ fried chicken , and all the sides . ”
But when the big day came around , a combination of rain , protesters , a nd a state law against burning paper all conspired against them .
Here ’s what happened :
And here , in their own words , is what Amazing Grace said about their quote - unquote book burning :
SCIENCE AND THE DEMISE OF PHILOSOPHY
Please note : I have left this article mostly as it was in 1990 or thereabouts ( only briefly eliminating references to ' spirituality ' and the supposed ' soul ' .
Since then I have gone though another sea change in relation to these issues and this does not represent my views today .
A more accurate view is found in the up - dated first chapter ( click )
" ... the progress of science has been accompanied by the retrogression of man .
Because of its practical triumphs , there grew up an almost mystical faith in the omnicompetance of science .
Not only could it transform man 's life , it could enable him to know the universe , not only could it render man practical service , it could give him ultimate truth . "

What started as ' natural philosophy ' in Greece and became the various sciences was originally stimulated by a strange mixture of common sense and abstract imaginings .
The common sense factor represented a revolt against superstitions about how most good and ill fortune was caused by the direct action of a hierarchy of Gods .
It began by trying to explain events by what we can observe with the aid of our five senses .
Mathematics was introduced early on , and also very abstract metaphysical ideas , which extended and refined the naturalistic way of thought until one arrived at the position that observable reality is not always as it appears after all .
The basic thrust of the revolution in thought that science heralded was aimed at testing ideas by observation and ordering them accordingly , whereas philosophy tended more to organise observations according to ideas and reasoning .
When philosophy degenerated largely into the theological dogmas of the Middle Ages when reason became too speculative and became divorced from observation , modern science arose as its counterpart .
That the hypothetico - deductive method of science has subsequently been enshrined as the only way to truth , not least by uncritical mainstream philosophy of science , shows independently thinking persons how great is the need of a radically regenerated philosophy of understanding .
Such philosophy has to point out how the inadequacies of prevailing physical empiricism as an instrument of truth can be overcome .
What passes as ' philosophy of science ' in the chief literature and most universities nowadays operates under much the same cloud of unknowing .
The failure to grapple with science 's blind spots and unproven ontological assumptions shows the dependency of philosophers of science on science itself .
The resulting weak role of ' handmaidens ' who applaud progress as scientific and gather the aftermath to analyse the methods and principles that might have been employed is a sorry comment on the ' love of wisdom ' .
Foremost in analysing in depth various forms of scientific discourse and in showing how scientific communities try to monopolise truth as a means to obtaining and establishing social power , was the French philosopher and social historian Michel Foucault .
He came to view all science as an expression of the will to power .
Human experience is far too easily hypostatised by words .
Due to this in quite a large part , the great systems of philosophy of both the distant and recent past are presently seen to have each their own peculiar limitations .
Human life and society are ever changing and surprising us , showing up the deficiencies and mistakes of the past and not least of many past thinkers .
Much of what philosophers once presumed to know was shown to be false , in so far as they made assertions about the nature of the relations that pertain in the natural or social world .
Observation was often sufficient to refute many old philosophical dogmas .
Analytic reason is another method of counteracting false ideas , successfully practised in mutual criticism by many philosophers throughout history .
In this century philosophy has made great advances in the art of analysis , both conceptual and linguistic .
Some variants of the philosophy of language help clarify our understanding and resolve problems that arose due to incorrect thinking , others analyse the meanings and usages of words and propositions most precisely , virtually to the point of absurdity .
Yet modern semantics , pragmatics and the philosophy of language in general have demonstrated the preconceptions that language itself engenders .
Because of the detachment of words from whatever they refer to , their generalised or abstract symbolical nature , mistakes in applying them are far more widespread than is evident without thorough training .
Wittgenstein has probably been the most penetrating analyst of the misuse of language and its many ways of ' bewitching intelligence ' .
No science can manage without language , and even the most mathematicised sciences rely for their interpretation on normal language at some point or other .
Here one strikes the richest source of hidden and confused scientific preconceptions about mankind and reality .
THE RELATIVE ABANDONMENT OF CRITICAL THINKING
Most current philosophy has unfortunately abandoned broad - based critical investigation and evaluation of science in theory and praxis and instead mainly embraces the subservient role that Bertrand Russell and A.J.
Ayer prescribed for philosophy as a handmaiden to science .
On that view , science carries out the discovery of truth and philosophy assists by improving the tools when they are too awkward for the job ... the tools being chiefly concepts and language .
The role is to serve scientists in their empirical endeavour to discover reality by providing logical and analytical help where called for , chiefly in unravelling subtle conceptual confusions caused by the misuse of language .
Philosophers are thought to be historians - cum - linguistic analysts who can plug holes in the leaky pipelines of scientific theory and their occasional attempts to raise the level of debate to something more sublime are disregarded in sovereign manner by most scientists .
With a few notable exceptions , such as in eco-philosophy 1 and in some studies in ethics or the philosophy of law , philosophers remain largely blind to the various and considerable limitations of the sciences - and consequent dangers to mankind of the scientific world view .
As Jürgen Habermas pointed out with great perspicacity " The sciences have retained one thing from philosophy : the illusion of pure theory " 2 .
This untenable belief in the sheer neutral objectivity of scientific knowledge is used by scientists to justify their washing their hands of all consequences of their professional activities .
Meanwhile , the abandonment of metaphysical insight as ' unscientific ' - constantly urged by scientists - has further brought about a degradation in their own self - understanding in numerous ways , and also that of those who are dazzled or blinded by science .
All this has contributed strongly to the removal from education of the urge to practice philosophy in the original sense of seeking the truth and acting rightly .
The decline in interest in sublime ideas is a symptom of the same malaise .
The hard - data sciences have become the model of knowledge , rather than those thinkers , poets , playwrights and authors whose works were once were the touchstone .
The rise in academia of positivism and logical empiricism in this century is largely due to the desire for knowledge productive of technology and material advances .
Logic has meanwhile usurped the place of metaphysic , while even investigative and creative reason have largely been blinkered so as to concentrate it overwhelmingly upon the observable world and the sensory data it provides .
Most funded philosophy today confines itself to the safe study of its historical classics and of established systems of ideas .
While this has value , great shortcomings are also evident in such academic philosophy .
The historical bias tends strongly to result in the drying up of creative experience itself in the academic world , where mental life easily becomes a past - oriented , bookish surrogate for the life of action .
Philosophy suffers from similar institutional constraints and pressures to the sciences .
These are reasons why philosophy departments today have so widely become toothless camp - followers of science and technology , helplessly observing the dissolution of values and what is acceptable in ' spiritual ' culture in a scientifically - advanced world environment of technical artifice , industrial greed and warmongering researches .
As the many journals of philosophy and academic publications make patently evident , the remainder are largely either historians of previous thinkers ' past glories or conceptual and linguistic hair - splitters .
The demise in institutionalised philosophy is related to ' the academic syndrome ' .
This consists in the narrowing of interest to limited or regulated ' fields ' of phenomena and a variety of constrictions on the scope of vision in interpreting them dictated more by one 's school of thought than by genuine discovery and insight .
The doctoral fate of knowing too much about little is often more dangerous than a little knowledge of many things .
Terminological complexity is a sign of it , as is the obsession with self - justificatory documentation and orthodox methods of argumentation .
Logical argumentation easily becomes a fetish , and defending a thesis or standpoint by disputative pro-arguments , while omitting contra-arguments rather indicates a seeker of knowledge trying to justify a belief already held than an actual possessor of it .
This one - sided attempt to persuade rather than present standpoints and evidence for and against neutrally for evaluation is too frequently seen in science .
The ideal of objectivity as ' distance from the field ' is realised through confinement to the proverbial armchair under whatever largely unventilated climate of collegial opinion prevails within the same ivory tower - block , without much other relevant experience - inducing stimuli than books , meetings and seminars .
THE META - CRISIS OF THE SEPARATE SCIENCES
Already in 1942 , the Oxford philosophy don , Professor C.E.M .
Joad , summed up the contemporary situation , as quoted above .
This tradition of critical evaluation of the assumptions and achievements of science was continued by one of Britain 's major philosophers , A.N. Whitehead , such as in his Science and the Modern World .
Yet Whitehead 's analyses and warnings seem to have gone unheeded and unnoticed compared to his colleague Bertrand Russell 's often naive positivistic enthusiasm .
Great efforts were made to turn empiricism into a tenable philosophy by the positivistic and logical empirical schools ... efforts that have ended in complete failure .
Widely heralded as the greatest exponent of the ideas of positivism , not least by Bertrand Russell , Wittgenstein had to deny that he was a positivist and set out to show how his work demonstrated the untenability of positivistic tenets as philosophy and had been almost universally misinterpreted by his colleagues .
His work definitively demonstrated that the attempt by positivists and empiricists to abolish metaphysics by the use of metaphysical arguments was self - defeating , not least because the had to have recourse to metaphysical assumptions in the process .
In short , positivism is philosophically untenable .
The demise of positivism , and along with it its watered - down version known as logical empiricism , left science without the basis of any consistent or universal philosophy .
An incomplete and crippled ' scientific philosophy ' stands shakily with one remaining crutch , faith in the empirical method .
Logical empiricism is what remains of philosophy in the service of scientism , but it adequate only within the premises of science , really only as a theory of method .
Its only ' metaphysic ' is the assumption of the exclusively physical nature of reality .
Science appears now to seek within itself for its own ' metaphysic ' , chiefly jointed together out of diverse speculations of bio-geneticists and astrophysicists .
Some speculate loosely over the fact that the universe has produced a species which conceives of the universe as such and whether this was somehow purposive or accidental .
Without an inclusive ontology , epistemology , ethic or meta- science , however , all this remains amateurish as philosophy , however professional it may be as physics .
Consequently , a majority of natural scientists either know little of philosophy or else misunderstand it , still backing neo-positivistic ideas .
Many scientists who address the public exhibit a lack of insight and self - reflection that indicates a vacuum in the preoccupation with physical scientism .
One historical consequence of positivism was not the suppression , not only the arbitrary rationalistic metaphysics against which it was a positive reaction , but also of the proper development of meta - scientific thought along with the growth of each science .
General meta - science too , which aims to elucidate the principles of knowledge and understanding that goes ' beyond science ' and which is the main subject of this book , has been hindered by the widespread survival of a scientistic philosophy of science .
This occurs largely because the sciences eschew critical and dynamic thought about their deepest fundaments and real aspirations , while avoiding those supra-empirical principles that nevertheless are implicit in science and function in all human understanding .
In present - day philosophy of science , one mostly argues fine technical points about methods and types of conclusions that the sciences can consider valid , and thus one tends only passively to monitor inexhorable developments in science uncritically .
Contemporary theorists in the philosophy of science are cautious in the extreme as critics and mostly seem blithely oblivious of fundamental distortions in science 's self - image , and in many of its claims .
Any telling body of major research is lacking in the sociology of scientific knowledge or its effects on society .
Philosophers of science seem unwilling seriously to consider many charges levied against the role of science as a social institution and an intellectual panacea .
Present - day philosophy of science has indeed very largely geared itself irreversibly to science and scientific progress .
Philosophers do offer a forum for ethical issues raised by scientific advances , but this discussion is mostly based on the premise that scientific progress is all important .
The great majority of academic philosophers today share basic interests with scientists in making their living from research grants and paid positions where their roles and public images are unavoidably interconnected in various ways .
Academics are overwhelmingly collegial supporters and apologists for science .
The scientific establishment and our latter - day ' intellectuals ' produced by the battery teaching methods of modern universities are physicalistic and atheistic in outlook ... but fortunately such widely - embraced Weltanschauung have come and gone many a time before .
Wittgenstein wrote of the " wretched effects that the worship of science and the scientific method has had upon our whole culture " .
He was especially concerned with aesthetics , moral behaviour and religious beliefs , on which areas of life science has nothing to say and , because of the scientific method , cannot ever have anything to say .
Nonetheless , scientists have argued and propounded on these subjects , engendering superficial confusions and distortions in addition to the difficulties that these questions already present .
PRECONCEPTION , CERTAINTY AND RESERVATION
The backbone of scientific enquiry should be the attitude of reservation of judgement .
Scientists recognise , at least theoretically , that even their most well - tried theories tend to have to be modified or even rejected as researches proceed .
Modern philosophy of science insists on the changing nature of scientific theory or its empirically - based ' truths ' as an unavoidable historical fact , but also as something that in principle must be so .
Yet the spirit that informed the best of European philosophy and science , openness of mind and reservation of final judgement , does seem to be losing ground to self - righteous scientific certainty .
Science bases itself only on what has been observed in the past .
It can not be certain of future events , for these are unobservable and beyond measurement , even though they may now and again prove calculable in advance .
The best it can do is predict on the basis of what happened in the past and then simply " wait and see " , as was the maxim of the founding fathers of British empiricism , Locke and Hume .
The results of science may turn out to hold true against future observations , but no guarantee of their certainty can ever be given .
In principle , the best science can offer is approximations , predictions of the likelihood of an event coming true .
Now , the human mind cannot avoid relying on ' preconceptions ' for any of its investigations .
When carrying out scientific research , for example , the meaning of what one is doing and why is provided by the mind 's acquaintance with an immense network of circumstances , facts , reasonable assumptions , values , motives and so on .
Though not themselves the object of investigation , its preconceptions - this ' fore - knowledge ' - consists in a necessary and ineradicable set of extra-scientific considerations which surround and inform the research work , thereby making it meaningful .
Such general common sense and other considerations are part of the context that makes any kind of research activity understandable , useful and somehow applicable to life and society .
Yet when fore - conceptions are held too rigidly in the face of testimonies , claims and even facts , knowledge suffers .
To put aside traditional ideas that support standard scientific method and open oneself up to new conceptions , however imprecise , irrelevant or unproven at first , is a prerequisite to scientific progress in beginning to understand some of the many and huge ' blank areas ' in scientific knowledge .
Too rigid preconceptions lead to wrong pre-judgements ( that is , mental prejudices ) .
Instead of trying to detract from the ideas of challengers , the attitude of adding to them in a spirit of mutual investigation should be preferred .
New insights can arise from the synthesis of an uninterrupted exchange of views in the spirit of Socratic dialogue .
Yet this is very seldom actually exhibited convincingly in public or in scientific conferences by the supporters of science .
In the arid situation left by the rise of scientism and the corresponding decline of original philosophy , many scientists fall back on common sense as their world - view .
While positivism and neo-positivism failed dismally to provide any consistent philosophy to underpin scientific physicalism , common sense has been elevated to the level of philosophy since G.E. Moore , at last in the view of some thinkers .
We often have to rely on common sense in life , which means on the evidence of the senses , usually in so far as this is experienced commonly .
Learning common sense is a necessary part of life because it ensures that we share the perceptions of others and learn to benefit from ordinary people 's experience .
Scientific investigation , which starts from common sense naturalism , arrives back at a contrary conclusion : we cannot trust our senses to tell us the true nature of reality .
This is still also where the physical sciences of today meet their final limits in the attempt to establish the truth by physical experimentation .
Their outgoing search for reality reveals the emptiness of physical appearances and eventually dissolves the very belief that reality is nothing but physical nature .
Science brings its followers to the limits of the materialistic fallacy , and philosophical insight must begin all over again .
What is the truth of reality is clearly not only a scientific concern , but also a philosophical challenge .
The solution can never be a matter of bigger research budgets , more sophisticated instruments or better - trained brains .
Lacking the capability of giving authoritative leadership on ethical issues or the broadest and deepest of intellectual questions , science must relinquish its self - appointed role as sole custodian of truth to a more universal and inclusive understanding .
Reason obviously cannot be limited strictly to what is already accepted as known .
That would mean also sticking to any false ideas and assumptions that may have been involved all along .
The idea of truth has now commonly been reduced to whatever is observable .
But what can not be observed would then have to be false .
Reason does not even go against truth when it invents or imagines what is not observable , because this is the way almost all knowledge progresses ... even science tries to predict what will be .
The making of the atomic bomb alone shows the crucial role of reason in creating new observables ... the vast explosion in the atmosphere , the mushroom cloud , radioactive fallout .
That reason as used in science is only very successful under limited conditions , such as in experimental set -ups , does not reduce its importance or validity , but simply indicates the existing limits of what is known and on the capacity of how much can be encompassed .
Einstein 's famous breakthrough was one of reason advancing well beyond the facts , one which rejected accepted facts but took account of certain other facts as its premises .
It 's essence was a pure form of reason , the mathematical .
It took long for scientists to catch up with its new ideas , even theoretically , and it was even longer before instruments were developed for the sort of observation that made relativity testable by crucial experiments .
Much the same is true of most seminal advances in science nowadays .
Yet the great mass of scientific work is - by comparison - plodding empirical mental footwork , such as collecting and collating fact after fact , all governed by major ' established ' theories over which the individual scientist has no real influence except in rare instances .
It is reason alone that enables one to distinguish , isolate , describe , compare and organise observations .
It can invent practical methods of behaviour and effective decision - making .
Reason also goes well beyond this in analysing , comparing and applying values , developing rational norms of behaviour , even as far as evaluating the scope and validity of entire world - views and in regulating and synthesising the entire understanding .
When reasoning is extended well beyond analytic tasks towards such very large - scale synthetic operations , it is famously prone to error , which is why scientists are supposed to be very cautious about broad generalisations and world - views .
Nonetheless , the demands of life require that such embracing evaluations be made and far - reaching policies be formed .
This surely calls for a discipline which would help to guide and regulate such extended reason with a scope that goes far beyond what science can inform about .
Only thought which combines the ideal philosophical approach of stringent consistency with wide comparative study and properly self - reflected legitimacy is in a position to evaluate the sciences , their assumptions , methods , consequences for human principles and morality .
The sciences , however , can cast no light upon strict philosophy , for such makes no physical - empirical claims of itself .
No observation can prove or disprove the truths of what can be called ' genuine philosophy ' , which aims less at facts or theories than at supra-factual or holistic insights arising in very wide - ranging forms of understanding .
Such meta - science both monitors the sciences and go beyond their epistemological limitations .
Unfortunately , though , philosophers have increasingly withdrawn from their rightful task of developing a truly critical philosophy of science , one rooted not only in methodological technicality but also in human values and concern for continuous examination of the role of science in civilisation .
The more advanced forms of philosophy of science and meta- scientific research can help one fix the actual limitations of the scientific mentality in each of the major fields of research .
It is held that science is so vast that no - one can have a complete overview of its scope in general review of its principles and practices through the ages and throughout the modern world .
I found that this applies only to sub- theories , applications and the host of empirical details of science , so that an overview is attainable .
By growth of understanding within a variety of model scientific fields combined with intellectual intuition it is possible to comprehend the multiplicity of scientific theories as necessarily - limited products of one type of mentality or approach to reality .
The approach of holistic understanding is limited to no theory and differs qualitatively from scientific method .
It is , and always has been , an essential in the further understanding of the nature of humanity and the cosmos .
This is not strict scientific understanding because it is not reproducible in experimental studies .
Even in strict science , reproducibility is often falsely claimed .
The requirement of scientific method ( i.e. hypothetical - deductive ) is that research findings can be reproduced by independent researchers .
Most medical research is natural scientific , but well - regarded medical findings often fall short on reproducibility .
In several scientific areas by some estimates , from about 50%— 90 % of published papers are based on studies and experiments showing results that cannot be reproduced .
In psychology , a worst case , the University of Virginia repeated 100 psychological experiments of which only 40 % were reproduced .
SCIENTISTIC CERTAINTY OR INTELLECTUAL TOLERANCE ?
All the foregoing calls for increased vigilance to ensure an attitude of tolerance by scientists towards others ' views .
As often in the past , future events may prove that other traditions than those accepted in science have been right where science was mistaken , have held the more fruitful hypotheses and have had more beneficial effects for humankind .
Anyone who has spent a few decades among academics and researchers will know that radical changes of opinion are almost unheard - of and public admissions of error hardly ever take place .
Reason and even evidence are often given a second - place to prestige .
Thus , it is not surprising that the Nobel laureate and great physicist Max Planck said , " A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light , but rather because its opponents eventually die , and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it . "
This is surely true in some respects , but even this generalisation is surely too sweeping , which illustrates our point about scientists often being just as fallible as other human beings .
When hypotheses based on perceptions and ideas that conflict with accepted wisdom or undermine dearly - held theories do achieve proper peer evaluation and experimental testing , there is often what seems an almost inherent tendency still to observe in accordance with the mental constructs one already holds about the whole state of affairs .
Where very delicate experiments are required , often dealing in their initial developmental stages with very weak or barely perceptible changes , the slightest preconceived bias can weight the scales .
Such appears to have occurred with many of the control experiments on cold fusion , as introduced by Fleischman and Ponds , quite apart from the blatant political - financial opposition by those scientists whose interests are threatened by such a discovery .
There is a very powerful tendency to black - or - white thinking when scientists are confronted by reported facts that originate from outside the scientific sphere , especially from philosophy or religion .
Most events that are rhetorically classed as ' psychic phenomena ' or the like are not approached open - mindedly , however many otherwise reliable persons can attest to them .
Pronouncements are nonetheless made about them by scientific pundits , working on the flimsiest of indirect evidence and the heaviest of prejudicial bias with quite irrelevant ' explanations ' .
The idea that differing versions of the truth can be equally valid is not much liked by scientists , lawyers or logically - minded philosophers and theologians .
It smacks of relativism and even solipsism .
Their basic view is that ' truth ' must be the same for everyone .
Rational philosophy holds sacrosanct the principle that an assertion must either be true or not true .
There can be no ' in - betweens ' , no relative truths , nothing that is true for you but not for me .
The water that feels chill to me and warm to you must have its fixed , objectively - measurable temperature .
Since at least the time of Socrates one has held very good reasons for this too , for otherwise we could say that almost anything could be true , dependent on taste or whim .
This sort of objective measure is what science wishes to apply to everything and even , paradoxically , to subjective experience , which will be discussed later as being a largely futile and mistaken aim .
An attitude that assumes there can be but one true account of any subject would seem to obviate any radical kind of tolerance towards differing views or incompatible versions of the cosmos and human life .
Such a rigid view breaks down when one understand that and how different but entirely incompatible systems of thought can account just as adequately as one another for the same phenomena , as in the way that many languages can describe the same things by different words and syntaxes .
As soon as we pass from questions of fact to questions of value , there are even clearer grounds for tolerance of others ' views .
Science never can itself answer any moral questions , for its hypothetical - deductive experimental method can never provide any measures of good or ill , nor test what is right or wrong ( i.e of whether one ought or ought not act in some given way ) .
At best it can only provide evidence to help decide factual questions ( i.e. whether something is the case [ true ] - or contrariwise [ false ] ) .
Remaining as neutral as possible on all matters of values ( i.e. of right or wrong ) , so the ' truth ' or rightness in any ethical issue will always remain outside the competence of science as we know it .
Tolerance of the views of others implies that one respects holders of views one does not accept or like and one is not aggressively critical .
Unfortunately , there are self - appointed defenders of science in various societies of sceptics and rationalists who shun no verbal means of attacking others viewpoints , especially religious tenets , even to the extent of trying to blacken the character of persons holding .
Representatives of these groups are unfortunately given press and world media coverage far beyond any justification that their own work might provide .
Perceptions and insights that arise in transcendental modes of consciousness that various philosophers through the ages have experienced , often in contemplation or ' inspired ' meditation , are still discredited at virtually every official institution of so - called higher learning .
Right enough , one may argue that these are really ineffable experiences and beyond the comprehension of the logical and even the rational mind and do not belong to the realm of worldly education .
Nonetheless , rejection by persons without such experience , or without any kind of controlled investigation , of what actually is experiencable speaks more of intellectual insecurity than understanding .
The love of wisdom rather than merely of knowledge still exists peripherally among Western intellectuals .
This requires that one moves beyond the technical , logico- rational mentality to a value - sensitive and ethically - based holistic approach .
Traditionally , attaining wisdom more or less meant gradually learning to know the self through insight gained by living experience into its multifarous nature .
Moreover , such understanding is not some theory divorced from one 's activities and lifestyle , one actually takes the consequences of what one learns by applying the ideals of unity and wholeness in practice to daily living .
When such character developing understanding as this occurs today , it is hardly ever thanks to our educational systems , more likely despite them .
If self - knowledge has ever been part of a university 's agenda , which I must doubt , everything certainly bends in the other direction today .
The slogan ' know thyself ' receives much formal academic lip - service but is ignored in actual life .
Understanding is not necessatily knowing the truth of a matter , but of reaching out to include all relevant issues however far research has or has not advanced therein .
It is a means of comprehension , bringing together often disparate , even contradictory and paraxdoxical viewpoints so as to discover how wider sense can be made of a theory and the issues it engenders .
( Update : ) I was formerly for some considerable time very concerned about the denial of the existence of the self in the sense of a personal I .
It is ignored or disbelieved - certainly by most natural scientists - to the extent that even serious discussion of the matter cannot get anywhere ( apart from in isolated theological seminars ) .
One may have a panoramic tour of second - hand ideas about it , from Socrates onwards , the inertia of which reiterated beliefs are extremely difficult and tortous to navigate .
In the humanities , very many accept - whether implicity or outright - the validity of ideas like ego bing distinct from true selfhood .
Such confusions I have come to be based on an inadequate investigation of the ideas of self as a fixed , unchanging identity ( or soul ) .
The term sould had , indeed , no empirical or clear inward phenomenal datum .
This can be appreciated by reading the works of Baggini .
Wholly oriented towards investigating and changing the material world , science rejects practical self - understanding and personal experience , which is almost unavoidable due to its exact methods and its necessary criteria of validity .
Unrepeatable situations and experiences are beyond generalising methodology and are relegated to the category of ' anecdote ' .
Hence , science is very largely incapable of investigating , understanding or dealing with human purposes , such as reactions to innumerable challenges and issues about the meaning of life .
Science relativises values and makes a private matter of them , thereby tending always to undermine them and with various consequences for a moral and good society .
Discovery of new truths about the human psyche and destiny will remain beyond its scope until the extent of ignorance about this is better appreciated and much wrong physicalistic thinking about the constitution of the human being is more widely discredited .
One hope for the future is promising , the advances in neurological technology and the research into the human mind it is developing .
If science is to develop beyond the study of physical reality by physical means - and chiefly for material and economic ends - the crisis seems unlikely to be overcome .

Manchester City 's attempts to placate Robinho and keep the most expensive footballer in England happy have failed , with the Brazilian desperate to leave in the January transfer window .
City are aware of his position and , despite strong denials on their mid-season training camp here in the United Arab Emirates , they have reluctantly accepted that the player whose £ 32.5 m transfer was supposed to symbolise the club 's ambitions wants no further part in the revolution .
Fourteen months after breaking the English transfer record to join the club from Real Madrid , Robinho is now so unsettled he has informed his advisers he does not " want another day in Manchester " .
Mark Hughes , the City manager , described the revelation last night as " people making mischief " but , behind the scenes , he has known for a long time that Robinho is disaffected and , grudgingly , the club have started the search for a possible replacement .
Angel Di María of Benfica has been identified among the leading candidates and has a £ 27 m buyout clause in his contract .
The question now seems to be when , rather than if , Robinho leaves .
Hughes is keen not to lose such a talented player in the middle of the season but , if the Brazilian has his way , he will move at the earliest opportunity .
That will be a major disappointment to a club of City 's aspirations , with Hughes stating recently that they were " not in the business of selling our best players " , but the manager may have contributed to Robinho 's unhappiness by disbanding the small but influential group of Brazilian players that he regarded as cliquish and undermining his authority .
Elano Blumer , who was regarded as a troublemaker , was sold to Galatasaray in the summer while Jô was loaned to Everton and Glauber Berti also left the club .
That , however , has left Robinho feeling isolated and not enjoying the experience of being in Manchester , a city he has struggled to embrace .
His wife , Vivian , is also unhappy in England , neither of them having learned the language and both disliking the climate .
Their problems even extend to moving house because of a dispute with their neighbours over them playing Brazilian music .
City 's official position is that they have not spoken to Barcelona and have no intention to do so .
Nonetheless , they do not consider Robinho indispensable when they have Craig Bellamy and Martin Petrov to play the same position on the left side of attack , and particularly when they know that the Brazilian is not fully committed to being a part of the club 's future .
One idea is that a player - plus - cash exchange could be arranged that would see Yaya Touré join his brother Kolo at Eastlands , although the midfielder 's agent , Dmitri Seluk , said that his client would go to a " more important club " .
In which case Barcelona would have to find in the region of £ 30 m either in January or at the end of the season .
From City 's perspective , however , it is not a question of finance , but of what it would say for their ability to handle players of Robinho 's profile .
Garry Cook , the executive chairman , said " categorically " there was no plan to sell the player and Hughes added : " I am quite clear and Robinho should be quite clear that his future is very much with City .
There is no reason to think that will change any time soon .
These stories do not originate from anyone from City . "
Robinho , nonetheless , has made no secret of his desire to move to Barcelona , frequently speaking to the Spanish press about what he described his " dream " – the same word Cristiano Ronaldo used when talking about his intention to leave Manchester United for Real Madrid .
Robinho 's form since joining City last September has been exhilarating at times , but there have also been other periods when his attitude has come into question and there have also been various off - field issues .
He was arrested on suspicion of rape after an incident at a Leeds nightclub earlier this year and , though he was never charged , the possibility of a court case was hanging over him for five months – something , he feels , that contributed to his loss of form and that has influenced his views on life in England .
He has not established a strong relationship with City 's management either , and there was a point last season when Hughes and his coaching staff were debating whether they should try to sell him anyway , the idea being that he could be used as the bait in an exchange for Franck Ribéry of Bayern Munich .
Ribéry , however , was not tempted by the idea .
1 St. Louis Rams
The Rams have lost 16 consecutive games and 33 of the past 38 .
Through the first seven games of the season they have been outscored 211-60 .
Without question , this team is the worst of the worst .
2 Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Thanks to the Bucs , England now wants nothing to do with the NFL .
After being pummeled 35 - 7 by the Patriots yesterday , Raheem Morris is searching for answers .
Perhaps Garrett Morris should have been hired as the head coach .
He is still alive you know .
No , really he is …just check for yourself .
3 Tennessee Titans
It ’s almost unfathomable that the Titans have gone from the penthouse ( 13 - 3 ) to the outhouse ( 0 - 6 ) so quickly .
A very beatable Jacksonville Jaguars team comes to town next week and Tennessee needs to find a way to get into the win column .
4 Cleveland Browns
Only victory of the season came against the Bills and quarterback Derek Anderson completed two of seventeen passes for 23 yards in the game .
Anderson was only slightly better against the Packers yesterday and the Browns were annihilated 31 - 3 .
5 Kansas City Chiefs
The Chiefs lost at home by thirty points to the San Diego Chargers yesterday and the game was n’t even that close .
Matt Cassel , the $ 60 million dollar man , threw three picks and managed only 97 passing yards against a very suspect secondary .
Larry Johnson ripped head coach Todd Haley on Twitter after the game and the asylum ’s inmates are starting to get restless .
The current odds on a Johnson / Haley fistfight between now and the end of the year currently stand at 4:1 .
6 Oakland Raiders
When the Raiders defeated Philadelphia last week , it looked like the proverbial corner had been turned .
Um , not so much .
After three early turnovers , Tom Cable benched JaDreadful Russell and Oakland was shutout by the Jets yesterday 38 - 0 .
On second thought , Richard Seymour , perhaps the Raiders wo n’t be playoff bound after all .
7 Washington Redskins
B -6…I - 17…N-26…G-39…O-47 … I said O - 47 !
Can ex-bingo caller Sherm Lewis make a difference in D.C. ?
Absolutely not .
Daniel Snyder , Jim Zorn and the Skins are an absolute embarrassment .
8 Detroit Lions
Although the Carolina Panthers are knocking at the door , the 1 - 6 Lions have earned the final spot in this week ’s Egregious 8 .
It could be short lived though as a victory over the Rams next week should enable Detroit to climb back to semi-respectability .
The ghost of Matt Millen still haunts Ford Field but there is genuine hope for the future .

My former butler Mike Woycheck brought this to my attention :
And what with all the fake Luke Ravenstahl accounts out there on twitter , I went straight to the Dread Lord for confirmation that it is in fact the REAL Hizzoner Master Lukey BabyFace Steelerstahl .
And the Dread Lord confirmed it is so .
I also asked the Dread Lord if Lukey would actually be doing the twittering , and not just having his staff do it for him .
And the Dread Lord said the Mayor does plan to do his own tweeting .
And then I asked the Dread Lord if he had eaten any souls lately .
Still waiting to hear back .
A woman who was attacked by a 200 - pound chimpanzee revealed her heavily disfigured face on television last night , saying she is blind and has to eat through a straw , but is n't angry .
" I do n't even think about it , " Charla Nash said on The Oprah Winfrey Show .
" And there 's no time for that anyways because I need to heal , you know , not look backwards . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Winfrey removed Ms Nash 's hat and veil to reveal her face , which was swollen and damaged beyond recognition .
She had a large scar near the bottom of her face and a large piece of skin where her nose had been .
The February 16 attack occurred when the animal 's owner , Sandra Herold , asked Ms Nash , her friend and employee , to help lure the animal back into her house in Stamford , Connecticut .
The chimpanzee ripped off Ms Nash 's hands , nose , lips and eyelids .
Police shot and killed the animal .
Ms Nash has been in hospital since .
She remains in stable condition at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio .
Ms Nash said she did n't remember anything from the attack and does n't want to .
" I want to get healthy , " she said .
" I do n't want to wake up with nightmares . "
In a telephone interview last night with The Associated Press , Ms Nash said she repeatedly warned Ms Herold that the primate was dangerous and could hurt someone .
Ms Nash said she saw the chimpanzee throw large objects around his cage , including a desk and 55 - gallon plastic drum .
She said she saw him flash his teeth and pound the bars of the cage so violently his hands would bleed .
" They had to weld the cage because he was starting to break out from hitting it so much , " Ms Nash said .
Another time Ms Herold told workers at her house they had to leave because Travis was misbehaving , Ms Nash said .

Ms Nash said she was afraid of Travis , who was typically locked in his cage when she saw him .
Ms Nash said she told Ms Herold eight or 10 times he was dangerous .
" I always told her you have to get rid of him , he 's going to hurt somebody someday .
He 's too dangerous , " Ms Nash said .
" You can't control him , and he 's going to hurt somebody . "
Ms Nash , who occasionally fed Travis oatmeal in his cage , said she told Ms Herold that Travis did not have enough room to run around and she should give him up .
" Sandy would say , ' I know , but it 's hard , " ' explaining that she believed if she gave him up , he would not get the same level of care she provided .
Ms Herold had black and blue marks from Travis , but she would say they were from playing around with him , Ms Nash said .
Asked about Ms Herold , Ms Nash said , " I feel like I 've been thrown under a bus " since the attack happened and legal proceedings began .
Ms Herold 's attorney , Robert Golger , provided AP with a statement , saying Ms Herold wishes Ms Nash the best .
" All of Sandy 's hopes and prayers are with Charla and her daughter in this challenging time , " the statement read .
" Sandy hopes and prays for a full and speedy recovery . "
Ms Nash 's family has filed a £ 30 million lawsuit against Ms Herold , saying she was negligent and reckless for lacking the ability to control " a wild animal with violent propensities . "
Ms Herold 's attorney has argued the attack was work - related and the case should be treated as a workers ' compensation claim .
Ms Nash denied she was Ms Herold 's employee .
Ms Nash 's family filed notice with Connecticut 's Office of Claims Commissioner this month , asking for permission to sue the state for £ 100 million , saying officials failed to prevent the attack .
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has said his office is reviewing the claim .
Ms Herold owned the 14 - year - old chimp nearly all its life .
When he was younger , Travis starred in TV commercials and took part in a television pilot .
A state biologist had warned Connecticut officials that the chimp could hurt someone .
The animal had the anti-anxiety drug Xanax in its system , according to toxicology tests , but investigators do n't know whether the drug played a role in the attack .
Ms Nash told Winfrey she is not in pain but can't breathe through her nose and has to eat through a straw .
She said she does n't touch her face often .
" I know that I have my forehead , " Ms Nash said .
" It feels like just patches of tape or gauze or covering , covering my face . "
It was n't until a couple of weeks ago , when an eye doctor told Ms Nash she no longer had eyes , that she realised she would never see again , she said .
Ms Nash said she does n't ask many questions about her injuries .
" It 's like less for me to worry about if I do n't know , " she said .
Ms Nash said the animal had once ripped out a hunk of her hair and grabbed her arm a few times .
" You could feel the strength he had , " she told AP .
Ms Nash said she wants to warn people about potential dangers posed by exotic animals .
" I 'd like to put across to people 's minds that these exotic animals are very dangerous and they should n't be around , " Ms Nash said on Winfrey 's show .
" There 's a place for them that is not in residential areas . "
Even if she is n't feeling well , Ms Nash said she pushes herself to go for a walk during the day .
She wears a veil so she does n't scare people and to avoid insults .
" I'm the same person I 've always been , " she said .
" I just look different . "
Traditionally it was employers who had to make themselves visible when looking to fill vacancies – posting adverts in the press , then choosing a pool of candidates from a veritable tsunami of applicants .
But not any more .
There 's mounting evidence that personnel specialists are now scouring social media sites and job boards for potential employees .
" Recruitment departments are starting to dabble with professional networking and other forms of social media to headhunt potential candidates , " says Teresa Sperti of The IT Job Board .
Microsoft recruiter Declan Fitzgerald claims that he saved £ 60,000 in recruitment fees by sourcing nine programming posts through professional networking site Linked In instead of using traditional channels .
That 's all good news if you 're currently looking for a job in IT .
What better way to ply your wares than on the web , where you can track down the right people and demonstrate your expertise direct ?
If you 're wondering how to draw attention to yourself in the right way on social - media sites , help is at hand .
We 've put together a comprehensive action plan for you to follow :
10 expert tips on using social media to get the job you want
Step 1 : Set up multiple accounts
The first rule of successful professional networking is to keep business and pleasure strictly separate .
Multiple social networking accounts will help you to present your best face to recruiters .
The first and easiest strategy is to use business oriented networks like LinkedIn , BrightFuse and Naymz for work while reserving MySpace and LiveJournal for mates .
FRIENDFEED :
You can update and manage multiple social media accounts via FriendFeed
However , with Facebook and Twitter accounting for the lion 's share of media attention and internet traffic , that approach will exclude access to a lot of influential contacts .
Setting up two separate accounts for friends and business on these networks will enable you to compartmentalise your image .
To stop all these accounts getting out of control , use tools that are capable of managing more than one account .
Both TweetDeck and Twhirl let you post to more than one Twitter account without the need to continuously log in and out .
Seesmic Desktop does the same job , and it handily also allows you to update your Facebook status at the same time .
Step 2 : Use Facebook 's privacy settings
While it 's good practice to create business profiles on business - oriented social networks , Facebook is the undisputed hub of the net 's social activity .
So , here 's an alternative to multiple profiles : tweak Facebook 's privacy settings so that work contacts are n't able to see any of your friends ' pictures of your latest debauched night on the town .
Click ' Friends ' on the main menu bar in Facebook and then click '+ Create ' in the Lists section of the sidebar .
Call this list ' Work ' .
You 'll be given the option to add existing friends to this list .
Create a second list called ' Mates ' .
Once created , you can add anyone who requests friendship to either list .
To make people on your Work list see a professional looking profile , go to ' Settings | Privacy | Profile ' .
The options here allow you to choose exactly who sees what .
As an example , let 's say you only want people on your Mates list to see your photos .
Click on ' Edit photo album settings ' , choose an album and make sure only your friends can see it .
Then in the ' Except these people ' box , type in ' Work ' .
Now you 'll be able to share all the amusing photos you want to with your mates , safe in the knowledge that the people on your ' Work ' list can't see what you get up to after hours .
Step 3 : Be careful what you say
Separating your work and personal lives is only one part of the process of creating a professional image for yourself online – a technique named ' personal branding ' .
You need to present a ' best version ' of yourself using the whole range of social - media tools available .
" My key Twitter advice to BBC colleagues ( is ) do n't say anything you would n't say on air , " BBC Technology Correspondent Rory Cellan Jones recently tweeted .
WATCH YOUR WORDS :
It 's easy to tap out a poorly judged message in the heat of the moment , but it 's much harder to delete the evidence
That advice holds true whether you 're blogging , tweeting or changing a public Facebook status update .
" It is very easy to build your reputation and credibility using social media .
Unfortunately , it 's just as easy to damage it irrevocably by being careless and whimsical in its use , " says Judith Germain , Managing Director of leadership consultancy Dynamic Transitions .
" One thing to remember is that everything that you do on the web is permanent , even in ' closed ' networks . "
The website Tweleted and the Google cache mean that even deleted posts can be easily found .
So think for a second before pressing that ' Update ' button .
And if you do find yourself participating in an argument , make sure you 're polite – or just anonymous .
Step 4 : Promote your expertise
Another important part of the personal branding strategy is establishing yourself as an expert in a particular fi eld or subject .
Social - media sites offer plenty of opportunities to promote yourself as a leading light in your area .
" Align yourself with good content and share it with others by answering difficult IT questions on user forums and social networks , " advises Judith Germain .
LinkedIn's Answers application is a great place to put this into practice .
Browse through questions that other Linked In members have posted in your area of expertise or search by keyword .
The more good - quality answers you provide , the more visible you become .
If you 're willing to invest more time , consider joining Experts Exchange , a site where people post IT - related queries .
Join as a volunteer and accrue points towards ' expert ' status through providing solutions .
Step 5 : Do n't be a spammer
Blog articles with titles like ' 10 Reasons I 'll Un- follow You on Twitter ' cite aggressive self - promotion as the fastest route to lose friends and alienate people , so avoid things like pushing your website with every status update or spamming hashtags with inappropriate information just to get yourself noticed .
The key to keeping followers and impressing recruiters is to balance your activity .
" Engage with your network , " says www.mashable.com contributor Atherton Bartleby .
" Genuine engagement with your followers will ultimately ensure that your mobile number is retained and not ' lost ' at the end of that fabulous party , and it will ensure that you do n't ( too often ) commit any serious faux pas . "
So take part in the conversation on social - media sites – just like you do at real - world networking events .
When you have something useful to share , share it .
Reply to other people , find out about them and make friends .
Let the networking happen organically .
Assistant Professor Mitchell Walker and Graduate Student Logan Williams examine a 10 - kilowatt
Hall effect thruster .
( Georgia Tech Photo : Gary Meek )
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have won a $ 6.5 million grant to develop improved components that will boost the efficiency of electric propulsion systems used to control the positions of satellites and planetary probes .
Focusing on improved cathodes for devices known as Hall effect thrusters , the research would reduce propellant consumption in commercial , government and military satellites , allowing them to remain in orbit longer , be launched on smaller or cheaper rockets , or carry larger payloads .
Sponsored by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Defense Sciences Office ( DARPA - DSO ) , the 18 - month project seeks to demonstrate the use of propellant - less cathodes with Hall effect thrusters .
" About 10 percent of the propellant carried into space on satellites that use an electric propulsion system is essentially wasted in the hollow cathode that is part of the system , " said Mitchell Walker , an assistant professor in Georgia Tech 's School of Aerospace Engineering and the project 's principal investigator .
" Using field emission rather than a hollow cathode , we are able to pull electrons from cathode arrays made from carbon nanotubes without wasting propellant .
That will extend the life of the vehicle by more efficiently using the limited on - board propellant for its intended purpose of propulsion . "
To maintain their positions in space or to reorient themselves , satellites must use small thrusters that are either chemically or electrically powered .
Electrically - powered thrusters use electrons to ionize an inert gas such as xenon .
The resulting ions are then ejected from the device to generate thrust .
In existing Hall effect thrusters , a single high - temperature cathode generates the electrons .
A portion of the propellant — typically about 10 percent of the limited supply carried by the satellite — is used as a working fluid in the traditional hollow cathode .
The DARPA - funded research would replace the hollow cathode with an array of field - effect cathodes fabricated from bundles of multi- walled carbon nanotubes .
Powered by on - board batteries and photovoltaic systems on the satellite , the arrays would operate at low power to produce electrons without consuming propellant .
Walker and collaborators at the Georgia Tech Research Institute ( GTRI ) have already demonstrated field - effect cathodes based on carbon nanotubes .
This work was presented at the 2009 AIAA Joint Propulsion Conference held in Denver , Colo .
The additional funding will support improvements in the devices , known as carbon nanotube cold cathodes , and lead to space testing as early as 2015 .
" This work depends on our ability to grow aligned carbon nanotubes precisely where we want them to be and to exacting dimensions , " ť said Jud Ready , a GTRI senior research engineer and Walker 's collaborator on the project .
" This project leverages our ability to grow well - aligned arrays of nanotubes and to coat them to enhance their field emission performance . "
In addition to reducing propellant consumption , use of carbon nanotube cathode arrays could improve reliability by replacing the single cathode now used in the thrusters .
" Existing cathodes are sensitive to contamination , damaged by the ionized exhaust of the thruster , and have limited life due to their high - temperature operation , " Ready noted .
" The carbon nanotube cathode arrays would provide a distributed cathode around the Hall effect thruster so that if one of them is damaged , we will have redundancy . "
Before the carbon nanotube cathodes developed by Georgia Tech can be used on satellites , however , their lifetime will have to be increased to match that of a satellite thruster , which is typically 2,000 hours or more .
The devices will also have to withstand the mechanical stresses of space launches , turn on and off rapidly , operate consistently and survive the aggressive space environment .
Part of the effort will focus on special coating materials used to protect the carbon nanotubes from the space environment .
For that part of the project , Walker and Ready are collaborating with Lisa Pfefferle in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Yale University .
The researchers are testing their cathodes with the same Busek Hall effect thruster that flew on the U.S. Air Force 's TacSat - 2 satellite .
In addition , the cathodes will be operated with Hall effect thrusters developed by Pratt & Whitney and donated to Georgia Tech .
The researchers are also collaborating with L - 3 ETI on the electrical power system and with American Pacific In - Space Propulsion on flight qualification of the hardware .
The ability to control individual cathodes on the array could provide a new capability to vector the thrust , potentially replacing the mechanical gimbals now used .
The use of carbon nanotubes to generate electrons through the field - effect process was reported in 1995 by a research team headed by Walt de Heer , a professor in Georgia Tech 's School of Physics .
Field emission is the extraction of electrons from a conductive material through quantum tunneling that occurs when an external electric field is applied .
The improved carbon nanotube cathodes should advance the goals of reducing the cost of launching and maintaining satellites .
" Thrust with less propellant has been one of the major goals driving research into satellite propulsion , " ť said Walker , who is director of Georgia Tech 's High - Power Electric Propulsion Laboratory .
" Electric propulsion is becoming more popular and will benefit from our innovation .
Ultimately , we will help improve the performance of in - space propulsion devices . "

SEATTLE  A former Sierra Club leader who rode his bicycle to campaign events and relied heavily on volunteer support claimed a narrow and surprising victory on Monday in the race for mayor of this environmentally friendly city .
“ You cared , you believed , and we ’ve got a lot more work to do , ” Mike McGinn told supporters after the city ’s mail - in election showed him winning 51 percent of the vote , by a margin of 4,939 votes out of about 190,000 cast in the mayor ’s race .
He was met by the same chant he heard on the campaign trail : “ We like Mike ! ”
His opponent had conceded a few minutes earlier .

When persons being held as slaves were accused by their masters of insubordination , or of eating more than their allotment of food , they might expect to be fitted with an iron muzzle .
In his autobiography , Olaudah Equiano described his first encounter with such a device in the mid-1700s .
. .
" I had seen a black woman slave as I came through the house , who was cooking the dinner , and the poor creature was cruelly loaded with various kinds of iron machines ; she had one particularly on her head , which locked her mouth so fast that she could scarcely speak , and could not eat or drink .
I [ was ] much astonished and shocked at this contrivance , which I afterwards learned was called the iron muzzle . "

Wow .
Via : The Plain Dealer :
InkStop Inc. , a specialty retailer of ink , toner , consumer electronics and other supplies for small businesses and home offices , abruptly told its employees that it was shuttering all 152 stores nationwide as of Friday and laying off all workers until further notice .
“ The company has elected to temporarily close all stores at the close of business today , Oct. 1 , to focus on a restructuring plan in an effort to improve the overall operations of the organization , ” the Warrensville Heights company told employees in a letter sent late Thursday .
“ Paychecks will not be issued on Friday due to our cash constraints .
We are working on a plan to improve our cash flow situation and reopen under better circumstances . ”
The letter , signed by the Inkstop board of directors , went on to say that medical coverage and other insurance had been paid only through Aug. 31 .
“ Your patience during this difficult time is appreciated , ” it said .
That means not only will employees not be paid for the past two weeks , but they will also be financially responsible for their medical benefits since Sept.
1 .
“ We all knew the hammer was going to come down .
We just did n’t think it would happen in one day , ” Linda Mastellone , an assistant store manager at InkStop in Newtown , Pa. , said via e-mail .
“ We all saw that the lack of ink [ the main reason for the store ’s existence ] was a big sign that the company clearly did n’t have the capital to purchase product .
“ The company has been doing poorly since I came aboard in August , ” she said .
“ I frankly could n’t see how they were still in business .
We did n’t have much ink / toner , and we could n’t order stock that we usually kept on the shelves . ”
According to its profile page on LinkedIn.com , InkStop operates 152 stores in 14 states , including 14 stores in Northeast Ohio .
“ We are on track to have over 200 stores opened by the end of 2010 , ” it said .

The video shows a teenager basically entering dementia after playing COD 6 for 17 hours straight with no sleep .
Although its quite amusing to watch , it does give insight into a growing trend of obsession .
My friend recently purchased COD 6 the morning of its release and has already logged an impressive amount of playing hours .
Much of his playing time though is done after homework and before bed .
Today I was talking to him about it and he said that he has much trouble sleeping after this , and that even when he does sleep , his dreams are adrenaline pumping recounts of him playing , which cause him to wake up constantly in the middle of the night .
At first I laughed at his problem , but then I did some research :
A 2007 study done at the German Sport University Cologne showed that after playing video games before bed , teenagers took longer to fall asleep , spent less time in slow - wave sleep — the type that helps a person form factual memories – and spent more time in stage 2 non-REM sleep – the stage of sleep first crops up right after the initial , “ drifting - off ” phase of sleep , and precedes deep , slow - wave sleep .
A study that was presented this week at SLEEP 2009 in Seattle , Wash . , reported that excessive video - game playing can interfere with your sleep .
It would be interesting to see if there was some kind of scientific parallel between coffee drinking and video game playing before bed …
Thankfully I stopped playing my ps2 three years ago

The BIXI system is coming to Toronto – and I can hardly contain my excitement .
If you have n’t already heard , BIXI is Montreal ’s bicycle - sharing program which was inaugurated on May 11th , 2009 .
It cost $ 15 million dollars to start and began with 300 stations around downtown Montreal with 3000 bicycles for rent .
The system was expanded by the end of the summer to 5000 bicycles at 400 stations .
To rent a bicycle , you simply insert your credit card into the solar - powered station to purchase a membership – at a cost of $ 5 / day , $ 28 / month or $ 78 / year .
You are then entitled to use the bicycle for free as long as you return the bicycle to another station within 30 minutes .
This enables the system to support a high capacity of users on short trips around the city .
After a successful launch in Montreal last May , BIXI has served more than 1 million users – an amazing accomplishment for its first year .
The system is however shutting down now as Montreal prepares for the ensuing winter .
On November 1st , BIXI started taking down the less frequently used stations and BIXI rentals will no longer be available after November 30th – making its triumphant return in May 2010 .
But fear not Torontonians – I have been told the BIXI system in Toronto will have no such restrictions !
The city plans to keep Toronto ’s BIXI system open all - year - round !
A detail that has previously not been released and I had to pry out of City Hall .
A recent article on BIXI in Toronto by Walrus Magazine re-ignited my BIXI nostalgia .
You see , I had tested out the BIXI system in Montreal in July for 4 days and although the system is n’t perfect , I was amazed at the possibilities it has for cycling culture in Toronto .
The City of Toronto had indicated it would release more details in Fall 2009 in its May 26th Staff Report – but these details have yet to be released .
The Walrus Magazine article unfortunately left me with more questions than it had answered , so I began my own quest to get more information on a BIXI system for Toronto .
Bixi will be implemented at no cost to the city
To address my long list of questions , I started some digging at City Hall to get some more details on how a BIXI system in Toronto will look .
Although the city is keeping the official details under wraps until the final agreement has been approved by council , I was able to get some information from Sean Wheldrake – the Bicycle Promotions Coordinator at City Hall – who was referred to me by Daniel Egan ( Manager Pedestrian and Cycling Infrastructure ) .
Sean explained that the city is still in negotiations , but the plan is to move forward with Public Bicycle System Company ( operator of BIXI ) to run Toronto ’s BIXI system at absolutely no cost to the city .
And despite talk of the possibility of using advertising to fund the system , Sean confirmed there will be no advertising used to fund the BIXI system .
Sean also confirmed that the plan is to implement 300 stations scattered around downtown Toronto with 3,000 bicycles to start ( the 1,000 number quoted in the Walrus ’ article was indeed incorrect ) .
Walrus was correct however in its assertion that the boundaries for the Toronto BIXI system will be roughly High Park in the West , Broadview Ave. in the east , Bloor St. in the north and Lake Ontario in the south .
Once the agreement is approved , all the city has to do is provide the locations of the BIXI stations , and the Public Bicycle System Company will handle the rest .
“ On - street parking is not a priority ”
Next I wanted to find out what the impact would be on car lanes and parking .
As you may know , Montreal turned dozens of parking spaces into BIXI stations – a point of contention amongst Montreal drivers .
Perhaps not surprisingly , the city does n’t want to head down the path of taking parking space away from drivers .
“ On - street parking is not a priority ” , Wheldrake said .
It makes sense that the city is trying to avoid possible confrontation with certain media outlets in our city that are opposed to cycling culture because they see it as a threat to driving in the city .
I however , see cycling as a benefit to drivers because it can help reduce congestion by getting people out of their cars .
Sean admitted that it will be a challenge to find space for the BIXI stations , but he is optimistic that this can be addressed given the easy mobility of the solar - powered BIXI stations that require no excavation .
Lower Bay Street / Union Station will be a major BIXI hub
The major hubs for BIXI in Toronto will be – as expected – Union station , and taller buildings where tens of thousands of people work .
The idea is that businessmen and women can hop on a bike to head to a meeting instead of taking a taxi ( thankfully the taxi lobby does n’t have a strong voice in our city ) .
I see BIXI benefiting everyone from a GO Train commuter , to a tourist , to a downtown resident , to a student .
The system allows for quick jaunts from point A to point B in short time while reducing pollution and providing exercise .
Although Toronto ’s bicycle infrastructure has a long way to go , increasing the number of cyclists in the city will make cycling safer for everyone and it will put pressure on the city to improve cycling infrastructure in the city .
BIXI is definitely ready for Toronto .
In the coming months we will find out if Toronto is indeed ready for BIXI .
Stay tuned for more updates on Toronto ’s BIXI program as the details become available .
Sean expects that information will become public in December or January .

Researchers at the University of Utah have found a way to see through walls to detect movement inside a building .
The surveillance technique is called variance - based radio tomographic imaging and works by visualizing variations in radio waves as they travel to nodes in a wireless network .
A person moving inside a building will cause the waves to vary in that location , the researchers found , allowing an observer to map their position .
The researchers , electrical engineering graduate student Joey Wilson and his faculty advisor Neil Patwari , have tested the technique with a 34 - node wireless network using the IEEE 802.15.4 wireless protocol , according to the MIT Technology Review .
By " interrogating " the space with signals and multiple receivers , the researchers found they were able to read the waves to detect the location of a moving object within a meter of accuracy .
The technique could be used by SWAT teams trying to determine the location of a sniper or hostages in a building or by first responders looking for signs of life in a building that is too dangerous to enter .
The responders could conceivably launch a series of radio sensors in the direction of a building , deploying them on each side and even on the roof , the researchers say .
Once the nodes begin to transmit , the responders could measure the received signals as they 're transmitted to a base station .
Of course there are privacy and security concerns associated with the technology .
A burglar could use it to detect if anyone is home or to scout the location of security guards .
A few years ago , the Game Show made a huge come back in the misguided forms of such flashes - in - the - pan as , “ Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ” , “ The Weakest Link ” and even “ Dog Eat Dog ” .
But let ’s face it , no Game Shows now - a - days ( see : “ The Power of Ten ” or “ Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader ” ) can even hold a candle to the programs of yore …
* SIGH *.
You can catch many of these that no longer air on the Game Show Network , or , you can obviously watch “ Wheel of Fortune ” and “ Jeopardy ” every single night on CBS ( in many markets ) .
But still , the heyday of the Game Show that really got the crowd and the contestants into its overpowering half - hour life cycle just no longer truly exist .
Yes , “ The Price is Right ” is still on , but ever since the Lord of the Microphone , He Who Shall Be Named Barker , retired , it ’s just not even remotely the same .
Drew Carey can pretty much kiss my ass .
So , all that being said , here is a baker ’s dozen of the finest emcees ever to grace the air - waves !
Survey says : Enjoy !
13 Jim Lange The Dating Game
From 1965 through 1980 , this striking lad hosted the precursor to so many of today ’s related ‘ love ’ interest shows called “ The Dating Game ” .
Basically , three guys or girls would place their very lives on the line for a chance to date the person behind the curtain … hopefully a member of the opposite sex .
Jim here kept the pace flowing and prevented anyone in suitor ’s row from becoming touchy - feely .
12 Peter Tomarken Press Your Luck
“ NO WHAMMIES ! NO WHAMMIES ! ”
Who could possibly forget the catch phrase of “ Press Your Luck ” ?
From 1983 through its transformation and subsequent conclusion in 1986 , Peter Tomarken hosted this masterpiece and , if we were lucky , read to the viewers a Whammy Poem at the end of the show .
What a guy … oh , he also sadly perished in the ever - popular plane crash .
11 Bud Collyer To Tell the Truth
According to our fine pals at Wikipedia : “ In 1956 , Collyer became equally , if not more , familiar as the host of a new Goodson - Todman production , “ To Tell The Truth ” on CBS .
This panel show featured four celebrities questioning three challengers all claiming to be the same person , in a bid to determine which of the three was the person in question , until Collyer intoned the famous phrase , “ Will the real Such - and - So — please … stand up , ” always with the pauses — and the actual person would do precisely that . ”
Oh , and within the same article we get the birth name of this iconic emcee as : Clayton Johnson Heermance , Jr. Holy stinking shit .
10 Bert Convy Win , Lose or Draw
Well remembered for his stint hosting “ Win , Lose , or Draw ” , Convy had done many more shows previously , including : “ What ’s My Line ” , “ Password ” , and “ Tattletales ” .
But , as most of us , I will always remember him sitting with those classic TV stars on those plush couches scribbling nonsensical gibberish on the giant drawing board attempting , frequently in vein , to make sense of the ramblings .
Yeah , and he was good on “ Win , Lose , or Draw ” , too .
HA !
9 Alex Trebek Jeopardy !
Yeah , yeah , I could have found a more recent picture of the “ Jeopardy ” host here , but my heart will always belong to the man and his mustache .
The quiz - master has been in charge of the trivial trios since 1984 and , as it appears right now , will go on emceeing the A. and Q. show until the end of time .
Oh , and this cat ’s real name is this thing right here : Giorgi Suka - Alex Trebek .
That … is something .
8 Richard Dawson Family Feud
This guy right here was quite the huggy fellow and often enfolded the contestants of the “ Family Feud ” in his groping arms .
Yeah , but no one gave a shit since he was the MAN .
From 1976 till 1985 he maintained his stature as “ The Kissing Bandit ” well enough to return for a year ’s stint from 1994 - 1995 after Ray Comb ’s untimely demise .
Dawson was also in “ Hogan ’s Heroes ” and even that Schwartzenegger vehicle , “ The Running Man ” .
He kicks ass .
7 Chuck Barris The Gong Show
Oh Chuck Barris , is there anyone who does n’t want to just kiss you square on your glistening lips ?
Well , I do .
The “ Gong Show ” was a masterful piece of work and ran from 1976 through 1978 and then in syndication for a few years there after .
Despite his minor stage appearances mostly confined to “ Gong ” , Barris is equally well known for his creation and production of many of the best - loved Game Shows of all time .
I ’m too lazy to post a link , but you can check out Wiki for all your Barris needs .
6 Gene Rayburn The Match Game
More from Wiki : “ In 1962 , Rayburn first hosted “ The Match Game ” .
The original version , which aired on NBC , lasted until 1969 .
The show returned to CBS in 1973 with a new format in which contestants had to match celebrity answers to humorous “ fill - in - the - blank ” questions .
Millions tuned in and it soon became the highest - rated show in daytime television history .
From 1973 to 1977 , it was # 1 among all daytime network game shows — three of those years the highest rated in all of daytime — fueled by the zany questions and Rayburn ’s witty style .
His interaction with the panel and contestants and his antics , including breaking through the entrance doors , roller - skating on stage and climbing the audience , made the show a classic . ”
And now continuing with our odd name fellows herein , I give you : Eugene Rubessa ( pronounced [ ruˈbeʃɑ ] ) .
Sweet Marie , what next ?
5 Chuck Woolery Lingo
Had I not married my stunningly gorgeous wife , I was full - on intending to shack up with Chuck Woolery .
I mean just look at this guy ?
He just perspires svelte and weeps machismo .
* SIGH *.
So , Chucky here hosted a pretty wide variety of shows as well including : “ Wheel ” ( 1975 - 1981 ) , ” Love Connection ” ( 1983-1995 ) , “ Scrabble ” ( 1984-1990 , 1993 ) , “ The Home and Family Show ” ( 1996 - 97 , co-host ) , “ The Dating Game ” ( 1997 - 99 update ) , “ Greed ” ( 1999 - 2000 ) and “ Lingo ” ( 2002 - present ) .
Whew , he does get around .
Oh , and I have my bridal gown already picked out .
I mean the dude ’s been married 4 times , I still have a chance , right ?
4 Pat Sajak Wheel of Fortune
Though not the original host of “ Wheel of Fortune ” , Pat has been doing it since 1981 along with his somewhat gracefully - aging letter turner and all - round vegetable , Vanna White .
Pat is a genuinely cool guy who regularly gags with the contestants and honestly seems to care whether or not someone wins the big dollar amount or lands on Bankrupt .
Pat should , in all sincerity , run for president .
Who cares if he is n’t political , I ’d vote for him in a heart beat .
3 Wink Martindale Tic Tac Dough
“ Tic - Tac - Dough ” .
Need I say more ?
OK , how about “ High Rollers ” and “ Trivial Pursuit ” .
Yeah , that did it , did n’t it ?
Great voice , awesome personality , and creator of one of my favorite short - lived Game Shows , “ Bumper Stumpers ” , where the contestants had to decipher license plates .
Oh , and as you might imagine , his name is n’t Wink .
It ’s Winston Conrad Martindale .
I need to change my name , too , now .
Maybe Glee Speakerman .
Cool .
2 Bob Eubanks The Newlywed Game
On and off from 1966 until 2000 , Bob Eubanks hosted the pinnacle of pairs Game Shows , “ The Newlywed Game ” He was , is , and for ever shall be a Game GOD .
In fact , as I understand , when Mr. Eubanks shuffles this mortal coil , God Almighty Himself will hire him on as the Emcee to Heaven .
Lucky for Bob , he ’s not known for cursing or using foul language of any kind and his catch phrase “ Making Whoopee ” has already sealed the Heavenly deal for him .
God going , man !
1 Bob Barker The Price is Right
Never before has one Game Show Host put up with so much from one single show .
Hosting “ The Price is Right ” from 12 BC until his unfortunate and horrendously uncalled for retirement in 2007 , Bob barker has had to endure incredibly fat and large - breasted women attempting to hug him into oblivion , the misguided and outrageously senile elderly meandering on stage before making it clear of Contestant ’s Row , wigged - out college kids making ridiculous bids on automobiles , and all - round idiots making complete asses of themselves as they fail miserably at some of the simplest games in television history .
But all of this is what makes Bob Barker an ageless and timeless hero in the Pantheon of Emcees .
Bob Barker is , quite possibly , the coolest human being alive .

SEAL BEACH–Members of an atheist group that held a social meeting at a local tavern are expressing concerns about being told to take down a sign placed on the table to identify their group , the Seal Beach Atheists .
A group organizer says she wo n’t go back to Hennessey ’s Tavern on Main Street after a manager told the group during a meeting Sunday that customers were complaining about their sign .
“ I think they just wanted to push us out of the bar , ” said assistant group organizer Claire Weaver , 30 , of Huntington Beach .
“ This kind of stuff happens all the time . ”
Managers at Hennessy ’s were not available for comment and Hennessy ’s corporate office said on Tuesday the incident had not been reported to headquarters .
Meetup.com is an online social forum that allows people with various interests to communicate online and organize social gatherings .
The group was formed in April and has 55 members .
Over the summer , they met on the beach but members are now looking for a venue to hold their monthly meetings indoors .
The incident was first reported by a meetup.com group member who wrote about the incident on his blog Deep Thoughts , a blog that promotes “ free thought ” .
Weaver said about 12 people from the group were sitting in a booth at the restaurant and placed a paper sign with one - inch type and a photo of some members on the beach that read , “ Seal Beach Atheist Meetup Group ” .
“ Within two minutes , the manager came over and told us the sign had to go , ” she said .
“ She was n’t rude … but she was n’t understanding either . ”
Weaver said she asked the manager if they would have to take down their sign if they were a Christian or a Muslim group and the manager told the group they would .
“ We doubt very much that she ’d ever be faced with that situation ” Weaver said .
Weaver said until that point , the group was having a nice time at the restaurant , despite some disapproving stares from some customers .
“ All of the employees were really nice , ” she said .
“ The locals were n’t too keen on it . ”
She said the manger did n’t give an exact number but said several customers had complained about their sign .
“ I just do n’t believe anyone is genuinely offended , ” she said .
“ It felt very much like atheist was a dirty word . ”
Weaver , who is married to a Christian , said she feels sometimes people have a misconception about atheism , which she said is a movement defined by not believing in a higher power .
“ I think people are n’t entirely sure what it is , ” she said .
“ People think that if you do n’t have a religion then you ca n’t understand morals .
You can be good without God . ”
She added the meeting was being held , in part , to organize some community outreach projects .
“ The ironic thing is we were talking about ways we could give back to the community , ” she said .
“ We were talking about organizing a rummage sale to raise money for a local animal shelter and a beach cleanup to help the environment . ”
Weaver , who is originally from England , said she was surprised by the customers ’ reaction considering Orange County is home to residents of various races and religious beliefs .
“ Maybe I expected it to be different because this area is fairly liberal , ” she said .
“ ( Orange County ) is very diverse . ”

The 2009 Linux Kernel Summit was held in Tokyo , Japan on October 19 and 20 .
Jet - lagged developers from all over the world discussed a wide range of topics .
LWN 's Jonathan Corbet was there , and has written the following summaries .
Day 1
The sessions held on the first day of the summit were :
Day 2
The discussions on the second day were :
Legal issues ; a lawyer visits the summit to talk about the software patent threat and how to respond to it .
How Google uses Linux : the challenges faced by one of our largest and most secretive users .
Performance regressions : is the kernel getting slower ?
How do we know and where are the problems coming from ?
Realtime : issues related to the merging of the realtime preemption tree into the mainline .
Generic architecture support : making it easier to port Linux to new processor architectures .
Development process issues , including linux - next , staging , merge window rules , and more .
The kernel summit closed with a general feeling that the discussions had gone well .
It was also noted that our Japanese hosts had done an exceptional job in supporting the summit and enabling everything to happen ; it would not be surprising to see developers agitating for the summit to return to Japan in the near future .

Duke University Medical Center researchers believe they have discovered why the appendix exists and what purpose it serves in modern humans .
They think it is used to ' reboot ' the digestive system and produce the bacteria sometimes eliminated by disease .
How is it that people have them removed and live normal lives afterward ?
In modern times , it is relatively unimportant .
In crowded areas people can easily replace lost bacteria from contact with others but in ancient times , when isolation was more common or when diseases such as cholera or amoebic dysentery struck and eliminated the stomach 's good bacteria , the appendix was likely how the human body regenerated good bacteria .
They say this notion is born out by the fact that in developing nations , where the appendix may still be needed , there is much less appendicitis .
In that sense , modern hygiene makes it more likely that the under - utilized appendix will need to be removed .
Biofilms in the large bowel suggest an apparent function of the human vermiform appendix , R. Randal Bollingera , Andrew S. Barbasa , Errol L. Busha , Shu S. Lina , b and William Parker , doi:10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.08.032
Abstract :
String theory currently is the only viable candidate for a unified description of all known natural forces .
This article tries to demonstrate that the fundamental structural and methodological differences that set string theory apart from other physical theories have important philosophical consequences .
Focusing on implications for the realism debate in philosophy of science , it is argued that both poles of that debate face new problems in the context of string theory .
On the one hand , the claim of underdetermination of scientific theory by the available empirical data , which is a pivotal element of empiricism , loses much of its plausibility .
On the other hand , the dissolution of any meaningful notion of an external ontological object destroys the basis for conventional versions of scientific realism .
String theory seems to suggest an intermediate position akin to Structural Realism that is based on a newly emerging principle , to be called the principle of theoretical uniqueness .
Just like old times : Generating RNA molecules in water
A key question in the origin of biological molecules like RNA and DNA is how they first came together billions of years ago from simple precursors .
Now , in a study appearing in this week 's JBC , researchers in Italy have reconstructed one of the earliest evolutionary steps yet : generating long chains of RNA from individual subunits using nothing but warm water .
Many researchers believe that RNA was one of the first biological molecules present , before DNA and proteins ; however , there has been little success in recreating the formation on RNA from simple " prebiotic " molecules that likely were present on primordial earth billions of years ago .
Now , Ernesto Di Mauro and colleagues found that ancient molecules called cyclic nucleotides can merge together in water and form polymers over 100 nucleotides long in water ranging from 40 - 90 °C –similar to water temperatures on ancient Earth .
Cyclic nucleotides like cyclic-AMP are very similar to the nucleotides that make up individual pieces of DNA or RNA ( A , T , G and C ) , except that they form an extra chemical bond and assume a ring - shaped structure .
That extra bond makes cyclic nucleotides more reactive , though , and thus they were able to join together into long chains at a decent rate ( about 200 hours to reach 100 nucleotides long ) .
This finding is exciting as cyclic nucleotides themselves can be easily formed from simple chemicals like formamide , thus making them plausible prebiotic compounds present during primordial times .
Thus , this study may be revealing how the first bits of genetic information were created .
Sir David was Mr Blair 's top foreign policy adviser Tony Blair signalled that he would be willing to back " regime change " in Iraq when he met George Bush in Texas in 2002 , the Iraq inquiry has been told .
But his ex-adviser Sir David Manning said he stressed the UK could only back action against Iraq if the issue went to the United Nations first .
Mr Blair asked for UK military options two months later , Sir David said .
In Texas Mr Bush told him there was " no war plan " for Iraq but a small cell had been set up to consider " options " .
Last week the former UK ambassador to the US , Sir Christopher Meyer , told the inquiry he felt Mr Blair 's views on regime change had " tightened " after the private meeting in April 2002 at Mr Bush 's ranch in Crawford , Texas .
' Peaceful ' solution
He said as no advisers were present for much of the meeting he could not be " entirely clear what degree of convergence was , if you like , signed in blood " .
On Monday , Sir David - who was Mr Blair 's top foreign policy adviser from 2001 to 2003 - said the then prime minister had continued to press President Bush to go through the UN route to deal with Saddam Hussein throughout 2002 - including meetings at the Crawford ranch and at Camp David .
AT THE INQUIRY BBC World Affairs correspondent Peter Biles
This was a strong defence of Tony Blair 's policy on Iraq .
Sir David Manning repeatedly emphasised that Mr Blair had been determined to go down the UN route by building international consensus .
Sir David gave an impression of the British prime minister trying to put a brake on the more extreme voices in the Bush administration , the neo-conservatives and others , whom he labelled " the regime changers " .
But as we now know , Tony Blair began talking about the possible need for regime change immediately after his visit to George W Bush 's ranch in Crawford , Texas in April 2002 , nearly a year before the war .
For the first time , there has been detailed evidence about the period after the invasion of Iraq .
Sir David 's assessment of the chaotic post - war reconstruction was a damning indictment of Paul Bremmer , the American who led the Coalition Provisional Authority .
He told the inquiry that at the Crawford meeting , Mr Blair was told by the president that at that stage there was " no war plan " for Iraq but that a " small cell " had been set up in US Central Command in Florida to come up with options for removing Saddam Hussein .
Sir David told the inquiry : " On the one hand the prime minister was very clearly urging the president to go back or adopt the UN route and coalition strategy but was absolutely prepared to say that at the same time he was willing to contemplate regime change if this did n't work .
" I look back at Crawford as the moment that he was saying , yes , there is a route through this that is an international , peaceful one and it is through the UN , but if it does n't work , we will be willing to undertake regime change . "
By June 2002 Mr Blair had asked for some options for UK military involvement , because they were aware US Central Command had started planning , Sir David said .
The next month the defence secretary 's office outlined three possibilities .
The first was an " in place support package " - using British military assets in the region such as planes in the no-fly zone and bases like Diego Garcia .
The second option was " the enhanced support package " - similar but with " additional maritime assets and aircraft " and possibly some special forces involvement , which would take two months to assemble .
' No decisions ' A bigger third option " the discreet UK package " would have offered land forces at about the level of 20,000 troops - which would have meant at least six months ' preparation , Sir David said .
Mr Blair had said he did not want to take any decisions at that stage and Sir David said : " I think he did n't want to give any signal that he was keen to think about a military alternative as opposed to going back to the UN route . "
That same month , Sir David met the president at the Oval Office where " repeated that it was impossible for the UK to take part in any action against Iraq unless it was through the UN . "
Mr Blair will give evidence early in the new year But in September Mr Blair was asked if Britain wanted to send a team to a planning conference in Florida and what would the British be willing to offer .
Sir David said : " At this stage , the prime minister said he was willing , on an entirely contingent basis , for the military to suggest that we would be willing to offer ' package two ' .. but that it had to be absolutely clear that no political decisions had been made in Britain about this .
" Clearly during October there was further discussion between the prime minister and the defence secretary about this and I think as time passed there was an acceptance that if it came to military action that we probably would be willing to move to package three . "
On Sunday Mr Blair denied reports his top legal adviser Lord Goldsmith was " gagged " after expressing doubts about the Iraq invasion 's legality in a letter which had been submitted to the inquiry .
The Mail on Sunday accused Mr Blair of deliberately keeping him out of cabinet meetings and of bullying the attorney general - who had threatened to resign - into backing down .
Asked if that was an accurate picture , Mr Blair told CNN : " No , it 's not " .
But he added : " But I think the best thing with this inquiry is actually to let us all give our evidence to the inquiry . "

The rising sun over the Koolau Mountains cast a glow upon the ballistic missiles planted on the lawn of a submarine museum at the edge of Pearl Harbor , throwing long shadows across the water .
They pointed at the bone - white memorial to the U.S.S. Arizona and , just beyond it , at the still - floating battleship Missouri , about to leave her pier .
It ’s not every year that you get to see a World War II battleship on the move .
Particularly in the heart of Pearl Harbor , along what used to be Battleship Row , ground zero for the carnage of Dec. 7 , 1941 .
The sight drew me and about 50 other people to the water ’s edge just after dawn on Oct. 14 .
The Missouri , mothballed for years , was towed to Hawaii from Washington in 1998 to be a bookend to the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial , symbols of Japan ’s surprise attack and abject defeat .
The Arizona was blown up and lies at the harbor bottom , a tomb for her crew .
The Missouri sailed triumphant into Tokyo Bay in 1945 ; surrender papers were signed on her deck .
Rusting and leaky , the Missouri was being towed to dry dock for three months of repairs .
As per the aphorism , turning her took a little while .
Shortly after 7 a.m. , she came into full broadside view , then swung around .

Microsoft Research has released a summary of the results of empirical studies examining software engineering myths .
The work , conducted by Nachi Nagappan , measures the impact on quality that common software engineering practices actually have .
The analysis reveals :
More code coverage in testing does n't necessarily correlate with a decrease in the number of post - release fixes required , citing many other factors that come into play .

TDD improves quality but takes longer ( pdf ) : " What the research team found was that the TDD teams produced code that was 60 to 90 percent better in terms of defect density than non-TDD teams .
They also discovered that TDD teams took longer to complete their projects — 15 to 35 percent longer . "

The use of assertions and code verification decreases bugs .
Further , " Software engineers who were able to make productive use of assertions in their code base tended to be well - trained and experienced , a factor that contributed to the end results . "
Organizational structure has a profound impact on quality : " Organizational metrics , which are not related to the code , can predict software failure - proneness with a precision and recall of 85 percent . "
The impact of a team being distributed has a negligible impact on quality .
These research findings are now being used by Microsoft development groups , including helping with risk - analysis and bug - triaging for major projects such as Windows Vista SP2 .
William Patry might not look from the outside like a man with a fire in his belly .
A copyright lawyer for 27 years , Patry has written one of two definitive accounts of US copyright law ( all 5,500 pages of Patry on Copyright can be yours for the low , low price of only $ 1,589 ) .
He served as a key counsel to the House of Representatives and is currently Senior Copyright Counsel at Internet behemoth Google — and if you ascribe his personal views to his employer , Patry will visit your house in the night and throw copies of Patry on Copyright through your largest windows .
Trust me .
In short , he 's an established and highly successful lawyer whose bio hardly makes him sound like a bomb - thrower .
But , when freed from the shackles of legal writing , Patry can lob hand grenades with the best of them .
Consider these choice nuggets from his new book , Moral Panics and the Copyright Wars , which veers repeatedly into " screed " territory :
" The Copyright Wars and the recent grotesque expansion of rights and remedies should be regarded as a legal equivalent of the subprime mortgage crisis : cancers on our system that were foreseeable and preventable but for greed , a failed ideology that the unregulated private pursuit of profit is also in the best interest of the public , and worldwide lack of political courage to admit to and take responsibility for the damage caused by copyright laws that harm rather than serve the public . "
" The term graduated response should be replaced with a more accurate term ' digital guillotine , ' reflecting its killing of a critical way people connect with the world and in some cases , eliminating their ability to make a living .
If proportionality is a hallmark of civilization , the digital guillotine is the hallmark of barbarians ...
The French Revolution shows that when we are in the throes of a moral panic , harsh , disproportionate measures can be made to appear essential . "
" Corporate copyright owners live in fear , especially fear of their own consumers .
Those consumers are young , tech savvy , and have wrested control over corporations ' physical product from them , an unthinkable act 10 years ago .
The result is a classical moral panic against youth ...
The Copyright Wars are a fight against our own children and it is a fight that says everything about the adults and very little about the children . "
" The DMCA is the 21st - century equivalent of letting copyright owners put a chastity belt on someone else 's wife . "
" I cannot think of a single significant innovation in neither the creation or distribution of works of authorship that owes its origins to the copyright industries . "
Not that there 's anything wrong with a good screed ; in the right hands , the screed can be a hugely enjoyable form .
But there 's a certain irony about the method here .
The quotes above rely on the most vivid of metaphors — copyright battles as cancer , graduated response laws as guillotines , the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act as a chastity belt — in order to discredit what they describe , yet this is exactly what Patry spends much of the book accusing Big Content of doing .
Powerful metaphors
You have to love a book on copyright that quotes Gadamer , I.A. Richards , and George Lakoff in its first fifty pages , and one that spends a chapter on the theory of metaphor .
Patry wants to show that copyright owners use metaphors — especially that of the " pirate " and the " thief " — in order to short - circuit critical thinking on copyright issues .
Moral Panics and the Copyright Wars Oxford 292 pages $ 21.56
" It does n't matter whether people know what pirates were actually like in the Golden Age of Piracy in the 17th and 18th centuries ; rather , it is enough that the term evokes powerful negative associations which are then transferred to the desired folk devils , for example , the manufacturer of VCRs , file - sharers , or Internet service providers .
In the transference , our attitudes are changed . "
Whenever copyright holders have felt threatened over the past century , they tend to stir up " moral panics " usually directed at the young .
One of the best at this was Hollywood 's top lobbyist in Washington for many years , Jack Valenti .
Patry calls Valenti " the best lobbyist I ever knew , " and says that he " always felt happy to be in his presence , even though he was lobbying on behalf of clients who did not always deserve what he sought . "
When Valenti got worked up , he could play on people 's fears like no one else — even when the issue was a business dispute over copyright law , Valenti could turn it into a morality play .
Most famous was his comment to Congress in the 1970s that the VCR was to Hollywood like " the Boston Strangler is to the woman home alone . "
But Valenti survived even into the peer - to - peer era , and he also testified to Congress in support of the DMCA .
The goal was to stop rampant file - swapping of music and movies , of course , but Valenti described P2P networks instead as full of the " most throat - choking child porn " " on a scale so squalid it will shake the very core of your being . "
In 2003 , he went on to tell Congress that copyright " pirates " and their goods accounted for " much of the money the international terror network depends on to feed its operations . "
To Patry , this is little more than fear - mongering , the creation of moral panics that are attached to " folk devils " like the " evil file - swapper " or the " dirty pirate " who are stealing American jobs .
" Folk devils are a tool to accomplish social , political or commercial objectives , and there is no better way to gain society 's acceptance of such control than through the manufacture of fear , " he writes , " which explains the copyright industries ' regular use of it . "
In Patry 's view , the Copyright Wars have no morality to them at all ; in reality , they are public relations campaigns waged with metaphors about issues that are essentially economic , and on which copyright owners are unwilling to face the future ( or even the present ) .
( Unlike most European copyright regimes , the American system is not based on the " moral rights " of an author . )
" There is no reason to keep pretending that the Copyright Wars involve matters of morality or principle — they do n't and never have .
The Copyright Wars and their predecessors have always been about one thing and one thing only — a fruitless effort to resist , to the end , the very nature of capitalism , which is a dynamic , creative force by which new innovations and business models replace old ones . "
Strengths , weaknesses , and tpyos typos
The best bits of the book come from Patry 's deep well of legal knowledge , his historical understanding of copyright battles that have played out in Congress , and the theorizing on " moral panics " and the nature of metaphor .
Moral Panics and the Copyright Wars is well - written , though it's not a " popular " book and casual readers may find themselves flipping pages , especially in the chapter on " the mythical origins of copyright " ( representative subheading : " the utilitarian / consequentialist origin story " ) .
And , as we noted at the beginning , the tone here gets so one - sided at points that all but the most hardened copyfighter will probably set the book down at some passages , scratch the chin , and ask , " Really ? "
Then there are the typos — present in such richness and variety that one is tempted to shed a tear for the proofreading department of mighty Oxford University Press .
( Update : Bill Patry has gotten in touch to clarify that there was some horrible printing error that eliminated many proofreading edits in the first batch of books , but it has been corrected and all copies available for sale now should be " clean . " )
But there is much here that is essential , including Patry 's thoughts on the " more is always better " copyright sickness that appears to be endemic in Washington .
" Regrettably , policymakers ( and even many copyright owners ) have been taken in by the slogan that stronger rights are somehow not only inherently better but inherently necessary , " he writes .
" There is no empirical support for this view , and much evidence to the contrary .
If stronger protection is always better , why not make the term of patent protection life of the inventor plus 70 years too ?
If stronger criminal laws are necessary to deter infringers , why not impose the death penalty , as China has done ?
The only type of laws we need are effective laws , laws that are effective for their purpose , in the case of copyright , to promote the progress of science , in the words of the US Constitution .
" Copyright owners ' problems are market problems , and they can only be solved by responding to market demands : strong copyright protection cannot make consumers buy things they do not want to buy and , as RIAA 's ill - conceived , ill - executed , and ill - fated campaign of suing individuals demonstrates , laws cannot stop individuals from filesharing .
Laws can , though , stifle innovation , and in this respect the copyright industries have been successful , and tragically so , for the public and for authors .
Innovation leads to greater consumer demand and therefore greater profits for copyright owners . "
The book 's final line darkly warns that " in other areas where a government monopoly , created to serve the public interest , is blatantly abused over a long period of time , it is taken away . "
The views may not be Google 's , but it 's not hard to see why Patry has landed at an aggregator and indexer of content rather than a creator of it .
Which , in a way , is too bad — making him the top lawyer at the MPAA or RIAA would be fascinating to watch , though we 're doubtful that those atop the big content industries share his easy confidence that innovation quickly produces greater profits , or that " less copyright law " can be " better copyright law . "
The Wall Street Rip Off : Fees and Consequences An Interview with John Bogle John Bogle is founder and retired CEO of the Vanguard Group — one of the two largest mutual funds in the world .
Fortune magazine named him as one of the four “ Investment Giants ” of the 20th century ; he was named one of the world ’s 100 most powerful and influential people by Time magazine ; and Institutional Investor presented him with its Lifetime Achievement Award .
He is the author of seven books , most recently Enough : True Measures of Money , Business , and Life .
Multinational Monitor :
What ’s your complaint with the way the mutual fund industry operates ?
John Bogle :
It ’s a very simple complaint .
Fund managers are in the business of gathering assets , all the better to maximize fees .
It ’s a marketing business .
It should not be a marketing business .
It should be a business of stewardship .
I ’ve often said that we ’ve let marketing triumph over management and salesmanship triumph over stewardship .
Stewardship means that the fund investor — not the manager — comes first , and that ’s not a principle we ’re really observing .
This is not to say that all fund managers are not trying to earn the best returns they can for their shareholders .
Of course they are .
But they ’re also trying to earn the best returns for other interests they represent , which is their management company .
Particularly in recent years , we ’ve developed a whole new problem about management companies .
Something like 40 of the largest 50 management companies are publicly held — either directly by the public or by giant financial conglomerates .
And it does n’t take some leap of cynicism to realize that when a big international financial conglomerate buys a mutual fund management company for a couple billion dollars , they ’re interested in increasing the return on their capital , not the return on your capital .
Those two interests are in direct conflict .
As a group , all investors inevitably capture the total market return .
These investors are trading with one another — competing with one another — and if one wins , the other loses .
So they all capture the market return before costs [ fees and trading expenses ] and lose the market return after costs .
To me , it is a tragedy that we ca n’t recognize that taking cost out of the system is absolutely essential .
MM : What ’s the difference between the mutual fund and the management company ?
How do they interrelate ?
Bogle : Typically , and this has not always been the case , an entrepreneur gets together some capital and starts a line of mutual funds .
He picks their directors , he keeps them in compliance , and he gets paid an annual fee for doing that .
Usually that fee is specified as a percentage of assets — maybe 1.5 percent of assets , maybe 0.75 percent of assets , sometimes the fee scales down as assets rise .
At the outset of this industry , we had small asset management companies managed by professional investors and owned by private individuals .
This gradually developed into an industry where that same management company has been bought from its original owners , maybe by an international financial conglomerate , maybe a U.S. bank , maybe a Canadian insurance company .
They ’re not investment professionals by and large ; they are large institutions looking for high returns .
The problem is a very simple one , and it ’s written in the Holy Bible :
No man can serve two masters .
The directors of the funds are pretty much chosen by the management companies .
They ’re trying to serve the interests of the fund shareholders — people who have invested in the mutual fund — but their prime interest is to serve the shareholders in the management company .
They have a fiduciary duty to both of these groups .
So which one has the high priority ?
If the fees were reduced sharply , the beneficiary would be the mutual fund investor — the shareholder .
If they were increased or left at too high levels , the beneficiary would be the public owners of that management company .
MM : Presumably the management company that ’s charging a high fee argues that they ’re bringing some high value added , that they ’ve got some special insights into the way the market works , and they ’re going to give the mutual fund investors a greater return .
Bogle : Yes , and that ’s absurd when you examine the historical record .
And it ’s absurd to think it could happen in the future even if it has happened in the past .
We all think we ’re smarter than the average , we all think we ’re better drivers than the average , I ’ve often observed that we probably all think we ’re better lovers than the average .
But as a group , we ’re all average .
And these managers are all average , until you take out their costs .
If a manager has a little hot streak , he ’s going to claim , “ I can beat the market . ”
But the fact of the matter is , over time , mutual fund managers as a group lose to the market .
And the other fact of the matter is , if you beat the market for a while , the odds are very powerful you ’ll revert to the market mean , less costs .
So , you ’ll fall below the market .
We know — we know , we do n’t guess — that an index fund that invests in all stocks , let ’s say in this case all U.S. stocks , and holds them forever , will have a huge advantage over the average actively managed fund largely because of costs .
The index fund has maybe a tenth of 1 percent total costs .
It has almost no transaction costs — it ’s not trading all the time like other mutual funds do .
It is very cash efficient because it pays very little in the way of capital gains taxes because it ’s a non-trader .
The actively managed funds , compared to that tenth of 1 percent , probably have an average fee of somewhere between 0.8 percent and 1.2 percent .
Add to that transaction costs — hidden and undisclosed , but clearly existing — of somewhere between 0.5 percent and 1 percent a year , because they turn over fund portfolios almost 100 percent a year .
And three , if you have a sales load in your mutual fund of 5 percent and investors hold it for five years , which is the average holding period for an equity fund investor , there ’s another 1 percent a year .
And even if they hold it for 10 years , that ’s another 0.5 percent a year .
So you can easily get costs in the range of 2.5 percent , compared to a no-load , low - cost , no - trading index fund of a tenth of 1 percent .
That ’s 25 times as much cost .
So , of course , the low cost funds win .
In addition , the record shows quite clearly — we do n’t know so much about the future here , but we can measure the past — that actively managed mutual funds have about a 2 percent tax disadvantage relative to indexed funds .
MM : For people who are not investors , or even for people who are , you ’re saying the numbers are 10 , 20 times more expensive , but they hear the number 2 percent and ask , what ’s the big deal ?
So , what is the big deal ?
Bogle :
The big deal is this :
If you look at the issue short - term , 2.5 percent costs , in , say , a 7 percent market , is consuming one third of your return .
And if the market is at 10 percent return , 2.5 will be consuming 25 percent of it .
What seems inconsequential over the short term becomes profoundly important over the long term .
Let ’s assume we have a market return of 8 percent , and you reinvest all of your earnings .
At the end of 50 years , the dollar you invested is worth $ 46.90 .
Now , let ’s assume we take 2.5 percent in fees out of the 8 percent return .
Your return drops to 5.5 percent .
At the end of 50 years that dollar grows to $ 14.54 .
So , if you can get costs out of the system , you can turn $ 14.54 into $ 46.90 .
Just imagine that .
What we ’re talking about is with all of the expenses , you , the investor , put 100 percent of the capital up , you ’re taking 100 percent of the risk , and you ’re capturing , in very round numbers , 30 percent of the return .
The financial system puts up none of the capital , takes none of the risk , and still captures 70 percent of the return that ’s there for the taking .
If everyone understood that , there would be an investment revolution in this country .
It ’s a fact .
There ’s no arguing it .
We all know about the miracle of compounding returns .
Just think of it : a dollar growing to $ 46.90 .
But none of us , or almost none of us unless they ’re Bogle - heads , are aware of the fact that the miracle of compounding returns over the long - term is overwhelmed by the tyranny of compounding cost over the long term .
That ’s why that $ 46.90 dwindles down to $ 14.54 .
It ’s short - term thinking , it ’s economic illiteracy , and it ’s also information asymmetry .
This is an industry that depends on marketing and sales .
We advertise high performing funds — this is really the disgraceful part that gets me angry just to think about it — knowing full well that the records we are advertising will not be repeated .
That ’s a disgrace .
We advertise , and we have a little footnote that says this may or may not be a reliable indicator of the future , or something like that , and we think we ’re relieved of responsibility for pumping up performance .
But I do n’t believe that .
I think it ’s unethical .
MM : You make a related point about the social consequences of speculation versus long - term investing .
Bogle : I ’ll give you a simple example to make it clear .
There are 500 stocks in the S&P 500 today .
Let ’s say that half of those stocks are held by investors who do n’t trade , and the other half of all those shares are held by speculators who trade , but inevitably trade only with each other .
So the investors capture the market return as a group .
The speculators capture the market return as a group because they own the same stocks , but they lose because they and their intermediaries are trading back and forth with one another .
The speculators capture that S&P return less all those costs .
So there is a social cost to that .
It greatly damages the retirement savings of Americans .
That ’s cost number one .
Cost number two is , when you have lower returns , the great temptation is to swing for the fences to get higher returns , which is one of the worst things you can do , because you ’re loading up on risk .
The third cost is the social costs of the mutual fund industry being a rent - a - stock industry rather than an own - a- stock industry .
Because if you ’re renting a stock for a while — and that ’s one way to look at this speculative market — you do n’t care how the company is governed , you do n’t care what the directors are doing about executive compensation .
If you ’re a speculator , you only care about short - term changes in the price of the stock .
If you ’re a long - term investor , you want to know what ’s going on in that company .
You care about how it ’s governed , you want to be sure those directors are forcing the management of the companies to put the interests of the shareholders before their own personal and pecuniary interests .
You ’re not in favor of some merger that will hike earnings over a short period of time , but hurt in the long run .
You ’re not in favor of putting a lot less money in the pension plan so your earnings go up this year , leaving your successor in five or 10 years in a deep hole with an underfunded pension plan .
You want to look at the investment as a long - term investment .
We all know , or should know , that there ’s one fundamental truth in investing :
The value of any investment today is the discounted value of its cash flow in the future .
Put another way :
You may think a company is going to grow at 10 or 12 percent for a few years and gradually dwindle down for the rest of its existence , to maybe a 6 percent return on capital .
You put that all in a formula and you discount it back to the current cost of capital , let ’s say 4 percent , and that ’s the value of the company .
So , if you sell a stock , you sell because you want to capitalize on the value of that future cash flow .
If you buy a stock , you want to own the right to that future cash flow .
That ’s what securities markets are about : to enable those buyers and sellers to meet on reasonable terms .
But future cash flow seems to be something we rarely look at , if ever , and that ’s a big oversight because we ’re so focused on the short term .
To make matters amusing , the speculators are not really first order speculators , they ’re second order speculators .
If you see bad news in the market and the market tumbles , that ’s because a whole lot of speculators are selling .
However , these early sellers are n’t selling because they think the news will cause stocks to go down .
They ’re selling because they think the news will cause other investors to think stocks will go down .
They ’re trying to anticipate expectations .
Does all of this make you think about Las Vegas ?
With people swapping money back and forth and the house winning ?
Of course it does .
Does it remind you of the race track where all that money comes in from the betters and goes out at the end of each race , except that the race track keeps itself a handle ?
Or does it remind you of a state lottery ?
The numbers are enormous if you win .
The odds against winning are enormous .
But the real winner is the state .
Wall Street has become casino capitalism in which the croupiers are getting too damn much money .
Last time we calculated this , it ’s less now , the croupiers were taking something like $ 520 billion a year out of the financial markets with all this trading and money management .
That ’s right out of our pocket .
MM : Is that the figure just from trading , or the overall financial sector profits ?
Bogle :
We actually did n’t try and do it that way .
What we did was make calculations based on the assets of mutual funds and the fee structure of mutual funds .
Total expenses turn out to be around $ 75 billion or $ 85 billion .
We then go to brokerage or trading firms — investment banking firms — and we look at their revenues .
When you take out the interest they pay back and forth to each other , that turns out to be a number around $ 300 billion a year .
And we take hedge fund managers , who are probably making about 4 percent on hedge funds , maybe 3 percent .
If they ’re running around $ 4 trillion , just 3 percent of that would be $ 120 million .
Annuities are another cost .
We just aggregate those costs .
It ’s not my job , I do n’t think , to do this scientifically .
We should get some good academic to do it , but I have n’t been able to find anyone to do it yet .
It ’s a good estimate of costs .
I ’d be happy if someone comes up with another estimate and says , “ Look , Bogle , you ’re wrong .
It ’s ‘ only ’ $ 400 billion . ”
Costs are going down now .
Fees are going down in this down market .
We do n’t really know how much it will come down , but $ 520 billion or $ 530 billion is simply unsustainable .
Think about this :
The stock market is valued now at about $ 9 trillion , down from $ 18 trillion .
Let ’s say that expenses are $ 400 billion a year for the equity portion of the money management trading casino .
Over 10 years , that ’s $ 4 trillion in expenses in a stock market that ’s worth $ 9 trillion .
It ’s just plain shocking that that much wealth is confiscated by those who are taking advantage of those who are putting up the capital .
MM : You talked about finance being too big .
What ’s your perspective on the size of the financial sector to the rest of the economy ?
Bogle :
In 2007 , the financial industry ’s share of overall corporate profits rose to 27 percent , up from 5 percent 10 to 15 years earlier .
It was much more than that because we did n’t count the financial arms of General Motors , Ford and Chrysler , or General Electric , even though over half of General Electric ’s revenues came from its financial group .
So it ’s easy to say in 2007 something around a third of the profitability of American business came out of finance , up from 5 percent or 6 percent a decade or 15 years before .
This business that detracts value from our society was the fastest growing and largest sector of our society .
The financial sector made more than two of the most profitable sectors in our society together — healthcare and technology — and many times as much as our manufacturing companies .
MM : One of the chapters in your book is “ Too much complexity , not enough simplicity . ”
What does simplicity mean in the financial context and why is it important ?
Bogle :
With the example I gave you of half the people owning stocks and trading them , that would be a complexity .
The half of the investors owning the total market in an index fund and not trading them represents simplicity — and it ’s quite clear that simplicity wins .
Part of the problem with complexity is it costs money , and part of the virtue of simplicity is it does n’t cost money .
Complexity also leads to uninformed investors because of information asymmetry .
The seller always knows more than the buyer .
Some fast - talking investment banker comes in with some new credit default swap , some new structured investment vehicle , some new way of breaking the link between borrower and lender , some securitization , some collateralized debt obligations , and he shows you how to get an extra return without any extra risk .
First of all , anyone who believes you can get extra return without any extra risk is a damn fool because that ’s part of the package .
But they do n’t need to tell you that and they do n’t tell you that .
So , we have a much larger share of the market that ca n’t understand what they ’re doing .
You might think as a logical person , they ’d say , “ If I ca n’t understand it , I ’m not going to buy it . ”
In fact , that was my unfailing rule when I ran Vanguard .
When people came in to propose all kinds of new types of funds to us , that was my definitive answer :
If I ca n’t understand it , we ’re not going to do it .
Happily , I do n’t have a giant brain , so that means I ’ve really got to focus on simplicity .
I think that saved our shareholders an awful lot of money .
Sellers have a huge financial incentive to sell these new things because they get paid a lot of money .
The buyer does n’t really know how much the seller is getting , but the seller sure does .
If you combine a seller with an information advantage and a substantial financial incentive , you can see why selling pressure overwhelms the buyers ’ understanding .
You might say people should n’t accept that , but somehow they do .
Let me give you one example out of the Madoff case .
There ’s a firm called Fairfield Greenwich .
Apparently , without disclosing who was managing the money , Fairfield Greenwich put an awful lot of their clients ’ money into the Madoff Ponzi scheme .
Between 2005 and 2008 , Fairfield Greenwich was paid $ 400 million in fees for investing that money with Madoff .
They pointed their finger and said , “ You ’re money is going here , ” and that was worth $ 400 million .
Nearly a half a billion dollars in a short period for just saying , “ Let him do the work . ”
How could they resist putting their money with Madoff ?
MM : In light of this analysis , do you think that tighter restrictions on leverage — the use of borrowed money — are appropriate ?
Bogle : Absolutely .
Of course , we now mix banks and investment banks because of the stupid vote to repeal the Glass - Steagall Act .
But investment banking firms were once private partnerships , and those partnerships were the ones who put up the capital ; it was their money .
They had unlimited personal liability , and believe me , they would make sure the quality of assets in their balance sheets was high .
They would n’t have a 40 - to - 1 leverage ratio because their own money was at stake .
We ’ve lost the link between investing people ’s money the way that one would invest one ’s own .
You see the results everywhere .
MM : Do you have any thoughts about a new regulatory regime for financial derivatives ?
Bogle : First , we have to have disclosure .
We ’ve got to have transaction disclosure , we ’ve got to have counterparty disclosure , we ’ve got to have volume disclosure , regulated by the SEC .
How anyone can say that the S&P future has more in common with pork bellies [ futures of which are regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission ] than it does with the S&P 500 index , has got to be the stupidest thing that you ’ve ever heard .
It turns out , by the way , at least by recent data , that while the value of the S&P is now $ 9 trillion , there are probably $ 18 trillion of S&P futures stocks that are outstanding .
The tail is larger than the dog by a factor of two .
Imagine how grotesque your pet would look .
MM : Besides transparency , do you think some of these instruments should be prohibited or require prior approval ?
Bogle : I think we ought to go about that very carefully .
I think there are some instruments that are so dangerous that their risks cannot be disclosed away .
But failing that , I think sunlight is almost always the best remedy .
I ’m not an inherent believer in more regulation .
I ’m really a believer in less regulation , although we ’ve got to have more regulation now .
I never realized human behavior would be so bad .
We do need some kind of limitations .
In our society and in our economy , we think of innovation as an almost unmixed blessing .
Innovation brought us bar codes , EZ passes , the Internet , on and on .
The unfettered price competition you get through the Internet has certainly been terrific for consumers .
But in the financial field , I wonder if we have n’t had enough innovation , because innovation takes place basically to benefit the innovator , not the buyer or user of the innovation .
People make a lot of commission on CDSs , on CDOs , and other obscure financial instruments .
And the users of them lost a lot of money .
That strikes me as not a very good credential for an ethical system that ultimately has to be based on trust .
We ca n’t say , there will be no more innovation here .
But we can say that it ought to be demonstrated somewhere along the way that this innovation will benefit the persons that use the innovation and not just the marketer of the innovation .
Warren Buffett has this wonderful saying that every new idea goes through three stages : first the innovator , second the imitator , and third the idiot .
So this thing spreads like a virus around the land and the last people that get in really lose money .
MM : What do you think about a financial transactions tax to slow speculation ?
Bogle : I love it .
It ’s going to be very hard to get , but I love it .
The financial institutions that control 75 percent of all stocks are tax free .
Pension funds are tax free .
Mutual funds are about half tax - deferred , but the other half is run by managers who pay no attention to taxes .
So we ’ve got these two giant industries basically operating without any frictional costs when they trade stocks back and forth .
The tax costs to traders are basically zero , and the commission costs are half a penny a share or something like that .
So we ’ve taken the frictional costs out and that helps explain why we ’ve had this orgy of speculation .
No question about that .
So I like the idea of a transaction cost .
I also like the idea of a capital gains tax on very short - term capital gains , applied whether you ’re a tax exempt institution or not .
In other words , a pension fund would be subject to that tax just like an individual investor .
In 1929 , the turnover was about 145 percent in the stock exchange .
It was about 25 percent , believe it or not , my first 15 or 20 years in this business .
Last year , it was 350 percent .
That ’s an orgy of speculation we ’ve never seen before .
If the idea of a transaction cost or a tax on short term capital gains is to cut back on that transaction volume , then it would n’t produce much revenue , but it would succeed in its primary goal of reducing those costs .
When you think about it , we have an industry whose raison d’être is to sic one investor on another and say , “ You can take advantage of that guy . ”
That ’s what the market is .
If you sell , you ’re trying to take advantage of the buyer .
You think you ’re smarter than he is and vice versa .
By pitting one investor against another and having that croupier in the middle , which is apparently necessary for the transaction to take place , you ensure that investing is a loser ’s game .
If investors acted in the community interest , that is , by owning the market , which they own anyway , and not trading , it would be a winner ’s game .
So by doing what is best for society , our investors would end up being winners rather than losers .
MM : You talk at some length about executive compensation and how that ’s gone awry and creates wrong incentives .
Do you feel that “ say on pay ” is an adequate solution or would you like to see a mandatory overall cap on executive compensation or maybe , especially in the financial sector , some requirement that incentive compensation be linked to long - term performance ?
Bogle :
The conversation about executive pay is just absurd .
Going back to 1980 in five year increments , executives have been predicting earnings growth of 11 percent a year and delivering 6 percent .
We know that executives as a group should n’t get any incentives for failing .
There has to be some accomplishment above average before you get paid a bonus .
It has to be based on performance and not peers .
We ’ve been handed a real bill of goods by our compensation consultants who put everybody in quartiles .
It ’s the nature of the system that the directors of companies whose executives are paid in the lowest quartile say that “ our man or woman is good so we ’re going to move him or her up to the second quartile . ”
And guess what happens ?
Somebody else falls into the fourth quartile .
There ’s no way around it .
So then the process goes on again .
What is value for shareholders ?
Let ’s start with what it is not :
It is not the price of your stock .
It may look like it , but over the long run your price of stock gets way ahead of the intrinsic value of the company — which is good for sellers and bad for buyers — or the price of the stock gets well below the intrinsic value of the company , which is good for buyers and bad for sellers .
There ’s no way around that , just read the great Buffett on that point .
It ’s just the totality again .
What matters for shareholders is creating intrinsic value over the long run .
It ’s intrinsic value as compared to stock prices , and it ’s the long run instead of the short run .
That kind of a rule — based on long - term accomplishment , if you leave the company you keep your shares , you do n’t get paid all at once every year , you do n’t get paid for short - term earnings — would help deliver real value for shareholders .
Executives certainly should not get paid for stock prices — which is how every option plan in America is built .
Stock prices are a terrible indication of corporate value in the short run , but as I mentioned , a perfect indicator of the long run , if you ’re around for the long run .
S eptember 29 , 1981 , is the one - hundredth anniversary of the birth of Ludwig von Mises , economist and social philosopher , who passed away in 1973 .
Von Mises was my teacher and mentor and the source or inspiration for most of what I know and consider to be important and worthwhile in these fields — of what enables me to understand the events shaping the world in which we live .
I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to him , because I believe that he deserves to occupy a major place in the intellectual history of the twentieth century .
Von Mises is important because his teachings are necessary to the preservation of material civilization .
As he showed , the base of material civilization is the division of labor .
Without the higher productivity of labor made possible by the division of labor , the great majority of mankind would simply die of starvation .
The existence and successful functioning of the division of labor , however , vitally depends on the institutions of a capitalist society — that is , on limited government and economic freedom , private ownership of land and all other property , exchange and money , saving and investment , economic inequality and economic competition , and the profit motive — institutions everywhere under attack for several generations .
When von Mises appeared on the scene , Marxism and the other socialist sects enjoyed a virtual intellectual monopoly .
Major flaws and inconsistencies in the writings of Smith and Ricardo and their followers enabled the socialists to claim classical economics as their actual ally .
The writings of Jevons and the earlier “ Austrian ” economists — Menger and Böhm - Bawerk — were insufficiently comprehensive to provide an effective counter to the socialists .
Bastiat had tried to provide one , but died too soon , and probably lacked the necessary theoretical depth in any case .
Thus , when von Mises appeared , there was virtually no systematic intellectual opposition to socialism or defense of capitalism .
Quite literally , the intellectual ramparts of civilization were undefended .
What von Mises undertook , and which summarizes the essence of his greatness , was to build an intellectual defense of capitalism and thus of civilization .
The leading argument of the socialists was that the institutions of capitalism served the interests merely of a handful of rugged “ exploiters ” and “ monopolists ” and operated against the interests of the great majority of mankind , which socialism would serve .
While the only answer others could give was to devise plans to take away somewhat less of the capitalists ' wealth than the socialists were demanding , or to urge that property rights nevertheless be respected despite their incompatibility with most people 's well - being , von Mises challenged everyone 's basic assumption .
He showed that capitalism operates to the material self - interests of all , including the non-capitalists — the so - called proletarians .
In a capitalist society , von Mises showed , privately owned means of production serve the market .
The physical beneficiaries of the factories and mills are all who buy their products .
And , together with the incentive of profit and loss and the freedom of competition that it implies , the existence of private ownership ensures an ever - growing supply of products for all .
Thus , von Mises showed to be absolute nonsense such clichés as “ poverty causes communism . ”
Not poverty , but poverty plus the mistaken belief that communism is the cure for poverty , causes communism .
If the misguided revolutionaries of the backward countries and of impoverished slums understood economics , any desire they might have to fight poverty would make them advocates of capitalism .
Socialism , von Mises showed , in his greatest original contribution to economic thought , not only abolishes the incentive of profit and loss and the freedom of competition along with private ownership of the means of production , but makes economic calculation , economic coordination , and economic planning impossible , and therefore results in chaos .
For socialism means the abolition of the price system and the intellectual division of labor ; it means the concentration and centralization of all decision - making in the hands of one agency : the Central Planning Board or the Supreme Dictator .
Yet the planning of an economic system is beyond the power of any one consciousness : the number , variety and locations of the different factors of production , the various technological possibilities that are open to them , and the different possible permutations and combinations of what might be produced from them , are far beyond the power even of the greatest genius to keep in mind .
Economic planning , von Mises showed , requires the cooperation of all who participate in the economic system .
It can exist only under capitalism , where , every day , businessmen plan on the basis of calculations of profit and loss ; workers , on the basis of wages ; and consumers , on the basis of the prices of consumers ' goods .
Von Mises 's contributions to the debate between capitalism and socialism — the leading issue of modern times — are overwhelming .
Before he wrote , people did not realize that capitalism has economic planning .
They uncritically accepted the Marxian dogma that capitalism is an anarchy of production and that socialism represents rational economic planning .
People were ( and most still are ) in the position of Moliere 's M. Jourdan , who never realized that what he was speaking all his life was prose .
For , living in a capitalist society , people are literally surrounded by economic planning , and yet do not realize that it exists .
Every day , there are countless businessmen who are planning to expand or contract their firms , who are planning to introduce new products or discontinue old ones , planning to open new branches or close down existing ones , planning to change their methods of production or continue with their present methods , planning to hire additional workers or let some of their present ones go .
And every day , there are countless workers planning to improve their skills , change their occupations or places of work , or to continue with things as they are ; and consumers , planning to buy homes , cars , stereos , steak or hamburger , and how to use the goods they already have — for example , to drive to work or to take the train , instead .
Yet people deny the name planning to all this activity and reserve it for the feeble efforts of a handful of government officials , who , having prohibited the planning of everyone else , presume to substitute their knowledge and intelligence for the knowledge and intelligence of tens of millions .
Von Mises identified the existence of planning under capitalism , the fact that it is based on prices ( “ economic calculations ” ) , and the fact that the prices serve to coordinate and harmonize the activities of all the millions of separate , independent planners .
He showed that each individual , in being concerned with earning a revenue or income and with limiting his expenses , is led to adjust his particular plans to the plans of all others .
For example , the worker who decides to become an accountant rather than an artist , because he values the higher income to be made as an accountant , changes his career plan in response to the plans of others to purchase accounting services rather than paintings .
The individual who decides that a house in a particular neighborhood is too expensive and who therefore gives up his plan to live in that neighborhood , is similarly engaged in a process of adjusting his plans to the plans of others ; because what makes the house too expensive is the plans of others to buy it who are able and willing to pay more .
And , above all , von Mises showed , every business , in seeking to make profits and avoid losses , is led to plan its activities in a way that not only serves the plans of its own customers , but takes into account the plans of all other users of the same factors of production throughout the economic system .
Thus , von Mises demonstrated that capitalism is an economic system rationally planned by the combined , self - interested efforts of all who participate in it .
The failure of socialism , he showed , results from the fact that it represents not economic planning , but the destruction of economic planning , which exists only under capitalism and the price system .
Von Mises was not primarily anti-socialist .
He was pro-capitalist .
His opposition to socialism , and to all forms of government intervention , stemmed from his support for capitalism and from his underlying love of individual freedom and conviction that the self - interests of free men are harmonious — indeed , that one man 's gain under capitalism is not only not another 's loss , but is actually others ' gain .
Von Mises was a consistent champion of the self - made man , of the intellectual and business pioneer , whose activities are the source of progress for all mankind and who , he showed , can flourish only under capitalism .
Von Mises demonstrated that competition under capitalism is of an entirely different character than competition in the animal kingdom .
It is not a competition for scarce , nature - given means of subsistence , but a competition in the positive creation of new and additional wealth , from which all gain .
For example , the effect of the competition between farmers using horses and those using tractors was not that the former group died of starvation , but that everyone had more food and the income available to purchase additional quantities of other goods as well .
This was true even of the farmers who “ lost ” the competition , as soon as they relocated in other areas of the economic system , which were enabled to expand precisely by virtue of the improvements in agriculture .
Similarly , the effect of the automobile 's supplanting the horse and buggy was to benefit even the former horse breeders and blacksmiths , once they made the necessary relocations .
In a major elaboration of Ricardo 's Law of Comparative Advantage , von Mises showed that there is room for all in the competition of capitalism , even those of the most modest abilities .
Such people need only concentrate on the areas in which their relative productive inferiority is least .
For example , an individual capable of being no more than a janitor does not have to fear the competition of the rest of society , almost all of whose members could be better janitors than he , if that is what they chose to be .
Because however much better janitors other people might make , their advantage in other lines is even greater .
And so long as the person of limited ability is willing to work for less as a janitor than other people can earn in other lines , he has nothing to worry about from their competition .
He , in fact , outcompetes them for the job of janitor by being willing to accept a lower income than they .
Von Mises showed that a harmony of interests prevails in this case , too .
For the existence of the janitor enables more talented people to devote their time to more demanding tasks , while their existence enables him to obtain goods and services that would otherwise be altogether impossible for him to obtain .
On the basis of such facts , von Mises argued against the possibility of inherent conflicts of interest among races and nations , as well as among individuals .
For even if some races or nations were superior ( or inferior ) to others in every aspect of productive ability , mutual cooperation in the division of labor would still be advantageous to all .
Thus , he showed that all doctrines alleging inherent conflicts rest on an ignorance of economics .
He argued with unanswerable logic that the economic causes of war are the result of government interference , in the form of trade and migration barriers , and that such interference restricting foreign economic relations is the product of other government interference , restricting domestic economic activity .
For example , tariffs become necessary as a means of preventing unemployment only because of the existence of minimum wage laws and pro-union legislation , which prevent the domestic labor force from meeting foreign competition by means of the acceptance of lower wages when necessary .
He showed that the foundation of world peace is a policy of laissez - faire both domestically and internationally .
In answer to the vicious and widely believed accusation of the Marxists that Nazism was an expression of capitalism , he showed , in addition to all the above , that Nazism was actually a form of socialism .
Any system characterized by price and wage controls , and thus by shortages and government controls over production and distribution , as was Nazism , is a system in which the government is the de facto owner of the means of production .
Because , in such circumstances , the government decides not only the prices and wages charged and paid , but also what is to be produced , in what quantities , by what methods , and where it is to be sent .
These are all the fundamental prerogatives of ownership .
This identification of “ socialism on the German pattern , ” as he called it , is of immense value in understanding the nature of present demands for price controls .
Von Mises showed that all of the accusations made against capitalism were either altogether unfounded or should be directed against government intervention , which destroys the workings of capitalism .
He was among the first to point out that the poverty of the early years of the Industrial Revolution was the heritage of all previous history — that it existed because the productivity of labor was still pitifully low ; because scientists , inventors , businessmen , savers and investors could only step by step create the advances and accumulate the capital necessary to raise it .
He showed that all the policies of so - called labor and social legislation were actually contrary to the interests of the masses of workers they were designed to help — that their effect was to cause unemployment , retard capital accumulation , and thus hold down the productivity of labor and the standard of living of all .
In a major original contribution to economic thought , he showed that depressions were the result of government - sponsored policies of credit expansion designed to lower the market rate of interest .
Such policies , he showed , created large - scale malinvestments , which deprived the economic system of liquid capital and brought on credit contractions and thus depressions .
Von Mises was a leading supporter of the gold standard and of laissez - faire in banking , which , he believed , would virtually achieve a 100 % reserve gold standard and thus make impossible both inflation and deflation .
What I have written of von Mises provides only the barest indication of the intellectual content that is to be found in his writings .
He authored over a dozen volumes .
And I venture to say that I cannot recall reading a single paragraph in any of them that did not contain one or more profound thoughts or observations .
Even on the occasions when I found it necessary to disagree with him ( for example , on his view that monopoly can exist under capitalism , his advocacy of the military draft , and certain aspects of his views on epistemology , the nature of value judgments , and the proper starting point for economics ) , I always found what he had to say to be extremely valuable and a powerful stimulus to my own thinking .
I do not believe that anyone can claim to be really educated who has not absorbed a substantial measure of the immense wisdom present in his works .
Von Mises 's two most important books are Human Action and Socialism , which best represents the breadth and depth of his thought .
These are not for beginners , however .
They should be preceded by some of von Mises 's popular writings , such as Bureaucracy and Planning For Freedom .
The Theory of Money and Credit , Theory and History , Epistemological Problems of Economics , and The Ultimate Foundations of Economic Science are more specialized works that should probably be read only after Human Action .
Von Mises 's other popular writings in English include Omnipotent Government , The Anti-Capitalistic Mentality , Liberalism , Critique of Interventionism , Economic Policy , and The Historical Setting of the Austrian School of Economics .
For anyone seriously interested in economics , social philosophy , or modern history , the entire list should be considered required reading .
[ All titles of von Mises currently in print can be ordered on this web site . ]
Von Mises must be judged not only as a remarkably brilliant thinker but also as a remarkably courageous human being .
He held the truth of his convictions above all else and was prepared to stand alone in their defense .
He cared nothing for personal fame , position , or financial gain , if it meant having to purchase them at he sacrifice of principle .
In his lifetime , he was shunned and ignored by the intellectual establishment , because the truth of his views and the sincerity and power with which he advanced them shattered the tissues of fallacies and lies on which most intellectuals then built , and even now continue to build , their professional careers .
It was my great privilege to have known von Mises personally over a period of twenty years .
I met him for the first time when I was sixteen years old .
Because he recognized the seriousness of my interest in economics , he invited me to attend his graduate seminar at New York University , which I did almost every week thereafter for the next seven years , stopping only when the start of my own teaching career made it no longer possible for me to continue in regular attendance .
His seminar , like his writings , was characterized by the highest level of scholarship and erudition , and always by the most profound respect for ideas .
Von Mises was never concerned with the personal motivation or character of an author , but only with the question of whether the man 's ideas were true or false .
In the same way , his personal manner was at all times highly respectful , reserved , and a source of friendly encouragement .
He constantly strove to bring out the best in his students .
This , combined with his stress on the importance of knowing foreign languages , led in my own case to using some of my time in college to learn German and then to undertaking the translation of his Epistemological Problems of Economics — something that has always been one of my proudest accomplishments .
Today , von Mises 's ideas at long last appear to be gaining in influence .
His teachings about the nature of socialism have been confirmed in the first - hand observations of honest news reporters with extensive experience in Soviet Russia , such as Robert Kaiser , Hedrick Smith , John Dornberg , and Henry Kamm .
They are being confirmed at this very moment by the actions of millions of angry workers in Poland .
Some of von Mises 's ideas are being propounded by the Nobel prizewinners F.A. Hayek ( himself a former student of von Mises ) and Milton Friedman .
They exert a major influence on the writings of Henry Hazlitt and the staff of the Foundation for Economic Education , as well as such prominent former students as Hans Sennholz .
Von Mises 's monetary theories permeate the pages of recent best - selling books on personal investments , such as those by Harry Browne and Jerome Smith .
And last , but certainly not least , they appear to be exerting an important influence on the present President of the United States , who has acknowledged reading Human Action and has expressed his admiration for it .
Von Mises 's books deserve to be required reading in every college and university curriculum — not just in departments of economics , but also in departments of philosophy , history , government , sociology , law , business , journalism , education , and the humanities .
He himself should be awarded an immediate posthumous Nobel Prize — indeed , more than one .
He deserves to receive every token of recognition and memorial that our society can bestow .
For as much as anyone in history , he labored to preserve it .
If he is widely enough read , his labors may actually succeed in helping to save it .

As Gillian Tett points out in the Financial Times today , clearing derivatives centrally has come to be viewed in policy circles as a magical solution .
As a result , it has not gotten the scrutiny it deserves .
The reason for the enthusiasm is that , in theory , a clearinghouse would make sure all agreements were adequately backstopped , so that if customer defaulted , it would not produce cascading counterparty defaults .
The clearinghouse would have enough margin and capital to absorb the loss .
And observers take great comfort from the fact that no significant exchange ( which also has central clearing ) has failed in a very long time .
But that view is based on precedents that have limited relevance for credit default swaps , which is the product that is the biggest source of risk .
First , the CDS market is dominated by a comparatively small number of very large counterparties .
So the failure of any one would be a vastly more serious blow than any modern exchange has suffered .
Second , the cheery view of the safety of exchanges is based on the airbrushing out of a near failure .
In the 1987 stockmarket crash , a large counterparty of the Chicago Merc had failed to make a large payment by settlement date , leaving the exchange $ 400 million short .
Its president , Leo Melamed , called its bank , Continental Illinois , to plead for the bank to guarantee the balance , which was well in excess of its credit lines .
The officer in charge said no , .
It was only because the chairman walked in and authorized the backstop only three minutes before the exchange was due to open that the Merc kept going .
Melamed has said repeatedly that if the Merc did not open that morning , it would not have opened again , and the head of the NYSE has said if the Merc did not open that morning , the NYSE would not have either , and it might never have repoened either .
Remember that .
One decision with three minutes to spare kept the two biggest exchanges in the US from collapsing in the 1987 crash .
See Donald MacKenzie ’s An Engine Not A Camera for details .
Third , a clearinghouse for credit default swaps is certain to be undercapitalized .
That means it is an AIG , a concentrated point of failure .
The reason is that the contracts will be undermargined .
CDS are not true derivatives , but are the economic equivalent of credit insurance .
When a “ reference entity ” has a “ credit event ” meaning a bankruptcy or default , CDS prices jump to default .
That means they shoot up massively because a payout on the CDS is certain , the only item in question is the precise amount .
A large enough initial margin to allow for jump to default risk will make CDS uneconomic ( that ’s an outcome I welcome , but that is contrary to the motives for the clearinghouse ) .
So dealers and counterparties will fight for a lower margin , meaning the exchange will be undercapitalized relative to the risks it faces .
Tett has some overlapping concerns :
And yet , as so often in the current regulatory debate , there is a crucial catch : most notably , that a clearing house can only offer that all - important sense of reassurance to investors , if it is always perceived to be absolutely rock solid – no matter what .
And what is notable about the reform debate so far this year , is that there has been remarkably little public discussion among politicians – or even among regulators – about how to guarantee that any future clearing house will indeed be strong enough to withstand any future shocks … .
I suspect the silence may also reflect delicate political sensibilities .
If politicians were to demand that a clearing house should be so utterly rock solid that it could withstand even financial Armageddon , the future members of any clearing platform would have to make massive financial commitments .
That would necessarily limit membership , to a small cabal of ultra-powerful banks – not something that most politicians wish to encourage .
However , if a clearing house is made more accessible to a wider pool of members , then it will only carry real credibility if it is ultimately backstopped by the government itself , to ensure that trades are always settled , no matter what .
And most politicians are not keen to highlight that option either , given the wider sense of public anger about the degree to which the government is bailing out the financial world .
Nevertheless , a few lone voices are now trying to stir up more debate , Gerry Corrigan , the former governor of the New York Fed , for example , recently declared that any future clearing house be placed under the supervision of central banks .
More controversially , he also demanded that any clearing house for credit derivatives should have enough resources to withstand the failure of two large members on the same day and still keep trading .
“ I believe that the operational and financial integrity of such counterparty clearing facilities must be virtually failsafe , ” he sternly declared * .
These strike me as sensible suggestions .
And behind the scenes , some policy makers strongly support what Corrigan has demanded .
Yet , thus far , it is still unclear whether such tough standards will be imposed – even though some clearing houses are now emerging .
And that is precisely why men such as Corrigan are growing uneasy .
After all , one lesson that financial history shows is that the issues which blow up the financial system are not usually those which caused the last crisis .
Instead , the biggest threats tend to come from the areas swathed in a lazy consensus , or where there is a strong political impetus to clutch at easy solutions .
That might yet apply to the clearing houses .
In theory , I still believe that clearing houses could – and should – make the derivatives world safer .
In practice , though , they could also end up creating new dangers if they are not put on a sound footing , particularly if the fact that no clearing house has ever failed before creates a false sense of complacency
Clearinghouses are the wrong remedy for CDS , but that horse has left the barn and is already in the next county .
And I must confess , they sound deceptively appealing ( I was a proponent early on ) until you dig further into how they would work for CDS .
They need to be regulated intrusively , with the intent of shrinking the market considerably over time , and like insurance , with tough capital requirements and frequent examinations of the capital adequacy and claims - paying ability of the sponsor .
But the real need is to cut off the air supply to CDS to reduce the size of the market so the product itself no longer represents a systemic threat .

" We chose King - Law to do our wills for us this year on the advice of a friend .
I am a little intimidated going to a lawyer ’s office , but they made us feel at home right away .
Richard was down - to - earth and made the process seem simple .
We were able to wrap things up in a timely manner thanks to both Richard and Cheryl .
If we need a lawyer for anything else of this nature , we will know who to go to . "
Todd & Barb ( Madison , Wisconsin )
" I found Richard King to be professional , thorough , time and accessible .
I consulted him for estate planning and several amendments that later needed to be made to the documents .
I had never been to a lawyer before , and I felt very comfortable with him and his staff .
He answered my questions and explained things so that I could understand easily .
The work was done promptly and emails were also answered promptly .
He anticipated issues , and I always felt that he was not just doing a job , but truly interested in addressing my situation in the best way he could . "
Charles & Wendy ( Middleton , Wisconsin )
" I contacted attorney King after he was recommended to me by a friend .
I wanted a living trust set up .
He was knowledgeable , thorough and efficient .
He was also comfortable to talk with , and I was n’t intimidated by his surroundings .
Perhaps the fact that this office is n’t ostentatious makes it possible for attorney King to charge a reasonable fee for his services .
If anyone says they are looking for a lawyer , I am quick to mention attorney King ’s name .
And I will definitely be calling him the next time I am in need of an attorney ’s services . "

Deep in the ocean , beyond where light reaches , thousands of new species are being documented by the Census Of Marine Life .
From the tiny and adorable to the nightmarish , all of these creatures from the Cthulian depths are entrancing .
The photic zone is an area of the ocean that extends beyond the reach of sunlight , as deep as 5,000 meters .
For the first time , a serious effort has begun to try and catalogue the vast array of deep sea life , under the auspices of the Census Of Marine Life ( COML ) .
Currently , they 've identified more than 17,000 species inhabiting the dark depths , which will join with information from hundreds of other projects next October to reveal the complete results of the census .

A 20 - year - old student was expelled from Brazil 's Bandeirante University ( Uniban ) Sunday after hundreds of her classmates rioted over the length of her skirt .
According to Edison Bernardo DeSouza of Brazzil Magazine , on October 22 , tourism student Geisy Arruda showed up to class at Uniban , near Sao Paulo , wearing a pink minidress and " heavy makeup , " which apparently prompted her fellow students to go completely insane .
Two hundred of them gathered outside her classroom to gawk at her , and when she left to go to the bathroom , men followed , physically fighting with her and trying to take cell phone pictures between her legs .
A professor then tried to hide her in another classroom , but 700 students massed outside , shouting , " Let her out Professor , we want to rape her . "
As she finally left , escorted by police , some students took videos , including the one above , where you can hear chants of " puta " or " whore . "
Uniban chose to respond to the situation by expelling Arruda .
And rather than doing so by contacting her directly , the university decided to take out an ad in Sao Paulo newspapers Sunday titled " Educational Responsibility - Education Is Made With Attitude Not Complacency , " explaining that it was kicking out Arruda because her dress and actions provoked " a collective reaction in defense of the school environment . "
Uniban 's lawyer Josias de Souza helpfully added that Arruda was responsible for her harassment , explaining , " she always liked to provoke boys , the problem was not with her clothes , but the way she acts , talks , crosses her legs , and walks . "

Arruda says she was initially told she'd be allowed to return to class with a security escort , and she 's rightly outraged at how Uniban has handled the attacks on her .
" I was the victim , " she says .
" How can I be expelled ?
It 's absurd . "
From the outside , the whole situation does seem absurd , and not in any sort of amusing way .
Reuters quotes an online commenter who says the hysteria over a mere miniskirt was " pure hypocrisy ...
Once February and the Carnival comes round everyone will be naked and no one will find it abnormal . "
The Toronto Star points out that " although Brazil is known for its skimpy attire , especially in beach cities , most college students dress more modestly on campus – commonly in jeans and T - shirts . "
Indeed , most of the students in the video above appear to be dressed in jeans , but that does n't give them the right to attack Arruda or threaten her with rape .
And psychologist Ana Fraiman , interviewed on a Brazilian television show , doubts whether moral outrage over Arruda 's skimpy attire was even the real issue .
She says ,
What we saw here was a case of mass hysteria , a false moralism .
This situation simply dragged the students into it because this fact was probably more interesting than the classes they were taking .

Since Uniban is apparently one of the worst universities in Brazil , this last statement sounds pretty apt .
A clearer dress code , as recommended by Minister Nilcéa Freire of Brazil 's Special Secretariat of Policies for Women , might make future incidents less likely , but even that is debatable — Arruda did n't cause her harassment and assault with her short dress any more than rape victims provoke their rapists with sexy clothes .
Rather , she appears to have been at the center of a deeply sexist mass hysteria , one that Uniban is only feeding by blaming her .
The university should be trying to root out the prejudices and pent - up rage that caused hundreds of students to turn on their classmate — instead , they 're sending the message that women who wear short skirts deserve to be called " whores . "
Perhaps now that the international press is paying attention , Uniban will change its tune , but it 's going to take a lot more than a dress code or security escort to make the campus truly safe for Arruda , or for any woman .

Der Vogonismus bezeichnet eine Verhaltensweise , mit der Informationen allgemein zugänglich in den Parteimedien verborgen werden .
Für den Fall , dass Parteimitglieder sich über mangelnde Information beschweren , verweisen die Vogonisten in der Regel auf die allgemeine Zugänglichkeit der Information .
Charakteristisch für den Vogonismus ist der Aufbau eines unüberschaubaren Netzes an Kommunikationskanälen und - formen , als auch die inkonsistente Nutzung der Kanäle , so dass Informationen nicht dort vorliegen , wo sie erwartet werden , selbst wenn vergleichbare Informationen bereits auf diesem
Wege verbreitet wurden .
Ein vogonistisches Informationssystem zeichnet sich dadurch aus , dass nur ein kleiner Kreis der Rezipienten mit der effektiven Nutzung der Informationskanäle vertraut ist , bzw .
gemacht wird .

Beispiele von Vogonismus in der Piratenpartei
Superministerium
Anlässlich der Ankündigung einer 2009 - 09 - 16 - Neues Ministerium in der das für den Fall einer Regierungsbeteiligung der Piratenpartei geplante Zukunftsministerium vorgestellt werden sollte , wurde ein Fall klassischen Vogonismusses sichtbar :
Von den damals etwa 8.000 Mitgliedern der Piratenpartei hatten laut Aussage des Autors etwa 50 Kenntnis des Entwurfes .
Es gab eine heftige Diskussion in den Parteimedien , insbesondere in den diversen Mailinglisten der Partei , als auch im Forum .
Die Diskussion wurde auch Gegenstand einer Sitzung des Bundesvorstandes und dort wurde unter Top 4 kundgetan :
TOP 4 : Zukunftsministerium ( Aaron ) Kritik : Die Idee wurde im Vorfeld nicht genug kommuniziert , Mitglieder fühlen sich übergangen .
Es ist nicht im Wahlprogramm drin .
Erwiderung der Projektverantwortlichen : Das ganze wurde offen im Wiki geplant , man hätte sich informieren können .
Wer das Wiki kennt , wird wissen , dass es die Anforderungen des klassischen Vogonimus bestens erfüllt , nämlich Informationen öffentlich zugänglich zu verstecken .

Diverse Mailinglisten sind auch als Newsgroup verfügbar , aber es gibt keine vollständie Liste darüber , welche das sind und welche ML welcher NG entspricht , lediglich eine Übersicht .
Wie kann die Piratenpartei Vogonismus verhindern ?

La Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación ( SCJN ) avaló la Norma Oficial Mexicana ( NOM ) 046- SSA2-2005 que ordena a todos los hospitales públicos interrumpir los embarazos resultados de violación sin necesidad de que la víctima denuncie el delito ante el Ministerio Público .
Para acceder a la interrupción del embarazo , la modificación a dicha norma establece que en el caso de niñas menores de 12 años , la solicitud se realizará por conducto del padre y/o la madre , o a falta de estos , su tutor .
Además , el personal de salud que participe en el procedimiento de interrupción voluntaria del embarazo no estará obligado a verificar el dicho de la solicitante , también se elimina el requisito de la autorización previa de la autoridad competente .
La Controversia constitucional 53/2016 fue promovida por el Poder Ejecutivo del Estado de Baja California , contra el Poder Ejecutivo Federal , demandando la invalidez de diversas disposiciones de la Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM - 190 - SSA1-1999 .
En la primera sesión del segundo período del año , el presidente de la SCJN , Arturo Zaldívar , recordó que ha votado reiteradamente por el derecho de todas las mujeres a interrumpir el embarazo , “ pero en el caso de violación , me parece que es casi incuestionable que ese derecho sea accesible , cercano y rápido " .
“ Me parecería muy grave poner requisitos excesivos e interpretaciones rigoristas de cómo se debe modificar una Norma Oficial Mexicana para no generar cierta incomodidad a las autoridades que la van a aplicar , perjudicando el derecho de las mujeres y las niñas ” , aseveró .
Zaldívar Lelo de Larrea advirtió que cuando en algunos lugares se aprecian regresiones contra los derechos de las mujeres , el alto tribunal tiene que mandar un mensaje muy claro de que se protejan los derechos de las mujeres .
“ Esta Norma Oficial Mexicana viene a hacer mucho más laxo , mucho más sencillo el acceso a ese derecho constitucional cuando las mujeres han sido violentadas de manera grave en su libertad sexual ” , añadió .
Esta norma es una forma de proteger a las mujeres y a las niñas , consideró que el Artículo 51 lo que quiere es que estas normas oficiales no inicien con un procedimiento muy abigarrado , cuando lo que urge es que se modifiquen para que sean claras y expeditas .
Resaltó que a partir de la reforma a la Ley General de Víctimas del 3 de mayo de 2013 , se prevé que a toda víctima de violación sexual se le garantice el acceso a servicios de anticoncepción de emergencia , a fin de generar un cambio de circunstancias jurídicas y fácticas , que obliga que la Norma Oficial Mexicana se adecue a esta situación .
A su vez , la ministra Norma Piña Hernández afirmó que esta norma es obligatoria para todos los órdenes de gobierno en términos del Sistema Nacional de Salud , pero su emisión es exclusiva de la Federación en términos del Artículo 13 , inciso a ) , fracción I , de la Ley General de Salud , de manera que los Estados no pueden alegar invasión de esferas competenciales vía controversia constitucional .
Mientras que la ministra Yasmín Esquivel Mossa dio a conocer que no comparte la invalidez de las disposiciones reclamadas en la Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM - 046 - SSA2-2005 , porque las nuevas obligaciones que incorpora esta norma se hicieron en acatamiento a lo dispuesto en la Ley General de Víctimas .
El magistrado Eduardo Medina Mora señaló que la materia de la que se desprende esta norma atiende una realidad dramática en el país en función de que , cuando hay circunstancia de violación , sobre todo en menores , particularmente en el sector rural , los activos de esos delitos son personas muy cercanas a las víctimas y , en consecuencia , hay un desincentivo dramático para denunciar .
En su turno , el magistrado Javier Laynez Potisek señaló que la norma , por lo que respecta a la mujer y a la mujer adolescente , simplifica , no complica ni agrega requisitos a un procedimiento que antes de esa modificación , efectivamente , resultaba sumamente tortuoso .
Recordó que en dos ocasiones la Segunda Sala concedió el amparo a mujeres víctimas de violación , y que conforme a la anterior Norma Oficial Mexicana , tenían que acreditar dicha violación , recurriendo forzosamente a acusar al agresor ante el Ministerio Público y esperar la autorización de éste para interrumpir el embarazo .
Consideró que es obligación , como Tribunal Constitucional , hacer una interpretación con perspectiva de género , máxime que en esta Norma Oficial Mexicana , se dice con toda claridad que las instituciones no están obligadas a corroborar el dicho de la víctima .
“ Es decir , no hay una carga para la institución , precisamente basados en el principio de buena fe prevista en el Artículo 5 de la Ley General de Víctimas , no se exige al hospital ni se responsabiliza a las instituciones de salud públicas estatales de tomar esta medida , porque ya no están obligadas a corroborar el dicho de la víctima ” , concluyó .

With the foregoing posts as background , I used the expanded dough calculating tool at http://www.pizzamaking.com/expanded_calculator.html to come up with the following recommended PJ dough clone formulation , which , based on the results I achieved , I believe represents a good starting point to make a very good PJ clone dough and pizza : Note : Dough ball weight = 21 oz . ( for a 14 " pizza ) ; a nominal thickness factor of 0.136419 ; bowl residue compensation = 1.5 % Before proceeding further , some comments are appropriate .
First , I used King Arthur bread flour ( KABF ) only because I do not have any high - gluten flour on hand .
Although a high - quality bread flour , like the KABF , is a very good choice based on my results using that flour , my recommendation to others is to consider using a high - gluten flour if it is available .
Typically , a high - gluten flour has a protein content of around 14 % , as compared with 12.7 % for the KABF .
Although it is not entirely clear what flour PJs is currently using ( it is a proprietary blend ) , in the past it has used high - gluten flour to prepare its dough .
Its current flour is described only as being a high protein flour ( see , for example , http://www.uppereast.com/papajohns.html ) .
For those who use the KABF and wish to supplement it with vital wheat gluten ( VWG ) to achieve an overall protein content comparable to a high - gluten flour , which is a method that I often use , I suggest that Novembers Mixed Mass Percentage Calculator at http://foodsim.toastguard.com/
be used to determine the amount of VWG to use to achieve the targeted protein content of the blend .
If I were to do this using the Hodgson Mill brand of VWG , the amount of KABF to use to achieve a targeted protein content of 14 % is 12.20 oz . ( 345.83 g. ) , and the amount of VWG to use is 0.30 oz . ( 8.6 g. ) , or about 2.85 t.
The comparable numbers for those using the Bobs Red Mill brand of VWG are 12.24 oz . ( 347.04 g. ) of KABF , and 0.26 oz . ( 7.39 g. ) , or 2.96 t. , of VWG .
Second , the amount of IDY ( instant dry yeast ) used in the above formulation is quite small - - equal to a bit less than 3/16 t. , or just under three of the pinch  measuring spoons for those who have mini-teaspoon sets such as shown , for example , at http://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/index.php/topic,5583.msg47264.html#msg47264.
For those who do not have mini measuring spoons , using 1/8 t. plus almost half again should come pretty close .
Third , as noted in the above table , I used a bowl residue compensation factor of 1.5 % , to compensate for minor dough losses during preparation of the dough .
That number turned out to be a reliable number .
I elected to use a fairly simple method to prepare the dough .
I started by adding the water ( I used bottled spring water ) , at a temperature of 55 degrees F , to the mixer bowl of my basic Kitchen Aid stand mixer .
I then added the salt and sugar to the water and stirred to fully dissolve , about one minute .
The oil was then added to the mixer bowl , followed by all of the flour .
( Normally , I would sift the flour to improve its hydration , but decided this time to skip that step to simplify the procedure . )
I used the flat beater attachment to combine all of the ingredients in the mixer bowl , at stir / speed 1 , for about a minute , or until the dough mass pulled away from the sides of the mixer bowl and collected around the flat beater .
In my case , there was no raw flour left in the bowl .
I then scraped the dough off of the flat beater ( it was shaggy and on the sticky side ) and switched to the C - hook attachment and kneaded the dough mass at stir speed , for about 2 minutes , or just until the dough gathered around the dough hook in a fairly cohesive , but still somewhat wet and sticky , mass .
At this point , I sprinkled the IDY over the dough mass in the mixer bowl .
This is a step that I have used many times before to help prolong the useful life of a dough .
For those who are interested , some of the theoretical and practical underpinnings of this step have been described in detail at this thread :
http://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/index.php/topic,3985.0.html.
The dough was then kneaded for about 5 - 6 minutes at speed 2 .
The finished dough weighed 21.30 ounces , corresponding to a thickness factor of 0.13837 ( or 0.13642 without the bowl residue factor ) , and had a temperature of around 78 degrees F , which was within the range of about 75 - 80 degrees F that I often use .
After about a minute of hand shaping and rounding , the dough ball was lightly oiled and placed in an oiled 1 - quart glass Pyrex bowl ( * Note : see the 3/31/14 EDIT below ) , covered with the accompanying plastic lid , and placed in the refrigerator .
To allow gases in the bowl to escape during fermentation while retaining the moisture of condensation , I had drilled a hole in the middle of the lid , the idea for which came to me from November ( I believe that Bill / SFNM does the same ) .
The dough remained in the refrigerator for five days .
During the first two days , there was little noticeable expansion of the dough .
It is unlikely that the dough could have been used during that time , because of insufficient fermentation .
On the third day , the dough started to expand , but slowly , and then appeared to level off in terms of its expansion .
The dough was used after about five days , which was within the window of usability ( 3 - 8 days ) that I believe applies to the dough balls used at PJs stores , as discussed in detail in Reply 1 in this thread .
From the appearance and firmness of the dough to the touch , I believe that it could have lasted at least a couple days more , but at the risk of increased extensibility .
Upon removal from the refrigerator , the dough was allowed to warm up at room temperature ( about 80 degrees F ) for about an hour .
In preparation for shaping and stretching the dough , I had made my own version of PJs Dustinator flour blend that is used by PJs pizza makers on the bench -- both on and in the dough skins -- when working with the dough balls to form skins , as well demonstrated in the YouTube videos referenced in Reply 1 .
To make a clone of the Dustinator flour blend , I used a combination of semolina flour , white flour ( KABF in my case ) , and soybean oil ( I worked a few drops into the flours ) .
The first photo below shows the dough ball as it warmed up on my work surface .
The flour blend shown is my Dustinator clone .
After I opened the dough ball to about 10 , in the same manner as noted in the videos , I used a dough docker ( mine has blunt metal pins rather than plastic pins ) but concluded that it was not really necessary .
The dough was quite extensible as it was , and was easy to shape and stretch out to the desired final size of 14  .
Because of the extensibility of the skin , I did not attempt to toss it in the air , as it is done at PJs .
I simply draped the skin onto a 14  pizza screen .
I made no attempt to form a rim for the pizzaonly a tug here and there to fit the skin to the screen .
This is the way I saw the workers at PJs do it ( and also in the videos ) .
To dress the pizza for baking , I started with 5.5 ounces ( by weight ) of pizza sauce , which was spread to about 1 ¼ of the edge of the pizza .
The pizza sauce I used was a clone sauce based on Escalons 6 - in - 1 fresh - pack tomatoes ( which is similar to the Stanislaus Tomato Magic product but without citric acid ) .
The actual composition of the clone sauce is set forth in Reply 8 at .
http://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/index.php/topic,6633.msg57044.html#msg57044.
After saucing the pizza , I distributed 9 ounces ( about two cups ) of diced low - moisture , part - skim mozzarella cheese ( Best Choice brand ) over the pizza .
Although I didnt do it with the pizza shown below in this post , I suggest that the cheese be distributed across the entire pizza , including random parts of the rim .
Any cheese that spills over the edge should then be retrieved and placed back on the pizza to maintain the weight of the cheese .
This method ensures that some of the cheese covers the rim , as is done at PJs , and creates a mottled effect on the rim when the cheese bakes and browns .
Had I used that approach , I think that the rim of my pizza would have more closely resembled the rims of the pizzas I bought from PJs .
I finished by placing 44 Hormel pepperoni slices over the entire pizza , in a pattern where the edges of the slices touched each other , as has been stated to be the proper procedure to be used at PJs .
However , before placing the pepperoni slices on the pizza , I allowed the slices to sweat at room temperature for about a half hour to induce release of some of the fat .
I then placed the slices between layers of paper towels and firmly pressed them together to absorb the released fat .
By doing this , I removed about 6 grams of fat , reducing the weight of the pepperoni slices from 88 grams ( 3.10 oz. ) to 82 grams ( 2.89 oz . ) .
This simple measure had the effect of reducing the oiling off of the pepperoni slices on the baked pizza , which had been a problem I was experiencing before instituting the new measure .
I hasten to add that this method may only work with a fairly high room temperature , which , in my case , was around 82 degrees F.
The dressed pizza was baked , on the 14  screen , on the lowest oven rack position , at around 500 degrees F ( preheated for 15 minutes ) , for about 8 - 9 minutes , or until the bottom of the crust was browned .
The remaining photos in this post show the finished pizza .
After the pizza was baked , I had the benefit of comparing it with a 14  pepperoni pizza that I had purchased from PJs .
The overall appearances of the two pizzas were somewhat different -- which I attributed mainly to the different ovens and bake protocols and the absence of cheese on the rim of my pizza -- but the sizes of the pizzas were essentially identical .
Similarly , the crust thicknesses at the rim and at the rest of the crust , and the texture ( soft and tender , and fluffy in parts ) and mouthfeel of the two pizzas were remarkably alike .
Both pizzas also behaved the same upon coming out of the oven -- with the slices being initially soft and flexible with drooping tips , and firming up only after being allowed to cool for several minutes .
As for differences , there was a slight difference in the two sauces , with mine having a slightly more noticeable oregano taste .
The PJ crust also seemed to be slightly less sweet than mine .
These differences suggest some possible experimentation or tweaking , for example , reducing the amount of oregano in future sauce batches or using a different variety of oregano ( my dried oregano is an Italian variety and is potent and aromatic ) and reducing the amount of sugar in the dough , for example , to something between 4 % and the 4.8 % I used .
Interestingly , when I did several side - by - side tests of reheated leftover slices of the two pizzas , I found them to be virtually indistinguishable .
To eliminate as much of the subjective component as possible , I cut the slices into small bite - size pieces and shuffled them around on my plate , without looking .
I then randomly picked them up off of the plate and ate them without examining them ( I actually closed my eyes ) .
I could not tell which pizza was which .
Some changes to the dough formulation that I hope to implement in future clones include sifting the flour ( KABF or equivalent ) to improve its hydration , and using vital wheat gluten ( for texture and flavor purposes ) .
I also plan to reduce the sugar to about 4 - 4.25 % .
I might also use a small amount of ascorbic acid ( Vitamin C ) as a dough conditioner for dough strengthening purposes .
As best I can tell from information that was provided to me by PJs , it does the same thing .

Once the dough ball has been formed and placed in its storage container , one can use the poppy seed trick as described at http://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/index.php/topic,6914.0.html to monitor the volume expansion of the dough during the course of its fermentation .

Lauren Wasson , 23 , of Garfield , was charged with obstruction of highways and aggravated assault after she allegedly threw her bicycle at Officer Shawn Dady , striking Officer Dady with it . "
Lauren was simply trying to slow down a moment so that another pedestrian could move out of her path .
A slideshow is available that clearly shows the women falling into Lauren 's path and the officers continuing to shove her despite the fact she was simply waiting for the women to move aside .
Let 's get as many signatures as we can and send them to Governor Edward Rendell demanding Lauren 's clemency !
Keywords : G20 , Pittsburgh , Bike girl , Lauren Wasson , Police brutality , Protests
Governor Rendell , We the undersigned respectfully ask for a pardon to be granted for Lauren Wasson for the charge of aggravated assault against a police officer as a result of what we feel was an example of police brutality against the suspect .
The only individual injured as a result of this incident was the suspect herself .
Had Ms. Wasson not have been shoved by officers into another citizen who had fallen down in front of her , then clearly her action of defense would not have been necessary .
Ms. Wasson has no prior criminal record , and we the undersigned feel the charges against her are too harsh considering the circumstances .
We thank you for your righteousness with the enacting of Act 134 , which you signed under House Bill 1543 on November 26 , 2008 helping convicted persons clear their name and having their records expunged .
We plead that you agree the charges being held against Lauren are too harsh and beg for your clemency governor .
We thank you for your consideration sir .
Sincerely , The Petition Signers
Two workers at a Lexington , Kentucky public library were fired after it was discovered that they had teamed up to keep a copy of Alan Moore 's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen : The Black Dossier out of circulation .
According to the story , Sharon Cook , 57 and Barbara Boisvert , 62 , basically colluded to keep the book out of circulation — Cook , who had become disturbed by the book 's imagery , checked it out for a year , meaning no one else could check it out .
However , when an 11 - year - old girl put it on hold , Cook was unable to continue her delaying tactic — and Boisvert stepped in , removing the hold , and keeping the book out of circulation .
Both were fired for their actions .
The Jessamine County Public Library has not commented on what they call a personnel matter .
Cook seems to have some kind of obsession with the book — she 's still carrying it around in her knapsack , the dirty parts marked with Post - Its .
This , despite what she describes as her mortal danger when reading the book :
" People prayed over me while I was reading it because I did not want those images in my head , " she says .
New York ( CNN ) --
For 19 - year - old Rodney Bradford , a simple Facebook status update turned into much more : a rock - solid alibi after he was accused of a crime .
Confirmation of the time stamp on the update and the location from which it was entered showed he could not have been at the scene of a robbery in another part of New York City .
After he had spent almost two weeks in jail , the case against him was dismissed .
The story began at 11:49 a.m. on Saturday , October 17 , when Bradford was updating his Facebook status at his father 's home in Harlem .
A minute later , 12 miles away in Brooklyn , two men were mugged at gunpoint .
The next day , Bradford , who is facing a separate 2008 robbery indictment , found out police were looking for him in connection with the Brooklyn robbery .
Bradford turned himself in , confident he would be cleared .
But after one of the victims picked him out of a lineup , he was charged with robbery in the first degree and sent to Rikers Island , home of the New York City jail .
It was n't until Rodney Bradford Sr. discovered his son's Facebook update that the young man 's defense attorney realized he had an unbeatable alibi .
" Throughout that week , " said the attorney , Robert Reuland , " I worked with the district attorney 's office and made them aware of who our alibis were , presented the Facebook evidence and generally tried to convince them that it would be wrong to proceed to an indictment in light of this evidence . "
The district attorney subpoenaed Facebook for documentation that would prove Bradford had updated his account from his father 's home in Harlem .
It worked .
" It all corroborated our alibis , " explained Reuland .
" The Facebook thing was really the icing on the cake .
I think , ultimately , it 's what prompted the DA to dismiss . "
The district attorney 's office would not comment on the story because the case is sealed .
Facebook officials said they are " pleased " they were " able to serve as a constructive part of the judicial process . "
The online social network is ready to join telephone records and video cameras as a means of establishing an alibi -- but the implications are both good and bad , says an intellectual property attorney versed in the medium .
" We 're in a much more trackable world , and for better and for worse , " said attorney Jonathan Handel .
" The extent to which it means that the right people get prosecuted and the innocent get their cases dropped , that 's all of the good . "
But , he said , the issue of privacy is also at stake .
And he pointed out that it could be argued the Facebook update was a set - up .
" On the Internet , nobody really knows it 's you , " he said .
" A kid could set up an alibi by setting up a Facebook update . "
Reuland finds that unlikely .
" This is a 19 - year - old kid .
He 's not a criminal genius setting up an elaborate alibi for himself , " he said .
" This is not the kind of thing someone would fake . "
And if someone were going to fake it , he said , " They 'd do it in a lot clearer way " than the inside joke that Bradford posted : " On the phone with this fat chick ... where my IHOP . "
The message was met with some incomprehension by reporters first writing about the story , who did n't quite understand the reference to the International House of Pancakes .
Reuland explained it this way :
The " fat chick " was a playful reference to Bradford 's pregnant girlfriend who was irked that he , his father and his stepmother had gone to an IHOP without her the night before .
The update teased that she wondered where her pancakes were .
" He was just kind of taunting her playfully about having been to IHOP , " Reuland said .
" I know it sounds not very nice but it 's sort of a reference to her because she 's pregnant .
But they actually have a very good relationship .
She 's cute as a button . "
Now that his innocence has been demonstrated , Bradford has hired civil attorney Herbert L. Schmell , who said they are " 99.9 percent sure " that they will be filing a civil suit against the city .
" Based upon what I see , there was no probable cause to arrest him at the time , " Schmell said .
" And to put him in Rikers for 12 or 13 days .
...
We 're seeking money damages .
He 's shook up . "
The Pirate Bay has been out of action for the best part of a day , after its Netherlands - based ISP was ordered to halt its service to the BitTorrent tracker site .
NForce , which TPB switched to last weekend , responded to a request from Dutch anti-piracy group Brein ( statement translated from Dutch to English ) yesterday to cut off service to the website .
The latest outage came just a few days after the site went titsup for about three hours last Friday .
It ’s understood that lawyers representing big name movie studios have been cracking down on ISPs that provide bandwidth to TPB , by threatening them with legal action .
In August Swedish web service provider Black Internet was ordered by Stockholm ’s district court to cut off its bandwidth supply to TPB or face a penalty of 500,000 kronor ( £ 43,000 ) a day .
It complied , but later said it would appeal the decision .
Prior to grabbing its bandwidth from NForce , TPB briefly shifted to a Ukrainian ISP that was also sucker - punched with legal threats .
At time of writing TPB was still out of operation , and it 's unclear when the site might come back to life . ®
Members of India ’s transgender community have won recognition from state election officials who agreed to add the category “ other ” to forms and web pages asking for gender identity .
Until now , hijras ( eunuchs ) , hermaphrodites , transvestites and transsexuals had only the choice of selecting “ male ” or “ female ” when registering to vote or completing other business with the Election Commission .
The decision by the election officials follows a landmark ruling by the Delhi High Court in July that legalized gay sex between consenting adults .
Advocates hailed the changes as signs of progress in a country where the estimated 500,000 hijras have faced entrenched discrimination .

The plot could n't be simpler or its attack on capital punishment ( and the act of killing in general ) more direct - a senseless , violent , almost botched murder is followed by a cold , calculated , flawlessly performed execution ( both killings shown in the most graphic detail imaginable ) , while the murderer 's idealistic young defence lawyer ends up as an unwilling accessory to the judicial murder of his client .

Total Privately Owned Housing Starts
Builders Probably Broke Ground on Most U.S. Houses in 11 Months
Builders in October probably broke ground on U.S. houses at the fastest pace in 11 months , and consumer prices held below the Federal Reserve ’s long - range goal , economists said reports today may show .
Housing starts rose 1.7 percent to an annual rate of 600,000 , the most since November 2008 , according to the median forecast of 77 economists in a Bloomberg News survey .
Government tax credits and lower prices and borrowing costs may spur residential sales and construction in coming months , indicating housing will help the economy recover .
“ Housing is starting to turn , ” said Michael Moran , chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. in New York .

Google is now eleven and a half years old , but it has never changed it ’s look drastically .
For Google what matter s the most is simplicity .
Keeping the simplicity still simple , google is all set to to revamp it ’s search UI .
The new look and New underlying Search Caffeine will be rolled out slowly and effectively .
As a result , a small number of Google users should already see the new Google main page with a new look to the Search Options .
This will be released to everyone some time after the New Year .
This is how the new Google home page will look : ( click to enlarge )

Search Modes
Let ’s take a closer look at the changes .
Here ’s an overview of the new results page in testing :
“ We ’re basically looking at a new look and feel for Google , It ’s an overall cleaning up of the search results page . ” said Google
The search options appear in the left - hand column .
The former “ All results ” area that allowed you to switch between different types of searches ( images , news , maps and so on ) has been replaced with new tabs for these services :
Internally , Mayer said that Google calls “ modes . ”
For example , after searching for “ australia ” in the example above , you ’re in “ Everything ” mode .
But with a click on the Images tab , you can switch to “ image mode ” and get back image results , select News to get news results in “ news mode ” so on .
By default , Google guesses at the modes it thinks are most relevant to your search .
But the “ More ” tab gives you access to the full range of search services Google offers .
If you Video mode , and that ’s not automatically suggested , you can select More , choose Video and get those results :
As happens now , when you switch modes , the search options change .
In video mode , you get unique video filtering options such as duration of clip or to see only video in high quality :
What ’s more is the new area “ See also ” .
This section suggests other queries related to your original topic .
Google 3Pane
The most dramatic change in the design is that the search options window is permanently open , rather having to be manually toggled on , as is the case now .
That ’s right .
If the test proves successful , Google ’s almost certainly moving to a three “ pane ” format , with search tools and options located on the left , search results themselves in the middle and ads on the right .
Mayer said going left made the most sense .
Google continues to add new search features , and they need to be exposed to searchers somewhere .
Putting them at the top of the page pushes results down ; ads are already at the right .
Having the tools on the left , with the pane permanently opened , is something she said she ’s personally wanted for some time , but not everyone in the design team was convinced .
The test will be a final proof of how well it works with Google ’s audience .
“ While I wish we had gotten here sooner , I ’m excited to finally have it out . ”
Mayer added that Google had recently done nearly 50 mockups , all done independently , to examine results .
A three pane design was a common theme that kept coming up .
That made it final .
So what do you think about the new Design ?
Is it intuitive ?

The Crazy October Surprise Debunking Patently absurd reasoning in someone ’s argument can often tell you about the strength of the underlying facts .
If an argument is deceptive on its face , you might suspect the supporting facts are pretty fragile , too .
Email
Printer friendly Such was the situation in late 1992 as America reached an important turning point for whether the people would get to understand their recent history or not .
A bipartisan House task force wanted to debunk allegations that Ronald Reagan ’s campaign in 1980 had sabotaged President Jimmy Carter ’s negotiations with Iran about freeing 52 Americans , who were taken hostage 30 years ago this week .
That alleged act of treachery , making Carter look weak and inept , set the stage for Reagan ’s landslide victory on Nov. 4 , 1980 , exactly one year to the date after the hostages were seized .
But the suspicions about this so - called October Surprise case only reached a critical mass in 1991 - 92 after several years of disclosures about the Iran - Contra arms - for - hostages scheme .
Despite Republican denials about any secret pre-election 1980 dealings with Iran – and the anger that the allegations drew from influential neoconservatives in the Washington press corps – a House task force was created to examine the case , although without much enthusiasm and mostly with an eye toward debunking the suspicions .
By November 1992 , especially after President George H.W. Bush lost his reelection bid to Bill Clinton , the task force ’s determination to proclaim the Republican innocence had solidified .
The Democrats would be in control of the White House and Congress and were looking forward to bipartisan comity .
However , after Bush ’s electoral defeat , the floodgates that had long protected the Reagan - Bush team gave way .
To the dismay of the task force , evidence of Republican guilt poured in .
The new evidence was so powerful , including multiple corroborations of secret Republican meetings with Iranians behind Carter ’s back , that task force chief counsel Lawrence Barcella saw no choice but to extend the investigation several months and to rethink the planned debunking .
Barcella told me later that he approached Rep. Lee Hamilton , a centrist Democrat who was chairman of the task force , with a request to give the investigators three more months to evaluate the new evidence .
But Hamilton , who prides himself in coming up with bipartisan answers to questions that otherwise might spur partisan conflict , said no .
He ordered Barcella to wrap up the probe and to continue with the planned debunking .
Concocting Alibis Hamilton ’s refusal to extend the investigation forced the task force to improvise .
It found itself with no choice but to concoct a series of irrational alibis for key Republicans , especially for William Casey , Reagan ’s campaign chief in 1980 and later Reagan ’s CIA director .
For the debunking to work , Casey had to be accounted for on crucial days because various witnesses had placed Casey in Europe at secret meetings with Iranian emissaries , including cleric Mehdi Karrubi , then a foreign policy adviser to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .
So , the task force constructed one Casey alibi around the fact that Reagan ’s foreign policy aide Richard Allen had written Casey ’s home number down in his notes on a specific day .
Even though Allen had no record or recollection of reaching Casey that day , the task force cited the writing down of Casey ’s home number as proof that Casey was at home .
For another key day , Oct. 19 , 1980 , the task force relied on the unsupported memory of Casey ’s nephew Larry Casey , who claimed that his late father had called his brother , Bill Casey , that day and found him at work at the Reagan - Bush campaign headquarters in Arlington , Virginia .
Though Larry Casey had no corroboration for that memory , the task force cited it as “ credible ” and thus dismissed other evidence placing Casey in Paris at a meeting with Karrubi that day .
The task force stuck to its conclusion even though I had notified the task force that Larry Casey had given me , in a PBS Frontline interview in 1991 , an entirely different story for the same day .
Larry Casey insisted to me that he vividly remembered his parents having dinner with Bill Casey at the Jockey Club in Washington on Oct. 19 , 1980 .
” It was very clear in my mind even though it was 11 years ago , ” Larry Casey said .
But then I showed Larry Casey the sign - in sheets for the Reagan - Bush campaign headquarters .
The entries recorded Larry Casey ’s parents picking up Bill Casey for the dinner on Oct. 15 , four days earlier .
Larry Casey acknowledged his error , and indeed an American Express receipt later confirmed Oct. 15 as the date of the Jockey Club dinner .
In 1992 , however , Larry Casey had replaced the Jockey Club dinner with “ the phone call alibi , ” which he had not mentioned in the Frontline interview .
Though Larry Casey ’s alibi was anything but “ credible , ” the House task force accepted it as solid proof .
Bush ’s Whereabouts
An alibi for George H.W. Bush on that same day also had holes .
Bush – as the vice presidential nominee – was under Secret Service protection , so it should have been easy to establish his whereabouts , but it was n’t .
Bush ’s redacted Secret Service records listed one non-public trip on Oct. 19 , to the Chevy Chase Country Club , but it could not be corroborated either by club officials , Bush ’s supposed guests or his Secret Service team .
Another reputed movement by the candidate that afternoon was to the home of a personal friend , but the Bush administration refused to disclose the identity of the friend .
Eventually , in mid-1992 , the administration agreed to tell a few task force officials the name of the personal friend but only if the congressional investigators agreed not to interview the witness .
The task force accepted this peculiar arrangement , even though one might have thought that then - President Bush would have been eager to clear up any suspicions by allowing an interview .
No interview was ever conducted and the name of the supposed alibi witness remains secret from the American people .
Another person connected to the alleged Paris meeting on Oct. 19 , 1980 , CIA officer Donald Gregg , also struggled to come up with an alibi , ultimately producing a photograph of himself in bathing trunks at a beach .
On the back of the photo , there was a stamp showing that the photo had been processed in October 1980 , a point that proved nothing .
There were other problems with the alibis .
Documents that investigators expected to find , such as Casey ’s 1980 passport and key pages from his calendar , had disappeared .
Meanwhile , as December 1992 wore on , more and more evidence was arriving implicating Republicans in 1980 contacts with Iranians , including the sworn testimony of the biographer for the chief of French intelligence Alexandre deMarenches .
The biographer , journalist David Andelman , said deMarenches had described arranging meetings between Republicans and Iranians in the summer and fall of 1980 , with one meeting held in Paris in October .
But deMarenches demanded that the story be kept out of his memoir to protect the reputations of his friends , George H.W. Bush and William Casey , Andelman said .
Andelman ’s testimony corroborated longstanding claims from a variety of international intelligence operatives about a Paris meeting involving Casey and Bush .
But the task force brushed Andelman ’s testimony aside , paradoxically terming it “ credible ” but then claiming it was “ insufficiently probative . ”
Contemporaneous Report
The task force also was aware of contemporaneous knowledge about the alleged Bush - to - Paris trip by Chicago Tribune reporter John Maclean .
Maclean , the son of author Norman Maclean who wrote A River Runs Through It , said a well - placed Republican source told him in mid-October 1980 about Bush ’s secret trip to Paris to meet with Iranians on the U.S. hostage issue .
After hearing this interesting tidbit , Maclean passed on the information to David Henderson , a State Department Foreign Service officer .
Henderson recalled the date as Oct. 18 , 1980 , when the two met at Henderson ’s Washington home to discuss another matter .
For his part , Maclean never wrote about the Bush - to - Paris leak because , he told me later , a Reagan - Bush campaign spokesman denied it .
As the years passed , the memory of the leak faded for both Henderson and Maclean , until the October Surprise story bubbled to the surface in the early 1990s .
Henderson mentioned the meeting in a 1991 letter to a U.S. senator that was forwarded to me .
In the letter , Henderson recalled the conversation about Bush ’s trip to Paris but not the name of the reporter .
A Frontline producer searched some newspaper archives and found a story about Henderson that Maclean had written .
Though not eager to become part of the October Surprise story in 1991 , Maclean confirmed that he had received the Republican leak .
He also agreed with Henderson ’s recollection that their conversation occurred on or about Oct. 18 , 1980 .
But Maclean still declined to identify his source .
The significance of the Maclean - Henderson conversation was that it was a piece of information locked in a kind of historical amber , untainted by later claims and counter - claims .
One could not accuse Maclean of concocting the Bush - to - Paris allegation for some ulterior motive , since he had n’t used it in 1980 , nor had he volunteered it a decade later .
He only confirmed it when approached by Frontline and even then was n’t particularly eager to talk about it .
Still , in December 1992 , Hamilton had issued the order to end the investigation with a finding of Republican innocence – and contrary facts were not going to get in the way of that mission .
[ For a full accounting of the October Surprise evidence , see Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
Avoiding Dissent
For the task force , all that was left to do was to run the report past some bored congressmen and hope that no one looked too closely at the evidentiary gaps and the irrational alibis .
That plan mostly worked but a staff aide to Rep .
Mervyn Dymally of California spotted some of the absurd alibis .
One of those alibis was the bizarre claim that Richard Allen writing down Casey 's home phone number proved that Casey was at home .
Another alibi was that because a plane flew from San Francisco directly to London on another key date , Casey must have been onboard , even though actual documentary evidence refuted that .
According to sources who saw Dymally 's dissent , it argued that " just because phones ring and planes fly does n't mean that someone is there to answer the phone or is on the plane . "
But Dymally 's reasonable observations were fiercely opposed by Hamilton .
Hamilton warned Dymally , who was retiring from Congress , that he would " come down hard " on Dymally if the dissent were not withdrawn .
The next day , Hamilton fired all the staffers who had worked on Dymally 's Africa subcommittee .
Seeing the firings as retribution ( though Hamilton denied a connection ) , Dymally relented and withdrew the dissent , which was never made public .
With that obstacle cleared , the task force report was shipped off to the printers .
The report was scheduled for release on Jan. 13 , 1993 , just one week before George H.W. Bush ’s Presidency officially would come to an end .
But there was still one more surprise for the October Surprise task force .
On Jan. 11 , 1993 , Hamilton received a response to a query he had sent to the Russian government on Oct. 21 , 1992 , requesting any information that Moscow might have about the October Surprise case .
The Russian response came from Sergey V. Stepashin , chairman of the Supreme Soviet ’s Committee on Defense and Security Issues , a job roughly equivalent to chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee .
In what might have been an unprecedented act of cooperation between the two longtime enemies , Stepashin provided a summary of what Russian intelligence files showed about the October Surprise charges and other secret U.S. dealings with Iran .
In the 1980s , after all , the Soviet KGB was not without its own sources on a topic as important to Moscow as developments in neighboring Iran .
The KGB had penetrated or maintained close relations with many of the intelligence services linked to the October Surprise allegations , including those of France , Spain , Germany , Iran and Israel .
History had shown , too , that the KGB had spies inside the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies .
So , Soviet intelligence certainly was in a position to know a great deal about what had or had not happened in 1980 .
The Supreme Soviet ’s response was delivered to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow by Nikolay Kuznetsov , secretary of the subcommittee on state security .
Kuznetsov apologized for the “ lengthy preparation of the response . ”
It was quickly translated by the U.S. embassy and forwarded to Hamilton .
To the shock of the task force , the six - page Russian report stated , as fact , that Casey , Bush and others had met secretly with Iranian officials in Europe during the 1980 presidential campaign .
The Russians asserted that the Reagan - Bush team indeed had disrupted Carter ’s hostage negotiations , the exact opposite of the task force ’s conclusion .
As described by the Russians , the Carter administration offered the Iranians supplies of arms and unfreezing of assets for a pre-election release of the hostages .
The Iranians “ discussed a possible step - by - step normalization of Iranian - American relations [ and ] the provision of support for President Carter in the election campaign via the release of American hostages . ”
But the Republicans were making their own overtures to the Iranians , the Russian report said .
“ William Casey , in 1980 , met three times with representatives of the Iranian leadership , ” the report said .
“ The meetings took place in Madrid and Paris . ”
At the Paris meeting in October 1980 , “ R[obert ] Gates , at that time a staffer of the National Security Council in the administration of Jimmy Carter and former CIA Director George Bush also took part , ” the Russian report said .
“ In Madrid and Paris , the representatives of Ronald Reagan and the Iranian leadership discussed the question of possibly delaying the release of 52 hostages from the staff of the U.S. Embassy in Teheran . ”
Both the Reagan - Bush Republicans and the Carter Democrats “ started from the proposition that Imam Khomeini , having announced a policy of ‘ neither the West nor the East , ’ and cursing the ‘ American devil , ’ imperialism and Zionism , was forced to acquire American weapons , spares and military supplies by any and all possible means , ” the Russian report said .
The Republicans just won the bidding war .
” After the victory of R. Reagan in the election , in early 1981 , a secret agreement was reached in London in accord with which Iran released the American hostages , and the U.S. continued to supply arms , spares and military supplies for the Iranian army , ” the Russian report continued .
The deliveries were carried out by Israel , often through private arms dealers , the Russian report said .
What to Do The matter - of - fact Russian report was stunning .
It also matched other information the task force had .
The task force had discovered that the Israelis , for example , had shipped U.S. military spares to Iran in 1981 , with the secret acquiescence of senior Reagan - Bush administration officials .
Hamilton and his task force faced a quandary about what to do with the explosive Russian report , which – if accurate – made the task force report , which was then at the printers , not worth the paper it was being printed on .
Reputations , including Hamilton ’s , could have been severely damaged .
During his days as House Intelligence Committee chairman in the mid-1980s , Hamilton had come under criticism for ignoring early evidence about Oliver North ’s secret contra-supply operations and getting blindsided by the covert military shipments to Iran in 1985 - 86 .
When the Iran - Contra scandal finally broke in late 1986 , Hamilton was named co-chairman of the investigative committee and quickly bought into White House cover stories that were later shattered by Iran - Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh .
In January 1993 , if Hamilton had to renounce his own October Surprise report , he might have been left with a tattered reputation , known as the Republicans ’ favorite chump .
He might not have built a glittering post - congressional career as a well - regarded senior statesman invited to sit on important panels like the 9/11 Commission and the Iraq Study Group .
So , in January 1993 , Hamilton and the task force decided to bury the Russian report .
“ We got the stuff from the Russians just a few days before ” the task force ’s own report was set for release , Barcella told me in an interview in 2004 .
“ We were n’t going to be able to look into it , whether it was new information , disinformation or whatever it was . ”
When I asked him why the task force did n’t just release the Russian report along with the task force report , Barcella responded that the Russian report was classified , precluding its disclosure to the public .
There was no interest in pressing for its declassification , though Hamilton would have been in a strong position to do so and presumably the incoming Clinton administration would have cooperated .
Instead , the Russian report was simply boxed up and filed away with other unpublished information that the task force had collected in its year - long investigation .
Barcella said he envisioned the material ending up in some vast government warehouse , “ like in the movie ‘ Raiders of the Lost Ark . ’ ”
Actually , the Russian report found an even less elegant resting place .
In late 1994 , I discovered the task force ’s documents , including the Russian report , in boxes that had been piled up in a former Ladies Room in an obscure office off the Rayburn House Office Building ’s parking garage .
[ To examine the key “ Ladies Room ” documents , click here . ]
Having hidden the Russian report and other incriminating evidence , Hamilton and his task force turned next to managing how the Washington press corps would treat the debunking report .
The task force briefed friendly reporters making sure the debunking conclusion got wide dissemination .
Then , a news conference was held on Jan. 13 , 1993 , to release the task force ’s findings .
However , copies of the task force report were not given to reporters beforehand .
In a strange process , copies of the task force report were kept shrink - wrapped at the front of the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing room while Hamilton and his Republican co-chairman Henry Hyde conducted the news briefing , followed by questions mostly from reporters who had already bought into the debunking .
Copies of the task force report were only handed out after the news conference was over .
Then , to ensure that there would be little or no second - guessing , Hamilton composed an op -ed for the New York Times that was entitled “ Case Closed . ”
The article cited the supposedly solid alibis for the whereabouts of Casey as the key reason why the task force findings “ should put the controversy to rest once and for all . ”
[ NYT , Jan. 24 , 1993 . ]
Floor Speech
Ten days later , Henry Hyde took to the House floor to gleefully mock anyone who still doubted the October Surprise innocence of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush .
During a " special order " speech , the white - haired Hyde did acknowledge some weaknesses in the House task force findings .
Casey 's 1980 passport had disappeared , as had key pages of his calendar , Hyde admitted .
Hyde noted , too , that French intelligence chief deMarenches had told his biographer that Casey did hold hostage talks with the Iranians in Paris in October 1980 .
Several French intelligence officials had corroborated that assertion .
But Hyde insisted that two solid blocks of evidence proved that the October Surprise allegations were false .
Hyde said his first cornerstone was hard - rock alibis for Casey and other key suspects .
" We were able to locate [ Casey 's ] whereabouts with virtual certainty " on the dates when he allegedly met with Iranians in Europe to discuss the hostages , Hyde declared .
( Those alibis included Allen ’s writing down Casey ’s home phone number and Casey ’s nephew recalling his father chatting with Casey on a specific day a dozen years earlier . )
Hyde also cited an alibi placing the late Iranian financier / CIA operative Cyrus Hashemi in Connecticut on a weekend when Hashemi ’s brother , Jamshid , had testified under oath that Cyrus was with Casey and Iranian emissary Mehdi Karrubi in Madrid .
That “ alibi ” rested on phone records showing two one - minute calls , one from a lawyer to Hashemi 's home and one back to the lawyer .
There was no evidence that Hashemi received or made the calls , and the pattern more likely fit a call asking a family member when Hashemi was due home and the second call giving the answer .
FBI Wiretaps
The second debunking cornerstone , Hyde said , was the absence of anything incriminating on FBI wiretaps of Cyrus Hashemi over five months in late 1980 and early 1981 when he was under suspicion for his secret dealings with Iran .
" There is not a single indication that William Casey had contact with Cyrus or Jamshid Hashemi , " Hyde said .
" Indeed , there is no indication on the tapes that Casey or any other individuals associated with the Reagan campaign had contact with any persons representing or associated with the Iranian government . "
But Hyde was wrong about the absence of incriminating evidence on the Hashemi wiretaps , although they were still secret in 1993 so Hyde ’s argument was impossible to judge .
However , when I accessed the raw House task force documents in late 1994 , I found a classified summary of the FBI bugging .
According to that summary , the bugs revealed Cyrus Hashemi deeply enmeshed with Republicans on arms deals to Iran in fall 1980 as well as in financial schemes with Casey 's close friend and business associate , John Shaheen .
And contrary to Hyde 's claim of " not a single indication " of contact between Casey and Cyrus Hashemi , the Iranian banker was recorded as boasting that he and Casey had been " close friends " for years .
That claim was supported by a CIA memo which stated that Casey recruited Cyrus Hashemi into a sensitive business arrangement in 1979 , a year before the October Surprise machinations .
Beyond that , the secret FBI summary showed Hashemi receiving a $ 3 million offshore deposit , arranged by a Houston lawyer who said he was a longtime associate of George H.W. Bush .
The Houston lawyer , Harrel Tillman , told me in an interview that in 1980 , he was doubling as a consultant to Iran 's Islamic government .
After Ronald Reagan ’s election in November 1980 , Tillman was back on the line promising Hashemi help from the " Bush people " for one of his foundering business deals .
Then , the FBI wiretaps picked up Hashemi getting a cash payment , via a courier arriving on the Concorde , from the corrupt Bank of Credit and Commerce International ( BCCI ) .
The House task force had concealed these documents , allowing Hamilton and Hyde to miswrite an important chapter of recent American history .
Another irony of the falsified October Surprise history was that Hamilton ’s wished - for bipartisanship never materialized .
The Republicans pocketed the Democratic readiness to cover up for Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush – and then launched a partisan war against Bill Clinton .
To this day , now 30 years after Iranian radicals seized the American hostages , the real story of what happened and how the Republicans manipulated the process remains mostly unknown .

Rand Paul Hauls $ 1.1 m for Senate Race
Created : October 02 , 2009 16:39 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The son of Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Tex . ) handily beat Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson ( R ) in the first quarter , raising $ 1.1 million to Grayson ’s $ 600,000 .
As I noted when Paul first got into the race , his ability to raise a lot of money from a national base is going to muddle Republicans ’ strategy in the state – the party has not made an endorsement , but Grayson polls better than Paul at the moment .

Limits are things that cause great controversy within the lifestyle .
As one moves further out on the spectrum towards the extreme , many believe that hard limits do not exist .
I am not a proponent of this belief .
There can be certain things that are off limits no matter what the makeup of the relationship .
Even slaves have certain things they cannot overcome .
To expect people to engage in activities which is potentially dangerous to that person is foolhardy and unsafe .
Limits need to be respected .
While there are truly hard limits which many cannot overcome , there are also those things that people will say are limits which are nothing more than walls of the mind .
A limit is something that cannot be overcome because it is dangerous for that person to engage in that particular behavior .
For example , if one was anally molested as a child , anal sex could be something this person cannot partake in .
I once had one who was blindfolded while she was raped as a child .
Thus , whenever anyone tried to blindfold her , she would have flashbacks to that point in time .
Obviously this was a hard limit for her .
To relive those experiences put her in psychological peril .
When you view something as uncomfortable , gross , or embarrassing , that is not a limit .
Many , especially when they are new , say they will not do a certain thing .
The reasoning is simple ; he or she does not want to do it .
That is not justification for classifying something as a limit .
Instead , it is another form of topping from the bottom .
Limits are serious and when one starts to " water down " the concept by attributing nonsense to this , it makes for a perilous relationship .
A good Dom or Master will help a submissive find his or her limits while assisting to get past them .
Nevertheless , something that is considered embarrassing is not a limit that is overcome .
Remember this idea the next time you are apt to throw out the " limit " idea .
Is there a real justification for you not being able to partake in this activity ?
If so , then it is a hard limit .
Yet , if you can only conclude the reasoning is that you do not want to do it , then you are manipulating the relationship .
I find that people who do this are like the boy who cried wolf .
When a true limit is uncovered , the trust from the dominant one is gone .
It is impossible to take someone seriously who always cries " hard limit " .
Atlanta , Georgia ( CNN ) --
The H1N1 virus has afflicted another celebrity victim .
Shawn Stockman of the R&B group Boyz II Men has been diagnosed with the illness , fellow group members Wanya Morris and Nathan Morris told CNN .
The pair said Stockman was unable to accompany them to Atlanta on Tuesday for a scheduled performance at the 2009 Soul Train Awards .
" We tour eight months out of the year , and we are always traveling around , " Nathan Morris said .
" It 's hectic for us always being in airplanes and airports .
He got sick , and it hit him pretty hard . "
The Grammy - winning and platinum - selling group , known for their No. 1 singles " End of the Road " and " I'll Make Love to You , " has a new album out in stores in November called " Love . "
Wanya and Nathan Morris still planned to perform at the awards show as a duo , according to the group 's manager .
" We go all over the world really , so I am surprised it has n't happened earlier , to be honest , " Nathan Morris said .
" I talked to [ Stockman ] today , and he is doing much better . "
Stockman joins a growing list of stars who have fallen prey to the swine flu , including the Backstreet Boys ' Brian Littrell and " Harry Potter " star Rupert Grint .
The prison was opened in the wake of the September 2001 attacks
The US Congress has cleared the way for the government to continue to transfer inmates held at the Guantanamo camp in Cuba to the US but only to face trial .
The Senate vote , which follows approval in the House last week , clears one of the hurdles facing President Barack Obama as he seeks to close Guantanamo .
But the measure does not allow those convicted to be imprisoned in the US nor permit those cleared to stay .
Mr Obama has set a 22 January deadline for closing the detention centre .
More than 220 inmates are still held at the Guantanamo camp which was opened after the 11 September attacks .
The bill , which must now be signed into law by President Obama , was passed by 79 to 19 votes in the Senate as part of a larger budget bill for the Department of Homeland Security .
The US justice department has said that it intends to decide by mid-November which detainees will stand trial and what kind of court they will face .
ANALYSIS Richard Lister
BBC Washington correspondent
This legislation represents the clearing of a potential roadblock for President Obama as he considers the vexed task of closing the Guantanamo Bay prison camp .
It is largely an extension of current policy , but given the fierce resistance in the US to letting Guantanamo inmates onto its soil for any reason , even preserving the status quo represents a small victory .
What this bill does not offer is any help on the question of what happens to those inmates once they have been through a judicial process .
The legislation does not allow those acquitted to stay in the US , and those convicted will not be able to serve their sentences in US prisons .
Under the terms of the bill , Congress must be provided with a detailed assessment of the security risk involved before a detainee can be brought to the US .
The administration must also give 15 days ' notice of any transfer .
Some Republicans have objected to plans to hold Guantanamo detainees in US prisons , arguing that they do not deserve the protections afforded under US law .
" There is too much at stake to grant the unprecedented benefit of our legal system 's complex procedural safeguards to foreign nationals who were captured outside the United States during a time of war , " said Senator Saxby Chambliss during the debate .
" Guantanamo must be closed because it's become a recruiting tool for al - Qaeda and other terrorist , " Senator Dick Durbin said .
Under the bill , those convicted will not be able to serve their sentences in US prisons , and those cleared will not be allowed to stay , even when no other country will accept them .
That matter is to be decided by future legislation or by the Supreme Court - which has announced it will hear an appeal by a group of Chinese ethnic Uighurs , who are still being held at Guantanamo despite being deemed to pose no risk .
Their lawyers argue that they should be allowed to resettle in the US rather than China , where as ethnic Muslim Uighurs they would be subjected to persecution .

Here 's the deal , The Little App Factory was contacted recently by Apple 's legal eagles informing the Australian shareware company that the name of their software iPodRip , that they 've been distributing since 2003 , had violated several of Apple ’s trademarks .
In fact , iPodRip has seen over 5 million downloads before hitting Apple 's radar .
In an attempt to preserve the epic iPodRip namesake , CEO John Devor penned a heartfelt plea for help in a letter addressed to Steve Jobs , Apple 's best and brightest mind .
Mr. Jobs neatly summed up his own solution to the problem and then kindly responded to Devor in an email sent direct from his personal iPhone .
" Change your apps name .
Not that big of a deal . "
Steve Sent from my iPhone November 19 , 2009 5:18 PM
The shareware in question , now safely renamed iRip , lets you copy and transfer your songs from an iPod and iPhone back to your computer .
It appears that the response from Jobs is quite possibly the best thing that 's happened to The Little App Factory in a long time .
Proving once again , as it's been true for several iPhone app developers , " rejection is the new acceptance " .
Delivering more attention for Devor 's company in the press than he could have ever afforded to purchase otherwise .
So go ahead and download a copy of iRip for yourself .
You have Steve Jobs to thank for it .
The man is a marketing genius who understands how to re-invent .
For him , the re-branding concept was " no big deal " .
iRip is really a much better name anyhow and the new icon rocks .
iPodRip was so 2003 .
All along , Mr. Obama ’s aides have said they knew that Congress might pass bills with serious flaws .
The White House strategy was to stand back and work with Congressional leaders to fix those flaws once the legislation entered its endgame .
The endgame is here .

For anyone who cares about reducing medical costs and improving outcomes , there are probably six big issues to follow in the coming weeks .
Let ’s take them one at a time :
THE EASY STUFF
Each year , about 100,000 people die from preventable infections they contract in a hospital .
When 108 hospitals in Michigan instituted a simple process to prevent some of these infections , it nearly eliminated them .
If Medicare reduced payments for the treatment of such infections , it would give hospitals a huge financial incentive to prevent them .
The Senate bill takes a small step in this direction by cutting payments to hospitals with high infection rates by 1 percent .
The House bill merely requires hospitals to report their rates publicly .
There are also other basic patient safety areas in which the bills can do much better .
WHAT WORKS ?
Earlier this year , I used prostate cancer as an example of how our fee - for - service medical system leads to higher costs and worse outcomes .
There are a handful of possible treatments for early - stage prostate cancer , and the fastest - growing are the most expensive .
But no one knows which ones work best .
Modern medicine is full of such uncertainty .
Again , the federal government could make a big difference here by giving Medicare a moderate amount of money for research , which would pay for itself many times over .
The stimulus bill began paying for such research , but the health reform bills fail to pick up where the stimulus leaves off .
A FED FOR HEALTH
Twice a year , an outside advisory board sends Congress a list of suggestions for Medicare payment rates , based on the available evidence .
Congress generally ignores them , in deference to the various industry groups that oppose any cuts to their payments .
We already have a wonderful model for how to avoid such interference .
It ’s called the Federal Reserve .
The Fed is charged with setting interest rates based on economic conditions , not politics .
The Senate bill would create such a commission for Medicare .
Unfortunately , it initially applies to doctors and home health care providers but not hospitals , thanks to a deal between the hospitals and the White House .
It expands to include everyone in 2019 .
The House bill has no such commission .

NOVEMBER 12--Meet Joshua Basso .
The Florida man was arrested yesterday after allegedly placing a series of obscene 911 calls during which he asked a female operator about her breasts and whether she would have sex with him .
When confronted by cops , Basso would not say whether he was masturbating while talking to the operator , as he claimed during the calls , according to a Tampa Police Department report .
Listen to an excerpt from one 911 call here :
The 29 - year - old rooming house resident admitted placing the calls , but " did not think he would get in trouble for calling 911 . "
That miscalculation resulted in Basso being charged yesterday with a misdemeanor count of misusing the 911 system ( he was booked into the Hillsborough County jail , where the mug shot at left was taken ) .
Asked why he chose to dial 911 from among " all the numbers he could have called , " Basso told police that his LG cell phone was out of minutes and he " called 911 because it was free . "
An excerpt from one of Basso 's calls -- which he placed while a shower was running in the background -- can he listened to above .
Basso appears to be pleasuring himself while an operator diligently tries to obtain his address .

WOODS CROSS --
An investigation begins Thursday into a refinery explosion at the Silver Eagle Refinery , located at 2355 S. 1100 West , that damaged several homes in the surrounding area and was felt several miles away from the facility .
Explosion shook homes , fire broke out
Jeff Bassett , with South Davis Fire , said his department was dispatched to the fire at 9:13 a.m .
When they arrived , Silver Eagle 's fire brigade was already putting the fire out , and it took only a few minutes to knock the flames down .
Surrounding refineries were putting off a lot of smoke , but that was due to power bumps caused by the initial explosion .
None of them was in any danger , according to Bassett .
Power has been restored .
The explosion was a result of a line carrying hydrogen and diesel fuel that leaked onto the ground .
It ignited , causing the large explosion and resulting fire .
Silver Eagle said it was working with the fire department to determine exactly what happened and what information would be released to the public .
A six - member team from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board is being deployed to the scene .
The team will be arriving Wednesday night and Thursday morning .
The CSB is an independent federal agency charged with investigating industrial chemical accidents .
Several nearby homes damaged
There were no injuries reported at the refinery or surrounding homes .
However , some homes were severely damaged .
The explosion was felt as far away as Roy .
We did n't know if it was the big earthquake or if a train had derailed .
– Paul Chavez
" I have family that lives in this area , and obviously you do n't want to see anyone hurt , let alone families that live around you .
So , absolutely a sigh of relief right now , " said Dave McSain , president of Silver Eagle Refinery .
Linda
Wood lives near the refinery .
She was n't home at the time of the explosion .
When she heard what happened , she rushed home to find her front door open , all the windows blown out and dishes on the floor .
There was also some damage to the foundation of the home , and her home was condemned .
" They said it blew it off the foundation .
You go in the backyard , you can see where it blew it off the foundation .
My front door was open , wide open , when I got here .
My garage would n't go up ; we forced it up .
I 'm really glad that I was n't here .
I probably would 've been hurt really badly , " Wood said .

Refinery has history of problems Wednesday 's explosion is n't the first problem at the Silver Eagle Refinery .
Federal investigators eyes were already focused on the refinery .
Pickup trucks pulling empty trailers arrived at Wood 's house all morning , preparing to empty the house of her belongings .
Wood 's house and the two next to hers seemed to have taken the brunt of the damage .
They are only about 200 yards away from the explosion .
Wood 's neighbor , Royd White , said , " It was almost like it was a delayed thing .
It was like a rumble , then it built .
You could feel , almost like the air was sucked out and blown back in .
And it lasted for several seconds , is what it felt like . "
Paul Chavez was visiting friends in the area .
He said , " I was meeting with my friend , and we were upstairs in the library , and we heard an initial blast .
We did n't know what type , what it was .
It felt like a second .
And the second one was a compression blast , where we actually felt it in our bodies , and the entire house shook for probably three to four seconds .
It seemed like it was much longer . "
Questions over safety
KSL News asked Silver Eagle 's safety manager how he feels about homes being built so close to the refinery .
" The neighbors came in long after the refinery did , and that 's about everything I can tell you , " safety manager Dan Beecher said .
In fact , Silver Eagle 's president said those homes were allowed to be built so close .
" I do n't really want to grapple with the city right now .
There is terminology in our field where they designate things as blat zones , and I would think that some of these would fall inside that , yes , " McSwian said .
Wednesday evening , refinery executives called a meeting of all the residents in the area .
They wanted to make sure that everyone affected by the explosion was contacted and that they know what 's going to be happening in the future .
Ironically , residents in the neighborhood just received a letter in the last few days inviting them to attend an open house a week from now regarding the refinery 's operations and the safety and environmental issues .

US Supreme Court rejects Taiwan case
DENIED
The court declined to hear an appeal by activist Roger Lin that claims the US has been the principal occupying power of Taiwan since the end of World War II
By William Lowther / STAFF REPORTER IN WASHINGTON
The US Supreme Court has refused to hear a lawsuit brought by Taiwanese activist Roger Lin ( 林志昇 ) that argues that the US is the principal occupying power of Taiwan and should still control it .
The terse rejection by the highest US court scuttles Lin ’s legal maneuvers in the US and at the same time could end an attempt by former President Chen Shui-bian ( 陳水扁 ) — sentenced to life in prison last month — to win his freedom through Washington .
Under a one - sentence ruling known as “ certiorari denied , ” the Supreme Court declined to hear the case and allowed a prior ruling to stand .
That ruling came in April when the US Court of Appeals sided with the US government on Lin ’s case and reaffirmed that US courts do not deal with political matters .
Legal analysts said in Washington on Monday night that as far as the US legal system was concerned , the case brought by Lin and expanded by Chen can go no further in the US and has been dismissed .
Lin first brought the case to US courts in December 2006 , arguing that Japan relinquished control over Taiwan and Penghu after World War II , but did not return it to China .
He wanted the US courts to decide what rights the Taiwanese have under the San Francisco Peace Treaty and the US Constitution , including whether they should be issued US passports .
Lin said the treaty did not ­address sovereignty over Taiwan and Penghu , and that the US was therefore still the principal occupying power .
Judges from the US Court of Appeals had some sympathy with Lin ’s arguments , but ruled in April : “ America and China ’s tumultuous relationship over the past 60 years has trapped the inhabitants of Taiwan in political purgatory .
“ During this time the people of Taiwan have lived without any uniformly recognized government .
In practical terms , this means they have uncertain status in the world community , which infects the population ’s day - to - day lives . ”
But they added : “ Determining Appellants ’ nationality would require us to trespass into a ­controversial area of US foreign policy in order to resolve a question the Executive Branch intentionally left unanswered for over sixty years : who exercises sovereignty over Taiwan .
This we cannot do . ”
The case took an unusual twist last month when Chen — convicted of taking bribes while in office — claimed Taiwan was still technically under US military occupation and that the Taiwanese government had no legal right to try or detain him .
Latching onto Lin ’s suit , Chen , 58 , filed his own case in the US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces in Washington .
The US financial news ­service Bloomberg quoted Shih Cheng - ­chuan ( 施正權 ) , a professor of international affairs at Tamkang University in Taipei , as saying : “ Chen Shui-bian is a desperate man and he is trying to use any trick to get out of jail .
There is little chance that the US will meddle with the case . ”
Coen Blaauw , executive director of the Washington - based Formosan Association for Public Relations , told the Taipei Times : “ Taiwan ’s future will not be determined in a court of law .
Only the people of Taiwan have the right to determine Taiwan ’s future .
There are no tricks or short cuts to full Taiwan independence , it might be a long and difficult road but it ’s the only way to go . ”
They call him the the new Che Guevara .
Loved and loathed in equal measure , Venezuela 's President Hugo Chávez has become the poster boy of the international left , revered by his disciples at home but reviled in Washington .
On the eve of Chavez 's visit to Britain , foreign affairs editor Peter Beaumont travels to Caracas and asks if the Castro - loving , Bush - hating , head of state is a revolutionary democrat or a dictator in the making ?
It is Sunday , and in Venezuela it 's time to watch President Hugo Chávez 's television programme .
This week he has taken his media roadshow to the town of El Tigre , where Aló Presidente is being broadcast from one of the cost - price supermarkets - known as Mercals - that he has set up to provide cheap food for the poor .
As always , the show 's main interest , its star , is the President himself .
In a red shirt worn over a red T - shirt , Chávez leaves his anchor 's table and strides through the store .
He picks goods off the shelf and reads aloud from the packets , which are printed with extracts from his constitution , and offers a little homily on each .
He is accompanied by a wilting and sweating Daniel Ortega , the former Nicaraguan President and Sandinista leader , who looks on baffled as Chávez maintains a breathless commentary on the micro-management of his ' Bolívarian revolution ' by way of the food basket .
' I should n't say I hope you win , because they will accuse me of sticking my nose into Nicaraguan internal affairs , ' Chávez jokes with Ortega at one point .
' But I hope you win ! '
However , it is not Nicaragua 's elections in November Chávez has on his mind but Venezuela 's presidential elections the following month .
For that reason , he is showing off the quality of food he is providing for the poor , who he can reasonably expect to keep him in power .
' Mmm ... smell that , ' says the President , opening a bottle of ketchup .
' Mmmm ! '
Ortega affirms when the bottle is shoved under his nose .
A packet of coffee is presented next .
' We should put on the packet that it is 100 per cent Venezuelan , ' says Chávez .
' We are going to keep increasing production every year .
First for national consumption , then we are going to do something else .
Maybe start exporting .
Dunno where ...'
The whirlwind of words continues .
Chávez talks to checkout staff .
He puts his hand on a woman's arm as she explains that she has just completed her high school degree in one of the special schools Chávez has set up .
' In July , 30,000 people are going to graduate , ' Chávez tells her .
' Then you are going to go to a college of further education .
Then you 'll study nursing ...'
He greets and kisses other staff before returning to where he started , at his desk .
But there is another side to this touchy - feely President , friend of Venezuela 's poor .
That is the international revolutionary fi ebrand who talks about the ' coming war with the US ' for which he has warned his people to prepare ; the friend of Cuba 's Fidel Castro ; and the figure at the apex of the rapid left - wing swing of South America .
This is the man described by US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as ' Hitler ' and by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as the ' most dangerous in the region ' - a role that Chávez has gleefully and aggressively played up to , in turn calling Bush ' Mr Danger ' and occasionally ' asshole ' .
( On Rice , Chávez has suggested ' her problem ' is sexual frustration . )
The ability of Chávez to prick the US has been made possible not by a large and modern army , or weapons of mass destruction , or support for terror , but by the simple fact of America 's large dependence on Venezuelan oil in the middle of an oil crisis .
Chávez , a visceral opponent of the influence of America in a Latin America that , like his 19th - century predecessor Simón Bolívar , he would like to lead , has found his dangerous global stage .
As self - appointed champion against ' the murderer '
Bush , he has acted as ringmaster to those who loathe America 's First Man : film stars , musicians , unionists , statesmen and writers .
Later this month he arrives in London where he will be entertained by Mayor Ken Livingstone , a long - time Chávez supporter who has accused the US of trying to undermine democracy in Venezuela .
Chávez has constructed alliances with everyone the White House hates most - including the Iranian President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and Evo Morales , the left - wing Bolivian President and former coca farmers ' leader .
And Chávez has included Morales in his ' axis of good ' with Castro in his struggle with the US .
In doing so , Chávez has plugged himself into a series of key international issues that have given him an influence way beyond Venezuela 's normal status in world aff airs .
On issues as diverse as the anti-globalisation movement , Latin America 's future political shape , oil , Iran , and even America 's relationships with India and China , Chávez is there stirring it up .
At home , the people will tell you that all you need to know about the Presidente is on display in Aló Presidente .
There he is : enthusiastic , verbose and sometimes staccato - the Castro of an era brought up on soap operas and reality TV .
He grazes on ideas as they occur to him .
Sometimes they run into the sand .
He encourages and fires officials .
He sketches the line of planned roads and jokes about his sex life .
There are lengthy denunciations of the evils of capitalism and the US .
He relates anecdotes from his life appropriate to the day 's message .
Sometimes he sings in a not unpleasant voice .
But what keeps Venezuela 's media and political classes glued to The Voice for hours on end is the knowledge that Chávez governs his country via his show .
If it has not happened on Aló Presidente on Sunday , Venezuelans think , it has not really happened .
I start watching Aló Presidente near the ugly concrete centre of the capital , Caracas , in a fast food restaurant smelling of criollo , the national dish .
One customer stands staring at Chávez on the overhead T V screen .
Later he says proudly : ' That 's my President , that is . '
I recognise the same look later , when I watch more of the show in an apartment in a slum barrio .
It is the expression worn by many of those poor and ordinary Venezuelans invited on to Chávez 's show and it borders on adoration .
It is also a look of deep familiarity .
He may be President , the faces say , but he 's also one of us .
On average , Chávez 's voice is present in their lives for 40 hours a week in speeches , proclamations and media events , including Aló Presidente .
His critics , largely in the middle class - led opposition , have wondered when he finds time to be President .
The chavistas ( Chávez 's supporters ) call his opponents escualidos - ' squalid-ones ' , after their efforts to depose him .
They tried once with a farcical coup that lasted two days in 2002 and was defeated by street power when his supporters among the poor demanded to speak to Chávez : to hear from him that he had really ' resigned ' .
The escualidos tried again by way of the constitution , trying to force early elections with a recall referendum - a gambit that also failed .
Chávez 's supporters have no doubts about how he spends his time .
They are the main beneficiaries of his misiones , the multi-billion dollar programmes that have provided the Mercals and schools and universities for the poor , financial benefi ts and healthcare at the hands of 17,000 guest Cuban doctors housed in the poorest areas .
It is a support that verges on religious devotion .
I hear , but cannot confirm , that there are some who pray to images of Chávez .
And nowhere is that devotion more strongly felt than in the Caracas barrio of 23 de Enero ( 23 January ) where Chávez himself votes .
This is a place of decrepit tower blocks and box housesthat hang precariously from the slopes of the hills surrounding the city .
It is not just the danger of landslide that makes this a risky place .
One housing block is known as the Seven Men and is home to the barrio's most dangerous gangsters .
Across the barrio , huge colourful murals depict Chávez fl anked by the two key figures in the mythology of his revolution : Che Guevara and Simón Bolívar , the 19th - century Venezuelan ' liberator ' of South America from Spanish colonial rule .
It is to this slum that revolutionary tourists from around the world are taken by the chavistas to see Hugo 's good works .
For Chávez , like Ortega and the Sandinistas in the 1980s , has become a totem for the international left .
They come to study for a few months at the ' Bolívarian '
University , live in the barrios or volunteer for one of his projects before going home as apostles of his revolution .
Many visitors are led first into the presence of Lisandro Perez , better known by his nom de guerre of ' Mao ' , the chief of the municipality .
' Mao 's ' office sums up the postmodern complexities of Chávez 's idea of ' 21st - century socialism ' .
The former high school teacher and left - wing guerrilla 's walls are decorated with pictures of Chairman Mao , Che and Bolívar .
There is a poster of Chávez too along with religious statuary and a wanted poster from ' Mao 's days on the run .
Perez , 47 , tells me he has been a rebel since the age of 12 , imprisoned five times and tortured while in jail .
As we talk , he reaches across to a tape recorder .
I anticipate a revolutionary song , perhaps sung by Chávez .
Instead it is the Beatles singing ' With a Little Help from My Friends ' .
Chávez 's Bolívarian revolution , as retold by ' Mao ' , is a mishmash of contradictory ideas .
Perez says : ' Christ was the first and greatest communist , ' that multiparty politics have had their day , but that the revolution is also democratic .
If the opposition won in December 's presidential elections the chavistas would respect that victory .
He claims that the movement does not want to export its revolution to other countries in Latin America and then concludes by saying that it does .
' In the phase that we are in , Hugo Chávez is very important because he has dared to set the agenda . ...
Chávez is the absolute leader because in his role he has permitted the process to go forward .
Political parties need to be abolished .
We need mass organisations .
People should direct the government .
That 's why Chávez says , " You the people should govern . " '
But the truth , as everybody knows , is that Chávez governs almost alone through a politics of improvisation .
Venezuelans see it weekly on TV .
Teodoro Petkoff , editor of the Tal Cual newspaper and putative presidential candidate , describes Chávez ( in an introduction to Hugo Chávez sin Uniforme , a biography published last year ) as a latterday Zelig - forever changing and forever interposing himself in each scene in history .
Other Chávez watchers suggest a different model : that of Argentina 's great populist , Juan Perón , and his wife Evita .
The authors of Hugo Chávez sin Uniforme - Cristina Marcano and Alberto Barrera Tyszka - cite the President 's own psychiatrist , who credited Chávez with a ' narcissistic personality ' .
While both Marcano and Barrera Tyszka are critics of Chávez , they believe he should be given credit for putting poverty on the agenda .
I meet the authors , who are husband and wife , in a cafe in Los Palos Grandes , not far from the huge square with its obelisk , typically the scene of opposition rallies .
It is the polar opposite to the blocks and narrow alleyways of the barrios .
Here air - conditioned restaurants serve chilled wine to ladies who lunch and busy young executives and lawyers .
Though middle - class themselves , Marcano and Barrera Tyszka place themselves in the rare , and little populated , centre of Venezuela 's polarised political life .
' I think most of the time he simply looks and behaves in the way he wants to be perceived , ' says Marcano .
' When Chávez is meeting businessmen he dresses like a businessman .
If he goes to meet the poor he wears his red shirt open at the neck .
He wants to be loved . '
But not loved by everyone of course .
' He has always had the necessity of an enemy both external and internal , ' says Marcano .
' It is an old trick of his .
He calls Bush a murderer and gets the attention of the world and captivates the left . '
' How can you be a big hero , ' interjects Barrera Tyszka , ' in the mould of Bolívar or Guevara , without an enemy ? '
Marcano believes , moreover , that beyond the theatrics there is a real Chávez who remains as yet unseen and untested .
' I have always said that we will get to knowthe real Chávez only when he stops being popular ...
What will he do then ?'
That is the big question .
His bellicose rhetoric in opposition to the US has seen an increase from 10 per cent to 30 per cent of Venezuelans who believe the US will eventually invade .
And fear is useful .
Citing the US threat , Chávez is militarising Venezuelan society , raising a new territorial guard , which can be seen assiduously training in Venezuela 's public spaces .
What does Chávez 's revolution stand for ?
Is it Marxist or religious in its inspiration ?
Does it represent a new economics , as he insists , or is it dependent on the old capitalism he claims to despise ?
Then there is Chávez himself .
Is he democratic or authoritarian ?
Above all , where does the rhetoric of his struggle with the US , with its threats , its risky alliances and ominous warnings of invasions and 1,000 - year resistance wars , begin and end ?
Above all , what is real , and what theatrical performance ?
Certainly his left - wing credentials are not in doubt .
Born in 1953 of mixed Amerindian , African and Spanish descent ( his parents were schoolteachers in Sabineta ) , Chávez came from the group to whom he now appeals : the poor .
As a boy he was sent to live with his grandmother , but it was the army - which he joined at 17 - that moulded him , giving him the education that would otherwise have been unavailable .
And it was as a young officer that Chávez first developed his ideas about ' Bolívarianism ' that later were forged into his Revolutionary Bolívarian Movement - 200 .
It was founded on a combination of the romantic ideals of South America 's anti-colonial struggles and a strong sense of social justice .
It found its expression amid the economic stagnation and collapse of party politics in the late 1980s , culminating in a failed neo-liberal experiment that made Venezuela 's poor more impoverished .
The scene was set , in 1992 , for an attempted coup by Chávez and his supporters in the military .
It ran into the ground when the unit commanded by Chávez failed to seize the initiative in the capital .
To avoid further bloodshed , the captured Chávez was put on TV .
What happened next was to launch his career as a popular leader .
The handsome and media - friendly young officer asked his soldiers to stand down , famously telling the country that he had failed ' por ahora ' - for now .
And , as Chávez the failed golpista was jailed , Chávez the democrat was born .
The two characters have never been reconciled .
As a democrat , Chávez has won election after election largely fair and square since his first campaign in 1998 .
Thereare few egregious human rights abuses , little serious repression and , despite a new media law , Venezuela enjoys a lively and usually critical press .
If the middle class - led opposition has failed to remove him democratically it is not because of widespread skulduggery ; it is because its movement is fragmented and represents , for all its claims to the contrary , a minority .
But there is another prism through which Chávez 's democratic credentials look more dubious .
On top of his leadership of the failed coup , and his relationships with left - wing revolutionary guerrillas , there is the fact that in his seven years in power he has consolidated personal control over all of Venezuela 's institutions .
The army answers to Chávez , as does the central bank , the treasury and the state oil - company PDVSA , which provides the vast bulk of Venezuela 's revenue as the world 's fifth - largest oil exporter .
In 2002 , when many members of the 19,000 - strong company joined a lock - out strike in support of calling early elections to oust him , he fired them all , replacing them with chavistas .
He has packed the judiciary with his supporters and rewritten the constitution to suit his ends .
Most worryingly , he has talked about finessing the constitution to enable him to stay in office until 2030 .
And it is not just because of his political inclinations that Chávez appears to be being pulled in contrary directions - between the authoritarianism of the classic South American caudillo ( strongman ) and democrat .
His personality too appears to be elusive and , say observers , deeply unpredictable .
For a dictator in the making , as his opponents claim he is , he may have the rhetoric and perhaps some of the inclinations of a caudillo , but his record in confrontation has been more mixed .
When Chávez began reallocating land from major landowners to the poor , whom he had encouraged to squat , it looked like the end for Venezuela 's major estates - the latifundios - including the British - owned Vesty .
But Chávez stopped short .
For now the policy is one of negotiation , allowing the big businesses to keep some land in exchange for giving up a little .
Then there was the confrontation with the middle classes , which resulted in the names of anyone who had signed a petition for a referendum demanding Chávez 's recall ( popularly known as la lista ) being published by a prominent Chávez supporter .
This so - called ' Tascón list ' was subsequently used to deny signatories government jobs and contracts .
It looked like an old - fashioned purge .
On the steep , grassy banks of the busy autopista linking Caracas and the coast , I meet a victim of the Tascón list at an opposition demonstration .
They are a strange group , mostly older and welldressed professionals and well - to - do Caracas housewives , some of them in Tshirts proclaiming their allegiance to the ' National Commando of the Resistance ' .
It is not a formation , you imagine , that scares Chávez .
Among them is Rodello Gonzales Martinez , 55 , a former commercial pilot who had signed la lista in 2003 - 04 .
' When I went to reapply for my licence and medical , nothing happened for a long time .
I did n't get a reply , ' he says .
' When I finally went to the Ministry of Transportation in person the girl asked for my ID .
She typed in my name and said : " You 're on the list " and ripped up my application in front of my face . '
It is a familiar story , although whether it is as widespread as the opposition claims is impossible to tell .
Again Chávez backed down , publicly calling on his supporters to stop using the list to punish escualidos - one of a series of measures to court the middle classes .
Most telling , there is evidence that , despite his tough language with the US , and a flurry of ' deals ' to sell his oil elsewhere , he has done little to restructure Venezuela 's oil business and steer it away from the convenient flow of America 's billions that are paying for his revolution .
It is contradictory , like so much in the Bolívarian Revolution .
Yet Alberto Garrido , one of Venezuela 's most respected political analysts , believes it is possible to reconcile the two Chávezes .
' Chávez has threatened to blow up his own oil installations in the event of an American invasion .
You can consider it rhetoric , but it is not really that .
He is intent on destroying imperialism .
By that he means the " empire of the US " .
His discourse does n't include Europe .
It is very localised .
But while the reality is Latin America 's independence from US influence , the reality is changeable .
Chávez is tactically pragmatic , but strategically obsessive .
Since he is pragmatic , he will continue selling oil to the US and resist pressure from more radical sectors of his movement to stop .
' What needs to be understood is that his main interest is geopolitical .
Everything that can be seen as ambiguous needs to be recognised as the fact he is leading a transitional phase .
He will allow the US to keep paying for his oil to strengthen his project .
His project - he has said it himself - will be 20 - 30 years in the making . '
It is the message that is visible on children 's singlets being sold by a street vendor at a chavista rally .
Beneath screenprinted images of Chávez 's face the legend reads : 2030 .
But what you realise , walking with these young people through Caracas 's dirty streets behind lorries blasting out music and bands of drummers , is that , for all the contradictions of his revolution , Chávez has harnessed the energy of the impoverished majority .
The noisy good humour of the thousands who march , the dynamism , is in stark contrast to a rival rally called by the opposition .
The chavistas march and sing and fill the capital 's streets , the middle classes opt to lie down and play dead .
It is hot and humid in Caracas : the rainy season has yet to come .
It is a national holiday and so those who can afford it have driven to the beaches .
The alternative is the Magic Mountain , an amusement park in the foothills of the Andes , a cable car ride above the capital .
It is not cheap , so most of those queuing for the ride up above the forested slopes are middle class .
They stroll along paths above a plunging valley filled with the weekend villas of the wealthy .
Inside its alpine - themed restaurant , Juan Garcia , an electrical engineer , is eating a picnic with his two children .
' We like to come when it 's cool , ' says Juan , 43 , a fierce opponent of Chávez .
' I am completely against him .
He is pushing our country into something that it 's not .
The social struggle that he talks about among Venezuela 's classes - before he came it did not exist .
He has strengthened the hate between the poor and the rich .
He gives the impression that if they follow him they can all wear white clothes and drive nice cars .
Unfortunately I do n't think that it is going to stop .
Once the idea has been sold there is no end to it . '
Not everyone on the Magic Mountain agrees .
Vanessa Aular , a student and a single mother , has taken her four - yearold son Antoine Escobar up the cable car for a treat .
An admirer of Chávez , Vanessa was sent to Cuba on a government scheme to train as a social worker .
' Where I have really benefited , ' she says , 'is with my son .
He needed to have his tonsils out , which would have been difficult for us before Chávez .
Our neighbours have got housing benefi t for the first time and a neighbour is going to Cuba for an eye operation . '
Chávez 's popularity is not , as the fragmenting opposition desperately hopes , built on a fake premise .
What Venezuela 's underclasses recognise is that he is no forgery .
They see it in his dark skin , his poor background and in his manners .
His aspirations are also theirs : the poor boy who joined the army in the hope of becoming a baseball star , who instead got himself the kind of education he is now offering to them .
He is the child from the shack who rose to the stuccoed grandeur of the Miraflores Palace .
This resonates with his core constituency .
For the poor , who have benefited from his seven years in power , democracy means social inclusion - not who controls the institutions that in Venezuela have often been either weak or hopelessly corrupt .
At present that social inclusion means Chávez 's misiones , which like the Mercals alleviate poverty , offering free and widespread healthcare , provided by 17,000 Cuban doctors , access to education , housing titles , land ownership and cheap start - up loans for businesses .
It is on these schemes - paid for by the oil receipts of the past two years - that Chávez 's popularity is based .
And it is not just in Venezuela .
Chávez spends his billions elsewhere in the region .
He buys debt from neighbouring countries , funds projects , supports parties in the left 's new rise to power in Latin America .
It is this that is the real source of friction with the US - that a revolutionary regime , with deep pockets filled with its own dollars , is undermining US policy , not least in fronting the resistance to the creation of the neo-liberal Free Trade Area of the Americas .
Chávez 's message , as in the barrios , is social justice .
But is that social justice policy working ?
I went to the barrio of Petare , without the presence of chavista minders , where people were more free to talk , to try to find out .
It is a place not much different from the 23 de Enero barrio - though it lacks the high - rises .
The hairdressing salon where Miriam Josefina Mejillas , 34 , works is open to the street .
She shops in the local Mercal and gets free medical treatment for her family from the Cuban doctors .
She is defensive about criticism of Chávez , although she recognises the country 's deep and lasting problems .
Mostly , however , she is grateful .
' I do n't think everything in this country is his fault .
He is a human being just like us .
There are lots of crises but they are not his fault .
There are all these people who say because of Chávez they do n't have work .
But there are people around him who are traitors to him . '
It is a familiar refrain among Chávez ' sleast well - off supporters .
If there are faults with the Bolívarian Revolution , they say , it is only because the President is surrounded by bad advisers and is not hearing about their problems .
If he knew , they argue , he would intervene .
There may be some truth in this .
In a movement largely suspicious of the technocrats and political classes who once ran the country , there is a shortage of expertise .
' Chávez has said in his own words that the three enemies of his revolution are corruption , inefficiency and bureaucracy , ' says Alberto Garrido .
' He also criticises nepotism .
The management of this state is absolutely terrible .
He trusts a small group of allies unconditionally .
' Chávez is still in the " charismatic phase " where he is above good and bad for his people and he has cleverly separated himself from the image of inefficiency and corruption of his government .
But that can not be eternal .
If he does not quickly succeed in restructuring the country 's problems , people will start losing hope in him .
That is his black spot .
If he does n't stop that mismanagement it will stop him . '
While Chávez has undertaken a remarkable intervention on the level of primary assistance , many even among those who support him are concerned that , if and when oil prices drop from their record levels , there will be little left to see of his revolution .
One day the Cuban doctors , who have transformed primary healthcare , will go home .
While Chávez has been busy educating a few thousand Venezuelan doctors , all his billions of oil money have not rebuilt the decrepit hospitals .
The Mercals are dependent on oil largesse and there is evidence that the importing of cheaper food is undermining the fragile farming and agriculture sectors .
While the Bolívarian schools and universities have transformed the literacy of the poor , the biggest problem is highlighted by their adult graduates .
Few new jobs have been created by the revolution , which has done little to diversify the economy .
The chavistas say that this is missing the point .
Chávez 's vision is not about outdated Western political and economic models ; it is about creating revolutionary ' fusion ' and breaking new ground .
In Latin America , at least , his example is influential most notably with Bolivia 's Evo Morales .
Just last week Morales nationalised his gas industry , sending in troops to secure production and telling foreign companies to leave if they did not comply .
Amid all the threats of economic meltdown and utopian promises , it is Lopez Maya who seems to present the most honest assessment of the likely prospects .
' Venezuela has a lot of money because of oil , ' she says .
' But in two years the prospects could be very different .
It is very difficult to assess the performance of the government .
In the past , when the oil price has dropped the defects of our government strategy have emerged .
Now the question is : is Chávez doing a good job or is it just the same again ? '
