Over at Twitter , @ Superman 64 asked me …
What do you think about @ebertchicago ‘s last tweet about you ?
I think Roger Tweeted an article that put words in my mouth .
This is the Canoe / WENN piece Roger linked .
Paragraph four : “ In a series of posts on his Twitter.com page , he writes , “ I gotta say that every day I hate film theory & film students & critics more & more ” "
Lovely .
Only , I did not , in fact , write that .
At all .
I was quoting @coked_up_jesus , a Tweeter who asked me a question .
I quoted his query , as I always do , then gave my responses .
FilmRot.com was kind enough to actually collect the supposedly scathing critical attack that resulted in blogger after blogger crying for the death of my heart .
I was painted as ‘ out to destroy film criticism ’ last week .
As you can see , that ’s not what I said at all ; said , instead , that I ’d like to give a new batch a try at the gig .
The idea seemed fair , as many of the same bloggers calling for my head have been calling for me to move over and give other filmmakers MY job for years now .
When I applied the same suggestion : critical meltdown .
NEVER critique a critic , folks : they get very sensitive ; as sensitive as filmmakers , it would seem .
But , as regards Roger : clearly , he felt I was in need of a public spanking .
Fair enough : I ’ll take it from the mighty Ebert ( which sounds far more erotic than it is ) .
I ’ve been watching Eborsisk love on film since the PBS COMING ATTRACTIONS / SNEAK PREVIEWS days , before the birth of AT THE MOVIES ( God rest its soul ) .
He ’s been in my life for so long , he ’s kinda like a Dad. Despite his Tweet , I ’ve always been , and remain , a booster .
What sucks , though , is that as much as I ’ve read Roger ’s stuff over the years , it would ’ve been nice if he showed me the same courtesy and a ) read my actual Tweets on the subject , and b ) emailed me if he had an issue .
And I ’m not talking about having an issue with COP OUT : I got no beef with a lifer / legend who wants to smack my flick around ( besides – it ’s not like I have n’t gotten bad reviews from Roger before : he panned both MALLRATS and CLERKS II ) .
What disappointed me was this is a guy I respected enough to hop planes to Chicago for when he first fell ill , so I could fill in on his show .
Multiple times , too .
And I took worlds of shit from a lot of the same bloggers who ’re currently outraged at the temerity of my Tweets , as well as from my representatives ( agent , lawyer , publicist ) , who were all like “ You ’re a filmmaker !
You ca n’t sit in for ‘ the Enemy ’ ! ”
But I threw caution to the wind and did it anyway ; because it was for Roger .
A little benefit - of - the - doubt from a guy I thought of as a friend would ’ve been nice , is all I ’m saying .

Actor Robert Downey Jr. did n’t take the role of Iron man lightly .
In fact , he decided to live up the super hero ’s name , and gained 20 pounds of muscle for his role in the second installment of the hit Marvel Comics movie franchise .
The star ’s trainer , Brad Bose , dishes the dirt on how he got Downey to bulk up in such a dramatic fashion :
“ When we did Iron Man 1 , we had five months before the shoot to get ready , so we used more traditional , heavy - weight training , ” says Bose .
“ After [ the first routine ] , Robert felt kind of bored with it and wanted to something a little more exciting … so we decided to do what I call a Rocky IV meets high - tech training , ”
Robert Downey pushed a custom - built wheelbarrow around an obstacle course .
It was modified with 600 - to 700 - pound weight stacks .
To say that the fitness routine was nontraditional , is an understatement .
Downey juggled Indian clubs , bowling - pin shaped wooden objects of varying sizes and weights .
He also used kettle bells .
“ We went out and bought truck tires , and we used sledgehammers – anywhere from , two four - pound sledgehammers in each hand , all the way up to a full 20 - pound sledgehammer – and we were just beating tires with it .
We used fire hoses that we filled with sand and water … and we ’d drag and whip them to build the shoulder muscles and pecs back up . ”
While you may not have a Hollywood star ’s budget for your workouts , maybe the lesson to be learned here is that you do n’t have to let yourself get bored with your fitness routine .
Change it up , get outdoors and outside your comfort zone .
Iron Man 2 opens today nationwide .

One of the great advantages of the OpenDocument format is that it is simply a zip file .
You can unzip it with any archiver and take a look at the contents , which is a set of XML documents and associated data .
Many people are using this feature do create some nifty toolchains .
Unzip , make some changes , zip it again and you have a new ODF document .
Well … almost .
The OpenDocument Format specification , section 17.4 has one little extra restriction when it comes to zip containers :
The file called “ mimetype ” must be at the beginning of the zip file , it must be uncompressed and it must be stored without any additional file attributes .
Unfortunately many developers seem to forget this .
It is the number one cause of failed documents at Officeshots.org .
If the mimetype file is not correctly zipped then it is not possible to programmatically detect the mimetype of the ODF file .
And if the mimetype check fails , Officeshots ( and possibly other applications ) will refuse the document .
This problem is compounded because virtually no ODF validator checks the zip container .
They only check the contents .
In this article I will show you how you can properly zip your ODF files , but before I do that I will show you the problem in detail .
Detecting mimetypes
Linux and other Unix - like opratingsystems do not rely on file extensions to determine the type of a file .
Relying on file extensions can be a serious sercurity problem , as you can see in the Windows world .
It 's simply too easy to change the extension and pretend that a file is of a different type than it really is .
Instead , the Unix world looks at the contents of the file itself .
This happens with a library called “ magic ” .
The magic library consists of a large set of rules , which it uses to figure out what type of file it is looking at .
For example , it can look at a certain byte offset and see what value it contains .
This is precisely the reason why the ODF specification says that you need to zip the mimetype first , without any file attributes .
If you do that and open the ODF file in a hex editor , you will see something like this :
Offset : Hexadecimal : ASCII : 00000000 - 50 4b 03 04 14 00 00 08 00 00 c1 b6 66 3 b 5e c6 PK ..............
00000010 - 32 0 c 27 00 00 00 27 00 00 00 08 00 00 00 6d 69 2 .'...'....... mi 00000020 - 6d 65 74 79 70 65 61 70 70 6 c 69 63 61 74 69 6f metypeapplicatio 00000030 - 6e 2f 76 6e 64 2e 6 f 61 73 69 73 2e 6 f 70 65 6e n/vnd.oasis.open 00000040 - 64 6 f 63 75 6d 65 6e 74 2e 74 65 78 74 50 4b 03 document.textPK .
...
This is very easy to match for the magic library .
Here is an explanation of the rules that magic uses to test if the file is an ODF file :
Look at the beginning of the file .
It should start with the letters PK and then bytes 03 and 04 .
This means it is a zip file .
Look at offset 30 ( " 1e " in hex ) .
It should be the string " mimetype " .
Look at offset 38 ( " 26 " in hex ) , directly after the word " mimetype " .
It should be one of the ODF mimetypes .
You can guess what happens when you do n't zip the mimetype file first :
The string " mimetype " wo n't be at the right offset .
And if you accidentally zip it with extra file attributes , then the contents of the mimetype file will not start directly after it .
There will be several bytes in between .
This causes the magic library to detect it as a standard zip file , not as an ODF file .
Here is how such a badly zipped ODF could look like .
This file was zipped normally , without paying special attention to the mimetype file :
Offset : Hexadecimal : ASCII : 00000000 - 50 4b 03 04 0a 00 00 00 00 00 25 01 6e 3c 00 00 PK ..............
00000010 - 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 10 00 15 00 43 6 f .............. Co 00000020 - 6e 66 69 67 75 72 61 74 69 6 f 6e 73 32 2f 55 54 nfigurations2/UT 00000030 - 09 00 03 16 1 b 9c 4 b 47 1e 9c 4 b 55 78 04 00 e8 ...... KG..KUx ... 00000040 - 03 e8 03 50 4b 03 04 0a 00 00 00 00 00 25 01 6e ... PK ........%.n ...
As you can see , it does not match the rules that the magic library has .
Instead of checking your ODF file with a hex editor , you can also simply use the " file " command .
For example :
$ file -- mime my - document.odt my-document.odt : application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text
If that command results in " application / zip " or " application / octet - stream " then it means that your ODF file is probably incorrectly zipped .
Note that the magic library shipped with " file " up to version 5.0.3 does not contain all mimetypes for ODF files but only for OpenDocument Text ( odt ) files .
File 5.0.3 is the version most commenly shipped with Linux distributions today .
I have since submitted a patch that includes all known ODF mimetypes .
It was accepted and it should be included in file version 5.0.4 and later .
How to zip an ODF file
So , here is how you can zip an ODF file the right way .
Suppose that I have an unzipped ODF file that looks like this :
+ my - document / + Configurations2/ + META -INF / - manifest.xml +
Thumbnails / - thumbnail.png - content.xml - meta.xml - mimetype - settings.xml - styles.xml
Start by creating a new zip file that just contains the mimetype file :
$ zip - 0 - X ../my-document.odt mimetype
The - 0 parameter means that the file will not be compressed .
The - X parameter means that no extra file attributes will be stored .
Next you can add the rest of the files :
$ zip -r ../my-document.odt * -x mimetype
Be sure to exclude the mimetype file .
Now if you look at it with a hex editor , you will see it has been zipped correctly :
Offset : Hexadecimal : ASCII : 00000000 - 50 4b 03 04 14 00 00 08 00 00 c1 b6 66 3 b 5e c6 PK ..............
00000010 - 32 0 c 27 00 00 00 27 00 00 00 08 00 00 00 6d 69 2 .'...'....... mi 00000020 - 6d 65 74 79 70 65 61 70 70 6 c 69 63 61 74 69 6f metypeapplicatio 00000030 - 6e 2f 76 6e 64 2e 6 f 61 73 69 73 2e 6 f 70 65 6e n/vnd.oasis.open 00000040 - 64 6 f 63 75 6d 65 6e 74 2e 74 65 78 74 50 4b 03 document.textPK .

There are new developments in the religious tensions in Jacksonville .
The evening before Parvez Ahmed was to take his seat on the City ’s Human Rights Commission there was an attempted arson at the local Islamic Center at which he is a member .
No one was injured in the explosion that occurred shortly before evening prayers on Monday , and the fire it caused was put out with a fire extinguisher .
A security video showed a white man carrying what appeared to be a gas can .
The incident is being investigated by local and federal authorities as a possible hate crime .
Interfaith Leaders including those at the Amity Turkish Center and OneJax denounced the attack as Muslim leaders called for more understanding and tolerance .

All flights in and out of the UK and several other European countries have been suspended as ash from a volcanic eruption in Iceland moves south .
Up to 4,000 flights are being cancelled with airspace closed in Norway , Sweden , Finland and Denmark among others .
The UK's air traffic control service ( Nats ) said no flights would be allowed in UK airspace until at least 0700 BST on Friday amid fears of engine damage .
Safety group Eurocontrol said the problem could persist for 48 hours .
The volcano is still spewing ash and the wind direction is expected to continue bringing clouds into UK and European airspace for some time to come .
COUNTRIES AFFECTED
Airspace closed : UK Republic of Ireland Norway Partial or planned closures : Sweden ( total closure by 2000 GMT ) France ( two main Paris airports plus several in the north ) Denmark ( total by 1600 GMT ) Finland ( northern airspace closed till 1200 GMT Friday ) Belgium ( total from 1430 GMT ) Netherlands ( being shut progressively )
The UK 's airspace restriction was the worst in living memory , a Nats spokesman said .
Some 600,000 people are thought to have been affected .
Nats suggested that the restrictions were unlikely to be lifted after 0700 , saying it was " very unlikely that the situation over England will improve in the foreseeable future " .
Passengers were advised to contact their carriers prior to travel .
Transport Secretary Lord Adonis said he was " closely monitoring the situation " and would be meeting with key transport officials on Friday morning .
Experts have warned that the tiny particles of rock , glass and sand contained in the ash cloud from the still - erupting volcano could be sufficient to jam aircraft engines .
ANALYSIS By David Shukman BBC environment correspondent
A lone plane is in the skies above Britain tonight on a research mission to investigate the volcanic plume .
The aircraft - with scientists on board - is taking measurements of the height , density and position of the ash .
There are limits to what satellites and ground observations can discern about the plume .
Its flight path was planned to take it from Oxford to Prestwick to Lossiemouth to Newcastle and then back south .
Among the researchers on board are specialists in atmospheric science .
The aircraft - a Dornier 228 - is managed by the government - funded Natural Environment Research Council .
Its head of airborne research , Peter Purcell , described the plane as " extremely adaptable and capable " .
" The instrumentation will allow the crew to safely monitor the atmospheric conditions as the plume is approached , " he said .
The findings will be fed to Met Office to help improve forecasts for the plume 's position .
The Health Protection Agency said the ash from the Eyjafjallajoekull eruption did not pose a significant risk to public health because of its high altitude .
However , the British Lung Foundation has warned people with lung conditions to keep their medication with them as a precautionary measure .
These are some of the knock - on effects : Eurocontrol says Germany is monitoring the situation and considering partial airspace closures
The two main airports in Paris and many others in the north of France are closing
There is severe disruption in France and Spain , where all northbound flights are cancelled
Nats is due to make an announcement shortly as to the arrangements that will be in place through to 1300 BST on Friday
British Airways offers refunds or an option to rebook after all its domestic flights are suspended
Flybe announces it has cancelled all flights up until 1300BST on Friday and more than 25 services due to run after that .
British sports teams have been hit by travel problems after flights were grounded
Dozens of Leicestershire students were evacuated from accommodation in Iceland after the volcano eruption
Singer Russell Watson calls off concert in the Irish Republic after missing the last ferry crossing from Holyhead One passenger at Glasgow told the BBC : " I 'm meant to be going to Lanzarote .
We 've travelled from Oban , leaving at 3 am .
Now we 've decided we might as well just go home and do a bit of gardening . "
Extent of Iceland volcano ash cloud
The volcanic eruption in Iceland on Wednesday night sent plumes of ash thousands of feet into the air .
The cloud has spread across the UK to Europe .
The spread of the ash cloud at 20 - 30,000 ft raised concerns for air safety , forcing at least 12 countries to restrict or halt flights in their airspace .
The eruptions from the Eyjafjallajoekull volcano continue to pump out ash clouds sporadically , which means the disruption is set to continue .
Although the cloud is too high to pose a health risk , people with breathing problems have been advised to take extra care if it falls to ground level .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
Others switched from plane to train , with the East Coast line extending its 1830 BST London to Newcastle service through to Edinburgh .
A spokeswoman for Eurostar estimated an extra 10,000 seats had been booked .
She also said Friday 's services were " extremely full " .
Budget airline Ryanair said no flights were operating to or from the UK on Thursday and it expected cancellations and delays on Friday .
VOLCANIC ASH CLOUD
The eruption in the Eyjafjallajoekull area is the second to occur in a month
This eruption has released ash to significantly greater heights Volcanic ash contains tiny particles of rock and even glass , which can wreak havoc with machinery
A 1982 BA flight unknowingly flew into an ash cloud , shutting down all four engines
While ash can be dangerous to health , the current cloud is too high to pose a threat
The ash is likely to lead to particularly red sunsets in some areas
Animated guide : Volcanoes BBC travel news A spokesman for Nats , which was formerly known as the National Air Traffic Services , said : " The Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre has issued a forecast that the ash cloud from the volcanic eruption in Iceland will track over Europe tonight .
" Nats is working with Eurocontrol and our colleagues in Europe 's other air navigation service providers to take the appropriate action to ensure safety in accordance with international aviation policy . "
The European air safety body , Eurocontrol , said the cloud of ash had reached 55,000ft and was expected to move through northern UK and Scotland .
Brian Flynn , assistant head of operations of its central flow management unit , told the BBC : " As it moves toward the Netherlands and Belgium it will dissipate and lose intensity , like any weather phenomenon .
But we do n't know what the extent of it will be . "
The Natural Environment Research Council ( NERC ) has sent up a reconnaissance flight to investigate how the ash is distributed in the cloud , something that is impossible to assess from satellite imagery .
Dr Mike Branney , senior lecturer in volcanology , University of Leicester , said : " Volcanic ash is not good to plane engines .
" Firstly it is highly abrasive and can scour and damage moving parts .
Secondly , if it enters a jet engine the intense heat of the engine can fuse it to the interior of the engine with a caking of hot glass , which ultimately can cause the engine to cut out completely .
" This is a sensible precaution . "
In 1982 a British Airways jumbo had all four of its engines shut down as it flew through a plume of volcanic ash .
There was also an incident on 15 December 1989 when KLM Flight 867 , a B747-400 from Amsterdam to Anchorage , Alaska , flew into the plume of the erupting Mount Redoubt , causing all four engines to fail .
Once the flight cleared the ash cloud , the crew was able to restart each engine and then make a safe landing at Anchorage , but the aircraft was substantially damaged .
A BAA spokesman said : " Passengers intending to fly today are asked to contact their airline for further information . "

The eruption under a glacier in the Eyjafjallajoekull area of Iceland is the second in the country in less than a month .
Prof Bill McGuire , professor at the Aon Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre , said it was not " particularly unusual " for ash from Icelandic eruptions to reach the UK .
" Such a large eruption ... would have the potential to severely affect air travel at high northern latitudes for six months or more .
" In relation to the current eruption , it is worth noting that the last eruption of Eyjafjallajoekull lasted more than 12 months . "

The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement yesterday that promised to “ liberalize the system by which civilian goods enter Gaza . ”
The announcement from Israel ’s security cabinet came after widespread international pressure on Israel following a deadly Israeli naval raid on a humanitarian flotilla trying to break the three - year old blockade of Gaza .
U.S. media echoed the Israeli press release in headlines like “ Israel to Ease Gaza Land Blockade ” ( New York Times , 6/17/10 ) and “ Israel Eases Restrictions on Goods Bound for Gaza Strip ” ( Washington Post , 6/18/10 ) .
( CNN — 6/17/10 — at least attributed the claim in its “ Israel to Ease Blockade of Gaza , Cabinet Says . ” )
But corporate news coverage in the United States omitted an important aspect of the story that undermines the narrative that Israel is “ easing ” its blockade of Gaza .
The Israeli daily Ha’aretz ( 6/17/10 ) reports :
The prime minister ’s office announced on Thursday that the security cabinet had agreed to relax Israel ’s blockade on the Gaza Strip , but as it turns out , no binding decision was ever made during the cabinet meeting .
The prime minister ’s office issued a press release in English following the meeting , which was also sent to foreign diplomats , was substantially different than the Hebrew announcement –according to the English text , a decision was made to ease the blockade , but in the Hebrew text there was no mention of any such decision .
U.S. corporate media have apparently decided to ignore the Hebrew press release that told a far different story about the blockade of Gaza .
Even if their correspondents in Jerusalem do n’t speak Hebrew , the online English version of Ha’aretz reported the news about the dual statements loud and clear yesterday afternoon .
Only time will tell which statement is true and whether Israel is really easing its land blockade of Gaza .
( The naval blockade will remain in place , according to the New York Times story on the Israeli statement . )
Even if the English version were true , though , it does n’t seem like it will squelch criticism of the blockade – Israeli human rights organization Gisha ( Guardian , 6/17/10 ) called the announcement “ cosmetic changes , ” and said that “ we need a policy that recognizes the rights of Palestinian residents of Gaza not just to consume but also to produce and to travel . ”
Such viewpoints , however , are unlikely to get much of a hearing in the U.S. press .

When my colleague Stephanie Mencimer notified me that some Tea Party types would be holding a rally in Houma , Louisiana , on Saturday to protest the new federal moratorium on deepwater oil drilling , I had some concerns .
Namely that Tea Partiers getting involved in the issue could make it look like only crazy people are against the drilling ban down here , when in fact plenty of non-crazy people are mad that it could endanger as many as 20,000 jobs .
But the sentiments expressed at this particular rally were , as it turns out , about 300 percent crazier even than I had feared .
Though a heavy storm was dumping sheets of rain outside , a couple hundred people packed the City Club of Houma .
Things started sensibly enough .
We bowed our heads and prayed that God would lift the drilling ban ; the president of Terrebonne Parish ( below ) declared that Obama ’s deepwater drilling moratorium was an “ economic disaster of biblical proportions . ”
Senator David Vitter ’s state director , David Doss , read a statement from the Louisiana Republican , who said he was unable to attend due to a canceled flight but “ looks forward to working with you all and we must push forward to end this devastating moratorium on drilling . ”
But other than that , the rally was mostly two hours of yelling about how climate change is natural — ” I ’ve never seen CO 2 in the air , have you ever seen CO 2 in the air ? ? ” — how Barack Obama is simultaneously trying to enslave the American population and steal from it , and how welfare recipients should have to be regularly drug tested .
One speaker gave the usual “ We do n’t need the government ” speech , followed immediately by , “ If the government was doing its job making sure MMS did its job , we would n’t be here .
Why was n’t the government looking down their throats ? ”
Another speaker pointed out that we ’re at two wars , one in Iran and one in Afghanistan , and that if we ’re not careful , the president of Israel , Ahmadinejad , is going to gain enough power to take over the world .
“ Whose agenda is Obama pushing ? ” one speaker asked , and everyone yelled , “ George Soros ’ ! ”
Then we watched a video montage including footage of American soldiers , stills of Obama in Dark Knight Joker makeup , and the sun rising and setting on the Gulf of Mexico , set to Queen ’s “ The Show Must Go On . ”
Then we watched another video with clips of Rahm Emanuel and ACORN employees intercut with pictures of Chairman Mao , all over the superdramatic theme music from Requiem for a Dream .
Then it stopped raining , and everyone went outside to show off their crazy signs .
This guy told me the dying pelicans are the fault of Obama ( Whose Government Is Too Big and Should Leave Corporations Alone ) because the government did n’t do enough to save the birds covered in BP ’s crude .
He said the design was saved at the mall shop where he had it made , so anyone can buy one .
Afterwards , I left to check out how the cleanup efforts were going in the gorgeous marshes at nearby Pointe Aux Chenes .
At the marina , four contractors stopped me to let me know that it did n’t matter whether I was media or the Queen of Sheba ; I was not allowed on to that piece of public property unless I was with BP .
New Delhi , India ( CNN ) --
Walking is a perilous endeavor in New Delhi 's traffic bedlam .
Pedaling around the city of more than five million vehicles weaving through whatever space they find is not without danger either .
As New Delhi grapples with the woes of rapid urbanization of largely rural India , some enterprising citizens are turning to an unexplored territory to find solutions .
Architect Manit Rastogi scurries through thick pockets of bushes along filth - filled , age - old drains that he is convinced can be transformed into scenic lakes with walkways and cycle tracks alongside .
He believes technological interventions can do wonders with the 350 - kilometer circuit of dirty streams that dump tons of household sewage into the River Yamuna , New Delhi 's heavily polluted lifeline .
Originally , the centuries - old system -- called nullahs -- emptied excess rain water into the river , but in modern Delhi , it is mostly carrying untreated waste , Rastogi said .
Rastogi has pitched his drain - cleaning plans to authorities in New Delhi and is now identifying locations for at least three experiments that he proposes to complete by the end of 2010 .
" We can treat sewage at its source with the help of mini-equipment before it flows into the nullahs , " he said .
Limitedly , enzymes can also be used to attack contaminants in a technique he describes as " bioremediation . "
Littered with garbage , the stinking network of 17 nullahs are free of human occupation in a city otherwise struggling to deal with the rampant encroachment of public streets .
An expert in urban planning and the head of a private architecture and design firm , Rastogi envisages turning those tracts into landscaped passages for New Delhi 's pedestrians , cyclists and solar - powered rickshaws .
" The city will then be interconnected with an eco- friendly and safe transport network , " he said .
According to India 's Centre for Science and Environment ( CSE ) , one - third of New Delhi 's daily commuters walk to work .
" They walk in extremely unsafe and hostile conditions , in constant conflict with motorized traffic and are easy victims to crashes and accidents , " CSE said in a report last year .
Pedestrians in New Delhi , it added , accounted for 47 percent of road accident deaths .
" All the ills of urban development exist in this one city , " Rastogi said , noting New Delhi 's gridlocked roads , rapidly increasing population and high levels of pollution .
Figures posted on the Delhi government Web site show that the city received 233,000 migrants from other states -- apparently in search of work -- in 2006 , a number higher than the population growth that took place naturally that year here .
Spread over about 1,500 square kilometers , New Delhi is home to about 17 million people .
The 40 - year - old , London - educated architect seems confident that he can ease some of the city 's burden .
But what Rastogi is seeking for his proposed answer to New Delhi 's problems is cooperation from a complex bureaucracy .
" The main challenge of a project like this surprisingly is not funding , it 's not technology either .

The magazine mogul is currently dating 24 - year - old Crystal Harris , who lives with him at the Playboy mansion .
The couple have talked about getting married , with the 84 - year - old apparently desperate to tie the knot .
Crystal says
Hugh has always been open about his past with her , explaining she has quizzed about his sex life .
He is rumoured to have slept with more than 2000 women , but Crystal is not jealous .
" I 've asked him all about his past .
He even confessed which lovers he made sex tapes with , " she said .
" Some date so far back that they were filmed in 8 mm !
But he had them all dumped in the ocean years ago because he did n't want anyone 's career to be hurt .
" He was worried they would be stolen from his library during one of the parties . "
Crystal has also discussed stars who have appeared on the cover of the adult magazine with Hugh .
He has told her about his favourites , and admitted which ones he got intimate with .
Crystal refuses to be drawn on the topic as she does not want to embarrass her partner , but admits they have an active and fulfilling sex life .
" When I asked Hugh which cover girls he 's slept with even I was shocked by some of the names , " she explained in an interview with British newspaper The News of the World .
" They were names you 'd never suspect , the ones who seemed so innocent .
" But he told me he did n't sleep with Pamela Anderson , although he wanted to .
He said it was ' bad timing ' as he was married and she was in a relationship . "

NASA boffins report that an unknown object approaching the Earth from deep space is almost certainly artificial in origin rather than being an asteroid .
Not actually an asteroid , according to NASA , but artificial .
Object 2010 KQ was detected by the Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona earlier this month , and subsequently tracked by NASA 's asteroid - watching service , the Near - Earth Object Program headquartered at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California .
According to the NASA experts :
Observations by astronomer S J Bus , using the NASA - sponsored Infrared Telescope Facility in Mauna Kea , Hawaii , indicate that 2010 KQ's spectral characteristics do not match any of the known asteroid types , and the object 's absolute magnitude ( 28.9 ) suggests it is only a few meters in size .
The mysterious artificial object has apparently made a close pass by the Earth , coming in almost to the distance of the Moon 's orbit , and is now headed away again into the interplanetary void .
The object has used no propulsion during the time NASA has had it under observation .
However the spacewatch boffins believe that it must have moved under its own power at some point , given its position and velocity .
" The orbit of this object is very similar to that of the Earth , and one would not expect a [ naturally occurring ] object to remain in this type of orbit for very long , " said Paul Chodas , a brainbox at JPL .
The experts believe that the object must be a spacecraft , or more accurately part of one - sadly not an alien visitor , though .
Rather it 's likely to be a booster stage from an interplanetary mission of the past , now drifting back in to Earth and out again .
The next visit will probably be 2036 , at which time there 's a small chance that 2010 KQ will crash into the atmosphere and burn up . ®
Allershausen - Das dürfte den Hells Angels auch noch nicht passiert sein : Ein 26 - Jähriger fuhr auf das Gelände des Motorradclubs bei Allershausen , ließ seine Shorts runter und warf einen Hundewelpen nach den Männern .
Dann flüchtete der Student mit einem geklauten Radlader .
Die Geschichte könnte aus einem Film stammen : Am Sonntag parkte ein 26 - jähriger Student aus München mit seinem Auto am Gelände der Hells Angels bei Allershausen .
Dann ließ er seine Bermudashorts runter , zeigte den Motorradfahrern sein blankes Hinterteil und warf mit einem Hundewelpen nach den verblüfften Männern .
Anschließend flüchtete er zur Autobahn , wo er auf der Baustelle einen Radlader entdeckte .
Da in dem Fahrzeug der Schlüssel steckte , machte er sich damit auf den Weg Richtung München .
Weil der Student sehr langsam unterwegs war , hatte sich hinter ihm schnell ein fünf Kilometer langer Stau gebildet .
Der 26 - Jährige hielt nach einem Kilometer an und stieg in einen Lkw um , von dem er sich bis Eching mitnehmen ließ .
Dort verlor sich zunächst seine Spur. Doch die Polizei konnte den Mann schnell ermitteln .
Grund für die
Tat dürfte das Absetzen seiner Medikamente gewesen sein , die er wegen Depressionen nehmen musste .
Der 26 - Jährige wurde zur Behandlung in eine psychiatrische Klinik eingewiesen .
Der Hundewelpe wurde übrigens mittlerweile in der Tierauffangstation in Freising untergebracht .

What 's it take to get a movie off the ground ?
For decades , screenplays , best - selling books or compelling in - person pitches typically triggered green lights for big Hollywood pictures .
But increasingly , filmmakers are stitching together high - concept trailers to sell studios on movies that do not yet exist .
Dubbed " rip-o- matics , " these hybrid clips compress a film story 's key points into a brief visual synopsis .
" Fame " director Kevin Tancharoen , for example , pitched his vision for a movie adaptation of the video game Mortal Kombat by posting an eight - minute spec short on YouTube that stirred studio interest after racking up 2 million hits on YouTube .
A group of Finnish filmmakers are using spec trailers to raise money for their sci- fi movie " Iron Sky . "
And producer Scott Glassgold this month hit a home run after deploying a faux trailer that excited a Hollywood feeding frenzy .
Early this year Glassgold secured the English - language remake rights to an obscure Serbian movie called " Technotise : The Edit . "
" We had acquired this wildly entertaining , high - concept movie that was a very popular property overseas , but it was n't really on anyone 's radar in the United States , " he says .
To generate buzz , Glassgold commissioned viral video maker Jaron Pitts to cut together pre-existing movie footage into a two - minute trailer .
Shortly after the " Technotise " clip went online in February , Glassgold 's office was flooded with more than four dozen queries from production companies and agents .
Writer - producer Laeta Kalogridis ( " Shutter Island , " " Avatar " ) signed up to develop a scripted pitch .
Three weeks ago , Glassgold finalized a financing deal with Legendary Pictures , which specializes in tentpole action pictures like " The Dark Knight , " " 300 " and " Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines . "
Glassgold , a partner in IAM Entertainment , says he 's happy his instincts paid off .
" We went outside the box and used Jaron 's skills with ripped trailers to bring to life our vision for a live - action ' Technotise ' remake . "

Blockbusted : Summer 2010 is dreadful so far
The hits this summer have been few , with attendance dipping 13 percent below the 2009 season .
Jeff Bock , an analyst for Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. , says he 's not surprised .
" A couple years ago I looked at the release schedule , and realized this would be the weakest summer for movies in a long time . "
One problem , Bock notes : " There are n't many safety nets , and by that , I mean comic book movies , huge properties , big - budget sequels .
That 's what drives summer box office . "
Bock points out that even the perceived flop " Clash of the Titans " earned nearly half a billion when foreign box office is factored in .
And he 's optimistic about a couple of non-sequel pictures coming in July , including Leonardo DiCaprio's " Inception " and Julia Roberts ' " Eat Pray Love . "
But August , he says , is shaping up as " unusually weak , even by Hollywood standards . "
Although domestic revenues , by Labor Day , are expected to fall considerably short of last summer 's $ 4.3 billion total , executives have not gone into panic mode for one simple reason : " Next summer you 're going to see the next ' Pirates of the Caribbean , ' ' Thor , ' the next ' Hangover , ' ' Kung Fu Panda 2 , ' another ' X - Men , ' ' Cars 2 , ' ' Transformers 3 ' and the final ' Harry Potter ' ... are you kidding me ?
It 's packed with blockbusters . " {sbox}
Scientists say onset of British summer has become increasingly early in the last 50 years , consistent with global warming
Britain is broke and the bank holiday weekend was a washout , but scientists at Sheffield University have some rare good news in these uncertain times : summer is coming earlier each year .
According to a new study , the English summer arrives some 18 days sooner than during the late 1950s , when Harold Macmillan succeeded Anthony Eden in No 10 and announced : " We have a difficult task before us in this country , all of us . "
Grant Bigg and Amy Kirbyshire of the department of geography at Sheffield University examined temperature records of central England over recent decades , together with observations of 140 types of summer flowering plant , such as geraniums and roses , and when they came into bloom .
To determine the onset of summer , they looked for the third day of each year when average temperatures reached 14C .
That may sound distinctly chilly for summer , but comfortably allows for daytime temperatures above 20C .
" We wondered if we could set a defining moment of when summer begins , " Bigg said .
According to the analysis , summer should , on average , arrive in Britain tomorrow .
Records show that in the period 1954 - 1963 , the average date for the third such day was 25 May .
By the 1990s , it had shifted forwards to 14 May .
By 1998 - 2007 , on average , summer arrived on 7 May .
The shift is consistent with global warming , Bigg said .
" It 's always very difficult to make direct attributions but scientists say global warming is very likely driven by human activity and I think we can say the same thing . "
The researchers saw a similar , though smaller , pattern with summer plant flowering .
On average , the first flowering date for 1954 - 1963 was 29 May .
By 1991 - 2000 it was 26 May .
Announcing their results in the journal Climatic Change , the duo say they " present a convincing argument that the onset of the British summer season has become increasingly early in the last 50 years " .
The finding is consistent with similar studies that have used the timing of natural events to investigate the onset of spring and autumn .
Earlier summers may have encouraged drought or heatwave conditions by prolonging the period of warm temperatures , the scientists suggest .
The earliest recorded summer onset day was 18 April in 2003 , which was followed by a record breaking heat wave .
An early start does not always herald a good summer .
The second - earliest onset day was in 2007 , which preceded the wettest summer in England and Wales since records began in 1766 .
" An early summer onset is clearly no guarantee of a barbecue summer , " the scientists say .
This year is not following the early summer pattern however , as there has not yet been a day with an average temperature of 14C .

Scientists have known since the 1970s that complex structures make up butterfly scales and produce their vivid colors .
Now a new study sheds light on just how those structures are formed in certain types of butterflies .
During development , the cell membranes of butterfly scales go through a folding process to create a double gyroid , a structure that looks a bit like two overlapping three - bladed boomerangs .
Each scale cell then transforms into a single gyroid by depositing chitin , a starchy material that makes up the exterior of insects , into one of the two gyroid spaces sculpted by the membranes .
Then , the rest of the cell dies , leaving one intact gyroid network .

A single butterfly scale contains dozens of such gyroids of different sizes that bend and refract light to produce the exact colors on a butterfly , the study reports .
How to turn bad travel advice into a travel success …after you ’ve already departed
A little bird told me … there is no such thing as a bad time .
“ The grass is always greener “ .
It ’s an over - used idiom , and one that has no place when it comes to travel talk .
I understand that it ’s highly likely someone will give you “ travel advice ” that proves to be utterly useless .
I also understand that ’s it ’s likely some of us will follow the trail of a “ magical location ” that proves to be a total dud .
These situations are inevitable and aggravating , but there ’s a way around them .
Let me tell you a story .
In November of 2006 , I visited the charming town of Trinidad in south - central Cuba .
It was a welcome departure from Havana as I was beginning to feel a little suffocated by the busy , tourism - oriented capital city .
I ’d found what I ’d thought was a perfect escape in the colourful town of Trinidad until I caught wind of “ an amazing , seldom - visited seaside village ” further west .
Intrigued by tales of white sand beaches , crystal waters and friendly , welcoming locals , my travel mate and I did what responsible adventurers were meant to do and chartered an old Volga to take us to that desolate paradise .
As we drove along narrow , windy roads bordered by the beautiful ocean , we passed a multitude of towns , farms and similar pleasant landscapes that gave you the impression you were catching satisfying glimpses of a more “ authentic ” Cuba .
All the while , we eagerly anticipated our arrival – could we possibly extend our stay in Cuba and hide out for a few days more in this mystery town ?
Our arrival was rather jarring .
The taxi dropped us off on a street that housed a row of colourful , single - story residences .
There was no beach in sight , and the locals must have been having their siestas because there were not a single person in sight either .
On first impression , this place was seriously underwhelming .
We made our way to a local man ’s home , and he grudgingly agreed to put us up for the night .
( We felt somewhat comforted in learning that we were n’t the first visitors to have visited this particular location . )
Once we were settled in , we eagerly packed our swimming gear and headed out to find the elusive white sand beach we ’d been looking forward to .
Let ’s fast forward to what happened next .
Our quest for the white sand beach came to an abrupt halt when we discovered the region ’s seaside offerings .
There was a generous sandy strip , I ’ll give it that .
But that was it .
What our travel advisors had failed to mention was that the beach was contained by an unsightly cement barrier that kept the pummeling waves at bay .
Not only that , but this large barrier sat at most about a hundred meters away from the water ’s edge , meaning that our views of the sunset would be obstructed .
On quick inspection of the water , we discovered that it was teeming with sea urchins , making swimming virtually impossible .
We went home , dejected and annoyed , where our grumpy host served us a stew that we thought contained strange bits of gelatinous meat .
We guessed it to be sea cucumber , or jellyfish .
To add insult to injury , we later found out that we ’d been eating pigs ’ intestines , but this naturally occurred only after we ’d already eaten them .
What do you do on a similar occasion , when your trip ends up being a total bust ?
Do you get angry ?
Do you bemoan your unfortunate situation ?
And do you swear off listening to the travel tips that take you to make - or - break location and stick to the path that ’s been clearly laid out by the guide books ?
Here ’s what I did : I soaked it up .
I ’ll be the first to admit that I ’d been expecting some sort of untouched paradise , akin to the idyllic island captured in The Beach .
Taking into consideration the intestine feast and the sea urchin beach , you can imagine that I was severely disappointed .
Interestingly , a good night ’s sleep changed my – our – viewpoint by morning .
The next day , we strolled over to the beach again and sat and laughed at our predicament .
We ’d used up our travel allowance when we ’d paid for the taxi to this desolate location , so we were stranded until we could make up the difference .
The beach was excruciating , in the sense that it looked beautiful but that it was actually a virtual mine - field beneath the water ’s surface .
Undeterred , we decided to make the most of it .
Our day was spent lounging in the sun , stealing coconuts from the surrounding trees and befriending the local mutts that patrolled the area .
The highlight of our day came when a local fisherman approached us , offering an incredible home - cooked lobster meal that would be served right there on the beach .
We ’d already spent more money than we ’d hoped to , but we had that defeated , “ why not ? ” mentality to us and readily agreed .
Best .
Decision .
Ever .
In hindsight , that little side - trip serves a good reminder , and most surprisingly , as a good memory !
I learned that you ca n’t always prepare for the bumps in the road less traveled , but you can learn to accept the sidetracks and make the most of them .
Had I taken on a sour attitude , that trip would have been a virtual disaster .
Instead , I looked at it as an inevitable and unexpected detour .
I learned you can make anything fun , as long as you reframe it and look for the best in the situation .
When I look back , that trip serves me as a constant source of laughter , and it ’s a story I love to share .
The trip itself may have been underwhelming in many ways , but in others it was so fulfilling .
I think I became a more mature , accepting traveler because of the unexpectedness of the situation , and that ’s something I still carry with me today .
Pig intestines aside , I consider that trip a success .
I hope you can keep this in perspective when you come to face a similar situation .

Armenian - Americans have lobbied for official use of the world " genocide " The Obama administration has called on a Congressional panel not to describe the killing of Armenians by Turkish forces during World War I as genocide .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee to hold off a vote on the issue , the White House said .
She said the non-binding resolution would harm talks between Turkey and Armenia .
The resolution is fiercely opposed by Turkey , a key ally of the US .
In 2007 , a similar resolution passed the committee stage , but was shelved before a House vote after pressure from the George W Bush administration .
Turkey has warned of consequences for US - Turkey ties if the latest resolution is passed .
During his election campaign President Barack Obama promised to brand the mass killings genocide .
' Too important '
On Thursday , committee chairman Howard Berman urged fellow members of the committee to endorse the resolution despite the White House warnings .
Q&A : Armenian genocide dispute " I believe that Turkey values its relationship with the United States at least as much as we value our relations with Turkey , " he said .
The Turks , he added , " fundamentally agree that the US - Turkish alliance is simply too important to get side - tracked by a non-binding resolution passed by the House of Representatives " .
Even if the committee approves the resolution , it is unclear whether it will go forward to a vote in the House of Representatives .
A Turkish parliamentary delegation has gone to Washington to try to persuade committee members not to approve the resolution .
It calls on Mr Obama to ensure that US foreign policy reflects an understanding of the " genocide " and to label the World War I killings as such in his annual statement on the issue .
Nationalist sentiment is intense in Turkey and , if the resolution passes , there will be an emotional reaction , even by those who have been arguing for reconciliation with Armenia , says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Istanbul .
In October last year , Turkey and Armenia signed a historic accord normalising relations between them after a century of hostility .
Armenia wants
Turkey to recognise the killings as an act of genocide , but successive Turkish governments have refused to do so .
Hundreds of thousands of Armenians died in 1915 , when they were deported en masse from eastern Anatolia by the Ottoman Empire .
They were killed by troops or died from starvation and disease .
Armenians have campaigned for the killings to be recognised internationally as genocide - and more than 20 countries have done so .
Turkish officials accept that atrocities were committed but argue they were part of the war and that there was no systematic attempt to destroy the Christian Armenian people .

In recent weeks , a pair of white European swans at Ramat Gan 's Safari Park have been refusing to let the black Australian swans enter the safari's pond and swim there .

The " blockade " launched by the white swans has been particularly hard on the black swans as the mercury climbed over the past few days .
Safari workers note that the move began a few weeks ago when the swans ' caretakers noticed that a pair of white swans was not allowing a pair of black swans to take a dip in the pond , which is their usual wont .
The two types of swans , Safari worker explained , have until now lived side by side for many years without any particular problems .
At first , the workers thought this was a temporary measure that would end in a day or two .
The caretakers thought it was aggressiveness related to the courting season of the white swans .
But the white swans have not shown any signs of courtship .
They have not started building nests and have not acted like swans in the midst of mating season .
Still the blockade has continued .
Will the High Court step in ?
Since then , Safari workers note , each morning the male and female white swans can be seen patrolling back and forth near the entrance to the pond and each time a black swan tries to find relief from the heat in the cool pond waters , they are immediately chased away .
" They have left the black swans a very small swath of land , " said the head of the Safari 's avian department , Dr. Gilad Goldstein .
In order to ease the situation for the black swans , the workers distribute food for them in several spots near the pond and also in some more distant spots in order to get the white swans to move a little away from the pond and open the entrance to the water and allow the black swans to bathe a bit .
" If this does n't stop soon , " Goldstein said , " we 'll have to find a solution for the black swans in order to restore tranquility to their lives .
In the meantime we are trying all sorts of intermediary solutions to open the water channels to them .
It 's funny to say , but the caretakers are using peace activists to deal with this . "
The black swan is a special kind of swan with black feathers discovered in Australia in the 18th century .
Since the existence of a non-white swan was thought impossible before then , the term " black swan " became a synonym for an event that happens despite slim odds .

NALP Employment Numbers : What to Believe ?
Posted by Zach Lowe
Give NALP credit for this :
They are not trying to sugarcoat the employment statistics for the law school class of 2009 , which are better than anticipated at first glance .
The overall employment rate for those bushy - tailed '09 graduates was 88.3 percent as of mid-February , which is down from a 91.9 percent employment rate at the same stage after graduation for the class of 2007 , according to NALP data , to be released later today .
That 88.3 percent figure is the lowest for any class since the mid-1990s , NALP says , but it seems pretty darn high given the doom and gloom surrounding the legal market amid the broader economic collapse .
But of course , that number is not accurate on its own , and NALP acknowledges that the 88.3 figure masks the true state of the legal market for the class of 2009 .
Many more jobs that qualify as " employment " for the purposes of the NALP survey are actually temporary , including 41 percent of all public interest jobs , many of which are undoubtedly tied to deferrals from big firms .
Overall , 25 percent of all jobs reported to NALP are temporary , and more than 10 percent of all reported jobs are part - time , up from 6 percent for the class of 2008 , NALP reports .
There is more : A ton of students are getting postgraduate jobs at their law schools , a majority of which are temporary , and those positions played a big role in boosting the overall employment percentage to 88.3 percent , NALP says .
Overall , NALP estimates that law schools created about 800 jobs for 2009 grads , bumping up the overall employment rate by about two percentage points .
" At the high end , " NALP says , " those jobs can account for up to 50 jobs on a single campus . "
Want more context ?
Nearly one - quarter ( about 22 percent ) of 2009 graduates who have jobs are looking for different jobs , up from 16 percent for the class of 2008 in the same period last year , NALP reports .
Fewer 2009 graduates are working in jobs that require law degrees , and more than 1,000 class of 2009 grads who reported employment at a private firm are actually working as solo practitioners .
The raw number of reported solo practitioners jumped by about 375 as compared with the class of 2008 , and that jump alone accounts for about one percentage point in the reported 88.3 percent employment rate , NALP says .
So the big question for 2009 graduates is not necessarily what their employment numbers look like now .
It 's this :
What will they look like when all of those temporary and part - time jobs disappear ?
A total of 192 ABA - accredited law schools participated in the survey , accounting for about 41,000 class of 2009 graduates -- or about 93 percent of all graduates from ABA - accredited law schools in the U.S. , NALP says .

Landmark legal action challenging a patent over breast cancer gene BRCA1 is being launched in Australia today .
The Australian action follows a lawsuit in the United States against patent holder Myriad Genetics .
Both the US and Australian legal cases are attempting to remove patents from human genes altogether .
The lawyers are trying to prove that patents should not have been awarded over human genes because they say these genes occur in nature , and therefore are a discovery , not an invention .
In March , the Federal District Court in New York ruled that patents should not have been granted to Myriad Genetics on two human genes , BRCA1 and 2 .
Melbourne - based company Genetic Technologies Limited ( GTL ) has the exclusive licence from Myriad to do the BRCA1 and 2 testing in Australia .
The tests show whether a woman is more susceptible to developing breast and ovarian cancer .
The action being launched in Australia 's Federal Court today aims to deem GTL 's monopoly on the gene mutation invalid .
The case is being brought against four biotech companies , including GTL and Myriad , by law firm Maurice Blackburn , national consumer group Cancer Voices and Yvonne D'Arcy , a Brisbane woman with breast cancer .
Lawyer Rebecca Gilsenan says there are many dangers to having a monopoly on this patent .
" There 's a philosophical and ethical issue about commercialising the human body and its genetic material , " she said .
" Beyond that though , there 's a practical concern and that is that the patent owner has a right to prevent people from studying and testing for the gene mutation .
" Gene patents can have the effect that they stifle research , they can stifle the development of treatments that researchers might otherwise develop and they can impede access to diagnostic testing for that gene mutation . "
Ms Gilsenan says GTL 's monopoly could lead to Australian women paying significant sums of money to test for BRCA1 and 2 , which are responsible for up to 10 per cent of cases of breast cancer .
" The patent owner has the right to be the exclusive tester , if you like , and therefore it can drive up the cost , it can create delays , " Ms Gilsenan said .
" It means there 's no competition and therefore nobody could develop an improved test so there 's all sorts of consequences - mainly cost and quality . "
In the US , Myriad Genetics charges women about $ 3,700 to test for BRCA1 and 2 , and the company does not allow second opinions .
In Australia , GTL has " gifted " its intellectual property rights to institutions and does not impose royalties .
But in 2003 and 2008 , GTL sent legal letters to Westmead Hospital and the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute in Victoria , telling them to stop testing for the BRCA1 and 2 genes .
GTL withdrew the threat after a public outcry , but the situation remains uncertain for medical researchers .
Patent law expert at the Australian National University , Dr Luigi Palombi , says the court action being launched today is extremely significant .
" It is important because for the first time in Australian legal history , the Australian courts are going to rule on whether an isolated biological material , such as the human gene which has been removed from the human body , is an invention , " he said .
" For the last 20 - odd years the Australian patent office [ IP Australia ] has been granting patents on all manner of genes and biological material such as plants , plant genes , viral genes - all manner of biological material .
" Having patents over what really amounts to raw fundamental data prevents others from using those materials in new and useful and inventive ways .
" It will mean a message will go out to the patent office immediately that it can no longer continue to pursue a policy that 's led to the grants of these kind of patents .
It will force biotechnology companies to start innovating in different ways . "
At least 20 per cent of human genes are patented in Australia , and the outcome of this legal action is likely to have implications for other genetic patents .
CHAPPAQUA , NY — After more than 60 years of redacting classified but amusing anecdotes from Reader 's Digest 's popular Humor in Uniform section , the CIA announced Monday that the full text of thousands of previously censored jokes will now be made available to the public .
A sidesplitting personal reminiscence once censored by CIA officials in effort to avoid compromising the stability of U.S. - backed military dictatorships .

Submitted to the monthly magazine by covert field operatives , paramilitary officers , and black - ops specialists , the lighthearted vignettes have for decades only appeared with their most sensitive and hilarious details obscured .
" Since the dawn of the Cold War , certain humorous materials have been kept from the American public in the name of national security , " CIA director Leon Panetta said at a press conference .
" But thanks to recent declassification efforts and the Freedom of Information Act , citizens will now be able to see for themselves what exactly was so funny about the historical goofs and gaffes of this agency 's most confidential overseas operations . "

Added Panetta , " Never before has so much laughter been brought to light . "
Panetta pointed out several " rib- tickling gags " relating to the 1973 Chilean coup , the Iran - Contra Affair , and the rise of crack cocaine , all of which had their punch lines blacked - out when originally published .

He also made mention of a 1962 joke that only became comprehensible once the names in the story were revealed :
In it , CIA agents are brainwashing Lee Harvey Oswald to turn him into an assassin .
The first agent , who wears a JFK mask , is beating Oswald in the face and counting out his punches , " One - two !
One - two ! "
A second agent , playing the " good cop " role , enters the room with a cup of coffee and , without thinking , asks Oswald , " Would you like one , too ? "
Oswald shrieks in terror , and the project is delayed for months .
The editors of Reader 's Digest said they were " thrilled " to finally make the estimated 3,000 pages of classified anecdotes public , calling it a victory for democracy and for people who like to laugh .

" I 'll admit this one is n't very funny if you can't read the part explaining how one of the briefcases contains vital information that could have prevented the 9/11 attacks , " said editor - in - chief Peggy Northrup , referring to a previously redacted Humor in Uniform story detailing a wacky mix - up that led to hundreds of deaths .
" And sure , it 's confusing to end a joke with ' it just goes to show you ' when the thing we 're trying to show you has been blacked - out to protect the identity of some ex-con who funneled money to several Salvadoran death squads in the 1980s . "
Added Northrup , " Actually , I still do n't really get that one . "
Now that the Humor in Uniform archives have been declassified , longtime readers are experiencing both chuckles and chilling insight into all the hilarious conundrums intelligence personnel have gotten themselves into during six decades of deniable operations .

" There 's this great one from 1982 , about the old spy and the young spy taking bribe money to a resistance leader in the desert , " subscriber Shelley Holmes said .
" It was all blacked - out except for the part where the old spy says , ' I remember when the payoffs were skinny and the dictators were fat ! '
It takes on new meaning now that I know the old spy , who had spent the 1970s ferrying moderate sums of CIA funds to portly South American fascists , was now handing over taxpayer - backed bearer bonds for $ 25 million to Osama Bin Laden , who is quite slender indeed . "
Service members and intelligence personnel will likely always submit their comic musings to Reader 's Digest , Panetta said , because humor is still the best way to help deep - cover specialists cope with the stress of events like the Laotian Civil War , the torture of an innocent terror suspect , or even a goofy blunder that might occur when agents attempting to influence the ongoing drug war in Mexico try to introduce Ebola into a Ciudad Juárez reservoir but accidentally capsize their canoe and instead release the deadly virus on the American side of the Rio Grande .

" I think I speak for all of us when I say I can't wait to see how that one turns out , " Panetta said .
" I 'm laughing already . "
L.A. County sheriff 's detectives are trying to determine why a woman armed with a butcher knife and a kitchen knife allegedly stabbed four people , one of whom is in critical condition .
The assailant was identified as Layla Rosetta Trawick , 35 , from Antioch , Calif. , authorities said .
She was stopped by an off - duty deputy shopping at the store , Clay Grant Jr. , who is assigned to the Men 's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles , Capt .
Michael Parker said .
“ We are exceptionally proud of Deputy Grant , ” Parker said .
“ The reason why this tragic situation was n’t worse was because of the quick thinking of an armed , off - duty sheriff ’s deputy who was willing to risk his life to end this situation . ”
The stabbing set off a stampede among customers , authorities said .
Deputies with the sheriff 's West Hollywood station responded after numerous 911 calls reported a gunman at the Target at La Brea Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard , Sgt. Josh Mankini said .
But it turned out a woman had stabbed four people in the store and was holding a bloody knife when the off - duty deputy confronted her and ordered her to give up the weapon , Mankini said .
DETROIT – Opening the U.S. Social Forum in this city hit hard by the economic crisis , 20,000 from around the nation marched Tuesday calling for jobs , economic and social justice and equality .
They range from conservatively dressed professionals and workers from all sorts of backgrounds to young people lugging backpacks and sleeping bags .
They are a rainbow – Black , white , Latino , Asian Pacific and Native American .
It amounts to a peaceful takeover of the Motor City for the first week of summer , by union members , community activists , civil rights supporters , environmentalists and many more .
“ The labor movement in this capital of organized labor welcomes all of you to this city , ” declared Sandra Williams , president of the Metro Detroit AFL - CIO , at an opening gathering attended by thousands .
“ When unions grow stronger good things happen for all workers , union and non-union , ” she said to the cheers of the throng .
“ The labor movement needs to get to know all of you and to help in your struggles .
You need to get to know the labor movement and support workers in all of their struggles – particularly the fight to organize .
That way , we will all go forward together , ” she said , to more cheers .
Marian Kramer of the Michigan Welfare Rights Organization was in the crowd .
“ Detroit is ground zero for the failed economy , ” she said , “ with almost 30 percent unemployment and severe environmental threats to our air and water .
“ This Social Forum shows we are not just a city of problems , but we are also a city of solutions , ” she said .
She said her organization has been able to slow down utility shutoffs in the area .
And the East Michigan Environmental Council says it has helped win recent strengthening of regulations on water quality here .
Native Americans and their struggles occupy a prominent position at this U.S. Social Forum .
The forum opened with a ceremony and songs by the First Nation Dancers and Drummers , who are from the Anishinabe nation , which is indigenous to the state of Michigan .
Anishinabe leaders told the crowd that the protection of their ceremonies and cultural practices was a serious concern for them .
The Anishinabe , who have been in the Detroit area for many generations , face problems of assimilation , they said .
They see preserving their culture and history as having been made difficult by those in power and they said that if they can pursue their own traditions freely they will be able to make a bigger contribution to the broader progressive movements .
The Communist Party USA and the Young Communist League are among the many organizations participating in the Social Forum .
The two groups marched in the parade yesterday and the YCL is sponsoring a workshop entitled “ Jobs and Education , not War ” on Wednesday .
On Thursday , Sam Webb , chair of the Communist Party , will lead a discussion entitled “ From reform to revolution : Working class politics in the age of President Obama . ”
The party and YCL will sponsor a “ meet and greet ” with refreshments Thursday night at the downtown Swords into Plowshares Peace Center .
The U.S. Social Forum traces its roots back to the World Social Forum in Brazil in 2001 – the people ’s alternative to the the World Economic Forum , the annual gathering of big capitalists at Davos , Switzerland .
The first U.S. Social Forum was held in Atlanta in 2007 .

More Americans filed for bankruptcy protection in March than during any month since the federal personal bankruptcy law was tightened in October 2005 , a new report says , a result of high unemployment and the housing crash .
Federal courts reported over 158,000 bankruptcy filings in March , or 6,900 a day , a rise of 35 percent from February , according to a report to be released on Friday by Automated Access to Court Electronic Records , a data collection company known as Aacer .
Filings were up 19 percent over March 2009 .
The previous record over the last five years was 133,000 in October .
“ Even with the restrictive new law , we ’re back up over where we were before the law changed , ” Mike Bickford , president of Aacer , said in a phone interview Thursday from his headquarters in Oklahoma City .
He faulted the stagnant economy , saying a surge in bankruptcies generally follows economic contraction by 6 to 18 months , and he pointed to March as a historically busy month for bankruptcy filings .
Other experts point out that filings invoking Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code , a simple and inexpensive option , are rising faster than more complex Chapter 13 reorganization filings , under which consumers repay a portion of their debts so they can keep their homes , suggesting that more homeowners are simply walking away from underwater mortgages .

Der Verein Deutsche Sprache will mit einem Teilboykott der Rundfunkgebühren auf den seiner Ansicht nach zu geringen Anteil deutschsprachiger Musik in den öffentlich - rechtlichen Radiosendern aufmerksam machen
Der Verein Deutsche Sprache ( VDS ) machte bisher vor allem durch seinen Kampf gegen das " Denglische " von sich reden .
In diesem Rahmen verleiht er unter anderem den Negativpreis " Sprachpanscher des Jahres " und betreibt mit dem Anglizismen - Index ein Online - Nachschlagewerk , das Alternativen zu englischen oder vermeintlich englischen Wörtern und Formulierungen enthält .
Nun hat der VDS die öffentlich - rechtlichen Radiosender entdeckt - und dass der darin gespielte Anteil deutschsprachiger Musik außer in Spartenprogrammen angeblich fast überall unter 10 Prozent liegt .
Aus diesem Grund rief der Vorstand seine Mitglieder auf der Bundesdelegiertenversammlung im niederbayerischen Landshut die nach eigenen Angaben gut dreißigtausend Mitglieder zu einem teilweisen Rundfunkgebührenboykott auf .
Beginn der Aktion ist der 1 . September .
Von den 5,60 Euro Radiogebühr sollen danach 60 Cent an die BBC und 1 Euro auf ein Sperrkonto überwiesen werden .
" Das Geld für die englische Musik " , so der VDS - Vorsitzende Walter Krämer , " soll [ nämlich ] dahin gehen , wo die Musik herkommt " .
Nach Amerika , woher möglicherweise ein größerer
Teil der in deutschen Radios gespielten englischsprachigen Musik stammt , will man deshalb nichts überweisen , weil sich hier nach Sicht des Vereins keine entsprechende Institution anbietet .
Die mit einen Juristen abgesprochene Protestaktion sieht vor , dass die GEZ beziehungsweise eine der öffentlich - rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten , die in solchen Fällen für sie tätig wird , nach einer Zeit des Abwartens einen oder mehrere Teilnehmer an der Protestaktion verklagt und sich in dem dann folgenden Verfahren Fragen zur Bedeutung deutschsprachiger Musik für die so genannte " Grundversorgung " und den " Kulturauftrag " stellen muss .
Die Gebühreneinzugszentrale ( GEZ ) meinte gegenüber Telepolis , man habe den VDS lediglich darüber informiert , dass auf Mitglieder , die sich an den Protest beteiligen , ein Mahnverfahren zukomme .
Die Musikauswahl sei alleinige Sache der Radiosender , die man nicht kommentieren wolle .
Von Seiten der BBC gibt es bisher noch keine Reaktion auf den Vorstoß .
Derzeit versucht der VDS an ein Konto bei der britischen Sendeanstalt zu kommen , auf das die Gelder überwiesen werden .
Vor einigen Jahren brachte der Freistaat Bayern eine Gesetzesinitiative auf den Weg , die zum Ziel hatte , das französische Modell zu übernehmen .
Vor allem Erwin Huber exponierte sich damals als Sprecher des Vorhabens .
Unterstützt wurde er dabei von den SPD - Politikern Wolfgang Thierse und Kurt Beck .
2004 wurde die Einführung einer Radioquote dann im Bundestag diskutiert .
Damals verabschiedete die rot -grüne Koalition eine Empfehlung , nach der Radiosender sich an einer Quote von 35 % deutschsprachiger Musik orientieren sollten .
Auswirkungen hatte die nicht strafbewehrte Empfehlung allerdings keine .
Befürworter einer Radioquote für deutschsprachige Musik verweisen immer wieder darauf , wie gut diese Quote in Frankreich funktionieren würde , lassen dabei aber das qualitativ stark unterschiedliche Angebot in den beiden Sprachen außer Acht .
Eine Quote für einheimische Produkte muss deshalb keineswegs mit einer Verbesserung des Programms einhergehen - historische und regionale Beispiele zeigen vielmehr , dass eher das Gegenteil der Fall sein dürfte .
Radioquoten gab es unter anderem in der DDR .
Ob sie dort unbedingt die Qualität der Popmusik förderten ist fraglich - nicht umsonst reimte man später " City , Puhdys und Karat " auf " größte Greueltat " .
Seit Anfang dieses Jahres scheint auch in der Bayern - 2 - Radiowelt der Anteil deutschsprachiger Produktionen erhöht worden zu sein , weshalb jetzt zahlreiche Dialektrocker die vorher überwiegend auf Qualität ausgerichtete Musikauswahl verderben und manche Hörer lieber zu einem der zahlreichen Internet - Alternativen greifen lassen .

Afghanistan War Costs More Than 1,000 U.S. Service Members ' Lives Military officials warn casualties will rise with summer troop surge .
WASHINGTON , May 28 , 2010 -- The U.S. - led war in Afghanistan , launched in response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , reached a milestone today as reports of one more service member killed in the conflict raised the total number of U.S. military deaths in and around Afghanistan to 1,000 .
According to the Pentagon , 1,000 service members have been killed in Afghanistan , Pakistan and Uzbekistan since combat operations began in the region nearly nine years ago .
This includes 15 service members killed in Pakistan and one in Uzbekistan .
More U.S. service members have died in the Afghanistan theater than any other part of the military 's broad worldwide counterterrorism mission known as Operation Enduring Freedom .
According to a press statement , a service member died today following an improvised explosive device ( IED ) attack in southern Afghanistan .
The statement did not identify the victim 's nationality , but a U.S. spokesman said that the service member was American .
The milestone of 1,000 deaths resulting from the broader operation that launched the " war on terror " was reached in March of this year .
Although the bulk of fatalities occurred in Afghanistan , that total also included the deaths of U.S. service members in countries ranging from Djibouti to the Philippines , reflecting the global nature of the mission .
" Every single casualty affects people .
It affects leaders , but more importantly it affects families , it affects children , it affects parents , spouses .
So each one of them is sacred , " Gen . Stanley McChrystal told reporters earlier this month .
McChrystal is the senior commander of all NATO forces in Afghanistan .
" The force is strong , " he said . "
The force believes in the cause .
The force understands that what we 're doing is important .
But casualties are something that I hope that the American people will keep in their minds as -- and their hearts , " he said .
McChrystal and other officials have warned that the number of fatalities in the Afghanistan conflict will continue to rise as the United States sends more troops to take on al Qaeda and Taliban strongholds in that country .
The Obama administration ordered in an additional 30,000 U.S. forces to Afghanistan in December to implement McChrystal 's new strategy to enhance security across the country .
More Troops , More Casualties
About 94,000 U.S. troops serve in Afghanistan , with the aim of having 98,000 by year 's end .
Reflecting the greater number of troops dedicated to the fight in the Afghanistan , the casualty levels have risen as more troops come into contact with Taliban fighters .
The 313 U.S. fatalities in 2009 was double the 2008 total of 155 , and so far this year the numbers have increased dramatically , already more than double the number of fatalities from the same period a year ago .
" There will be more targets , but there will also be more security , which will ultimately decrease casualties , " said retired Army general and ABC News military consultant William Nash .
" The key is going to be synergy between military , politics and economics .
...
Over a period of one or two years , I think there 's a great opportunity to make progress . "
An increasing threat to U.S. forces has been the Taliban 's use of roadside bombs .
They are less sophisticated than the bombs American forces faced in Iraq , but they have proven just as deadly .
More often , the bombs are made from fertilizer , which has led the Afghan government to ban certain fertilizers in strategic regions such as southern Afghanistan .
The Pentagon figures do not include CIA , Drug Enforcement Administration or other civilians killed in the war , including the seven intelligence operatives killed in a base attack in late December 2009 .
The Pentagon also keeps a separate tally of fallen service members and Defense Department civilians who have died supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom .
3,479 military service members and 9 department civilians have been killed in action in Operation Iraqi Freedom , according to Pentagon reports .
While the death toll in Afghanistan climbs , U.S. losses in Iraq continue to go down with the improved security situation .
As the United States prepares for a major drawdown of forces this year to 50,000 by September , the number of American forces in Afghanistan now exceeds the number in Iraq .
There are now 94,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan and 92,000 serving in Iraq , as of May 24 .
Improved Security in Iraq : Fewer U.S. Troops , Casualties
Last year was the deadliest year for U.S. service members fighting in Afghanistan and the first time U.S. casualties there exceeded the number in Iraq .
At least 313 U.S. soldiers died in Afghanistan last year , nearly twice as many as in 2008 .
In Iraq , 150 Americans lost their lives , half as many as the year before .
December 2009 was also the first month without a U.S. combat death in Iraq since the U.S. - led war there began in March 2003 .
How To Become Invisible
It sounds incredible , does n't it ?
Like something straight out of a movie .
You'd be right to be sceptical - I was too , when I first heard of the technique .
I mean , how can it be possible ?
Bend light somehow ?
Use an advanced camouflage method as shown in the James Bond film " Die Another Day " ?
Make your molecules invisible ?
Unfortunately , none of these methods are practical .
The most promising of them would seem to be the James Bond one - at least a very basic form of that technology has already been demonstrated , though certainly not to the extent shown in the movie .
But the method I was taught takes a different approach to the problem .
One that I am pleased to be able to reveal to the world .
So will this really make me invisible ?
To all human eyes , you will be totally invisible .
You will be able to make objects appear to float around the room , you 'll be able to walk freely in and out of restricted areas without fear of being spotted , all your fantasies will become true !
You are free to use this power as you wish , though I would suggest you are careful - as we shall see , just because you are invisible to other people , it does n't mean that other animals or security cameras can't see you .
What do you mean ?
Well , as you may have guessed by now , the method of invisibility I am about to teach you is based on psychological effects .
It 's not hypnosis , and it will work on over 99.9 % of the people you will encounter on your invisible travels , but it is not 100 % foolproof ( and I have yet to see proof of any method that is ) .
It also requires a lot of mental effort to sustain the invisibility , so plenty of practise is required .
To begin with , you may experience only moments of partial transparency , but with enough training you should be able to go for over an hour in full invisibility .
My personal record is over 80 minutes of sustained transparency !
It sounds too good to be true .
Let 's get started !
Do n't try to run before you can walk .
There are several key stages which must be perfected before the effect even begins to become noticeable .
But stick with it and I guarantee that you will achieve what most people think is impossible .
I do n't believe there is anything in the technique that would make it unsuitable for any age - as long as you 're old enough to understand what I say , and competent enough to use your mind as I instruct , you will be well on the way to becoming invisible .
If this technique is so good , why have n't I seen it on TV ?
As mentioned previously , there is a large psychological element to it .
This means that although people wo n't see you , cameras will .
Trying to perform the effect on television will only make you look an idiot .
The people in the studio might not see you , but everyone at home will know exactly what you 're up to .
That 's not to say I have n't been asked - several TV presenters who have seen my demonstrations have almost demanded that I appear on their shows , but I have had to decline .
I am not currently at liberty to reveal their identities .
Are you the only one who knows how to do this ?
By no means !
I 've taught the skills to approximately 40 people over the past five years , and I know of at least two of them who have gone on to reveal the method to others .
There have also been several people I have attempted to teach , but for various reasons they gave up or did not complete the full course , and never achieved total transparency .
All of those who completed the exercises have demonstrated an ability to become invisible .
You may have even encountered one of these people and not known it !
I have also heard reports of people experiencing moments of spontaneous invisibility - take a look at this site and this site to read more about them .
Note that none of the people mentioned in these articles have been trained - given suitable instruction they would be able to control their episodes .
What about my clothes ?
Do I have to be naked ?
That 's the beauty of psychological effects - it 's not your skin that becomes invisible , it 's the whole you , which includes anything you might be wearing .
Once you have become invisible , you 'll be able to manipulate objects that are currently in view of observers , but anything on you at the time you perform the transformation will be included .
Of course , once you 're invisible you 're free to run around naked if that 's what interests you - no -one will know !
Do you offer a money - back guarantee ?
You 're paying nothing to be here , so you 've lost nothing other than a few minutes of your time reading this .
If you decide to go ahead and begin training for full invisibility you will need to devote a certain amount of your spare time to it , but believe me if you follow my instructions you will see results !
Once you master the effect , you 'll soon come up with novel ways to make money from it - though I cannot condone illegal activities .
This is some kind of joke , right ?
If you do n't want to believe this is possible , you 'll never succeed .
A positive mental attitude is one of the keys to making this work .
Read through what I have to say , and move on to the next site on your list .
For those of you who are willing to put in the time , you 'll discover just how much fun being invisible can be !
Come on !
How do we do it ???
Ok , ok , I wo n't keep you waiting any longer .
It 's time to let you in on the secrets of true invisibility .
It starts simple , with a mental exercise that you can practise whenever you have a quiet moment .
Here 's what you have to do :
Sit somewhere you can feel relaxed
Close your eyes
Imagine what it might feel like to be invisible
Picture yourself living out your invisible fantasies
After about five minutes of this , concentrate on one part of your body - a fingertip is a good choice - and will it to become invisible .
See it in your mind 's eye as it slowly becomes transparent , revealing what is behind it .
it to become invisible .
See it in your mind 's eye as it slowly becomes transparent , revealing what is behind it .
Once it is invisible in your mind , hold that thought for as long as possible .
You may find your mind begins to wander .
If it does , do n't worry , relax .
Wait a while , and try again .
To begin with you may only be able to hold that thought for a few seconds , or perhaps a minute at most .
Keep practising .
You 'll need to be able to hold that thought uppermost in your mind for at least FIVE minutes before continuing on to stage 2 .
Distractions are , unfortunately , inevitable , but with enough practise , you 'll find you are able to ignore them .
Keep repeating this exercise for at least three weeks .
If you still have n't reached five minutes , stick with it - it will happen .
Some people have taken two or more months to achieve this , but everyone who has stuck with it has made it to five minutes .
The best way to time yourself is to glance at a clock before you begin to concentrate .
When your mind begins to wander - however slight it may be - open your eyes again and check the clock .
You may be surprised how long you kept that thought going .
Ok , I 've mastered stage 1 .
What next ?
Now that you have the ability to hold a thought about having a part of your body transparent , it 's time to move on to stage 2 .
Before beginning this exercise , make sure you have eaten nothing for at least one hour , and drunk nothing but water in the same time period .
Put yourself in the same relaxing situation you used for stage 1 .
Starting with the tips of your toes , and working slowly up the entire length of your body , imagine yourself becoming transparent .
While you do this , repeat the word " invisible " in your head .
If you do this correctly , you should take about five minutes to reach the top of your head .
By now you 'll be subconsciously aware of how long it takes for five minutes to pass , and you 'll be surprised at how accurate you can be .
In total , you 'll think of the word " invisible " about 60 times during those five minutes .
Repeat this exercise 12 times , and try to do it every day for at least two weeks - a month works well in my experience .
Yes , it 's a full hour each day , which may seem a lot , but dedication is one thing you 'll need if you 're to achieve what most people can only dream about .
And if you can't manage this stage , you 'll really struggle later .
Be aware that if anything distracts you from the exercise that you 'll need to start over again - a full hour is required , no less .
So make sure you unplug the phone and perhaps put on some relaxing music - anything that will help you keep your mind on what you 're doing , not on the things around you .
If you do choose to have music on , make sure it 's something you 're familiar with - anything new or unusual will easily catch your attention .
Should I repeat stage 1 at all during stage 2 ?
It 's not necessary to go back to stage 1 at this point , unless you feel you 're having trouble nailing the five minutes needed for the full body sweep .
Perhaps you moved on too soon , if this is the case .
Return to stage 1 for another week , then come back to stage 2 and see if it 's any easier .
Great .
Mastered both stages - why am I still visible ?
Patience !
If it was that easy , do n't you think everyone would be doing it by now ?
There is still a long way to go , but by now you are getting your head into the space it needs to be for total invisibility to become effective .
All really impressive skills take time to learn and turning invisible is no exception .
Bring on stage 3 , then !
A word of warning to those who think they can jump straight in at this stage without fully mastering the previous two - you could do yourself serious mental damage if you are not prepared .
I have never taken anyone on to this stage who I was n't sure was ready for it .
Please , if you have any doubts whatsoever , seek the advice of a medical doctor or a psychiatrist .
There is a risk involved here and I do not want to be responsible for any decline in your health .
If you have successfully completed both of the above stages , you will be mentally prepared for what is to come and you should be fine .
But please , if you have any doubts whatsoever DO NOT CONTINUE .
You have been warned .
Stage 3
Now , for the first time , we 'll get a second person involved in the exercise .
This person should be someone you trust , someone who will read through these instructions with you and understand what it is you are trying to achieve .
If this person is not sympathetic to your aims , they will only hinder your progress .
Ideally they should be your partner , but if you are single you can ask a close friend or a relative to take part .
We 'll refer to this second person as your " invisibuddy " .
Ask your invisibuddy to bring a pen and paper to the exercise .
Have them sit near you , quietly , to observe you as you perform the mental tasks I am about to list .
At the start of the task , and at the end , they should write down how " visible " they think you are , expressed as a percentage .
100 % would mean you were totally visible , and 0 % would be a very early ( and , unfortunately , unlikely ) success - total invisibility .
Throughout the exercise , if they notice any change , however small , in your visibility , they should make a note of the time and whether they thought you got more visible , or less visible , than before .
This will provide a useful " map " for you to refer to later , to see how effective your mental exercises are becoming .
Apart from these notes , your invisibuddy should have no other input into the exercise - please ask them to keep as quiet as possible throughout the hour .
Even the noise a pen makes can be distracting .
An experienced invisibuddy will try to match their breathing rate to yours , which can actually aid in your relaxation .
Now , onto the exercise from your point of view :
Castrating my son ?
- 04-06-2010 , 10:13 PM
04-06-2010 , 10:13 PM
My youngest son has been masturbating a lot lately and no matter how many beatings I give him , he just does n't stop .
I looked to see if the Bible had any solutions to this and Mark 9:43 popped into my head .
Mark 9:43 :
And if thy hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
I do n't want to cut his hands off since he needs them to hold his Bible .
So I was wondering if this could be applied to his genitals instead .
If he does n't have any genitals , he wo n't be able to masturbate , right ?
My neighbor did the same thing with his dog last year and he 's been behaving a lot better since .
I have a good friend , a retired butcher from my village and he 's willing to perform the surgery next weekend .
I know my son wo n't be able to bring me any grandchildren but I 'll just leave that up to my other sons instead .
However , I 'm not entirely sure whether this is the right thing to do but I think this might be the only way to save my boy from burning in hell for eternity .
What are your thoughts on this ?
Is anybody familiar with this solution ?
If so , did it work ?

It ’s really good if you have fresh grown tomatoes that you do n’t know what to do with or when you find good ones at the Market .
It ’s so simple .
Ingredients : 5 medium sized ripe tomatoes
½ large Onion chopped
1/3 English cucumber peeled and chopped
2 Cloves Garlic chopped
½ Green Pepper , seeded and chopped
3 tablespoons Olive Oil
2 Tablespoons White Vinegar
½ Bunch of fresh parsley ( or Cilantro if you like it )
Lots of salt to taste to wake up the tomatoes
Pepper to taste
8 ozs of spicy V8 juice ( or tomato juice -
bloody Mary mix works too )
1/3 teaspoon paprika
Half and half cream ( optional ) A cute little Summer Garnish : Cut the root end off .
Starting about 1 - inch away from the green part , make several lengthwise close together cuts in the white part toward the root end .
Leave about 3 inches of the green stalk above the cuts you just made .
Place in ice water until ready to use , the thin cuts will flair out and curl up making a brush .
Directions : Boil a saucepan full of water and drop the fresh tomatoes in for about 30 seconds .
Remove from the water and peel them under cold running water .
Chop them coarsely .
In a blender or food processor , combine the tomatoes , garlic , chopped onion , cucumber , green pepper , olive oil , vinegar , parsley and salt and pepper .
Blend to your desired texture , I like mine finer , but some people like it chunkier .
Just keep testing while blending .
Stir in the V - 8 juice and paprika .
Put it in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to blend flavors and chill .
Optional :
When you put it in the bowls to serve , pour about a teaspoon of half and half on top … it just gives it a little richer texture .
You can also add some Hot - sauce if you ’re into real spicy !
Makes about 4 servings .
I always look forward to the leftover bowl for breakfast !
Roasted Red Pimento Peppers
If you come across some nice Red Peppers ( especially ones on sale as they ’re so expensive these days ! ) or if you have an overabundance in your garden , here ’s a great way to prepare them !
They are great on their own as a side , a wonderful addition to a sandwich and are lovely when paired with cream cheese .
Cut the Peppers in half , remove the seeds and trim off the top .
Trim the inside soft spiney stuff also .
Heat your grill and get it very hot .
Lay the Peppers on the grate and let them roast – they can actually get a little black on the outside ( but not too much ! ) .
Keep turning them until they are cooked on all sides .
Place them into a paper bag and let them cool down and then peel them .
The skins will pop right off !
In this case I made a cold salad of baby artichokes , olives and peppers with an oil / garlic / vinegar drizzle !
So good and very Pretty !
These can also be put in zip lock bags and frozen .
When thawed , they come out just as tasty !
Toasted Almond , Cranberry and Spinach Salad
Ths is an absolutely amazing and taste tantilizing salad .
It 's a real crowd pleaser and a regularly requested recipe .
I 'm not really into sweet dressings , but this one is so refreshing and good !
I think the toasted almonds are the key here !
Ingredients 1 tablespoon butter
3/4 cup almonds , blanched / slivered
1 pound baby spinach
1 cup dried cranberries
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
1 tablespoon poppy seeds
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons minced onion
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup white wine vinegar
1/4 cup cider vinegar
In a medium saucepan , melt butter over medium heat .
Cook and stir almonds in butter until lightly toasted .
Remove from heat , and let cool .
In a large bowl , combine the spinach with the toasted almonds and cranberries .
In a medium bowl , whisk together the sesame seeds , poppy seeds , sugar , onion , paprika , white wine vinegar , cider vinegar , and vegetable oil .
Toss the dressing with spinach just before serving .
It is sooooo good !
Easy and tasty Red Pepper Hummus Dip I really like Hummus , but when you buy it in the grocery store it 's kind of tasteless .
This one has a little zip to it !
You can find Tahini in the ethnic section of the grocery store - It ’s sesame paste .
Ingredients 1 medium size red bell pepper cut into 1/2 " pieces
1 16oz can of Garbanzo beans drained
1 tablespoon Olive Oil
1 1/2 tablespoons of Tahini
2 small cloves of garlic minced
1 fresh lime juiced
a couple small dashes of worchestershire
1 sprig of rosemary - leaves only ( optional )
A couple sprigs of parsley finely chopped
Salt to your liking ( keep tasting as you blend )
1/4 teaspoon black pepper Combine everything into a food processor or blender .
Blend until smooth !
Add the chopped parsley and blend it in .
That 's it .
I serve it with these little pita rounds I buy from Sams Club , but it 's good on any cracker .
It 's really tasty when your first make it but even better when you let it sit a while in the refrigerator .
Tangy Dilly Potato Salad
What would Summer be without Potato Salad ?
I Love Potato Salad and make it several ways .
Hot / Cold / Skins on / Skins off – I like this recipe when I 'm in the mood for the tangy variety !
Personally I like Russet potatoes for this as they ’re a little drier and really absorb the dressing , but generally any potato will do .
We also have a recipe for German Potato Salad contributed by Ilonka that has been very popular with Cubit members .

When the potatoes are cooked drain them and let them cool down .
Peel and chop them ( I like mine chunky but it ’s all personal preference ) .
Sprinkle them lightly with white vinegar .
Peel and chop your eggs and add to the bowl .
Make the dressing by combining the mayonnaise and cream .
Stir well and add the vinegar as this will thicken it up .
Add the sugar , dry mustard , dried dill weed , salt , pepper and minced garlic .
Add the chopped veggies / pickle to the potatoes and eggs and lightly mix .
Add ¾’s of the dressing and combine well .
Keep adding it until you come up with a nice creamy consistency – but you do n’t want it too runny .
Garnish with a little paprika and add the bacon if desired .
Put in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to chill .
Love this even better on Day2 !

The Freshest and Lightest Tomato Sauce
This is probably my favorite tomato sauce of all time .
It does n't have a lot of ingredients but it 's light and good and the taste is so pure and lovely .
It is the true essence of a tomato !
If your tomatoes are n't super - ripe than just put them into a paper bag for a day or put them into a bowl and let them sit and ripen a bit more for a couple of days .
Ingredients : 24 small very ripe fresh tomatoes ( Roma preferably )
5 Large cloves of Garlic / cut in half
Olive Oil
2 sprigs of fresh rosemary – chopped
2 sprigs of fresh parsley – chopped
A handful of fresh basil leaves – coarsely chopped
1 hot pepper ( optional )
Salt to taste
Pepper Directions :
Put a large pot of water on the stove to boil ...
In the meantime assemble your Garlic / Basil / Parsley and Rosemary While the water is boiling - cover the bottom of a large saucepan with Olive Oil .
Heat on medium and saute the Garlic Cloves ( and hot pepper if using ) until brown .
Remove from the oil and discard .
Turn off the heat until the tomatoes are prepped and chopped .
Plunge your tomatoes into the boiling water .
When you see the first tomato split it 's skin ( 45 seconds ? ) ... it 's time to remove them .
Retain the tomato water to boil the pasta if you like .
Let the tomatoes cool a bit or peel them under cold running water ... Trim off the ends and any hard core .
Chop the tomatoes into a rough dice ( no scrunching or milling ) .
Add about a tablespoon of salt to the mix and let it drain in a colander over a bowl to retain the juices .
I do this because some tomatoes are very wet and it really dilutes the sauce and takes a long time to cook down .
These tomatoes were very good and I did n't get a lot of juice .
Keep the juice !
Heat up the oil and when hot , add the tomatoes .
You 'll get a nice sizzle sound .
Simmer over medium heat for about 45 minutes to an hour , stirring occasionally until thickened .
If it gets too thick ... add some of the retained juice .
Chop the rosemary and parsley and add it about 15 minutes into the cooking .
Taste and add salt if needed ( tomatoes need a lot of salt to bring out their flavor )
Add some pepper .
Meanwhile ... Prepare your pasta .
I find this sauce is good on most but really goes well with a small rigatoni or penne .
for more detailed instructions :
Roma tomatoes really do n't have a lot of seeds but some other varieties do .
If they bother you just cut the tomato in half after it 's boiled and peeled and scoop them out .
Tomatoes need a lot of salt to bring out their flavor .
Add some pepper and after cooking , the sauce will look something like this .
When the pasta is ready ... drain it and put it back into the pot .
Chop and add the basil and a few scoops of the sauce along with a couple of tablespoons of parmesan cheese .
Gently mix it all up well and let the sauce soak into the pasta .
mmmm !
I sincerely hope that if you try these recipes you truly enjoy them .
I also hope that nobody gets insulted that I include photo's of simple things like chopping veggies , etc . .
I think a photo is worth a thousand words and personally , I love cook - books with photo's .
This article is meant to appeal to everybody 's cooking level whether it 's beginner or advanced .
Happy Summer Cooking !
The Bleak Arc of Mafia II
By Chris Remo
The crime genre has expanded in games so much so that one publisher can support multiple games -- and each has its own creative vision .
Take - Two is parent of both Rockstar ( which has Grand Theft Auto and LA Noire ) and 2 K Games , which has the upcoming Mafia II .
Here , that game 's senior producer Denby Grace explains the approach that 's been taken to this game in terms narrative , visuals , and gameplay design , to set it apart .
This includes the fact that the game embraces more linear gameplay than other crime games -- something he sees as essential to presenting a polished , shooter - like experience -- yet still retains the freedom of movement players expect .
He explains also the narrative chances the developers are taking with the title -- a " bleak arc " which features an early climax and ups and downs ; one he hopes can deliver unexpected twists and show gamers the true complexity of the life of a made man .
You guys are releasing this game , and we 're starting to see promotion of LA Noire , which is the same parent company .
GTA IV obviously came out a little while back .
Where do you see Mafia II in the spectrum of this open - world crime genre ?
DG : It 's interesting :
They sit in a little bit of a different space .
GTA IV 's whole schtick -- and I 'm speaking from a fan 's point of view , not a consumer 's point of view -- is do anything in the world .
Go there ; do this .
And on the side , it has this great storyline , great multiplayer .
It does everything pretty good ; it 's a big open - world game .
LA Noire --
I do n't know anything more than you guys do about it , so I can't really talk about that .
But Mafia 's whole schtick is this cinematic experience , you know ?
It really is more like a third - person action - adventure game shooter than an open - world game .
This open - world backdrop exists because it is needed for our story ; we need the player to be able to get into the city , get cars , and do these things .
But the actual gameplay itself -- the story , the way the story 's presented , the linear sort of nurse of the story -- it 's all more like a third - person shooter .
So I think the experience is a more cinematic experience .
That 's the easiest thing to say .
It feels less of an open - world game and feels more like Uncharted or Gears of War in a lot of ways , but then you have these cars that you can drive around in an open - world city .
I think you 'll get that .
And it 's one of the reasons why we 've had to do this sort of two - pronged approach because , [ for example ] this mission , we wanted to focus on people getting their teeth into the gunplay -- something that we spent a lot of time on is making the gunplay behave more like a third - person shooter .
We worked on sort of auto - aiming stuff ; we 've got like a cover system and a really fluid system , so I think that hopefully paints some sort of picture .
And , of course , obviously , it 's not the first time ; Mafia had a similar structure .
Is that a challenge from a design standpoint when the core of the game is you 're going through this story -- you 're going through this very compelling experience -- marrying that with that backdrop that , as you say , is not the same focus as sort of an open - world , open - world , open - world game ?
Is that a challenge to marry those two in a way that does n't feel overlapping ?
DG : It is , and it is n't .
What we sort of do -- the linear - ness of the game , the scope , was something we embraced .
It allowed us to spend our time in the other areas , making sure that the other areas were really spectacularly good : things like the combat , the cutscenes .
So finding the right balance ?
Yes , absolutely .
Everything in the city that you can do , in the backdrop , supports the fiction , so we do n't give you really weird things to be able to do -- go bowling , go play darts .
It just does n't support the fiction .
We do give you the ability to go into restaurants .
We do give you the ability to go where you meet people ; go into clothes shops and buy clothes because you need to change your appearance -- the player might want to change their appearance , but that 's how the police system works , so .
When we sat down , we really embraced these things .
We looked at Mafia 1 , obviously ; we looked at everything else that was about at the time .
We really embraced the linear - ness of the game .
We do n't do real - time day / night cycle , and people are like , " Ugghhh ! ! ! "
But the reason why we do n't is I want to present you with a mood and a feeling while you 're playing this level .
So I want it to be rain now ; I want it to be dark , like a film .
Sometimes , when you 're doing an open - world game , you can kind of get to these points when you 're like , " Uh ? " You 're doing something really weird , and it 's kind of like the middle of the day ; it does n't have the same feeling ...
Again , it comes back to that third - person sort of attitude towards it .
And then the open - world , again , we spent a lot of time making it feel really authentic .
There 's two versions of our city : the winter city and the summer city -- ' 40s and '50s .
And then , in the '50s , you kind of have a summer and an alternate version , as well .
So as we progress through different time periods we kind of hit these things .
The really nice thing is the seasons kind of reflect the mood of the story .
At the start , it 's really a sort of bleak existence ; everything has this winter .
And then , as you 're kind of getting up , the point where you were playing today was just before you become nearly a made guy .
You 're getting some of these bigger jobs ; Joe and Vito getting a lot more respect -- well , apart from Eddie kind of giving you shit for losing that truck , but .
It kind of reflects as it goes through summer , you know ?
It 's the bright existence , the ' 50s , " the birth of cool " as marketing likes to term it ; loads of different stuff , fashions , music , and stuff .
It 's a cool change , you know ?
Again , like the stuff , we embraced the date changes we go through , you know ?
It naturally lets us ... [ explore that through ] cars and guns and music as you go through without having to refer to some sort of goofy fictional explanation .
What kind of research did you do on those two periods and the Italian - American experience particularly ?
DG : The research we did came from anywhere and everywhere .
Speaking specifically about the story , first - off , the big influence for us was obviously Goodfellas , Godfather .
Dialogue - wise , it was probably The Sopranos .
Dialogue - wise it was -- actually walking around [ here ] you can see [ 2 K director of production ] Jack Scalici .
He 's actually an Italian - American New Yorker himself .
His grandfather was in the police force in the ' 40s and ' 50s , so he actually talked to this guy a lot -- well , he was his grandfather .
But , as well as that , the type of language they used and the way they talked to one another and the way they are with each other -- a lot of that is pulled from Sopranos and all these films that we know and love .
Now , the other stuff , we looked anywhere and everywhere ; that 's the honest truth .
One of the big influences for the art teams and a good reference point for me is Mad Men .
I 'm not sure how big that is in the general public right now because it 's quite new , but it 's a good reference point for me when I 'm reviewing the art .
Their actual reference -- they 'll literally pull it from anywhere and everywhere .
You can see hints in the actual look of the game , especially in the summer , of Road to Perdition , for the art style , is a real big influence as a film .
But , as well as that , we look at things like other movies , other things from the era , Maltese Falcon , any Marlon Brando film from the era of the ' 50s , James Dean / Rebel Without a Cause for vehicles and stuff like that ; so , yeah , we pull reference from anywhere and everywhere , really .
My grandfather and his brothers were all Italian immigrants who came over and actually fought in World War II and went through the same sort of cycle -- well , they did n't join the mafia .
( Both laugh )
It was interesting seeing the initial cutscene and sort of bringing that to mind .
DG : Yeah .
There 's a lot of things in the story that we kind of hope you get that real sort of connection .
Joe and Vito -- like I said , it 's a buddy story -- the connection between these guys ...
Inherently , a best friend asking you to do something or getting you into strife is something that most of us can relate to , I think .
As well as that , the motivation of the main character to do anything to get this money for his mama and his sister -- again , that motivation is really powerful .
It 's not some random guy going , " I have a problem down on the thing .
You need to go kill him ; I 'll give you one thousand dollars . "
Alright , we have that .
we obviously have that when you go to the mafia guy , but the overall motivation of the act is -- the reason why I want to earn the money , the reason why I want to get out of this -- it 's something that we strive to do , to play with the character 's motivation and make you really connect with that , you know ?
As you progress through , you kind of go up .
The first act is sort of dictated by his father 's death and getting out of there , and as you progress forward -- at the stage you 're at now -- you 're kind of becoming a made man .
At that point , you 're becoming a bit more selfish .
You 're loving the glamorous lifestyle maybe that the mafia brings ; but then , quite quickly , you kind of reach a height , and then we kind of -- not to go into too many spoilers , but -- then we kind of reveal to the player it 's nowhere near as glamorous as it seems .
People start really getting hurt and stuff like that .
It 's an interesting slant on the story .
It 's classic in a lot of ways , but at the same time there 's some definitely good twists I do n't think people will be seeing .
That is obviously the classic arc for gangster films and stories , but in games you rarely have a peak that is n't the very end of the game .
Games traditionally are power fantasies ; they tend to want to point the player to the highest point , and that 's where you end .
DG : One thing we do n't have is ...
The story 's about the guys who do n't have aspirations become the don .
They have aspirations to become wiseguys .
I do n't think I 'm spoiling anything as I 've talked about it before :
By about 60 percent of the way through the game , you are a wiseguy .
You 're a made guy .
At that point , we start stripping things away from you .
Obviously , there is a crescendo , but then there 's quite a few peaks along the way -- or low points , even .
So we do n't aspire to the end point , which I think -- say " mafia story , " and the end point is people naturally think , " Don. Boss . " -- and it 's like , no , we do n't do that .
There is an ultimate peak , obviously , but it 's more like a movie - like story .
Again , the big influence is Goodfellas for us , the way it 's kind of like these guys get all the way up and then all of a sudden it 's like , holy shit ; get greedy , stuff happens .
It 's kind of interesting .
Well , that 's a bleak arc .
( Laughs )
DG : It 's a very bleak arc .
The story 's a pretty bleak arc .
I worked on The Darkness before , and that was a pretty bleak arc , ( laughs ) although I have had nothing to do with writing either of the games .
It 's kind of where I 'm just connecting with these bleak stories .

In the run up to the 2010 World Cup , which begins this weekend , I wanted to post my favorite YouTube soccer clip of all time .
And as the resident soccer fanatic amongst the guest bloggers here , I ’ve watched quite a few .
Roberto Carlos is a left - back from Brazil , a soccer legend who played for Read Madrid for 11 years and featured in 3 World Cups for his country .
He currently plays for the Brazilian club Corinthians and was notably left out of Brazil ’s national team for the 2010 World Cup ( not too surprising as he is now 37 years old ) .
He was recently voted best left back in World Cup History in a Dream Team poll .
In the clip below , you can see a better angle on Roberto Carlos ’ incredible ability to bend a shot , this time from a free kick .
This famous clip is from a game against France in 1997 .
There ’s a Roberto Carlos Pepsi commercial from 2002 that references this goal & the old Coke commercial with Mean Joe Greene .
The opening game of World Cup 2010 is this Friday with hosts South Africa playing Mexico .
Printer Friendly Version Israel 's Mad Dog Diplomacy
By Jonathan Cook 03 June , 2010
Countercurrents.org
Nazareth : Moshe Dayan , Israel ’s most celebrated general , famously outlined the strategy he believed would keep Israel ’s enemies at bay : “ Israel must be a like a mad dog , too dangerous to bother . ”
Until now , most observers had assumed Dayan was referring to Israeli military or possibly nuclear strategy , an expression in his typically blunt fashion of the country ’s familiar doctrine of deterrence .
But the Israeli commando attack on Monday on the Gaza - bound flotilla , in which nine activists have so far been confirmed killed and dozens were wounded as they tried to break Israel ’s blockade of the enclave , proves beyond doubt that this is now a diplomatic strategy too .
Israel is feeling cornered on every front it considers important – and like Dayan ’s “ mad dog ” , it is likely to strike out in unpredictable ways .
Domestically , Israeli human rights activists have regrouped after the Zionist left ’s dissolution in the wake of the outbreak of the second intfada .
Now they are presenting clear - eyed – and extremely ugly – assessments of the occupation that are grabbing headlines around the world .
That move has been supported by the leadership of Israel ’s large Palestinian minority , which has additionally started questioning the legitimacy of a Jewish state in ways that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago .
Regionally , Hizbullah has progressively eroded Israel ’s deterrence doctrine .
It forced the Israeli army to exit south Lebanon in 2000 after a two - decade occupation ; it stood firm in the face of both aerial bombardment and a ground invasion during the 2006 war ; and now it is reported to have accumulated an even larger arsenal of rockets than it had four years ago .
Iran , too , has refused to be intimidated and is leaving Israel with an uncomfortable choice between conceding to Tehran the room to develop a nuclear bomb , thereby ending Israel ’s regional nuclear monopoly , and launching an attack that could unleash a global conflagration .
And internationally , nearly 18 months on from its attack on Gaza , Israel ’s standing is at an all - time low .
Boycott campaigns are gaining traction , reluctant support for Israel from European governments has set them in opposition to home - grown sentiment , and even traditional allies such as Turkey cannot hide their anger .
In the US , Israel ’s most resolute ally , young American Jews are starting to question their unthinking loyalty to the Jewish state .
Blogs and new kinds of Jewish groups are bypassing their elders and the American media to widen the scope of debate about Israel .
Israel has responded by characterising these “ threats ” all as falling within its ever - expanding definition of “ support for terrorism ” .
It was therefore hardly suprising that the first reaction from the Israeli government to the fact that its commandoes had opened fire on civilians in the flotilla of aid ships was to accuse the solidarity activists of being armed .
Similarly , Danny Ayalon , the deputy foreign minister , accused the organisers of having “ connections to international terrorism ” , including al - Qaeda .
Turkey , which assisted the flotilla , is widely being accused in Israel of supporting Hamas and trying to topple Benjamin Netanyahu ’s government .
Palestinians are familiar with such tactics .
Gaza ’s entire population of 1.5 million is now regularly presented in the Israeli media in collective terms , as supporters of terror – for having voted in Hamas – and therefore legitimate targets for Israeli “ retaliation ” .
Even the largely docile Palestinian Authority in the West Bank has rapidly been tarred with the same brush for its belated campaign to boycott the settlements and their products .
The leaders of Israel ’s Palestinian citizens too are being cast in the role of abettors of terror .
The minority is still reeling from the latest assault : the arrest and torture of two community leaders charged with spying for Hizbullah .
In its wake , new laws are being drafted to require that Palestinian citizens prove their “ loyalty ” or have their citizenship revoked .
When false rumours briefly circulated on Monday that Sheikh Raed Salah , a leader of Israel ’s Islamic Movement who was in the flotilla , had been gravely wounded , Israeli officials offered a depressingly predictable , and unfounded , response : commandoes had shot him after they came under fire from his cabin .
Israel ’s Jewish human rights community is also under attack to a degree never before seen .
Their leaders are now presented as traitors , and new legislation is designed to make their work much harder .
The few brave souls in the Israeli media who try to hold the system to account have been given a warning shot with the exile of Haaretz ’s investigative journalist Uri Blau , who is threatened with trial on spying charges if he returns .
Finally , Israel ’s treatment of those onboard the flotilla has demonstrated that the net against human rights activism is being cast much wider , to encompass the international community .
Foreigners , even high - profile figures such as Noam Chomsky , are now routinely refused entry to Israel and the occupied territories .
Many foreign human rights workers face severe restrictions on their movement and efforts to deport them or ban their organisations .
The Israeli government is agreed that Europe should be banned from “ interfering ” in the region by supporting local human rights organisations .
The epitome of this process was Israel ’s reception of the UN report last year into the attack on Gaza by Richard Goldstone , a respected judge and international law expert who suggested Israel had committed many war crimes during its three - week operation .
Goldstone has faced savage personal attacks ever since .
But more significantly , Israel ’s supporters have characterised the Goldstone report and the related legal campaigns against Israel as examples of “ lawfare ” , implying that those who uphold international law are waging a new kind of war of attrition on behalf of terror groups like Hamas and Hizbullah .
These trends are likely only to deepen in the coming months and years , making Israel an ever greater paraiah in the eyes of much of the world .
The mad dog is baring his teeth , and it is high time the international community decided how to deal with him .

Thanks to everyone who participated .
All of the runners - up who did n't have a star before have one now .
But there could only be one winner , ladies and gentlemen , and that honor goes to Artful Slinger .
He left us with three tales in all , but the first one is a story that is so incredibly disturbing that it is going to haunt me every morning and evening during my commute .
Thanks for ruining my life !
Email me to redeem your prize of a $ 10 Metrocard .
For the rest of you , all you get is the horrible vision that is ArtfulSlinger 's story .
It is below :
While transferring from the L to the E at 14th street one night , very late , I was treated , with a handful of other folks , to quite a show .
A scantily clad , mid-40 's black woman , who had to be on some sort of illegal substance , was playing with herself while straddling one of the those wooden benches .
At first , when I was approaching I thought she was just joking around , but she then grabbed a soda bottle or something from the garbage next to her and inserted .
I almost threw up and ran far far far away .
Sadly , I 'm sure many people stuck around .
Thanks to all for your horrifying stories , and happy riding !

Islamic cleric Sheikh Mansour Leghaei , who was ordered to leave Australia after being deemed a security risk , says he has been denied justice .
Sydney 's most senior Shia cleric - who has been living in Australia for 16 years - is due to board a flight to Iran tonight after having his request for a permanent visa denied .
He says he has never been given an explanation of the reasons for ASIO 's assessment and maintains his deportation is unjustified .
" I'm not the only person that is unfairly treated and deported ... and I wo n't be the last unless the law is amended and changed , " he said .
" Whatever they think and whatever they may have is absolutely wrong .
" There 's an error somewhere .
We tried our very best to help them and correct that error .
" They did n't let us , simply because the act does not allow us to do so . "
Under Australian law , ASIO is under no obligation to tell Dr Leghaei why it suspects him .
Supporters of Dr Leghaei say he is a leader of inter - faith relations between Muslims and Christians .
His lawyers say the United Nations wrote to Immigration Minister Chris Evans to ask that he not be deported , but this request was declined .
Dr Leghaei will fly out with his wife and daughter but leave behind his three sons .
A recent study released by the civil liberties advocacy group highlights the rise in U.S. government Big Brother policies by localizing the National Security State with no accountability .
Politically motivated domestic surveillance and harassment are surging in the U.S. , a recent study by the American Civil Liberties Union ( A.C.L.U. ) found .
Though recent reports have indicated the military is taking a Bush Administration spy program out of hibernation — of datamining information collected through domestic surveillance policies — the civil liberties group added that local agencies and private corporation are violating rights to privacy and free speech with impunity .
The release of the report , “ Policing Free Speech : Police Surveillance and Obstruction of First Amendment ‐Protected Activity ” [. pdf ] , coincides with the civil liberties advocacy group ’s launch of “ Spy Files “ , a “ web hub on domestic political surveillance , which will serve as a comprehensive resource on domestic spying ” , according to a statement .
“ It will include a database of documents obtained through state and federal open - records requests as well as links to news reports and other relevant materials , ” it added .
Analyzing 111 incidents in 33 states , the group found that all levels of law enforcement are abusing weak standards of probable cause to meet low burdens of proof to threaten and spy on people .
The government ’s policies result in harassing , surveying and kidnapping people “ for doing little more than peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights ” displays a regression of basic human rights defense , according to the A.C.L.U. , which added :
Political spying — rampant during the Cold War under the F.B.I. ’s COINTELPRO , the C.I.A. ’s Operation Chaos and other programs — has experienced a steady resurgence in the years following 9/11 as state and local law enforcement are being urged by federal law enforcement agencies to participate in counterterrorism practices .
“ In our country , under our Constitution , the authorities are n’t allowed to spy on you unless they have specific and individual suspicion that you are doing something illegal , ” said Michael German , A.C.L.U. Policy Counsel and former F.B.I. Special Agent .
“ Unfortunately , law enforcement in our country seems to be reverting to certain old , bad behaviors when it comes to political surveillance .
Our review of these practices has found that Americans have been put under surveillance or harassed by the police just for deciding to organize , march , protest , espouse unusual viewpoints and engage in normal , innocuous behaviors such as writing notes or taking photographs in public . ”
Community policing projects — “ suspicious activity reporting ” ( S.A.R. ) programs [ . pdf ] — are expanding the reach of what the U.S. Supreme Court called the “ reasonable suspicion ” standard , a “ Spy Files ” post adds :
S.A.R. programs increase the probability that innocent people will be stopped by police and have their personal information collected for inclusion in law enforcement and intelligence data bases .
They also open the door to racial profiling and other improper police practices by giving police unwarranted discretion to stop people who are not reasonably suspected of wrongdoing . [ … ]
The Supreme Court established “ reasonable suspicion ” as the standard for police stops in Terry v. Ohio in 1968 .
This standard required suspicion supported by articulable facts suggesting criminal activity was afoot before a policeman could stop a person for investigative purposes .
Likewise , the Department of Justice established a reasonable suspicion standard for the inclusion of personally identifiable information into criminal intelligence systems .
Title 28 , Part 23 of the Code of Federal Regulations states that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funds : shall collect and maintain criminal intelligence information concerning an individual only if there is reasonable suspicion that the individual is involved in criminal conduct or activity and the information is relevant to that criminal conduct or activity [ emphasis added ] .
S.A.R. programs threaten this reasonable , time - tested law enforcement standard by encouraging the police and the public to report behaviors that are not reasonably indicative of criminal or terrorist behavior .
In January 2008 the D.N.I. [ Information Sharing Environment ( I.S.E. ) ]
Program Manager published functional standards for state and local law enforcement officers to report ‘ suspicious ’ activities to fusion centers and to the federal intelligence community through the I.S.E .
The behaviors it described as inherently suspicious included such innocuous activities as photography , acquisition of expertise , and eliciting information .
The following March the Los Angeles Police Department ( L.A.P.D. ) initiated its own S.A.R. program to “ gather , record , and analyze information of a criminal or non-criminal nature , that could indicate activity or intentions related to either foreign or domestic terrorism , ” and included a list of 65 behaviors L.A.P.D. officers “ shall ” report , which included taking pictures or video footage , taking notes , drawing diagrams and espousing extreme views .
In June 2008 , long before either of these programs could be evaluated , the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security teamed up with the Major City Chiefs Association to issue a report recommending expanding the S.A.R. program to other U.S. cities .
( Indeed , in April 2009 the L.A.P.D. admitted its S.A.R. program had not foiled any terrorist threats during its first year in operation . )
The F.B.I. began its own S.A.R. collection program called eGuardian in 2008 , and in 2010 the military announced it would implement a S.A.R. program through eGuardian .
Programs like COINTELPRO , Operation Chaos , the Denver Police Department labeling a Nobel Peace Prize - winning Quaker organization and a 73 - year - old nun as “ criminal extremists , ” and a case — just settled this week — of an antiwar activist being spied on and arrested on false charges to keep him from attending a protest are “ quickly becoming a dime a dozen ” , Amanda Simon posted today at the A.C.L.U. Blog of Rights .
In a separate post , describing the objective of “ Spy Files ” , the A.C.L.U. stated these policies are “ directed at all of us ” and the motivations are politically manufactured fear .
They are not isolated to federal law enforcement , military intelligence and foreign intelligence agencies , but extend to local agencies — even those unrelated to law enforcement :
Today the government is spying on Americans in ways the founders of our country never could have imagined .
The FBI , federal intelligence agencies , the military , state and local police , private companies , and even firemen and emergency medical technicians are gathering incredible amounts of personal information about ordinary Americans that can be used to construct vast dossiers that can be widely shared with a simple mouse - click through new institutions like Joint Terrorism Task Forces , fusion centers , and public - private partnerships .
The fear of terrorism has led to a new era of overzealous police intelligence activity directed , as in the past , against political activists , racial and religious minorities , and immigrants .
This surveillance activity is not directed solely at suspected terrorists and criminals .
It ’s directed at all of us .
Increasingly , the government is engaged in suspicionless surveillance that vacuums up and tracks sensitive information about innocent people .
Even more disturbingly , as the government ’s surveillance powers have grown more intrusive and more powerful , the restrictions on many of those powers have been weakened or eliminated .
And this surveillance often takes place in secret , with little or no oversight by the courts , by legislatures , or by the public .
“ Spy Files ” has a section where users can monitor government “ spying on First Amendment activity ” cases by state .
Shadows can be distracting ( Image : Andy Ryan / Stone / Getty )
WHEN Peter Pan lost his shadow , he was still recognisable , even though most of us find shadows help us to identify objects .
Children with autism , however , appear to regard the dark shapes as more of a distraction .
There is evidence that people with autism process images differently , including finding it harder to decode facial expressions .
To investigate how autism affects recognition of objects in general , Umberto Castiello of the University of Padua in Italy and colleagues compared the ability of 20 children with autism and 20 children without the condition to recognise …
The case of two troubled teens captivated psychiatrists at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine for months .
Eleven residents and four attending psychiatrists read up on their symptoms and met once a week to discuss them .
They stipulated early on that Edward was , indeed , a vampire .
But since he was supposedly 100 years old , not 17 as he appeared , his adolescent moodiness suggested arrested development .
As for Bella , her self - loathing and willingness to sacrifice herself made her especially vulnerable to a dangerous relationship .

When you call CK Claims , you ’ll speak to someone with a real name who can give you genuine , professional advice .
Our No Win No Fee Promise
We work on a “ NO WIN , NO FEE BASIS ” .
What does that mean ?
It means if we take your case on and do n’t win , or at any stage along that road we decide that your claim will not succeed , we cannot give you a bill for trying , or for the work already done .
Ok … What if I win ?
That would be a “ YES WIN , YES FEE ” case , in which case we can , and will give you a bill for our time .
How much will that be ?
Well , your case will have been dealt with under a C.F.A. standing for … Conditional Fee Agreement .
That means that the amount we can charge you may vary depending upon how much compensation you get awarded .
However , this conditional fee is capped in law at no more than 25 % of your damages .
So for example £ 3,000.00 in compensation , that would mean a fee of £ 750.00 .
Do you still get paid from the other side ’s insurance company ?
Yes …we get a fixed sum of money , but from April 2013 , this sum was drastically reduced .
At the same time the government brought in legislation to allow us to top up our fees out of your compensation , on the one condition that this top up would not be more than 25 % of your damages .
Of course , we only take on cases where we believe there is a realistic chance of compensation being awarded .
If you ’ve been involved in an accident or suffered some kind of injury that you believe was n’t your fault , you may well have a strong compensation claim .
When you contact us , we ’ll give you a frank and honest appraisal of your claim , and we ’ll let you know from the outset whether we recommend taking it further .

Stress - Free Accident Claims
We understand that the process of taking action against the person or organisation responsible for your accident can be stressful , especially after the stress caused by the injury itself .
That ’s why we ’re committed to working with you on a personal level from the beginning , and doing whatever we can to make the whole process easier .
That means explaining everything in simple language that you can actually understand – why would you want to listen to complex legal jargon that means nothing to you ?
Mancunians are well know for being outspoken and straight - talking , and that ’s what we ’re all about – we speak out on your behalf , and we relate to you on your own terms .
One thing that many people certainly do n’t look forward to is going to court , but this is n’t always necessary , with many claims being settled out of court .

Washington ( CNN ) --
A firm affiliated with the former Blackwater security company has been awarded a contract to provide protection to U.S. consulates and diplomats in the Afghan cities of Herat and Mazar-e Sharif , a U.S. State Department official confirmed on Saturday .
The official said U.S. Training Center got the contract on Friday .
It is part of Xe , the new name of Blackwater Worldwide .
Blackwater became the target of widespread outrage in Iraq after its contractors were involved in the September 2007 shooting at Baghdad 's Nisoor Square that left 17 civilians dead and 24 wounded , straining relations between Iraq and the United States .
The deal is a one - year contract with an option to extend up to 18 months .
If the contract is fulfilled for that entire period , it would be more than $ 120 million .
The State Department official , insisting on anonymity , said past history with Blackwater did not prevent U.S. Training Center from bidding on contracts and that in this case the company was the best qualified for the work in Afghanistan .
U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky , D - Illinois , said on Saturday she was " extremely disappointed " over the deal and that the former Blackwater should n't be receiving more U.S. contracts .
" This is a company whose cowboy - like behavior has not only resulted in civilian deaths ; it has also jeopardized our mission and the safety of U.S. troops and diplomatic personnel worldwide .
Instead of punishing Blackwater for its extensive history of serious abuses the State Department is rewarding the company with up to $ 120 million in taxpayer funds , " she said in a statement .
The congresswoman has introduced legislation that would phase out the use of private security contractors .
" Though the name Blackwater has become synonymous with the worst of contractor abuses , the bigger problem is our dangerous reliance on such companies for the business of waging war . "
As for the Nisoor Square violence , the U.S. Justice Department is pushing forward efforts to put five Blackwater guards on trial in connection with that incident .
ST . LOUIS --
As the fighters on Saturday night 's Strikeforce : Heavy Artillery card filed out of the Scottrade Center and back to their hotel after Friday afternoon 's weigh - ins , their work for the day was n't quite finished .
According to Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker , once back at the hotel all fighters were required to submit to drug tests administered internally by the Strikeforce organization via a local independent laboratory .
" It was n't based on any one specific fighter , " Coker told MMA Fighting .
" It was just the right thing to do .
It 's so all the fighters , all the fans , and all the media know what 's going on .
I talked to all the fighters about it and they were all fine with it .
" Coker said the decision to conduct the independent tests has been in the works for at least a week , and was spurred on in part by the Missouri Office of Athletics ' policy of conducting only random testing " I know that the commission here is doing random testing , but we did n't want to leave it up to that , " said Coker .
" People were asking , ' Why are n't you testing Alistair Overeem ? '
Hey , I did n't know .
It 's not up to me .
So we just said , let 's test everybody , make sure the playing field is even .
" Coker said the organization most likely would n't continue its own testing for events in California where commission standards ensure there 's " no need for it , " but he would n't rule out future internal tests when Strikeforce visits other states that use less stringent testing procedures .
Test results should be available in about two weeks , according to Coker , who added that disciplinary action for fighters who test positive for banned substances " would be very similar to what you would see in California and Nevada . "
" It 's just to make it clear to everyone that all the fighters are going to be tested , and I believe they 'll test clean , " Coker said .
( CNN ) --
Most men 50 and older should seriously consider the potential risks of treatment before deciding whether to be screened for prostate cancer , the American Cancer Society said Wednesday in revised guidelines .
" What we are trying to say to men is the harms ( of prostate screening ) are better proven than the benefits , " said Dr. Otis Brawley , chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society .
Prostate cancer screening consists of the prostate specific antigen , or PSA , blood test or a digital rectal examination .
While these tests can detect cancer , they also can produce false positive results that lead to unnecessary and uncomfortable biopsies and treatments that carry undesirable side effects such as impotence and urinary incontinence .
On the other hand , tests that appear normal can overlook existing cancers .
The American Cancer Society estimates 192,000 men were diagnosed with cancer last year .
Prostate cancer is the second leading cancer in men , killing about 27,000 in 2009 .
The cancer society now recommends that beginning at age 50 , men with no special risk of prostate cancer discuss the pros and cons of screening with their doctors and decide together whether it 's worth doing .
The new guidelines are pretty much like the old guidelines issued in 1997 and 2001 , but put more emphasis on individual counseling .
Cancer society official on what 's behind the guideline change
Stephen , 63 , a testicular cancer survivor from Hamilton , New Jersey , has undergone routine screening since he was in his late 40s .
In 2007 , his test results showed the PSA levels were climbing .
Even though his PSA levels were still below the 4.0 nanograms per milliliter threshold considered to be a positive PSA score , Stephen , who asked that we only use his first name , said he just wanted to eliminate the cancer risk .
" I did tons of research and was offered a lot of options , " he said .
" I decided to get a radical prostatectomy .
I had no really long - term side effects , thankfully . "
Cancer specialists know that because prostate cancer is usually a slow growing disease , many men are likely to die from other causes before they would die from prostate cancer .
The cancer society 's Brawley says better cancer screening tools are needed .
" In prostate cancer we desperately need to tell the difference between cancers that kill and cancers we need to watch , " he said .
Until new screening tools are available , the updated guidelines are meant to help men decide what to do .
Two studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine almost a year ago failed to clearly answer whether men should be screened using a PSA test .
One study conducted in the United States found no significant difference in the incidence of death among men who were screened for prostate cancer and those who were n't .
In the other study , conducted at multiple sites in Europe , researchers found PSA testing lowered prostate cancer - related deaths by 20 percent .
According to data from the National Cancer Institute , three out of 100 men will die of prostate cancer .
A 20 percent reduction in deaths as seen in the European study translates to only 2.4 men out of 100 dying .
Consequently the guidelines have essentially stayed the same .
The American Cancer Society believes before a man gets screened for prostate cancer , he should be educated about the pros and cons .
" We want men who want to get screened to get screened , and men who do n't want to get screened do n't have to , " Brawley said .
" It should be left up to the man . "
" I think the ACS folks got it right , " said Dr. Michael Barry , who reviewed the two major studies for the New England Journal of Medicine last March .
Barry is the chief of the general medicine unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and president of the Foundation for Informed Medical Decision Making .
He said men really need to learn about the risks and benefits of prostate screening and make a decision for themselves .
" Before we had the trials , we had to say we do n't know if there 's a benefit to screening .
Now we can begin to quantify those benefits , " he said .
The American Society of Clinical Oncology , which represents cancer specialists , including those treating prostate cancer patients , supports the Cancer Society guidelines .
" All men considering testing for prostate cancer should be fully informed by their clinicians about their risk factors and other uncertainties before being screened , " a statement from ASCO President Dr. Douglas Blaney said .
But not everyone agrees with the new / old cancer society recommendations .
The American Urological Association , which revised its guidelines last April based on the same two studies , agrees that making an informed decision for screening is important .
But it says all men with a life expectancy of 10 years or more should have a baseline PSA test at the age of 40 .
Dr. Herbert Lepor , chairman of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York , takes care of prostate cancer patients , including Stephen .
Lepor believes every man should be screened once for prostate cancer at 40 , and annually after 50 .
He says then , when you find the 10 percent to 15 percent of men whose screenings suggest a risk of cancer , you talk to them about the risks and benefits of treatment .
Lepor thinks it is impractical to suggest that a primary care physician who has 15 to 20 minutes to spend with a patient fully explain all the pros and cons of screening in the course of an annual physical .
" How do you present this to a patient ?
You can't possibly spend an hour discussing this , " Lepor said .
During the same 15 - or 20 - minute physical , the physician also has to discuss issues like blood pressure , diabetes , exercise and diet .
The new guidelines say that men can " be referred to reliable and culturally appropriate sources , " so the information does n't have to come from a doctor , Brawley noted .
For Stephen , getting screened is important .
" I would do it again , " he said .
" I have a son in his early 40s , and i'm telling him , ' Please get screened . ' "

Facebook has been giving advertisers data that they can use to discover users ' names and locations , contrary to its privacy policy .
The dominant social network tells users it wo n't share their details without consent , but according to the Wall Street Journal , it has handed over information that advertisers can use to look up individual profiles .
MySpace had a similar loophole , it 's reported .
Both sites said they were making changes to stop the handover .
Advertisers were getting reports whenever users clicked on their ads , as is typical across the web .
However , Facebook and MySpace 's reports contained the URL of the user 's profile page , which often included their real name or user name .
Neither site had bothered to obscure the data , in breach of their own privacy policies .
It 's just the latest privacy failing by Facebook , which has suffered heavy criticism this month .
Major changes to its privacy settings are expected after it decided to publish users ' private information , and IM transcripts showed CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling those same users " dumb fucks " for trusting him with their data . ®
Introduction
Drupal is an open source platform and content management system ( CMS ) for building dynamic web sites .
Supported by a vibrant developer community , Drupal is establishing itself as a leader among social software solutions .
Having already gained a small but significant share of the domestic and worldwide public sector CMS market , the solution appears on - track for continued growth .
The expanding list of high - profile government organizations adopting the solution , along with its recent recognition by industry analyst Gartner as a visionary product in the marketplace , will only accelerate its growth .
Community
One of the most important â€œfeaturesâ€ of Drupal is the breadth and depth of its community .
This was made evident recently when DrupalCon 2010 San Francisco attracted over 3,000 attendees .
Within this community , there is widespread support for leveraging Drupal to innovate new public sector solutions .
In fact , one of the keynotes of this yearâ€™s three DrupalCon keynotes ( and the only sector - specific one ) was entitled â€ œOpen Source in Government , â€ which featured representatives from the White House and New York Senate .
The overwhelming sentiment shared by these officials and others is that the strength of the Drupal Community is a key reason why the public sector is embracing the solution .
In conjunction with the emergence of Drupal enterprise service providers , the growing Drupal Community extols confidence in the platform and its long - term innovativeness , security , and supportability .

Modules
As an open source solution , Drupalâ€™s success is tied to the Drupal Communityâ€™s ability to innovate new modules ( plug-ins for Drupal that extend , build , or enhance Drupal core functionality ) to address marketplace needs .
The modules can take two forms : contributed modules ( shared under the same GNU Public License as Drupal ) and custom modules .
While the public sector benefits from many of the same contributed modules that are in use by other sectors , a number of public sector modules have been created by government for government , and subsequently contributed back to the Drupal Community , as outlined below .
These modules now form a growing code base â€ “ specific to Drupal â€ “ which public sector organizations can quickly leverage for their own requirements .
By reducing development costs and improving the efficiency of government web site design and development , modules like these are helping to justify the business case for Drupal for an ever - expanding list of organizations .
Distributions
Senior members of the Drupal Community have been championing the value of distributions for some time .
These â€œready to useâ€ solutions offer developers pre-configured Drupal installations , usually including a selection of modules and themes coupled with Drupal core .
The value of distributions is that they provide the developer community with extensible solutions that can be rapidly implemented to meet the functional and technical needs of a specific sector / vertical .
This supports economies of scale in open source development by eliminating the need for each independent developer or development shop to develop their own baseline solution for the common set of requirements for a given sector / vertical .
This allows developers to focus more on derivative innovation and reduces the total cost of feature development and software defect fixes .
For these reasons , distributions are a critical component to the growth of Drupalâ€™s adoption , especially in the public sector .
As Dries Buytaert says : â€ œWithout Drupal distributions , ( the Drupal Community ) wo n’t be able to successfully compete with commercial vendors.â€ 
Acquia Drupal
Downloaded over 125,000 times , Acquia Drupal is a social publishing platform developed by Acquia to simplify the development of interactive , community - based publishing web sites that feature both editorial and user - generated content .
By selecting only the most important modules for online communities ( e.g. , blogs , articles , forums , mashups , and web content ) , Acquia Drupal enables developers to quickly stand - up high - quality web sites that can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of their users .
This GPL licensed distribution is available for free download and organizations can turn to Acquia for 24/7 private paid support .
( Disclaimer : Forum One Communications has implemented web sites for clients on Acquia Drupal . )
PressFlow
Pressflow is a specialized distribution of Drupal developed by Four Kitchens which features extensive performance , scalability , availability , and testing enhancements required to support high traffic sites .
One of the key features of Pressflow is that it supports multi-tier proxy layers .
Since no version of Drupal can properly handle this architecture , this is a key benefit of the distribution .
To date , Pressflow has been implemented by a number of governments and multilateral organizations , including the United Kingdom and World Bank .
Open Atrium
Downloaded over 90,000 times , Open Atrium is a collaboration platform distribution developed by Development Seed to meet the knowledge management needs of large and mid-sized government organizations .
The platform provides â€œout - of - the - boxâ€ team collaboration functionality , including blogs , wikis , microblogs , and content dashboards , that enables web developers to rapidly deploy highly customizable social intranets and extranets .
This free and open source solution therefore allows a growing number of organizations to substitute proprietary social business software solutions ( such as Salesforce and Jive ) with Drupal .
Within the U.S. federal government , the Department of Homeland Security , Department of Health and Human Services , and Department of Veterans Affairs have already adopted the platform .
Looking ahead , one of the platformâ€™s key strengths is its supportability , as demonstrated by the growing ecosystem of open source development shops implementing the solution and the recent announcement that the platform will soon feature private paid support .

Currently under development by Acquia and its partners , Drupal Commons will be a free , open source distribution designed to make the process of building intranet and extranet community sites easier and less costly than commercial social software applications .
Slated for official launch this summer , Acquia expects that Drupal Commons will enable the Drupal Community to more easily develop web sites and web applications that require basic social collaboration functionality , including blogs , status updates , and social networking , coupled with seamless document sharing through customized wikis , group discussions , task reminders , and activity streams .
Like Acquia Drupal , Drupal Commons will be commercially supported by Acquia .
Real - World Implementations
As the age - old adage goes , â€ œthe proof is in the pudding .â€ 
Perhaps no better driver exists for the adoption of an emerging software solution than real - world examples of successful implementations for comparable requirements .
In the last few years , the list of successful adoptions of Drupal by domestic and worldwide public sector organizations has exploded .
This is especially true of federal , state , and local governments in North America and Europe , particularly in the United States , France , and the United Kingdom .
To illustrate this point , the showcase below features some of the most important examples of government and multilateral organization web sites and web applications currently powered by Drupal .
White House
In 2009 , the White House decided to re-launch WhiteHouse .
Gov on Drupal .
The decision to power one of the most targeted web sites in the world with an open source content management system garnered significant interest from both media and industry .
The White Houseâ€™s decision and associated media coverage helped validate Drupal as a mainstream CMS solution for all - levels of government .
New York Senate
The implementation of Drupal by the New York Senate demonstrates the potential for Drupal at the state level .
Experimenting with the platform , the organization was able to extend the existing platform through new innovations specific to their organizational needs , including OpenLegislation and Whitelist .
United States Army
The U.S. Armyâ€˜s Black History Month web site , ForLoveofLiberty .
Net , features powerful , audience - centric design ( including interactive Flash - based elements ) and deep integration with social media sites ( including YouTube , Flickr , and Issuu ) .
Designed primarily for students , educators , and veterans , the site serves as a great example of how government organizations can use social publishing to bring history to life and enable public discourse on important topics .

Net for the US Army . )
U.S. Department of Education
Drupal is the foundation behind the Department of Education ’s main organizational web site .
The site demonstrates how a federal department or agency can leverage Drupal to help make information , resources , tools , and funding opportunities more transparent and accessible to citizens .
French Government
The â€ œPortail du Gouvernementâ€ serves as the official French government portal .
Like the White House , it serves as an important example of a trustworthy Drupal implementation by a high - profile government organization .
It also demonstrates the ability for Drupal to easily support localized content requirements and customizable design .
City of London
The Greater London Authorityâ€™s web site demonstrates a successful implementation of Drupal at the local - level .
This informative web site makes excellent use of the content management features of Drupal but also leverages social features to encourage public participation with their government and community .
U.S. Department of Commerce
The Department of Commerce chose Drupal to power its Open.commerce.gov site , which was launched in response to the Open Government Directive .
The site provides a great example of how government organizations can achieve a simple , yet effective , implementation on Drupal that fosters transparency , accountability , and collaboration .
New Zealand ‘s Ministry for the Environment
NewZealand ’s Ministry for the Environment chose Drupal to power its sustainability web site .
The features of the site enable users to participate in polls , establish conservation and sustainability goals , discuss topics related to the environment , share ideas , and rate and comment on content .
This site is a compelling example of how Drupal can be used by government agencies to shape behavior , change perceptions , and build momentum around important public policy and social issues .
World Bank
Earlier this month , the World Bank launched Data .
WorldBank.org , an open data initiative aimed at making the 2,000 +
World Bank data indicators more transparent and accessible to the public .
Using MapBox , OpenLayers and Flot , the World Bank was able to create a powerful data analysis and visualization web application supported by an intuitive user interface .
This visually appealing site not only demonstrates the potential of off - the - shelf Drupal modules like Features , Context , and Views 3 , but also points to the inherent extensibility of Drupal when properly coupled with other open source solutions .
( Disclaimer : Forum One Communications was a subcontractor to the vendor who designed and developed this web site . )
United Kingdom Datastore
Whereas many other government sites utilize Drupal ’s social and interactive features and emphasize citizen participation , the UK’s Data.gov.uk site builds on Drupal ’s other skill set : content management .
The UK leveraged Drupal ’s content and database management capabilities to build a publicly accessible data store .
Young Professionals in Foreign Policy
While not specific to the public sector , Young Professionalâ€™s in Foreign Policyâ€™s organizational web site is a wonderful example of a Drupal implementation to support large , globally distributed user communities seeking to collaborate on foreign policy issues .
The organizationâ€™s simple design reflects the tradeoffs international governmental and multilateral organizations can make to enable cost - effective social functionality with Drupal .

The White House asked former President Bill Clinton to talk to Rep. Joe Sestak about the possibility of obtaining a senior position in the Obama administration if he would drop out of the Democratic primary race against establishment - backed Sen.
Arlen Specter , the Obama administration said in a report released Friday morning .
But the report , by White House Counsel Robert Bauer , concluded that " allegations of improper conduct rest on factual errors and lack a basis in the law . "
Batting down allegations that the White House dangled the secretary of Navy position in front of Sestak , the report said that Sestak was offered executive branch positions on advisory boards that were uncompensated .
One of the jobs Clinton specifically discussed with Sestak was the president 's intelligence advisory board .
But a White House official said the plan always was for Sestak to remain in the House , and he could n't have served in the House and on the president 's intelligence advisory board .
The report also described the Clinton conversations as informal and not tied to any precise job offer since , as a former president , Clinton could not guarantee Sestak anything .
Clinton initiated conversations with Sestakat the behest of White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , who was Clinton 's political director when he was president .
As president , Clinton promoted Sestak to vice admiral and made him his director of defense policy .
Sestak was also a loyal and tireless supporter of Hillary Clinton 's run for the presidency in 2008 .
At hastily arranged news conference Friday afternoon , Sestak said Clinton called him last summer to express concerns over his jumping into the Senate primary , and how his military background could help him leave a mark on the House .
Sestak said he almost interrupted Clinton to tell him Clinton that " I am going to decide to get into this or not only depending upon what 's good for Pennsylvania 's working families and not an offer .
And he said ' I knew you 'd say that , ' " before the conversation moved on to other subjects .
The White House report disputed any suggestion that there was " impropriety " in Clinton 's discussion with Sestak over possible alternatives to his Senate candidacy .
" There have been numerous , reported instances in the past when prior administrations -- both Democratic and Republican , and motivated by the same goals -- discussed alternative paths to service for qualified individuals also considering campaigns for public office , " the report read .
" Such discussions are fully consistent with the relevant law and ethical requirements . "
The report comes one day after President Obama insisted " nothing improper " happened with Sestak .
On that same day , Obama had lunch with Clinton .
" This is punishable by prison .
This is a felony , " said Rep. Darrell Issa , R - Calif. , who has been leading the charge for more details on the allegation .
" This is about the White House .
This is not about Congressman Sestak , " Issa said , adding that he wants to know what Clinton was empowered to say .
" They 've answered a question and it begs many more answers , " he said .
" We want elections not to be appointments . "
Sestak 's opponent in the general election for the Senate seat , Republican Pat Toomey , questioned why it took so long for this explanation .
" If this explanation is as innocent as it looks , I sure do n't know why it took three months to say so , " Toomey said in a statement .
" As I 've said many times , this job offer issue is not my focus , and it's not where Pennsylvanians want the focus of the campaign to be . "
Critics say the Sestak job offer may have violated the part of the U.S. code that says : " Whoever , directly or indirectly , promises any employment , position , compensation ... appointment ... provided for or made possible in whole or in part by any Act of Congress ... to any person as consideration , favor , or reward for any political activity ... or in connection with any primary election ... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year , or both . "

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israeli marines stormed a Turkish aid ship bound for Gaza on Monday and at least nine pro-Palestinian activists were killed , triggering a diplomatic crisis and an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council .
European nations , as well as the United Nations and Turkey , voiced shock and outrage at the bloody end to the international campaigners ’ bid to break Israel ’s blockade of the Gaza Strip .
Boarding from dinghies and rappelling from helicopters , naval commandos stopped six ships , 700 people and 10,000 tonnes of supplies from reaching the Islamist - run Palestinian enclave -- but bloody miscalculation left Israel isolated and condemned .
Once-close Muslim ally Turkey accused it of “ terrorism ” in international waters .
The U.N. Security Council met in emergency session .
The European Union , a key aid donor to Palestinians , demanded an independent inquiry and an end to the Gaza embargo .
Israel ’s most powerful friend , the United States , was more cautious , disappointing Turkey .
But President Barack Obama said he wanted the full facts soon and regretted the loss of life .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also voiced regret as he cut short a visit to Canada and rang Obama to call off a White House meeting that had been planned for Tuesday .
He said his forces had been attacked : “ They were mobbed , they were clubbed , they were beaten , stabbed , there was even a report of gunfire .
And our soldiers had to defend themselves . ”
For all his regret , he vowed to maintain a three - year - old embargo to stop Iranian - backed Hamas from bringing arms to Gaza .
Back home , questions were asked about how an operation that aimed to avoid bloodshed had gone so badly and publicly wrong .
The White House meeting had seemed intended to soothe ties with Obama , which have been strained by differences over Jewish settlement expansion that had delayed the recent revival of peace talks with the Palestinians .
But Obama must also balance support for Israel , which is popular with American voters , with understanding for an angry Turkey and other Muslim U.S. allies .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said : “ What Israel has committed on board the Freedom Flotilla was a massacre . ”
PAINTBALL ATTACK
Even after the vessels were escorted into Israel ’s Ashdod port , accounts of the pre-dawn operation some 120 km ( 75 miles ) out in the Mediterranean were sketchy and limited to those from the Israeli side .
Activists were held incommunicado , though Israeli officials said most would be free to go in due course .
Military night - vision video showed commandos being winched down , only to be surrounded .
Some Israeli commentators asked why commanders put troops into a position where they were cornered .
An Israeli minister admitted plans to maintain the blockade on Hamas while avoiding an international incident had backfired in spectacular fashion .
“ It ’s going to be a big scandal , no doubt about it , ” Trade Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said .
One marine told reporters his squad went in with anti-riot paintball guns but , fearing for their lives , resorted to using normal pistols or leapt overboard .
Navy video showed a commando fire a paintball at a man who seemed to be clubbing an Israeli .
Other footage showed a commando fire a pistol , two - handed .

“ We were prepared to face human rights activists and we found people who came for war , ” the marine told reporters .
Israeli military officials said nine activists died on the Mavi Marmara , a Turkish cruise ship carrying nearly 600 people .
Most of the dead were Turks , one senior Israeli officer said .
Military officials said some activists had snatched pistols from the boarding party , which responded to gunfire .
Seven troops and 20 protesters were injured , the military said .
Some officials had earlier put the death toll at 10 or even higher .
A Turkish Islamic charity chartered the Mavi Marmara .
Other vessels carried Americans and Europeans , including politicians , a Jewish Holocaust survivor and Swedish author Henning Mankell .

TURKISH ANGER
The bloodshed sparked street protests and government ire in Turkey , long Israel ’s lone Muslim ally in the region .
Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan , whose Islamist views and outreach to Iran and other Israeli enemies are blamed by many in Israel for souring relations , headed home from Chile .
He said : “ This action , totally contrary to the principles of international law , is inhumane state terrorism . ”
Some said Turkey ’s political and economic ties with Israel were too deep and complex to suffer long - term damage , but Ankara canceled joint military exercises and recalled its ambassador .
Israel told tourists in Turkey to stay indoors and dismissed any accusations that it had broken international law by boarding foreign ships far beyond its own territorial waters .
Israeli forces were on high alert but aside from scattered scuffles , there was little trouble with Palestinian protesters .
Demonstrations in European cities included Paris , Stockholm , Rome and Athens , where police used teargas against protesters who threw stones and bottles near Israel ’s embassy to Greece .
The U.N. Security Council heard calls from most members for an inquiry .
Diplomats then tried to agree on a common statement .
The Arab League condemned what it called a “ terrorist act . ” Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called it “ inhuman . ”
More worryingly for Israel , its friends showed little sympathy .
The outrage sounded at times more uniformly hostile to the Jewish state than during its offensive in Gaza , which killed 1,400 Palestinians in December 2008 and January 2009 .
Israel said it launched that war to curb Hamas rocket fire on its towns .
But it has found it harder to win understanding for an embargo limiting supplies to 1.5 million people in Gaza , including cement the U.N. says it needs to repair bomb damage .
Arizona voters Tuesday gave a resounding thumbs - up to a temporary sales - tax increase , handing Gov. Jan Brewer a victory in her yearlong crusade to raise money for a strapped state budget .
Proposition 100 was passing by more than a 3 - 2 ratio late Tuesday , according to preliminary returns .
The measure increases the state sales tax by 1 cent per dollar , to 6.6 cents .
It will take effect in two weeks .
" This is the beginning of Arizona 's comeback , " Brewer said as victory appeared certain .
The tax will bring sales - tax levies for purchases made in Phoenix to 9.3 cents on the dollar .
Other tax measures in Valley communities were meeting a mixed fate :
In Gilbert , voters were rejecting a proposed quarter - cent increase in the local sales tax , and the creation of a property tax in Litchfield Park appeared headed for defeat .
In Tempe , a 0.2 cent sales - tax hike was passing .
The statewide sales tax is not a silver bullet for the state 's budget woes .
Cuts that have led to the elimination of all - day kindergarten , reductions in health care for low - income Arizonans , a freeze on the KidsCare program and the closure of several state parks and highway rest stops will not be reversed .
The estimated $ 1 billion a year from the tax will go to education , public safety and health and human services .
But tax proponents warn that further cuts are likely as the state climbs out of a recession .
Education appeared to be the winning ingredient .
The Yes on 100 campaign relied heavily on appeals to the needs of schools and noted repeatedly that two - thirds of the revenue would go to education .
Teri Martin was typical of those who voted " yes . "
" My kids go to school right there , " she said , pointing to Gilbert Elementary School .
" Their class sizes have gotten so big .
I mean , they 've cut art teachers , they 've cut librarians , speech therapy . "
The remaining third of the tax revenue is split between public safety and health and human services .
The tax expires on May 1 , 2013 .
The passage is a win for Brewer , a Republican , who bucked many in her party to push for the tax increase .
" Doing the right thing almost always means doing the hard thing , and today , ( voters ) did the hard thing , " Brewer told a subdued crowd of about 200 gathered at Madison No. 1 Middle School in Phoenix .
She choked up as she repeated her admonition that the vote was not about her political future but about what 's right for Arizona .
Still , the success of Prop. 100 will likely give Brewer a boost in August 's crowded GOP primary .
All of her opponents opposed the tax .
Brewer reached out to those who voted " no . "
" I respect you , and I 've heard you , " she said .
Opponents said the temporary tax increase was an easy out for state government , and they argued the state must live within its means , just as many residents have done during the recession .
" I think folks will be disappointed that the tax is not going to solve the problems they were told it was going to solve , " said Republican state Sen .
Thayer Verschoor , chairman of the Ax the Tax Committee .
Tempe residents Al and Joan Laninga , retirees and registered Republicans , voted " no . "
Although she initially leaned toward the tax increase , Joan said the " yes " campaign changed her mind .
The heavy focus on education was a " scare tactic , " said Joan , 71 , a retired teacher .
" What they need to do is manage the money they have , " she said of state officials .
" We pay a lot of taxes .
We buy a lot , and tourists buy a lot . "
But Brewer said tax collections have plunged since the recession , and she and lawmakers have responded by cutting $ 2 billion from the budget over two years .
The apparent passage marks the second time in 10 years that voters have agreed to increase the sale tax in the name of education .
The " yes " vote puts Arizona in league with numerous other states that raised taxes to cope with declining state budgets .
Results wo n't be official until the May 28 canvass .
The campaign was a lopsided affair , with the Yes on 100 effort raising more than $ 2 million , compared with $ 1,200 from opponents .
The " yes " campaign put a heavy emphasis on early voting , and it paid off :
In Maricopa County , 66 percent of the mail - in vote was in favor of the tax increase .
The measure was passing in 14 of the 15 counties , preliminary results showed , trailing only in Mohave County .

I ‘ve seen this movie before .
In 1989 , I was a fraud investigator hired to dig into the cause of the Exxon Valdez disaster .
Despite Exxon 's name on that boat , I found the party most to blame for the destruction was … British Petroleum .
That 's important to know , because the way BP caused devastation in Alaska is exactly the way BP is now sliming the entire Gulf Coast .
Deepwater Horizon in flames before sinking .
Photo provided by D.Becnel
Tankers run aground , wells blow out , pipes burst .
It should n't happen but it does .
And when it does , the name of the game is containment .
Both in Alaska , when the Exxon Valdez grounded , and in the Gulf over a week ago , when the Deepwater Horizon platform blew , it was British Petroleum that was charged with carrying out the Oil Spill Response Plans ( “ OSRP ” ) which the company itself drafted and filed with the government .
What 's so insane , when I look over that sickening slick moving toward the Delta , is that containing spilled oil is really quite simple and easy .
And from my investigation , BP has figured out a very low cost way to prepare for this task : BP lies .
BP prevaricates , BP fabricates and BP obfuscates .
That 's because responding to a spill may be easy and simple , but not at all cheap .
And BP is cheap .
Deadly cheap .
To contain a spill , the main thing you need is a lot of rubber , long skirts of it called “ boom . ”
Quickly surround a spill or leak or burst , then pump it out into skimmers or disperse it , sink it or burn it .
Simple .
But there 's one thing about the rubber skirts : you 've got to have lots of it at the ready , with crews on standby in helicopters and on containment barges ready to roll .
They have to be in place round the clock , all the time , just like a fire department ; even when all is operating A - OK .
Because rapid response is the key .
In Alaska , that was BP 's job , as principal owner of the pipeline consortium Alyeska .
It is , as well , BP 's job in the Gulf , as principal lessee of the deepwater oil concession .
Chugach Natives of Alaska clean Exxon Valdez oil off their beach , eight years after the spill .
© 1997 James Macalpine for Palast Fund .
Before the Exxon Valdez grounding , BP's Alyeska group claimed it had these full - time oil spill response crews .
Alyeska had hired Alaskan Natives , trained them to drop from helicopters into the freezing water and set boom in case of emergency .
Alyeska also certified in writing that a containment barge with equipment was within five hours sailing of any point in the Prince William Sound .
Alyeska also told the state and federal government it had plenty of boom and equipment cached on Bligh Island .
But it was all a lie .
On that March night in 1989 when the Exxon Valdez hit Bligh Reef in the Prince William Sound , the BP group had , in fact , not a lick of boom there .
And Alyeska had fired the Natives who had manned the full - time response teams , replacing them with phantom crews , lists of untrained employees with no idea how to control a spill .
And that containment barge at the ready was , in fact , laid up in a drydock in Cordova , locked under ice , 12 hours away .
As a result , the oil from the Exxon Valdez , which could have and should have been contained around the ship , spread out in a sludge tide that wrecked 1,200 miles of shoreline .
And here we go again .
Valdez goes Cajun .
BP's CEO Tony Hayward reportedly asked , “ What the hell did we do to deserve this ? ”
It 's what you did n't do , Mr. Hayward .
Where was BP 's containment barge and response crew ?
Why was the containment boom laid so damn late , too late and too little ?
Why is it that the US Navy is hauling in 12 miles of rubber boom and fielding seven skimmers , instead of BP ?
Last year , CEO Hayward boasted that , despite increased oil production in exotic deep waters , he had cut BP 's costs by an extra one billion dollars a year .
Now we know how he did it .
As chance would have it , I was meeting last week with Louisiana lawyer Daniel Becnel Jr. when word came in of the platform explosion .
Daniel represents oil workers on those platforms ; now he 'll represent their bereaved families .
The Coast Guard called him .
They had found the emergency evacuation capsule floating in the sea and were afraid to open it and disturb the cooked bodies .
I wonder if BP painted the capsule green , like they paint their gas stations .
Becnel , yesterday by phone from his office from the town of Reserve , LA , said the spill response crews were told they were n't needed because the company had already sealed the well .
Like everything else from BP mouthpieces , it was a lie .
In the end , this is bigger than BP and its policy of cheaping - out and skiving the rules .
This is about the anti-regulatory mania which has infected the American body politic .
While the “ tea baggers ” are simply its extreme expression , US politicians of all stripes love to attack “ the little bureaucrat with the fat rule book . ”
It began with Ronald Reagan and was promoted , most vociferously , by Bill Clinton and the head of Clinton 's de-regulation committee , one Al Gore .
Americans want government off our backs … that is , until a folding crib crushes the skull of our baby ; Toyota accelerators speed us to our death ; banks blow our savings on gambling sprees ; and crude oil smothers the Mississippi .
Then , suddenly , it's , “ where was hell was the Government ! ”
Why did n't the government do something to stop it ?
The answer is , because government took you at your word they should get out of the way of business , that business could be trusted to police itself .
It was only last month that BP , lobbying for new deepwater drilling , testified to Congress that additional equipment and inspection was n't needed .
You should meet some of these little bureaucrats with the fat rulebooks .
Like Dan Lawn , the inspector from the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation who warned and warned and warned , before the Exxon Valdez grounding , that BP and Alyeska were courting disaster in their arrogant disregard of the rulebook .
In 2006 , I printed his latest warnings about BP 's culture of negligence .
When the choice is between Dan Lawn 's rule book and a bag of tea , Dan 's my man .
***
This just in : Becnel tells me that one of the platform workers has informed him that the BP well was apparently deeper than the 18,000 feet depth reported .
BP failed to communicate that additional depth to Halliburton crews who therefore poured in too small a cement cap for the additional pressure caused by the extra depth .
So it blew .
Why did n't Halliburton check ?
“ Gross negligence on everyone 's part , ” says Becnel .
Negligence driven by penny - pinching bottom - line squeezing .
BP says its worker is lying .
Someone 's lying here : the man on the platform ” “ or the company that has practiced prevarication from Alaska to Louisiana ?

Samsung Sues Satirist , Claiming Criminal Defamation , Over Satirical Column Poking Fun At Samsung
from the thin - skinned ?
dept
One item read that Samsung had sent to all employees photographs of the son of the firm 's chairman with instructions for hanging the photo next to one of his father -- an allusion to North Korea 's Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il .
Breen also wrote that Samsung , " the rock upon which the Korean economy rests , sent traditional year - end cards offering best wishes for 2010 to the country 's politicians , prosecutors and journalists along with [ $ 50,000 ] gift certificates . "
Since 80 % of its revenues are from overseas , the firm is sensitive to any " minor accident or mistake " that could adversely affect its international reputation , the suit said .

Mel alerts us to this story of Korean electronics giant , Samsung , and its decision to sue a freelance writer who penned a satirical Christmas column that poked fun at Samsung 's well - known corruption and bribery issues .
The writer , Michael Breen , a UK native who 's been living in South Korea for a dozen years , wrote an English - language light satire ( in English ) for the Korea Times , where he joked about what sorts of presents public figures might send to others :
As satire goes , it seems pretty tame ( and , really , not that funny ) .
But , Samsung went ballistic , suing Breen , the Korea Times and its top editor for both civil andlibel charges .
Supposedly , after Korea Times ran a " clarification " that was written by Samsung itself , the paper and its editor were dropped from the lawsuit , but the suit against Breen remains .
And , since there are criminal charges , not only could he face hefty fines ( perhaps $ 1 million ) , he might also face jailtime .
For writing a satirical Christmas day column .
Tough audience .
Apparently , Korean defamation laws are n't just draconian , but they 're also downright ridiculous .
Truth ?
Not a defense .
Satire ?
Not a defense .
Basically , if anything you say harms someone 's reputation , you 've defamed them .
Even if it 's true or you 're just making a joke .
As the LA Times notes , Samsung says it needs to do this to protect its reputation worldwide : Uh , perhaps there 's just a cultural mistranslation , but the stories about Samsung 's corruption and bribery scandals are pretty widely known .
Nothing in that column was going to change that .
And , I would argue that , outside of South Korea , filing this ridiculous , petty and vindictive lawsuit over a joke is much more likely to harm Samsung 's reputation than the original column ( which was probably barely read outside of South Korea ) .
And , does n't something seem completelywhen Samsung seems more concerned that its reputation will be harmed more by satire about its well - known and well - documented bribery and corruption scandals than .
If the problem is Samsung 's " reputation " on the line , then perhaps the company should have thought of that before getting involved in massive bribery and corruption efforts ...
The article also notes how this is basically a sign of how dominant Samsung is in South Korea , and how it more or less has power over the newspapers , suggesting that no one is ever willing to criticize them -- and that it 's really using this lawsuit as a warning shot .
If true , that 's a huge shame for South Korea .
If a company is bullying people for just making jokes , just imagine what sort of shenanigans it goes through for people who areuncovering serious misdeeds at the company .

North Korea , the planet 's deepest information void , appears to be dabbling with electronic books ( e- books ) , a South Korean activist claimed Thursday .
It 's questionable how much an ecosystem for e-books would be relevant to readers living in perhaps the most censored country in the world .
But according to Free North Korea Radio's Kim Seong - min , North Koreans have choices beyond government propaganda books to read on their computers , including translations of Western classics such as Shakespeare 's plays , `` The Iliad , '' ``Don Quixote , '' `` Jane Eyre , '' `` Les Miserables ' ' and even ``Gone With The Wind . ''
``North Korea will have less complications surrounding copyright issues compared to the South , and with the government pushing the project directly , the country seems to have acquired a wealth of e-book content over a relatively short period of time , '' Kim told Yonhap News .
Kim revealed ``Electronic Library Mirae ( Future ) 2.0 , '' North Korea 's e-book computer program he claimed to have acquired from one of his foreign sources .
When run on Microsoft Windows , Mirae 2.0 opens a page that resembles a conventional library search site , and provides access to the electronic versions of about 1,500 books and 350,000 kinds of other documents .
The books include a wealth of non-fictions work , mostly on political theories and history , but also a variety of literature , song collections , and educational content such as dictionaries and books of facts .
The e-book collection of literature contains some contemporary North Korean work that has n't been previously introduced to the South , Kim said .
Users of Mirae 2.0 can search for e-books by title or content .
They can even use its voice recognition system by clicking the ``read '' tab at the top of the screen , with the computer responding with a recorded female voice that seems ``natural '' by North Korean standards , Kim said .
Electronic version of books have been around for a while , but the emergence of e-book readers such as Amazon 's Kindle now appear to be heralding an e-book industry explosion .
Apple recently unveiled its iPad tablet computer , which is expected to take the e-book reader competition to the next level .
South Korean electronics firms Samsung Electronics , LG Electronics and Trigem Computer are also expecting to reveal a slew of e-book readers and tablet computers this year .

Certain lawmakers in Missouri are on a mission to strip the adult - entertainment industry of nudity and alcohol .
Lawmakers passed a bill that , among other things , bans nudity and alcohol in adult - entertainment clubs , forbids them to stay open past midnight , and prohibits partially nude employees from touching customers .
Club owners and dancers tell the Wall Street Journal if the bill does become law , necessary jobs and revenue will be lost in a state that ca n’t afford to lose either .
The main supporter of the bill is Republican state Senator Matt Bartle , who has been reportedly trying to curb Missouri ’s adult - entertainment industry for years .
His previous efforts have been shot down in either state or federal court , and there is still a chance that this bill may not be made law .
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon , a Democrat , has yet to sign or veto the bill .
Critics warn that if the bill is made law it will face a swift challenge in court .
( via the Wall Street Journal )
A couple of months before the Oregon primary , a funny thing happened .
Ninjasmoker received a Facebook request from Oregon Republican candidate Chris Dudley .
It was very interesting to me that a self proclaimed conservative would try to network with a 100 % self proclaimed stoner , even on Facebook .
I chalked it up to the fact that Chris Dudley ’s campaign probably sent out requests to anyone and everyone that was based out of Oregon .
After all , Republicans are not exactly the most tech savvy crowd , and therefore probably just did as many requests as FB would let them .
Since the approval by Ninjasmoker , Ninjasmoker has ‘ liked ’ and commented on just about everything that Chris Dudley puts on his page .
It ’s really funny to see Chris Dudley put up some conservative rant , and to see a picture of Bob Marley smoking a joint , and a comment from Ninjasmoker saying ‘ Go Blazers ! ’
The irony is very thick too , considering the fact that Chris Dudley refuses to take a stance on marijuana policy in the State of Oregon .
Apparently marijuana consumers are good enough to receive his FB propaganda , but not good enough to deserve ANY attention during his campaign .
Every lunch break for the last two weeks I have called Chris Dudley ’s campaign headquarters .
My questions were the same every time ; ‘ What is Chris Dudley ’s stance on marijuana issues in Oregon ?
Specifically , how does he feel about legalization , the current state of the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program , and whether or not Oregon should allow medical marijuana dispensaries ? ’
The answer I received for the first week was always the same —
‘ We are not sure , we will get back to you . ’
Considering the fact that I call conservative campaigns almost every week day , and I NEVER get a call back , I did n’t sit around waiting for their answer .
Instead , I just called back every lunch break .
By the second week ( last Monday ) , their answer was updated to ‘ He has not issued an official stance on any of your questions . ’
Naturally , I asked ‘ when does he expect to make an announcement ? ’
At which point , the campaign reverted to their original answer of ‘ We are not sure , we will get back to you . ’
By Friday , the campaign was getting a little tired of my questions , which is funny , considering that I am an unaffiliated voter in Oregon , and they should be frothing at the mouth to get my vote .
Instead , their last response was ‘ If this is that same guy that has been calling all week , Chris Dudley has not issued an official position on marijuana , and probably wo n’t before the election , so quit calling . ’
It ’s nice to know that Chris Dudley cares so much about the marijuana voting bloc in Oregon … HEY CHRIS DUDLEY , BEFORE YOU PUSH US ASIDE , MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING :
DHS ’s current stats on the OMMP lists close to 50,000 participants ( patients and caretakers ) .
This of course does n’t include their friends and family , who are also sympathetic to marijuana related public policies .
According to Oregon NORML ’s stats found on Wiki , almost 1 out of every 10 Oregonians has consumed marijuana in the last 30 days — which does n’t include the countless others that wo n’t admit to it , but will surely let it be known at the ballot box .
Oregon is one of the most marijuana friendly states in the nation for a reason .
We were the first to decriminalize , the second to approve medical marijuana , and I would n’t be surprised if we were one of the first to legalize it outright .
Why Chris Dudley and his campaign staff do n’t realize this , is beyond me .
Oh wait , maybe it ’s because Chris Dudley is new to voting .
By his own admission , Chris Dudley voted less than half of the time in the last 13 elections .
While he was a professional athlete , he did n’t vote AT ALL .
Sounds like a well qualified candidate huh ?!
Luckily for Oregonians , there is an alternative .
Democratic candidate ( former Oregon Governor ) , John Kitzhaber has issued an official stance on marijuana policy in Oregon .
While he does not support outright legalization , he is , and always has been , a firm supporter of medical marijuana in Oregon .
He is in full support of medical marijuana dispensaries , and will fight on behalf of the OMMP , because after all , it was implemented while he was the previous Governor of Oregon ( 1998 ) .
It ’s not quite a full endorsement from me due to his unwillingness to support full legalization — but it ’s a hell of a lot better than Chris Dudley ’s response which was …oh that ’s right , NOTHING !
If you want to contact Chris Dudley ’s campaign , and tell them how you feel about his efforts to duck and dodge this important public policy issue , click this link .
I suggest you call them , every day .

When they do , they ’re usually rookies , who have low salaries and they are playing for a team that is n’t particularly doing well at the box office .
At a four - year , $ 15.1 million contract , Stephen Strasburg is not your typical low - priced rookie .
But that does n’t mean he can’t pay for himself pretty quickly .
In fact , if Strasburg is as good as advertised , the Nationals might be able to do more than $ 15 million in business on Strasburg alone by the end of next season .
What we do know is that we ’re projecting that Strasburg ’s debut game tonight in Washington is worth more than $ 1.5 million to the Nationals .
And that ’s likely more than any one player has ever been worth to an organization for a single game .
Let ’s show you our math on how we got there for tonight 's game .
The Nationals average 21,559 fans per home game , but on a weekday against the Pirates , they ’d average significantly less .
Jim Lackritz , associate dean of the college of business at San Diego State , where Strasburg played in college , believes Strasburg puts about 24,000 more fans in the seats tonight .
With an average ticket price of $ 30.63 , according to Team Marketing Report , that ’s $ 735,120 in additional revenue .
Add to that the 2,000 standing room seats that will likely be sold today at $ 10 and suite seats that they ’re selling in blocks of two and we ’re up to $ 780,000 .
But we ’re still not done on tickets .
Since the Nationals did n’t immediately announce Strasburg ’s debut , fans were forced to play a guessing game .
Some guessed it would be Monday and some guessed it would be Wednesday .
Lackritz says the team probably sold 10,000 tickets on each day just from people guessing .
That ’s an additional $ 612,000 for the team .
And wait , there ’s more .
Some fans , in order to get tickets for tonight ’s game , had to buy four - game ticket packages for the price of three .
With a two - ticket minimum and a low of $ 45 per seat , that ’s $ 270 .
If 500 fans did that , that ’s another $ 135,000 .
What ’s our total so far ?
$ 1,527,000 .
Then there are the concessions , which Lackritz conservatively estimates will be at least $ 7.50 a person , though likely more because this is an event of sorts and people will arrive to the ballpark early .
Remember , revenue from Strasburg ’s jerseys and shirts are shared among all teams .
The addition of 24,000 people is worth $ 180,000 more in concessions to the Nationals .
And let ’s not forget about parking .
Most of the 24,000 Strasburg fans , let ’s call them , will be taking the Metro .
But let ’s say that 2,000 people park in the Nationals lots .
On average , let ’s say the team nets $ 15 each from those people and that ’s another $ 30,000 .
The Strasburg pop now has us at $ 1,737,000 .
The Nats pay 10 percent gross back to the city in taxes and that gets us to $ 1.56 million for the team .
Strasburg wo n’t quite do what Dontrelle Willis was doing in 2003 , which was essentially earning his salary every game he pitched .
At a salary of $ 235,000 , the Marlins were drawing 20,000 more fans for his starts .
But if Strasburg continues to be the real deal , and the team starts him through the rest of the season , Lackritz says the team can bank on him drawing 15,000 additional fans per game versus games that he does not start .
That will equal more than $ 5 million in ticket revenue alone .
If ratings for Strasburg games give the local network , MASN a bump , the team could also cash in on additional ad revenue .

Even after a decade of development , no soft synth to date has been a true replacement for real analog gear .
Sure , some plug-ins have come close — notably FXpansion 's impressive DCAM suite of analog emulations — but the fact remains , if you wantsound you need the real thing .
Lately , there 's been a bit of a renaissance for analog hardware synths .
A few years back , Dave Smith — the inventor of the Prophet 5 and , well , MIDI itself — unleashed a brand new Prophet for the 21st century , then followed it up with a slew of truly affordable successors .
Tom Oberheim recently jumped into the fray with a flawless recreation of his legendary SEM unit .
Modular behemoth , Doepfer , recently released a baby modular for entry - level users .
Heck , even boutique developers like Bleep Labs have produced analog toys for less than 200 euro .
To help producers get a better idea of the current state of the industry , we 've created a guide to some of the analog synths on the market today under 1000 euro .
In our opinion , these are the best and the brightest at the moment .
But if the trend keeps up , there will surely be more to come .
Hot on the heels of Dave Smith 's reintroduction of the legendary Prophet , DSI released the monophonic Mopho .
Sporting a slightly different voice architecture than the Prophet , the Mopho's all - analog signal path features two oscillators , a resonant lowpass filter that can function in either 12 dB or 24 dB per octave mode , four LFOs , three envelopes , four 16 - step sequencers , tons of modulation routing optionsthe ability to process external audio signals through its filter and amplifier sections , making the Mopho both a synth and a solid effects unit .
The sound is a bit more aggressive than the Prophet , since the audio input allows the oscillators to be overdriven with a touch of feedback .
Adding low - end emphasis are two sub-oscillators — one for each of the primary oscillators — that track their pitches one octave lower .
The original Mopho module comes in a package about the size of a hardcover novel and is controlled via standard MIDI in / out connections .
But this year 's NAMM show heralded the arrival of the Mopho Keyboard edition , which adds a two - and - a - half octave keyboard and a bunch of knobs for real - time tweakage .
If the Mopho 's synthesis engine piques your interest , then you 'll definitely want to get up to speed on DSI 's recently introduced Tetra .
Essentially four Mophos in an identically sized package , the Tetra packs a ton of synthesis power for its street price .
The Tetra 's four voices can also be configured multi-timbrally .
That is , each of the voices can have its own unique settings so it reallylike having four Mophos going at once .
Better still , the Tetra also includes a direct USB port for much faster response times than the ancient MIDI standard .
Granted , this USB port is strictly for sending note and controller information — no audio amenities here — so you 'll still need a decent audio interface to capture the beauty of this synth .
Another audio - oriented distinction is the fact that the Tetra does n't include the Mopho 's external audio input , so you can't feed any other signals into its synthesis engine .
This is n't a huge deal when you consider that this box is basically a four - voice Prophet 08 with sub-oscillators and a faster interface , minus the P08's luxurious array of knobs .
As a result , if you 're looking for a real analog polysynth for under a grand , the Tetra is the only one worth investigating .
Germany 's Doepfer is one of the biggest names in modular synthesis hardware , so last year 's introduction of their entry - level baby modular , the Dark Energy , has created quite a stir .
Consisting of a single VCO , 24db / oct lowpass VCF , ADSR envelope and two LFOs that extend well into the audio range , the Dark Energy 's simplicity belies its power .
The oscillator can blend square waves with either triangle or sawtooth with a twist of a knob and can also be used to modulate the filter cutoff ala FM synthesis .
The envelopes can be switched into a super - fast mode for really tight transients .
Using the LFOs in the audio range can create anything from dirty sideband mayhem to extreme talkbox effects .
What 's more , the Dark Energy can translate its USB control directly into control voltages for sequencing vintage gear like the Roland SH - 101 .
So what 's the catch ?
Well , because the Dark Energy is 100 % analog with no digital encoding on the knobs , there 's no way to store presets .
For some users , this could be a critical omission .
On the other hand , the lack of digitization means that the knobs are incredibly sensitive — moving them even slightly can radically change a sound , just like classic gear from the ' 70s and ' 80s .
To be absolutely candid here , I 've been using the Dark Energy for four months now and it has become my go - to synth .
Warm , big bass ?
No problem .
Crazy modulation weirdness ?
Check .
In - your - face percussive patches ?
Done and done .
This synth covers a ton of ground in a tiny package that sits neatly next to my laptop at all times .
Truly the perfect beginner 's synth if you can live without the ability to store your own patches .
After a year of buzz , Tom Oberheim 's long - awaited SEM reissue has finally hit the stores — and it was well worth the wait .
In Oberheim 's words , the reissue is 98 % identical circuit - wise , with a few improvements thrown in for good measure .
The original SEM was a mainstay for ' 70s artists , with a big following in the progressive rock world .
The architecture featured two oscillators , triangle - wave LFO , amp envelope , filter envelope and one of the coolest analog filter implementations on the planet .
Unlike most classic analog synths , the SEM included something called a state - variable filter that can operate in lowpass , highpass or notch modes in a continuously variable manner — as well as a switchable bandpass mode .
On most synths , multimode filtering operation works via a switch .
That is , each mode is a discrete option .
Here , you can smoothly morph between modes , creating sweeps that are near impossible to achieve via any other technology .
While some users will want the MIDI version — so they can sequence the device via a standard MIDI interface — diehard synthesists will likely opt for the control voltage ( CV ) version , which includes an integrated patch panel for modular - style re-routing .
The caveat with that version is that you 'll need a CV interface of some sort , like say , the Doepfer Dark Energy — which is an outstanding solution , in my opinion .
The two units combined should serve as a badass baby modular rig with a sound that transcends either device on its own .
There 's been quite a buzz surrounding the MFB Kraftzwerg 's modular - style design and extensive feature set .
And for good reason .
The desktop wedge houses three VCOs that can deliver hard sync effects , a 24dB / oct lowpass VCF , noise generator , ring modulation , two LFOs and two envelopes .
The modular capabilities on the Kraftzwerg are a definite notch up from the Dark Energy , with voltage control options for all of the essentials and then some .
With some clever oscillator patching , it should be possible to create dirty , metallic FM and ringmod effects .
Throw in some switchable envelope curves and CV in and out on the LFO rates and there are a lot of sonic options here that would be impossible to nail on virtual analog hardware or software .
As with the Dark Energy , though , you can't store presets for future recall so , again , your mileage may vary .
Based on the online audio demo examples and the extensive feature spec , the Kraftzwerg 's price tag is a rather reasonable point of entry for a unit of this scope .
Definitely worth further investigation for sound designers looking for something other than " me-too " synth patches .
If experimental sonics are your cuppa tea and the recession has tightened your purse strings to the point of snapping , you should take a closer look at Bleep Labs ' Thingamagoop 2 .
It may simply look like a little robot , but the sounds that come out of this beastie are quite monstrous indeed .
The robot eye is actually a photocell that controls pitch .
The LEDacle " antenna " houses a flexible LED that can be used to drive the photocell .
Kind of like a 21st century Theremin .
The voice circuitry consists of an analog VCO that can be switched into one of five continuously variable modes courtesy of its programmable Arduino chip : sample & hold , arpeggio 1 , arpeggio 2 , white noise and audio rate digital data ( kind of like bit- crushing ) .
An LFO delivers either amplitude modulation , using a square wave or triangle wave based pulse - width modulation for really thick trance lead effects .
The LFO can also be pushed into the audio range for ring mod type effects that go far beyond anything else in this price range .
Rounding out the synth are control voltage in and out connectors for attaching the Thingamagoop to vintage gear .
While the Thingamagoop 's oscillator does n't calibrate to the one - volt - per - octave standard , it 's still quite handy for creating pitched effects in either direction that would be hard to achieve otherwise .

Advice for Commenters
Instead of " You forgot ... " and expressions of dismay that my tastes , priorities , and thoughts do not mirror yours exactly , why do n't you try a variation of " One of my favorite / least favorite ... " in your comment ?
Recent research at Harvard Business School began with the premise that as a state 's congressional delegation grew in stature and power in Washington , D.C. , local businesses would benefit from the increased federal spending sure to come their way .
It turned out quite the opposite .
In fact , professors Lauren Cohen , Joshua Coval , and Christopher Malloy discovered to their surprise that companies experienced lower sales and retrenched by cutting payroll , R&D , and other expenses .
Indeed , in the years that followed a congressman 's ascendancy to the chairmanship of a powerful committee , the average firm in his state cut back capital expenditures by roughly 15 percent , according to their working paper , " Do Powerful Politicians Cause Corporate Downsizing ? "
" It was an enormous surprise , at least to us , to learn that the average firm in the chairman 's state did not benefit at all from the unanticipated increase in spending , " Coval reports .
Over a 40 - year period , the study looked at increases in local earmarks and other federal spending that flowed to states after the senator or representative rose to the chairmanship of a powerful congressional committee .
We asked Coval about the relationship between the government and the private sector , and how policymakers should critically evaluate federal stimulus plans to help local companies .
Sean Silverthorne : First , a little bit about your empirical approach to the research .
Why did you decide to study changes in congressional committee chairmanships ?
Joshua Coval :
Our original goal was to investigate how politically connected firms benefit from increases in the power of their representatives .
A benefit in focusing on changes in committee chairmanships is that their timing is largely exogenous from the perspective of the ascending chairman and his constituents .
That is , a change in chairmanship can only occur if the incumbent retires or is voted out -- both of which are entirely independent of what is currently happening in the ascending chairman 's state .
Q : One of your findings was that the chairs of powerful congressional committees truly bring home the bacon to their states in the forms of earmark spending .
Can you give a sense of how large this effect is ?
A : Sure .
The average state experiences a 40 to 50 percent increase in earmark spending if its senator becomes chair of one of the top - three committees .
In the House , the average is around 20 percent .
For broader measures of spending , such as discretionary state - level federal transfers , the increase from being represented by a powerful senator is around 10 percent .
Q : Perhaps the most intriguing finding , at least for me , was the degree and consistency to which federal spending at the state level seemed to be connected with a decrease in corporate spending and employment .
Did you suspect this was the case when you started the study ?
A : We began by examining how the average firm in a chairman 's state was impacted by his ascension .
The idea was that this would provide a lower bound on the benefits from being politically connected .
It was an enormous surprise , at least to us , to learn that the average firm in the chairman 's state did not benefit at all from the increase in spending .
Indeed , the firms significantly cut physical and R&D spending , reduce employment , and experience lower sales .
The results show up throughout the past 40 years , in large and small states , in large and small firms , and are most pronounced in geographically concentrated firms and within the industries that are the target of the spending .
Q : Although you did n't intend to answer this question with the research , what does your team suspect are some of the causes that could explain why companies retrench when federal dollars come into their neighborhoods ?
A : Some of the dollars directly supplant private - sector activity — they literally undertake projects the private sector was planning to do on its own .
The Tennessee Valley Authority of 1933 is perhaps the most famous example of this .
Other dollars appear to indirectly crowd out private firms by hiring away employees and the like .
For instance , our effects are strongest when unemployment is low and capacity utilization is high .
But we suspect that a third and potentially quite strong effect is the uncertainty that is created by government involvement .
Q : These findings present something of a dilemma for public policymakers who believe that federal spending can stimulate private economic development .
How would you suggest they approach the problem that federal dollars may actually cause private - sector retrenchment ?
A : Our findings suggest that they should revisit their belief that federal spending can stimulate private economic development .
It is important to note that our research ignores all costs associated with paying for the spending such as higher taxes or increased borrowing .
From the perspective of the target state , the funds are essentially free , but clearly at the national level someone has to pay for stimulus spending .
And in the absence of a positive private - sector response , it seems even more difficult to justify federal spending than otherwise .
Q : What do you think your research has brought to the literature ?
A : The literature has had difficulty empirically identifying the effect of government spending on the private sector .
Because spending both influences and is influenced by developments in the private sector , disentangling the two has proven challenging .
We think our approach offers a rare opportunity to identify the private - sector response to government spending increases that are essentially random .
Q : What are you working on next ?
A : Our next project will be to ask a similar question of the private sector :
Does private - sector economic activity create or crowd out additional private - sector opportunities ?
Put differently , did Bill Gates 's decision to relocate Microsoft to the Seattle area in 1979 increase the likelihood that Amazon.com , Starbucks , and Costco would emerge from there a decade or so later ?
If so , this has strong implications for policymakers interested in , say , improving Detroit 's economic prospects .
Drone Wars
It ’s been a bad week for drones .
On Friday , U.N. official Philip Alston announced he would be asking the United States to move the controversial , Central Intelligence Agency - run program under the aegis of the military , and international law .
He joins a growing chorus of people opposed to the use of drone airstrikes to target militants ensconced in Pakistan ’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) , on legal , humanitarian , and operational grounds .
( Alston is at least more informed than most drone foes in that he recognizes that the drone strikes in Pakistan ’s FATA are CIA - led covert operations rather than " military strikes . " )
The anti-drone argument goes like this :
Because drone attacks kill innocent civilians and violate Pakistan ’s sovereignty , they are deeply and universally despised by Pakistanis , and contribute to deepening anti-U.S. sentiment in the country — enmity that could boost terrorist organizations ’ recruitment and eventually force Pakistan ’s military and civilian leaders to abandon their cooperation with the United States .
During his testimony before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee in May 2009 , David Kilcullen , a former counterinsurgency advisor to Centcom commander Gen. David Petraeus , said it was time for the United States to " call off the drones . "
Later that month , Kilcullen and Andrew M. Exum , who served as an Army Ranger in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2002 to 2004 , published a provocative editorial in the New York Times , titled " Death From Above : Outrage from Below , " in which they estimated that over the " past three years " drones had killed just 14 " terrorist leaders " at the price of some 700 civilian lives .
" This is 50 civilians for every militant killed , " they wrote , " a hit rate of 2 percent . "
Their conclusion ?
Drone strikes produce more terrorists than they eliminate - an assertion that has become an article of faith among drone - strike opponents .
It would be a damning argument — if the data were n’t simply bogus .
The only publicly available civilian casualty figures for drone strikes in Pakistan come from their targets : the Pakistani Taliban , which report the alleged numbers to the Pakistani press , which dutifully publishes the fiction .
No one has independently verified the Taliban ’s reports — journalists cannot travel to FATA to confirm the deaths , and the CIA will not even acknowledge the drone program exists , much less discuss its results .
But high - level Pakistani officials have conceded to me that very few civilians have been killed by drones and their innocence is often debatable .
U.S. officials who are knowledgeable of the program report similar findings .
In fact , since January 1 there has not been one confirmed civilian casualty from drone strikes in FATA .
Not only do drone opponents rely upon these fictitious reports of civilian casualties , they also tend to conflate drone strikes in Pakistan with air strikes in Afghanistan , lumping the two related but very different battlefields together as one contiguous theater .
They also conflate different kinds of air strikes within Afghanistan .
These distinctions matter , a lot .
In Afghanistan , it is an ignominious truth that hundreds of civilians are killed in NATO airstrikes every year .
But most of the civilian casualties in Afghanistan have not stemmed from pre-planned , intelligence - led attacks ; rather , civilians are most likely to die when troops come into contact with the enemy and subsequently request air support .
This is because when it comes to air strikes , NATO forces in Afghanistan have a limited range of air assets at their disposal .
As a result , when troops come into contact with insurgents and call for air support , they get the ordinance that is available , not the firepower that would be best suited to their needs .
Sometimes large bombs are dropped when smaller ones would have been better , and the risk of civilian casualties increases accordingly .
By contrast , drone airstrikes are pre-planned , intelligence - led operations , and are usually accomplished with minimal civilian deaths — as even Human Rights Watch acknowledges .
They are the product of meticulous planning among lawyers , intelligence officers , and others who scrupulously and independently confirm information about potential enemies , working to establish a rigorous " pattern of life " to minimize the deaths of innocents .
Others in the Air Force , using a classified algorithm , estimate the potential for civilian casualties based upon a variety of local data inputs .
While one should not be blasé about the loss of any civilian life , it is important to note that the different kinds of air operations are not created equal .
How does the situation in the air over Afghanistan compare to that in Pakistan ?
The short answer is that we do n’t know — drone strikes in Pakistan are conducted under the auspices of the CIA and occasionally the Joint Special Operations Command , and are covert operations that the United States government does not even acknowledge take place .
( If you ’ve seen footage of civilian casualties at all , they ’re in Afghanistan , not Pakistan . )
But if we know little about the drone strikes , we know enough about the alternative means of eliminating terrorists in FATA to know that they ’re probably worse .
Pakistan has no police in FATA to arrest them .
The Pakistan army is now in its 13th month of sustained combat in the region , an effort that has flattened communities and displaced millions but done little to chip away at the insurgents ’ strength .
Drone strikes may not be perfect , but they ’re likely the most humane option available .
Of course , the actual impact of the drone strikes is only part of the equation — the perception of them in Pakistan matters enormously as well .
But here , too , the conventional wisdom — that Pakistanis hate the drone strikes , and consider them an affront to their national sovereignty — is not entirely correct .
Pakistan ’s government makes a big show of opposing the strikes , but it ’s not much more than political theater .
In fact , the United States secured permission to launch strikes from then President Pervez Musharraf in 2006 — Musharraf was adamant at the time that the strikes be confined to the FATA and they have been .
Musharraf also warned U.S. President George W. Bush beforehand that Pakistani military and civilian officials alike would protest the strikes , out of domestic political necessity — it was nothing personal .
Presidents Asif Ali Zardari and Barack Obama have inherited this combination of operating agreements and kabuki politics .
What about the Pakistanis in the regions where the strikes are occurring ?
The truth is , we do n’t really know what they think .
Collecting reliable and rigorous opinion data in FATA is difficult — the lack of a current census , the influx of Afghan refugees and emigration of FATA natives fleeing the unstable region makes it nearly impossible for even the best polling firms in Pakistan to draw a scientifically defensible sample of FATA residents .
As a result , all we have is a smattering of anecdotal accounts , which vary depending upon who is asked , and where , when , and how they are interviewed .
On one hand are those who rubbish the Pakistani media claims of civilian casualties and assert that the drones effectively kill militants but not civilians .
On the other are outraged residents who live in fear of the constant buzzing of the drones circling above .
It ’s unreasonable to extrapolate any kind of majority opinion from either one of them .
What is clear enough , however , is that the drone strikes , however unpopular they may be , are likely to be more popular than the realistic alternatives : the Taliban ’s violence or the Pakistani army ’s operations , which have displaced millions .
Mosharraf Zaidi , a Pakistani journalist and commentator , vividly captured the complex reality in his May 11 piece in The News : " The relative popularity of drones is almost as emphatic as their absolute unpopularity .
Pakistani military operations have a reputation in the region now , for being so brutal , that entire parts of towns are destroyed .
Drones that destroy one or two homes at a time , obviously represent less damage , and therefore , an option that is preferable to the military ’s artillery campaigns . "
That ’s why , if the United States does pull its drones out of FATA , Pakistanis will have two options .
Either the government simply gives up the fight , or the Pakistani military — which is already stretched thin — may have to pick up where the Americans leave off .
After the Pakistani army ’s arduous battle to wrest control of the Swat Valley back from the Taliban beginning in earnest in 2009 , Musharraf argued that the United States should give Pakistan drones to pull off future strikes without the massive footprint of a ground force operation .
After subsequent requests were rebuffed , Pakistan first sought to buy drones from Italy , but now plans to manufacture them locally .
Nevertheless , American and Pakistani citizens do need to weigh the relative costs and benefits of drone attacks .
Doing this requires some concessions from the U.S. government .
First , it should abandon the absurd claim that it does not conduct drone strikes — since Google Earth images of U.S. drones at the Shamshi airbase in Baluchistan were published in 2009 , the charade hardly seems worth the effort .
Second , it should provide evidence of what exactly the drone attacks have produced so far : who has been killed , and how important those people were to the enemy ’s capabilities .
Drone critics can surely question and even reject the process by which individuals are declared " fair targets " and the legality of these extrajudicial killings .
But such a debate can only happen when the U.S. government clarifies how targets are selected and vetted .
Until the U.S. government owns these attacks and presents information about their outcomes , at best unrealiable and at worst fabricated civilian casualties figures will dominate the drone debate .
And that would be the real tragedy — it could force policymakers in the United States and Pakistan to discard the least bad tool at their disposal .
( CNN ) -- Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed a bill Friday that makes changes to a controversial new state immigration law , saying the changes should ease concerns about racial profiling .
" These changes specifically answer legal questions raised by some who expressed fears that the original law would somehow allow or lead to racial profiling , " Brewer said in a statement after the signing .
" These new amendments make it crystal clear and undeniable that racial profiling is illegal and will not be tolerated in Arizona . "
But opponents challenged that assertion in the run-up to Brewer 's signing of the changes into law on Friday .
" It does n't deter anything , " said Dan Pochoda , legal director of the Arizona ACLU .
" It 's not a serious hurdle . "
Pochoda said that law enforcement officers -- under strong pressure to find and remove illegal immigrants -- could still identify people by race and then look for a minor infraction as an excuse to investigate them .
He noted that the authors of the immigration law , passed April 23 , also backed the changes to it .
The new Arizona law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect they are in the United States illegally .
Under the law , police would be able to detain an individual based merely on the suspicion that he or she entered the country illegally .
But one of the changes -- which had been adopted by state lawmakers Thursday night -- says police could stop suspected illegal immigrants only while enforcing some other law or ordinance .
An officer could only ask about an immigrant 's legal status , for example , while investigating that person for speeding , loitering or some other offense .
The new law also makes it a state crime to live in or travel through Arizona illegally .
And it targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them .
University of Arizona law professor Gabriel Chin told CNN that the changes to the bill are significant , insofar as they help remove a " huge disincentive for victims and witnesses to cooperate with the police . "
Under the original version of the law , he said , police officers would have been obligated to arrest a suspected illegal immigrant who approached them after being victimized .
That would not be the case under the revised law .
Arizona 's law originally said that the attorney general or a county attorney cannot investigate complaints based " solely " on factors such as a person 's race , color or national origin .
The changes enacted Friday remove the word " solely " to emphasize that prosecutors must have some reason other than an individual 's race or national origin to investigate .
But Chin dismissed the significance of that change .
Both the federal and state constitutions make it clear that you can " never stop someone exclusively on account of race , " he said .
Racial profiling would still occur , he said .
" It 's always ' race plus ' in these situations .
...
The law still allows the consideration of race as a factor . "
Defenders of the law -- angry over the charges of racism permeating the debate -- say it is needed because the federal government has failed to enforce border security with Mexico , allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to move into in the state .
" Illegal is illegal , " Arizona state Sen .
Russell Pearce , the controversial statute 's primary sponsor , told CNN Friday .
" Illegal 's not a race , it 's a crime .
...
And in Arizona , we 're going to enforce " the law .
Pearce accused President Barack Obama , a critic of the measure , of " aiding and abetting criminal activity , inciting criminal activity , inciting violence , and [ violating his ] oath of office to secure this border , enforce these laws and defend the American people . "
Some analysts said that Arizona was compelled to adopt the amendments in reaction to a growing movement among civil rights activists and others to launch an economic boycott of the state .
On Friday , two San Francisco , California , officials wrote a three - page letter to Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig to ask that the 2011 All - Star Game be moved from Phoenix , Arizona , if the law is not repealed .
The overall law has drawn sharp scrutiny from the Justice Department , at least two lawsuits and condemnation from the Mexican government and other Latin American nations .
Several prominent entertainers also have spoken out against the measure .
An April 27 - 28 nationwide Gallup poll , however , found that 51 percent of Americans favor the Arizona law , while only 39 percent oppose it .
The changes to the law are not sufficient and will do little to positively affect daily law enforcement in Arizona , argued Clarissa Martinez De Castro of the National Council of La Raza , a major Latino civil rights organization .
" Even right now , without this law , we know that the practice on the streets is different , " she told CNN .
" The [ current ] practice does n't reflect what the law is .
And if the governor is saying that racial profiling is not going to be tolerated , why has it been tolerated so far ? "
About 500,000 unauthorized immigrants were believed to live in Arizona in 2008 , and 11.9 million nationwide , up from 3.5 million nationwide in 1990 , according to a Pew Hispanic Center report published in 2009 .
Protests against the Arizona law are scheduled Saturday in at least 21 states , the District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces .
In all , protests are planned for 47 cities .
The changes to the law will take effect along with the rest of the statute in 90 days .
" It goes back to the federal government , " Martinez told CNN .
" If they abdicate their responsibility , they leave state and local governments to grapple with this issue , and the only thing that happens is that we create greater chaos .
...
This is just not the way forward . "

Al - Jazeera has been having a hard time since the start of the 2010 FIFA World Cup .
The Qatari network , which holds the rights to broadcast the soccer matches , has been in intense talks in recent weeks with broadcasting authorities in the Arab world , and has sold pay - per- view subscriptions to the international event 's games .
Al - Jazeera 's insistence on high prices has made the otherwise popular network the subject of criticism in the Arab world , and it will likely be facing massive lawsuits filed by disappointed viewers .
This has also lead to tensions between the Qatari government , which owns the network , and other Arab states .
The network 's troubles began on the first day of the World Cup , when viewers were unable to watch the opening match between South Africa and Mexico .
The network claimed that a " third party " disrupted the broadcast and even convinced FIFA to investigate the matter .
Qatari elements in private blamed the disruptions on the Egyptian Nilesat – the leading satellite provider in the Arab world .
Meanwhile , disruptions have occurred in almost every match since Friday .
Clients who have paid between $ 80 to $ 160 for a subscription to watch the matches have complained of broadcasts freezing during games and several other hitches .
The Qatari network charged coffee shops and restaurants interested in broadcasting the matches between $ 800 and $ 1,400 , and many in the Arab Gulf countries are considering suing .
Al - Jazeera 's vow to compensate the disappointed clients and business did not manage to calm the storm .
Pointing fingers at Israel
The network has been placing the blame on cable companies and satellite providers throughout the Arab world , but now , it is also point the finger at Israel .
Raed Abed , head of the Al - Jazeera 's broadcasting department , told Emarat Alyoum , " I do not rule out Israeli involvement in the disruptions . "
Meanwhile , the al - Quds al - Arabi newspaper said Egyptian parliament members have adopted Al - Jazeera 's claims .
Egyptian MP
Mohsin Radi was quoted as saying that Israel has a clear interest in disrupting the broadcasts to increase inter-Arab tensions .
Al - Jazeera has invested millions of dollars in constructing studios and hiring leading commentators , but bloggers around the Arab world say the network failed on a technical level .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - A senior Iranian cleric has decreed dogs are “ unclean ” and should not be kept as pets -- a move aimed at discouraging Western - style dog ownership in the Islamic state , a newspaper reported on Saturday .
Dogs are considered “ unclean ” under Islamic tradition but , while relatively rare in Iran , some people do keep them as pets .
By issuing a fatwa -- a religious ruling -- Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi has sent a clear message that this trend must stop .
“ Friendship with dogs is a blind imitation of the West , ” he was quoted as saying in Javan daily .
“ There are lots of people in the West who love their dogs more than their wives and children . ”
Guard dogs and sheep dogs are considered acceptable under Islamic law but Iranians who carry dogs in their cars or take them to public parks can be stopped by police and fined .
The Koran does not explicitly prohibit contact with dogs , Shirazi said , but Islamic tradition showed it to be so .
“ We have lots of narrations in Islam that say dogs are unclean . ”
The interpretation of religious rules on personal conduct is a constant source of debate and potential conflict in Iran which has been an Islamic republic since a revolution ousted the Western - backed Shah in 1979 .
In a television interview last week , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad weighed in on the issue of the Islamic dress code , saying women who fail to cover their hair completely should not be harassed by the police .
Morality police are conducting their annual crackdown and women who reveal strands of hair are liable to be stopped in the streets for failing to respect the dress code , or “ hijab . ”
Ahmadinejad ’s surprisingly liberal view was condemned by fellow hard - liner politicians and senior clerics “ I wish he had not said those words about the hijab , ” Grand Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati told the faithful during the week ’s Friday prayers , in a rare criticism of the president .
“ We are grappling with many problems including economic and political ones but the issues of morality and ethical security are among the important issues that cannot be ignored , ” he said .
Tehran University has set up a thinktank “ to investigate the problems related to hijab , ” the representative of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to the university announced on Monday .
Mark and Roberta Maxwell had been zapped by fees for overdrawing funds and using the wrong ATM , and they felt their bank , the former Washington Mutual , had lost its personal touch since a takeover by Chase .
Adding insult to injury , Roberta said , they had to pay a special fee for depositing more than $ 5,000 in cash to their small - business account in a single month — something they might do again because Mark , a saxophone player , earns much of his living selling his smooth - jazz CDs at street fairs .
“ I thought banks were supposed to want you to put more money in them , ” Roberta said .
So the Maxwells moved their account last year to the Studio City office of the Musicians ’ Interguild Credit Union , joining what could be the vanguard of angry consumers abandoning major banks in favor of smaller ones .

It ’s an appealing notion in an era of outrage over the huge bailouts and high fees of the big banks .
Consumers are much more willing to switch banks than they were before the financial crisis , according to a recent survey by market research firm J.D. Power & Associates .
Two - thirds of the big - bank customers surveyed said they would consider jumping to a smaller institution .
It ’s too soon to tell whether switch - your - bank campaigns , including the Move Your Money crusade undertaken by website entrepreneur Arianna Huffington , have prompted a significant number of bank customers to trade down .
The big banks are n’t exactly giving up on you .
In California , in fact , they ’re battling one another for market share .
And , to be fair , it ’s hard to beat them for convenience , cutting - edge technology , pervasive automated teller machines that are free to customers , and a variety of options for deposits and other products .
For example , the Maxwells could have increased the amount of cash they were allowed to deposit each month without incurring a fee to $ 10,000 or even $ 25,000 — if they had sat down with a Chase small - business specialist and discussed alternative types of deposit accounts , said Gary Kishner , a spokesman for Chase , a unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co .

At Bank of America , the country ’s largest bank , first - year Chief Executive Brian T. Moynihan is spearheading an effort to encourage employees to put customers ’ needs first instead of simply maximizing revenue , a strategy that sounds much like marketing pitches for smaller banks and credit unions .
There are pitfalls as well as potential benefits in switching .
If you ’re thinking about it , here are some issues and options to consider .
Credit unions
If you ’re a regular consumer seeking an alternative to the big banks , a credit union might be your best bet .

“ Consumer banking is what credit unions do , ” said Edward J. Carpenter , an Irvine investment banker who has advised hundreds of start - up banks .
Credit unions do n’t actually have customers ; they have members .
To join one , you have to be in a group the credit union serves .
But it ’s usually easy to find credit unions you can join .
One may serve residents of the area you live in .
Another may cater to employees at your workplace .
To search for one , go to the National Credit Union Administration website .
Services vary greatly , but many credit unions offer a wide range of deposit options , auto and home loans , credit cards , and even loans for boats and RVs .
Some provide small - business banking and investment advisory services .
Through alliances , credit union members can access ATM networks of as many as 25,000 machines free of charge .
Because they pay no taxes and are organized to benefit members , not shareholders , credit unions generally are able to pay higher interest rates on deposits than banks — and charge lower rates on credit cards and auto loans .
Mortgage rates tend to be about the same .

For many people who switch to credit unions , fees may be the biggest difference they notice .
A study last year by economists at UC Davis and Dartmouth College found that fees for overdrafts at credit unions averaged $ 23 , compared with $ 33 at banks .
The typical credit union charge for using an out - of - network ATM was $ 1.50 ; at banks it was $ 2.50 .
Although they tend to take on much less risk than the megabanks do , credit unions , like all consumer lenders , have suffered loan losses in recent years , some more than others .
At the end of 2009 , 64 California credit unions had the equivalent of a D or F on their confidential regulatory report cards , five times the number at the end of 2006 , said John J. McKechnie III , spokesman for National Credit Union Administration , which regulates federally insured credit unions .

Community banks

If you ’re considering a community bank , make sure it ’s a good fit for you by talking with officials at the bank and maybe even some customers .
The reason : Community banks generally are set up to accommodate the needs of small businesses , not the average person with a small checking and savings account .
“ Consumer accounts are very hard to deal with from a regulatory standpoint , and you need a bunch of them to do it efficiently , ” said Anaheim - based bank consultant Gary S. Findley .
Banks with less than $ 500 million in assets generally are n’t in a position to do much for consumers , he said .
What ’s more , Findley said , small banks are devoting so much attention to raising fresh capital and working out troubled real estate loans that they might not be as free as they ’d like to make new loans .
In the middle

A notch up the food chain are larger regional banks with the wherewithal to do consumer business if they choose .
But many of them also are still digging their way out from losses , or do n’t aim their services at the mass market , or both .
The “ find a bank or credit union ” button atop the Move Your Money website launched by Huffington can give potential switchers a list of local , financially sound smaller banks .
In Southern California , the list includes City National Bank , an L.A. - based lender with $ 20 billion in assets , and Pasadena ’s OneWest Bank , a $ 28 - billion thrift that emerged from the wreckage of failed IndyMac Bank .
However , City National , once known as Beverly Hills ’ “ bank to the stars , ” does n’t provide many services that everyday consumers might want .
Auto loans ?
No way , unless as a favor to a longtime client who , say , collects antique cars .
And the bank ’s $ 3.5 - billion mortgage portfolio holds loans custom - tailored to wealthy borrowers with an average of 43 % equity in their homes .
As a savings and loan , OneWest is friendlier to the average consumer , offering home loans , savings accounts , certificates of deposit and checking accounts — but no credit cards or auto loans .

Big but not so big
Other possibilities are the large but not gigantic banks that received the highest ratings in California in the J.D.
Power survey : Bank of the West , with $ 60 billion in assets , and Union Bank , with $ 85 billion .
Both offer consumer as well as business services and have giant parent companies based overseas : France ’s BNP Paribas owns Bank of the West , while Japan ’s Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi UFJ owns Union Bank .
Strong financial support from Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi , including a $ 2 - billion capital infusion last September , has made it easier for Union Bank to weather the financial crisis without sacrificing customer service , said Tim Wennes , Union Bank ’s chief retail banking officer .

Bank of the West is “ small enough that you can take a community bank approach ” while offering a full range of products , said Andy Harmening , a senior executive vice president .
Check ‘em out
Because the financial health of credit unions and small banks and thrifts can vary significantly , it ’s a good idea to check them out online .
You can view independent soundness ratings free at Bankrate.com or from Bauer Financial Inc .
In addition , credit unions ’ quarterly reports to regulators are available online .
Similar data from banks and thrifts are available from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .

Regardless of how big or how highly rated your financial institution is , make sure you stay under the federal deposit insurance coverage limit of $ 250,000 per customer .
The bottom line
For many people , a bigger bank may be better .
But if you can find the right one for you , a small institution may simply try harder to make you happy .
Even in online banking , which is dominated by large banks , a survey this year awarded the highest satisfaction ratings to credit unions , and smaller banks outshined the five biggest institutions .
“ While the big companies try to outdo each other with lots of flashy bells and whistles , the small banks have had to keep their focus on satisfying the customer because that ’s the only way they can compete , ” said Larry Freed , president of research firm ForeSee Results , which conducted the survey for Forbes.com .
“ And as the data shows , it ’s paid off . ”

It 's impossible to shake the feeling of deja vu .
It 's a bright Paris morning .
After waiting in the street , I 'm ushered into a quiet , darkened little bistro .
It 's empty save for the barman and a bulky figure at the far corner table , formally dressed , waiting to receive me .
I have an audience with the don himself : Francis Ford Coppola .
If I had a dishonoured daughter , I 'd ask him to avenge her .
If he was wearing a ring , I 'd probably kiss it .
The suspicion that Coppola has engineered this encounter to resemble the opening scene of The Godfather evaporates when he starts talking , though .
Rather than mumbling imperiously , Brando - style , he 's chatty , open , and even self - critical .
" I 'm a good enough director , I think , " he says at one point .
" The area I 'm most vulnerable in is my own confidence as a writer .
I was n't given that type of God - given talent , but I 'm joined at the hip with myself as a writer . "
This is a man with three Oscars in his heaving trophy cabinet purely for screenwriting ( Godfathers I and II and Patton ) .
If Coppola had wanted to play the don , you'd be happy to oblige him , but instead he 's like a young man again .
He 's now 71 years old , with a bushy white beard and a girth that attests to his success as a wine - maker , resort entrepreneur and all - round living legend .
His career has roller - coastered through the highest highs ( The Godfathers , Apocalypse Now , The Conversation ) and the lowest lows ( disasters like One From The Heart and The Cotton Club , financial ruin , and the death of his son , Gian - Carlo ) , with many an interlude of megalomania , manic depression and Hollywood excess in between , as anyone who 's read Peter Biskind 's Easy Riders , Raging Bulls or watched Hearts Of Darkness , on the making of Apocalypse Now , will know .
Coppola will make a great biopic subject one day , but not before he 's added another chapter .
Just when his career was fizzling out with director - for - hire dreck like The Rainmaker and Jack , Coppola has returned to his roots .
Just as he once turned out cheap quickies for Roger Corman , he 's making his own low - budget indie movies , self - financed this time .
It started with 2007 's erratic Youth Without Youth , which appositely enough , tells the story of an old man who miraculously starts getting younger .
Now comes Tetro , a striking , semi-autobiographical story of estranged brothers ( Vincent Gallo and newcomer Alden Ehrenreich ) and family secrets .
Handsomely shot in black and white ( mostly ) , in real Buenos Aires locations , and given to stylistic flourishes , operatic tragedies , and bizarre digressions , Tetro is a little rambling but wildly inventive ; the work of an old dog learning new tricks .
' If you make the conditions similar to what a more youthful artist would have , then you suddenly become more youthful '
Francis with daughter Sofia Coppola in 1989 .

" Well , if you work with no money , that 's similar to what young people have to deal with , " he laughs .
" And if you work with subject matter you have no total assurance about , you 're not so confident about what you 're doing .
So you make the conditions similar to what a more youthful artist would have , then you suddenly become more youthful . "
This is what Coppola always said he planned to do .
It 's what all the New Hollywood generation said they planned to do : become auteurs like their French New Wave idols .
But few of them ever achieved it .
They either crashed and burned early ( Peter Bogdanovich , William Friedkin ) or grew in stature to unwieldy proportions .
Scorsese turns out bloated thrillers like Shutter Island , Spielberg is the fully fledged studio mogul , George Lucas , whose early hits Coppola produced , is busy counting his Star Wars bucks , Altman is gone .
Success derailed them all , none more so than Coppola .
Post - Godfather , Peter Biskind painted an unflattering picture of him , cavorting with various women in the pool in his San Francisco mansion " like a newborn porpoise " .
" Being the director of The Godfather was like a trip ! " Coppola admits .
" I was young and I was , like , the king of the world for a moment , and I 'd never had money in my life , never had fame .
It was an adventure .
But on the other hand it made opportunities come to me that I should have turned down .
That 's the part I really regret .
It took me away from what I really wanted to do .
But I really do n't feel like I lost it because even then I never thought I had it !
I still do n't feel I have it .
So nothing has changed . "
Tetro certainly feels like a personal film .
Not just because it throws in scenes you can't imagine any studio approving of – " do we really need the risqué avant - garde transvestite theatre production of Faust halfway through ? " – but also because its characters are loosely based on Coppola and his elder brother , August , who died last year and whom Coppola looked up to " like he was my father " .
Like the real - life Coppolas , the film 's brothers also have a classical musician father – although in the movie he 's a domineering monster .
The Coppola movie Tetro most resembles is Rumble Fish , but then families , sibling bonds and paternal rivalry are recurring themes in Coppola 's movies .
It 's not difficult to see where they came from .
The Coppola dynasty now extends through three generations and countless branches of the Hollywood network , all thanks to Francis .
As well as giving breaks to a whole generation of newcomers like Tom Cruise , Matt Dillon , Rob Lowe , Diane Lane and Laurence Fishburne , he 's regularly employed his father ( Carmine , composer ) , his sister ( Talia Shire , AKA Connie Corleone ) , his nephew ( Nicolas Cage ) and innumerable extended - family members .
And , of course , he 's literally daddy to the movers of the new New Hollywood .
Sofia Coppola has distinguished herself as a director in her own right , but who would dare mess with her with Francis as her producer ?
" She 's very small , Sofia , very petite .
She 's made of steel but she 's a tiny , soft - spoken person , " he says , beaming with paternal pride .
" So I made sure on those first films she was surrounded by people who would protect her .
But after a while it was so clear that she had a knack for it . "
' Sofia said to his casting person she had this cousin and he was so funny .
Jason was n't even thinking about being an actor '
… and with nephew Jason Schwartzman .

There 's also his son Roman , his father 's regular right - hand man , but also director of music videos for the Strokes and Daft Punk , among others , and co-writer of Wes Anderson 's The Life Aquatic and The Darjeeling Limited .
Then there 's his other nephew , Jason Schwartzman , whose big break in Rushmore was also thanks to Uncle Francis .
" Jason came to Wes because for a while I would do nutty things with the kids , " he explains .
One summer holiday he got Roman , Sofia and Jason to write and direct their own one - act plays .
He wrote one too , to get them going .
" Mine was the worst , Roman 's was the best .
But a few years later when Wes was stumped finding an actor for Rushmore , Sofia said to his casting person she had this cousin and he was so funny .
Jason was a writer and a musician .
He was n't even thinking about being an actor . "
It sounds like The Royal Tenenbaums round the Coppolas ' gaff .
Or perhaps Stella Street .
One imagines Thomas Mars out of Phoenix ( Sofia 's partner ) picking up some nappies .
There 's George Lucas bringing round some Star Wars toys .
There 's Nicolas Cage playing table football with Vincent Gallo .
Spike Jonze is packing some old clothes he left here .
Oh hello , Wes , just borrowing a cup of sugar ?
But Francis denies he 's hipster Hollywood 's Godfather .
What , no horses heads in studio bosses ' beds ?
" Absolutely not !
They 're out there making deals by themselves ! " he says .
" I 'm usually the last one to know what 's going on .
These kids that were all in awe of what I was doing once , now they 're not even interested .
So I have to say I was a good parent in an artistic sense because they do n't need me any more . "
Coppola does n't need anyone any more , either .
He 's turned down offers from the studios to return to the fold .
He 's currently writing his next movie , whose budget will be determined by the success of the new vineyard he 's opening in California next month .
He 's unconcerned by commercial success , he says , " What matters to me more is what people will think of it 20 years later . "
It 's a pity some of his counterparts have n't done what he 's done .
" I think he will blossom with some more personal films , " he says of his old friend Scorsese .
While Lucas he describes as " a terrific experimental film - maker " .
It 's unlikely either of them still share Coppola 's appetite for adventure , though .
" You have to continue to jump off a cliff , " he says .
" I do n't think things through ; I feel them through .
And I know that half the time I might not land right , and maybe there 's a pleasure in that , but in my life I have to say , that 's served me well .

Newell sits next to an altar boy during Mass in Tijuana , Mexico , June 22 .
U.S. church officials said Newell was supposed to never work around children again after he was accused of child molestation while serving in the Los Angeles archdiocese sixteen years ago .
Join the conversation : Religion , spirituality & ethics | Reader forum : Your beliefs @FAITH_REASON ON TWITTER @FAITH_REASON ON TWITTER LOS ANGELES ( AP ) 
The 20 - year - old college student was working as a youth minister with the Archdiocese of Los Angeles when he revealed a long - buried secret to church authorities :
He had been molested by a priest for several years , beginning when the cleric was first a youth minister and then a seminarian .
The young man met with church officials , who promised the priest would never work around children again .
Sixteen years later , the man — now a father of two — typed the Rev. Jeffrey Newell 's name into a computer and was stunned by the results :
Newell was still a priest , serving in the Diocese of Tijuana .
His MySpace page lists a half - dozen teenage boys as his friends and includes pictures of Newell in his priest 's collar .
That discovery led to a lawsuit filed Tuesday against the Los Angeles archdiocese alleging that church leaders engaged in fraud and negligence by allowing Newell to continue serving as a priest long after his alleged crimes were reported .
The lawsuit is the second to be filed in California in recent months that uses fraud — and not molestation or sexual battery — as the basis for litigation over alleged sex abuse , and more are expected .
Dozens are already working their way through the legal system in several other states , including about 20 fraud cases filed in Minnesota in the past year .
Church attorneys in California have submitted court papers calling the theory fatally flawed , and a Fresno County judge will soon consider if a case there , filed in April , passes legal muster in California .
If it survives , suing for fraud could be another avenue for California clergy sex abuse victims who failed to take advantage of a one - year grace period that allowed them to sue after the deadline for a lawsuit had expired .
The alleged California victim , referred to only as Joseph Doe in the lawsuit , says he was duped into not suing earlier because he believed the archdiocese had removed Newell .
" I thought the archdiocese would handle it .
I was 20 , 21 years old and here I was going up as high as I thought I could go , " said the man , who requested anonymity because he is a sexual assault victim and is concerned about his reputation as an administrator at a private Christian school .
The Associated Press does not name alleged victims of sexual abuse .
A 2008 letter from a church attorney to law enforcement indicates Newell was ordained in 1990 , a year before the alleged victim reported the abuse , and removed from the Los Angeles archdiocese in 1993 for unrelated reasons .
The letter lists possible contact information for him in the Diocese of Tijuana .
On Wednesday , church spokesman Tod Tamberg said Newell was removed for " not complying with a treatment program for personal issues including obesity and alcohol " and engaging in " sexual misconduct with an adult . "
He did not elaborate .
Newell , 48 , now ministers in a working - class neighborhood in Tijuana and holds a daily evening Mass with drums and electric bass that is broadcast live through the parish website .
Young parishioners interviewed there said they think highly of " Padre Jeff , " who runs a teen community group every week , holds a radio show for Catholic teens and takes groups of children on sleepovers to a church - owned ranch .
There is no evidence of abuse allegations in Mexico .
When approached by an Associated Press reporter , Newell said the Tijuana archdiocese told him not to comment .
But he did say he had done nothing wrong in Mexico .
" I 've lived a chaste life for the past 20 years , 17 years in this community , " he said .
Until now , the church has been immune to old sex claims not filed within the one - year window — but that could change if these new lawsuits survive legal challenges , said Anthony DeMarco , a plaintiff 's attorney in Los Angeles .
The claims could also be a financial pitfall for the Roman Catholic church in California .
The grace period led to about 1,000 lawsuits in California and has cost the church more than $ 800 million in settlements in recent years , including a record - breaking $ 660 million payout in Los Angeles and a $ 100 million deal in Orange County .
" We 've routinely found evidence that the church has covered up allegations of abuse and continued to place these priests into positions of trust , " DeMarco said .
" That to me is a fraud and there 's probably quite a few folks out there who could benefit . "
The law allows plaintiffs to file suit within three years of discovering they were the victim of fraud or deceit , said Joe George , the Sacramento attorney who filed the Newell lawsuit .
Church attorneys say attempts to circumvent time limits on sex abuse cases by suing for fraud are dishonest and legally defective .
Michael Hennigan , an attorney representing the Los Angeles archdiocese , did not return a call for comment , but papers filed in the Fresno case called the lawsuit a " tortured " attempt to sue a decade too late .
Greg Keating , a tort law professor at the University of Southern California 's law school , agreed the cases are a long shot , but said they could go forward if plaintiff attorneys can prove a pattern of deception .
" The Catholic church is trying to rely on the statute of limitations for not being held accountable for some pretty serious wrongs .
It 's not a get - out - of - jail - free card , " he said .

Each week , we add about a million and half people to our current world population , which is at 6.8 billion .
We have we reached the point many describe as global overpopulation .
The family of humans , known as the hominids , has populated Earth , according to the fossil record , for 5 to 6 million years .
The hominids transitioned from one genus to another before our genus , homo , appeared about a million and half to two million years ago .
We transitioned through a number of homo species before our species , homo sapiens ( “ sensible humans ” ) emerged about 150,000 years ago .
Over time , we ’ve accumulated people .
Two - thousand years ago , our population was at 250 million .
In the year 500 A.D. , it remained the same .
By 1000 A.D. , we climbed to 500 million people .
We reached 750 million people around 1500 A.D.
We hit our first billion mark in 1800 at which time the Industrial Revolution kicked in .
We added people more rapidly and began to move quickly in the direction of human overpopulation .
Between 1800 and 1900 we added 600 million people .
At 1900 , we were at 1.6 billion .
By 1960 , in 60 short years , we nearly doubled that as we reached 3 billion .
In 1960 , we humans had been here about 150,000 years .
It took us that long to accumulate 3 billion people .
How long did it take for us to double that number ?
Thirty - nine years !
In 1999 , we reached 6 billion people .
It is estimated that we will be at 9.2 billion by 2050 .
The effects of global overpopulation are multiple and ominous .
As the result of having so many people who do not understand our reality and its behavioral demands , we have created an interrelated web of global environmental problems .
We are depleting our natural resources : our forests , fisheries , range lands , croplands , and plant and animal species .
We are destroying the biological diversity on which evolution thrives ( this is being called the sixth great wave of extinction in the history of life on earth , different from the others in that it is caused not by external events , but by us ) .
With powerful new electrical and diesel pumping techniques , we are draining our aquifers and lowering our water tables .
We are systemically polluting our air , water , and soil , and consequently our food chain .
We are depleting the stratospheric ozone that shields us from harmful ultraviolet radiation .
And , we are experiencing symptoms of global warming : heat waves , devastating droughts , dying forests , accelerated species extinction , dying coral reefs , melting glaciers , rising sea levels , more frequent and intense storms , and a more rapid spread of diseases .
With so many of us on a very small and fragile planet , and with the addition of so many more every week , we can no longer continue to relate to each other , our environment , ecological systems and biosphere as we have throughout our history .
Nature , which could not care less , will eliminate us .
To sustain humanity and advance our civilization , humankind must travel on a new and far more enlightened track .
The solutions to global overpopulation and other pressing issues can be found at the website below .

This year 's E3 Expo is about the future of videogames , as always .
But it 's also about delaying the future for as long as possible : Instead of rolling out new gaming machines , the big players are adding flashy new tech to systems already on shelves in an attempt to extend existing consoles ' life cycles and attract new players .
E3 , aka the Electronic Entertainment Expo , opens Tuesday in Los Angeles .
Microsoft 's E3 focus will be Project Natal , a camera - based device that lets Xbox 360 players control the onscreen action using body movements .
( Microsoft introduced Natal at last year 's E3 . )
Sony will highlight PlayStation Move , its version of the Wii motion controller , and make a big move into 3 - D stereoscopic gaming .
It 's arguable that Natal and Move will differentiate Microsoft's and Sony 's aging consoles more than a faster CPU and better graphics would , anyway .
" What would an Xbox 720 even look like ?
We 're beginning to hit the point of diminishing returns , " said Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Michael Pachter .
He says Sony and Microsoft will treat the launches of the new controllers as if they were entirely new machines .
The only company unveiling a new game platform at the show will likely be Nintendo , which will show off its 3 - D - enabled portable machine , the Nintendo 3DS .
Although the company 's current DS hardware remains a smash success , the portable device is positively geriatric , dating back to 2004 .
Facing renewed competition from Apple 's game - friendly iPhone and iPod Touch , Nintendo needs to do something radically different .
E3 is back at full size after a few downsized years , and ready to once again serve as a portal into videogaming 's near future .
The industry 's grandest trade show , expected to draw over 40,000 attendees , will lure every major publisher to the Los Angeles Convention Center .
There , they will show off high - profile titles they plan to release in the next 12 months , and even give some early looks at what the next few years will bring .
It 's great timing , says Electronic Entertainment Design and Research analyst Jesse Divnich , because the struggling game industry needs a show of force .
" The industry has performed poorly over the last 16 months , and E3 2010 is a time to show ( that ) bigger , better and more entertaining games are right around the corner , " Divnich said in an e-mail to Wired.com .
It 's been nearly five years since the launch of the Xbox 360 , which in the past would have put Microsoft on schedule to show off a new console with flashier graphics and more memory at this year 's E3 .
But the Xbox 720 and PlayStation 4 remain a long way off , in part because of the complexity of current consoles and in part because Microsoft and Sony are playing catch - up to Nintendo 's casual - gaming innovations .
Gamers and game developers alike have faced higher costs with this generation of consoles .
It costs tens of millions of dollars to produce big - budget high - definition games for Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 .
A low - end PlayStation 3 console still costs $ 300 , keeping it out of reach for many consumers who came in at the tail end of the PlayStation 2's life cycle .
Neither Sony nor Microsoft stand to gain by introducing more - expensive , more - complicated hardware too soon .
Instead , they 'll layer features onto their current consoles through the judicious addition of peripherals .
The PlayStation Move controller .
Image courtesy Sony
Move , a two - piece controller that tracks users ' hand motions and where they are pointing at the screen , is quite similar to Nintendo 's Wii controller .
But Wii's graphics are n't anywhere near the level of PlayStation 3's .
So Sony is attempting to create an all - in - one system that will cut Nintendo off at the knees , Pachter argues .
" Sony is positioning Move as an upgrade to the Wii , " he said .
" Sony is hoping that they pre-empt Nintendo from upgrading the Wii , so that everybody who would buy [ an HD version of Wii ] buys a PS3 [ instead ] . "
Microsoft's Project Natal is significantly different from both Move and Wii , because it eschews the traditional game controller altogether , letting users control the action by moving their hands and bodies .
" Natal will likely broaden the target market for the Xbox 360 , " said Divnich .
" The Xbox 360 is the console of choice among the core gamer , but with the addition of Natal , Microsoft will finally position itself as a true living - room entertainment hub . "
Natal , says Pachter , is less about giving gamers a cool new way to play games and more about getting more people in the household to use the Xbox 360 .
" Microsoft 's goal is to capitalize on a very large install base of console and get others to use it .
If you can bring in all those other people , it 's a win for Microsoft , because they can sell you more stuff . "
There is a serious disconnect at Microsoft .
Thanks to services like Hulu and Netflix , Microsoft 's game console is already loaded with opportunities to sell users something every time they turn on the box .
The more users who log in to the Xbox 360 , the more chance Microsoft can increase its revenue .
That , says Pachter , is the goal of Natal .
" You could sell a lot more stuff if you can get those other people to use the box , and the way to get them to use the box is make the control scheme more user - friendly , " he said .
There 's just one potential catch :
It might not happen .
" I think there is a really serious disconnect at Microsoft between what they want to achieve with Natal and what their audience wants , " Pachter said .
Although Natal is geared toward the non-gamer , it 's the gamer who 's going to make the purchasing decision , according to Pachter .
" Capturing the imagination of the guy who controls the console is hard , " he said .
" They 're not putting Gears of War on Natal . "
In short , the Trojan horse only works if the Trojans like horses .
Assailed on all sides by its competition , Nintendo will continue to produce wholly new devices .
On Wii , its Vitality Sensor attachment will take a user 's pulse and measure his or her heart rate .
To what end ?
We wo n't know until the company 's E3 press conference , but signs point to a game that 's about relaxation .
3 - D Pushes From Nintendo and Sony — — — — — — — —— ——
But Vitality Sensor is n't the big news ; Nintendo 3 DS is .
The company 's next - generation portable hardware will be fully playable on the E3 show floor , featuring 3 - D graphics that do n't require glasses .
Electronic Entertainment Design and Research 's Divnich says 3DS could be a bigger deal than either Move or Natal .
" Of the developers and publishers that have seen all of the new technologies in advance , they seem to be more excited about what the 3DS has to offer , " he said .
" Nintendo is known for its originality , and even when faced against an emerging competitor in Apple , Nintendo is sticking to its guns by creating a device that no competitor will replicate . "
Nintendo will create a device that no competitor will replicate .
Though Nintendo will deny it up and down , Apple has changed the handheld gaming market dramatically with the ubiquitous , accessible iPhone and its thriving App Store .
Jake Kazdal , a game artist formerly of Sega and Electronic Arts , said in an e-mail to Wired.com that he 's interested to hear how Nintendo will sell 3DS games through direct downloads .
" While I hear the 3DS is actually really impressive , what I 'm more interested in is their distribution model , " said Kazdal , now a founder of indie developer Haunted Temple Studios .
" I for one know I buy a lot more DS games now that I can easily purchase cheap , small , snack - sized fun games from home and never worry about bringing the cartridge around with me , " he said .
3 - D will also be a hot watchword for Sony 's E3 presentation .
The company has just rolled out the first batch of PlayStation 3 games that display in stereoscopic 3 - D on new television sets .
The company will surely spend a good deal of its energy trying to convince gamers that 3 - D 's time has finally come .
Kazdal says he 's excited .
" I think people just do n't yet comprehend how much depth it 's going to add to playing 3 - D games , being able to judge distances for jumping , driving and throwing things in 3 - D. I 'm saving up for the biggest 3 - D TV Sony is going to make ! "
He 'll have to .
Sony 's 3 - D Bravia televisions start at a budget - busting $ 2,000 and skyrocket from there .
Divnich does n't think 3 - D is going to catch on as fast as Sony thinks it does .
" 3 - D wo n't be considered a serious revenue driver for the gaming industry until 2012 , " he said .
" Consumers are not going to shell out $ 2,000 just to play 3 - D games .
Instead , consumers will naturally adopt 3 - D - enabled televisions over time , as they replace their current sets . "
At E3 , we 'll see a variety of new , flashy technology .
It remains to be seen which of these will hit the sweet spot and get people to buy more videogames , and which are just ahead of their time .

I 'd hazard a guess that more than half of the money we spend on IT infrastructure goes to ensuring uptime .
Whether that takes the form of redundant power supplies , redundant disks , multicore network architectures , high - availability server clusters , or fully replicated backup data centers , we build our infrastructures not " just in case " of failure , but because we know failure will eventually occur .
And we 're usually not disappointed .
I 've lost count of how many failed SAN disks and controllers , servers , and network equipment I 've seen -- probably thousands over the years .
Does n't matter who made the equipment -- it could be the biggest , most respected name in storage or networking -- it all breaks at some point or another .
[ Learn how data deduplication can slow the explosive growth of data with Keith Schultz 's Deep Dive Report .
| Looking to revise your storage strategy ?
See InfoWorld 's iGuide to the Enterprise Data Explosion . ]
We 're now at a point , however , where failure has become much more complicated .
As storage has moved from simple , striped disk volumes to virtualized storage platforms and deduplication , the old standby of throwing more redundant hardware at the reliability problem does n't always cut it .
Every time you add a new feature to optimize or more effectively manage storage , you need more software to drive all the hardware .
Often , that software is where the worst problems arise .
The case of the disappearing cartridge Recently , I worked with a client to design and implement a fairly complex new backup architecture .
One key component of that configuration was a fairly large , high - performance VTL ( Virtual Tape Library ) .
The VTL was chosen as part of the design because it offered easy integration with the client 's existing backup infrastructure and provided excellent deduplication capabilities -- essentially allowing them to keep months of backups in a nearline state where they could be easily and quickly restored -- rather than the few days that their previous , non-deduplicated disk - to - disk to tape solution had allowed .

Last week , the VTL decided for some reason that one of the emulated tape cartridges was corrupt .
There was no real indication as to why ; the hardware seemed to be working fine .
Obviously , that did n't inspire confidence , but hey , things break .
I 've seen a few corrupted physical tape cartridges in my time .
You learn to have a backup plan for your backup plan and roll with it .
The manufacturer 's first - line support suggested that the client delete that cartridge and then reboot the VTL ( fourth - level support and engineering would later say this was the last thing you should do , but that 's an entirely different topic ) .
Having done that , the VTL could n't bring the affected virtual library online at all .
That 's because that cartridge -- really a massive collection of deduplicated data blocks on a disk array -- was n't deleted cleanly and had taken with it all of the blocks that had been in common with many of the other virtual tape media .
That one poorly conceived troubleshooting step had essentially rendered 20 TB of backups useless in one fell swoop .

High - stakes international negotiations in Morocco over the future of whaling collapsed this week , with anti-whaling nations like Argentina unwilling to accept compromise proposals that Japan reduce , but not eliminate , its killing of whales in Antarctic and Pacific waters .
That this latest meeting of the International Whaling Commission produced a stalemate is hardly surprising .
For years , the commission ’s 88 member nations have been split along an ideological divide no less profound than the one over abortion in the United States .
Pro-whaling nations like Japan , Norway and Iceland say that opposition to modern - day whaling is illogical , as the species of whales being hunted are no longer endangered .
“ Japan supports the realization of the management , conservation and sustainable utilization of whale resources based on the best scientific information available , ” that country said in its opening statement at the Morocco meeting .
But for many whaling foes , the legitimacy of the practice hinges not on whether populations are sustainable enough to allow selective hunting , but on whether whales , like higher primates including chimpanzees or gorillas , are too intelligent and evolved to be hunted at all .
“ It ’s kind of a dichotomy between those who see whales as resources and those who see whales as beings , ” said Hal Whitehead , a marine biologist at Dalhousie University in Halifax , Nova Scotia , who studies sperm whales in the wild .
Proponents of whaling have argued for years that evidence of cetacean intelligence is weak and overstated .
The Japanese Whaling Association , a pro-whaling lobbying group , states at its
Web site that “ those who assert that the whale has a higher intelligence base their assertion on the large size of a whale ’s brain .
It is simply natural for a whale , which has a large head , to have a larger brain than those of other animals , but that does not necessarily mean that it has higher intelligence . ”
Yet arguments about brain size and cetacean intelligence have fallen to the wayside in recent years , with experiments in captivity showing that dolphins can grasp basic language and math skills , understand concepts of imitation and improvisation , and succeed in self - awareness tests previously passed only by humans and primates .
Whale and dolphin research in the wild ocean has also had breakthroughs .
Dolphins have been shown to divide themselves into societies , forming complex alliances to compete and fight against other dolphin groups .
And preliminary research shows whales distinguishing themselves geographically through variations in their famous vocalizations – the human equivalent of accents and dialects .
“ We are finding things that we had to invoke culture to explain , ” Dr. Whitehead said .
Growing appreciation for the complexity of whale behavior helped propel the opposition that sank the Morocco negotiations , despite early signs that a deal might be at hand .
Before the conference began , Japan stated that it was open to substantial compromises , including reduced quotas , the placement of international observers onboard whaling vessels , the deployment of satellite tracking systems and the monitoring of whale meat marketing using DNA fingerprinting .
But such a compromise , which would have reauthorized commercial whaling for the first time in 30 years , was a no - go for too many nations .
Without a deal , Japan has pledged to continue killing whales in the name of scientific research , as it has done since the commercial ban went into effect in 1986 .
The country ’s research is continuing and considerable , but perhaps unsurprisingly includes little investigation into whale intelligence .
The Web site for Japan ’s foremost whale research lab , the Institute for Cetacean Research , lists hundreds of papers in “ peer - reviewed journals ” but none on cetacean behavior , social structure or communication .
A few of the institute ’s published research papers seem destined to raise the hackles of anti-whaling activists , who call the institute a front for illegal commercial whaling .
One study from 2008 , for instance , is titled “ Comparative Experiment of Whaling Grenades in the Japanese Whale Research Program . ”
The study examined the effectiveness of Japanese and Norwegian explosive harpoons “ in order to improve the method of whale killing . ”
The study describes testing two weapons on live whales , after which researchers determined that they were both equally effective .
“ As there is not much difference in actual performance between the two , the lower price of the Japanese grenade may be an important factor in selecting future whaling devices , ” the study concludes .
A while ago at the start of Season 6 we broke the news that Illana was actually Jacob daughter .
However this spoiler never came out in the episode and we suspected it was due to that particular scene being cut .
Today the actress , Zuleikha Robinson , confirms that she was initially intended to be Jacob 's daughter but this plotline was dropped .
Thanks to FutureMan for the heads up .
A bit of breaking " Lost " news ( well , as breaking as news can be about a character who died four episodes ago ) : Ilana Verdansky was Jacob 's daughter .
That 's what Zuleikha Robinson , the actress who played the vest - wearing Ajira Airlines flight survivor , revealed at the Wednesday opening of a " Lost " gallery exhibit at the Vilcek Foundation in New York .
She was chatting with me and another journalist when we asked if she could tell us anything more about her character 's relevance to the broader narrative on the show .
" I was supposed to be Jacob 's daughter , " she confirmed , adding that the writers ultimately decided they did n't have enough time to fully address that part of the " Lost " saga in the number of episodes they had left .
Which is why Ilana got the " Boom goes the dynamite ! " treatment in " Everybody Loves Hugo , " accidentally blowing herself to smithereens after mishandling some explosive sticks .

If you run A / B tests on your website and regularly check ongoing experiments for significant results , you might be falling prey to what statisticians call repeated significance testing errors .
As a result , even though your dashboard says a result is statistically significant , there ’s a good chance that it ’s actually insignificant .
This note explains why .
Background
When an A/B testing dashboard says there is a “ 95 % chance of beating original ” or “ 90 % probability of statistical significance , ” it ’s asking the following question :
Assuming there is no underlying difference between A and B , how often will we see a difference like we do in the data just by chance ?
The answer to that question is called the significance level , and “ statistically significant results ” mean that the significance level is low , e.g. 5 % or 1 % .
Dashboards usually take the complement of this ( e.g. 95 % or 99 % ) and report it as a “ chance of beating the original ” or something like that .
However , the significance calculation makes a critical assumption that you have probably violated without even realizing it : that the sample size was fixed in advance .
If instead of deciding ahead of time , “ this experiment will collect exactly 1,000 observations , ” you say , “ we ’ll run it until we see a significant difference , ” all the reported significance levels become meaningless .
This result is completely counterintuitive and all the A/B testing packages out there ignore it , but I ’ll try to explain the source of the problem with a simple example .
Example
Suppose you analyze an experiment after 200 and 500 observations .
There are four things that could happen :
Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4 After 200 observations Insignificant Insignificant Significant !
Significant !
After 500 observations Insignificant Significant !
Insignificant Significant !
End of experiment Insignificant Significant !
Insignificant Significant !
Assuming treatments A and B are the same and the significance level is 5 % , then at the end of the experiment , we ’ll have a significant result 5 % of the time .
But suppose we stop the experiment as soon as there is a significant result .
Now look at the four things that could happen :
Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4 After 200 observations Insignificant Insignificant Significant !
Significant !
After 500 observations Insignificant Significant ! trial stopped trial stopped End of experiment Insignificant Significant !
Significant !
Significant !
The first row is the same as before , and the reported significance levels after 200 observations are perfectly fine .
But now look at the third row .
At the end of the experiment , assuming A and B are actually the same , we ’ve increased the ratio of significant relative to insignificant results .
Therefore , the reported significance level – the “ percent of the time the observed difference is due to chance ” – will be wrong .
How big of a problem is this ?
Suppose your conversion rate is 50 % and you want to test to see if a new logo gives you a conversion rate of more than 50 % ( or less ) .
You stop the experiment as soon as there is 5 % significance , or you call off the experiment after 150 observations .
Now suppose your new logo actually does nothing .
What percent of the time will your experiment wrongly find a significant result ?
No more than five percent , right ?
Maybe six percent , in light of the preceding analysis ?
Try 26.1 % – more than five times what you probably thought the significance level was .
This is sort of a worst - case scenario , since we ’re running a significance test after every observation , but it ’s not unheard - of .
At least one A/B testing framework out there actually provides code for automatically stopping experiments after there is a significant result .
That sounds like a neat trick until you realize it ’s a statistical abomination .
Repeated significance testing always increases the rate of false positives , that is , you ’ll think many insignificant results are significant ( but not the other way around ) .
The problem will be present if you ever find yourself “ peeking ” at the data and stopping an experiment that seems to be giving a significant result .
The more you peek , the more your significance levels will be off .
For example , if you peek at an ongoing experiment ten times , then what you think is 1 % significance is actually just 5 % significance .
Here are other reported significance values you need to see just to get an actual significance of 5 % :
You peeked …
To get 5 % actual significance you need … 1 time 2.9 % reported significance 2 times 2.2 % reported significance 3 times 1.8 % reported significance 5 times 1.4 % reported significance 10 times 1.0 % reported significance
Decide for yourself how big a problem you have , but if you run your business by constantly checking the results of ongoing A/B tests and making quick decisions , then this table should give you goosebumps .
What can be done ?
If you run experiments : the best way to avoid repeated significance testing errors is to not test significance repeatedly .
Decide on a sample size in advance and wait until the experiment is over before you start believing the “ chance of beating original ” figures that the A/B testing software gives you .
“ Peeking ” at the data is OK as long as you can restrain yourself from stopping an experiment before it has run its course .
I know this goes against something in human nature , so perhaps the best advice is : no peeking !
Since you are going to fix the sample size in advance , what sample size should you use ?
This formula is a good rule of thumb :
\[ n = 16 \ frac{\sigma^2}{\delta^2} \]
Where \( \delta\ ) is the minimum effect you wish to detect and \ ( \sigma ^ 2 \ ) is the sample variance you expect .
Of course you might not know the variance , but if it ’s just a binomial proportion you ’re calculating ( e.g. a percent conversion rate ) the variance is given by :
\[ \sigma^2 = p \times ( 1 - p ) \]
Committing to a sample size completely mitigates the problem described here .
UPDATE , May 2013 : You can see this formula in action with my new interactive Sample Size Calculator .
Enter the effect size you wish to detect , set the power and significance levels , and you 'll get an easy - to - read number telling you the sample size you need .
END OF UPDATE
If you write A/B testing software : Do n’t report significance levels until an experiment is over , and stop using significance levels to decide whether an experiment should stop or continue .
Instead of reporting significance of ongoing experiments , report how large of an effect can be detected given the current sample size .
That can be calculated with :
\ [ \delta = ( t_{\alpha /2} + t_\beta ) \sigma \ sqrt{2/n} \]
Where the two \ ( t\ ) ’s are the t-statistics for a given significance level \ ( \alpha / 2\ ) and power \ ( ( 1 - \beta ) \ ) .
Painful as it sounds , you may even consider excluding the “ current estimate ” of the treatment effect until the experiment is over .
If that information is used to stop experiments , then your reported significance levels are garbage .
If you really want to do this stuff right : Fixing a sample size in advance can be frustrating .
What if your change is a runaway hit , should n’t you deploy it immediately ?
This problem has haunted the medical world for a long time , since medical researchers often want to stop clinical trials as soon as a new treatment looks effective , but they also need to make valid statistical inferences on their data .
Here are a couple of approaches used in medical experiment design that someone really ought to adapt to the web :
Sequential experiment design : Sequential experiment design lets you set up checkpoints in advance where you will decide whether or not to continue the experiment , and it gives you the correct significance levels .

Bayesian experiment design : With Bayesian experiment design you can stop your experiment at any time and make perfectly valid inferences .
Given the real - time nature of web experiments , Bayesian design seems like the way forward .
Learn more : “ Bayesian A / B Testing ”
Conclusion
Although they seem powerful and convenient , dashboard views of ongoing A/B experiments invite misuse .
Any time they are used in conjunction with a manual or automatic “ stopping rule , ” the resulting significance tests are simply invalid .
Until sequential or Bayesian experiment designs are implemented in software , anyone running web experiments should only run experiments where the sample size has been fixed in advance , and stick to that sample size with near - religious discipline .

ABOUT THAT CNN POLL ….
It ’s likely that much of the polling on health care reform is going to change .
As the policy , instead of the process , takes center stage , and the nature of a historic victory creates a new narrative , public attitudes will be subject to change .
But in the meantime , CNN has released its latest pre-vote survey .
At face value , the results are a mixed bag for Democrats .
On the one hand , the public still does n’t trust Republicans .
Asked who they trust more to handle changes to the health system , respondents preferred President Obama to congressional Republicans , 51 % to 39 % .
Asked which party respondents trust more , the results were closer , but Dems still edge the GOP , 45 % to 39 % .
But that headline still reads , “ CNN poll : Americans do n’t like health care bill . ”
A majority of Americans have a dim view of the sweeping health care bill passed by the House , saying it gives Washington too much clout and wo n’t do much to reduce their own health care costs or federal deficits , according to a new poll released Monday .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll found that 59 percent of those surveyed opposed the bill , and 39 percent favored it .
But as we ’ve been talking about for a year , the nature of the opposition counts .
In this case , the follow - up question asked , “ Do you oppose that legislation because you think its approach toward health care is too liberal , or because you think it is not liberal enough ? ”
Looked at this way , 39 % support the bill , 43 % oppose it , and 13 % want the legislation to be more liberal .
So , when CNN tells you 59 % oppose the Democratic proposal , this is not to say that 59 % have bought into the right - wing demagoguery and think Republican criticisms have merit .
On the contrary , one could look at the same results and say that a 52 % majority either support the Democratic plan or want it to be even more ambitious in a liberal direction .
This is not to say that public attitudes are entirely accurate ; they ’re not .
Much of the country is still deeply confused about the plan and what it hopes to accomplish .
A 70 % majority , for example , said they expect reform to increase the deficit , despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary .
But Republicans assume that voter attitudes on health care are on their side .
If this poll is any indication , the GOP is misreading the opinion landscape .
For a party that has suddenly decided that public opinion polls are the single most important factor in shaping public policy , Republican officials really should take a closer look at what they ’re citing .
Q : Does Greece have a history of defaulting on its debt ?
A : Anytime you think something in financial markets is unprecedented , just speak with a market historian to get some perspective .
Given the random nature of markets , and the importance of money to most cultures , you might be surprised to find out how many times events called " unprecedented " have happened .
Most recently , investors have gotten unnerved about the financial woes of Greece .
The idea of a company , much less a country , not being able to pay its debts is staggering .
But you might be surprised to learn it 's not that unusual .
Consider Greece .
This recent scare is not the first time the country has had debt issues .
The nation has defaulted or restructured its debt five times since 1826 , according to market historian Bryan Taylor , chief economist at Global Financial Data .
The first time Greece issued debt was Feb. 21 , 1824 , when it sold bonds yielding 5 % .
Those 1824 bonds paid just five payments before the nation defaulted in July 1827 , Taylor says .
But let 's not make the mistake of painting Greeks as deadbeats .
National defaults , while rare , are n't unheard of .
Other European nations that have defaulted include : Austria ( three times ) , Bulgaria ( twice ) , Germany ( in 1932 ) , Hungary ( 1931 ) , Italy ( 1940 ) , Poland ( twice ) , Portugal ( twice ) , Romania ( three times ) , Russia ( twice ) , Serbia / Yugoslavia ( three times ) , Spain ( three times ) and Turkey ( four times ) .
What 's the lesson from this history ?
First , know that bond prices are an excellent indicator of troubles with debtors .
When bond prices fall , sending yields higher , that 's a pretty good indicator that investors think default is more likely .
These events are usually seen by capital markets .
But perhaps even more important , before you panic and think something is unprecedented , check the history .
You'd be surprised how many times the unthnkable , or the seemingly impossible , has happened .

I flew the U - 2 during the 1990s , and I received this news as if I had learned that an old friend was dying .
It may seem odd to grieve for a machine .
But the U - 2 is no ordinary vehicle .
Some in my world call flying the plane a religion , others a calling .
For me it was a gift .
The U - 2 is nicknamed the Dragon Lady for good reason .
You never knew what to expect when you took it into the air , no matter how seasoned a pilot you were .
This was an unfortunate consequence of its design .
The trade - off of a plane built light enough to fly above 70,000 feet is that it is almost impossible to control .
And 13 miles above the ground , the atmosphere is so thin that the “ envelope ” between stalling and “ overspeed ”  going so fast you lose control of the plane , resulting in an unrecoverable nose dive  is razor - thin , making minor disruptions , even turbulence , as deadly as a missile .
The challenge is even greater near the ground , since to save weight , the plane does n’t have normal landing gear .
As I was told before one of my tryout flights , “ Landing the U - 2 is a lot like playing pool .
It ’s not so much how you shoot as how you set up your shot . ”
Or , as my former wing commander said , “ We ’ve all had moments when we could just as easily have made one tiny move the other way and ended up dead . ”
Getting the plane up and down was not the only challenge .
Staying airborne  and alert  for countless hours , looking at nothing but sky , was another .
I learned the hard way , for example , that you can get diaper rash from Gatorade .
Other risks were less benign , as I found when I was the ground officer for a pilot who radioed , “ My skin feels like it ’s crawling . ”
He had the bends so badly from changes in pressure that when he landed his body was covered with huge welts .
Had the weather not cleared in time for him to land , these bubbles of nitrogen might have lodged in his brain or optical nerve  as they had in other U - 2 pilots .
Last night , the New Jersey Devils were down 3 - 1 going into the third period against the New York Islanders .
A laser of a slapshot by Ilya Kovalchuk pulled the Devils within one early in the third period and the attack was on .
Dwayne Roloson was bombarded with rubber as the Devils did whatever they could to get the equalizer .
Dylan Reese of the Islanders high - sticked Zach Parise in the face and drew blood , giving the Devils a four minute power play .
Normally , this is a gift for the team down by one .
But the Devils not only squandered the opportunity , but surrendered a goal against that undercut the comeback effort .
Sure , Blake Comeau tacked on a minor with 50 seconds left to leave a short 5 - on - 3 and an abbreviated 5 - on - 4 , but again , the Devils did n't do much with .
Of the 21 shots the Devils had in the third period , about 4 of them came on the power play that lasted over 5 minutes in that same period .
That 's a problem .
And it 's not a new one .
On Wednesday , the Devils ' offense showed up , made Marc - Andre Fleury of the Pittsburgh Penguins work all night long , and scored 3 goals .
Yet , when Craig Adams took a 5 minute major penalty for a hit from behind on Martin Skoula ; the Devils ' offense shrunk out there and only put a few shots on net .
A later power play in the second period looked a little better but yielded later .
The power play for the New Jersey Devils has been frustrating to watch , considering the personnel involved .
With another week of four games , surely , power play opportunities will come up for New Jersey .
Let 's discuss what the problems are in more detail in the hopes of finding some root cause to their power play struggles .
The Current Power Play Situation
Let 's focus on the last 6 games , the ones after the Olympic break .
Here 's how the Devils have done on the power play in each of those games :
3/2 at San Jose : 1 - for - 3 ( 4:06 ) ; 5 shots on net ; PPG scored by Ilya Kovalchuk , assisted by Zach Parise , Travis Zajac ; Other Devils on Ice : Andy Greene , Jamie Langenbrunner
3/5 at Calgary : 1 - for - 4 ( 5:27 ) ; 5 shots on net , PPG scored by Zach Parise ; assisted by Jamie Langenbrunner , Travis Zajac ; Other Devils on Ice : Brian Rolston , Ilya Kovalchuk
3/8 at Edmonton : 0 - for - 1 ( 2:00 ) , 0 shots on net
3/10 vs NY Rangers : 1 - for - 2 ( 2:15 ) , 3 shots on net ; PPG scored by Zach Parise , assisted by Dainius Zubrus , Travis Zajac ; Other Devils on Ice : Brian Rolston , Ilya Kovalchuk
3/12 vs Pittsburgh : 0 - for - 4 ( 9:20 ) , 8 shots on net
3/13 at NY Islanders : 0 - for - 4 ( 7:11 ) , 5 shots on net
That 's a total of 18 power play opportunities , 3 were converted for goals , and 23 shots were put on net .
All three goals involved the Devils putting at least 4 forwards on the ice , with Parise , Zajac , and Kovalchuk all present .
In fact , Parise has scored two of them off rebounds with the only other one being Kovalchuk 's wrist shot from the point .
Generally , most teams will use the power play to set up an excellent shot as opposed to what they would normally do on even strength situations .
With the opposition short a defender , this is desirable and understandable .
So bombing pucks away just is n't a smart option .
This can include , but is not limited to , cross-ice passes for one - timers , clogging the slot to open up the shot at the point , and just jamming the puck in deep .
Nevertheless , the team has averaged 1.278 shots per power play .
It 's clear that not only are they not scoring power play goals , but they are n't setting up enough good shots regardless of how well they have performed offensively in 5 - on - 5 hockey .
In general , Lemaire tends to throw Kovalchuk usually at the point , either ZZ Pops ( Parise - Zajac - Langenbrunner ) or ZZZ ( Parise - Zajac - Zubrus ) , and either Brian Rolston or Andy Greene at the point on the first unit .
Especially on special situations like a 5 - on - 3 or a power play longer than two minutes , Lemaire will put out five forwards .
Kovalchuk tends to stay on throughout the power play when other forwards come in to spell the initial unit .
Per Tom Gulitti's comment in this post at Fire & Ice ( discussing the power play , incidentally ) , the Devils practice the power play regularly .
They even worked on it today .
The issue is n't that they have neglected it in practice - that can be eliminated .
As reported here by Gulitti , Jacques Lemaire is concerned about the unit , just as much as we are as observers :
" We have to work at it to see the options that we have , " Lemaire said .
" See when it ’s time to shoot , when to pass , what ’s available , what ’s not . "
Lemaire conceded the power play is the team ’s biggest problem right now .
" We ’re losing games because of this , " he said .
" At least if you do n’t score , you can not give up a goal . "
Lemaire said he would " probably " continue using five forwards at times on 5 - on - 4 power plays .
He had Ilya Kovalchuk and Brian Rolston on the points again during today ’s practice .
Now , I do n't agree that the power play has led to a loss , but it certainly has n't helped New Jersey a lot as of late .
Tactical Issues & Suggestions
What troubles me is that Lemaire says that he 'll continue to use 5 forwards on the power play .
With what was seen in the last two games , I really do n't think this is a good idea .
For one thing , it basically puts all of the Devils ' offensive talent into one basket .
On paper , a unit featuring Zach Parise , Ilya Kovalchuk , and Travis Zajac alone should be frightening to play against .
Moreso when you add in Jamie Langenbrunner , Brian Rolston , Dainius Zubrus , David Clarkson , or Patrik Elias .
Basically , the top forwards on the team .
The good news is that despite the Devils not having a defenseman to run the point , the Devils do have enough forwards who can handle themselves well on the power play .
There 's Kovalchuk , Parise , Zajac , Elias , Langenbrunner , Zubrus , Clarkson , and Rolston .
That 's eight forwards , each with differing skill - sets .
Surely , two units could be created out of this group ?
Greene and Anssi Salmela are capable enough on defense to handle a man advantage .
When Paul Martin returns , that 's another defenseman available .
The point is that the Devils are n't short on personnel .
However , it 's not clear what the plan is to utilize all of them .
Kovalchuk and Rolston have excellent slapshots , so do the Devils employ an umbrella strategy ?
Zubrus , Clarkson , Langenbrunner , Zajac , and Parise are excellent down low , so do they try to overload the slot and just crash the crease ?
Elias , Kovalchuk , Langenbrunner , and Zajac have good vision and can set up good passes ( Elias being the best at it ) , so do they just set along the side boards to look for passing lanes ?
To me , this leads to two major issues : it is not clear who should be on what unit and the Devils do n't have a specific approach to their power play .
I feel that the two issues go hand - in - hand .
For one chance , we can see Parise - Zajac - Zubrus - Kovalchuk - Rolston and on the next power play it could be Parise - Zajac - Langenbrunner - Kovalchuk - Greene .
Granted , I understand fatigue and individual performance ( e.g. if Zubrus is having a great game , give him more minutes ) plays a role , but I think it 's undercutting what the Devils are doing .
We can immediately ask questions about the power play right from the get - go .
For example : If Rolston and Kovalchuk are on the point , then who 's the primary target at the point ?
Who 's leading the breakout to get into the zone ?
Are they dumping and chasing or is one man going to carry it over the line , draw attention , and dish it off to someone else ?
Will there be Devils trying to set up screens or play off the slot for rebounds ?
I do n't know , you do n't know , and the answers ( and the questions ) by the team change from power play to power play , game to game .
Because the units change by one or two people , it changes the approach and so an aggressive penalty kill can just stand at the blueline and be prepared for the rush up ice - figuring out what the Devils are doing and reacting faster than the Devils can employ their tactic .
On the Devils ' side , this all leads to just struggling to get into any kind of rhythm among their power play units .
This puts Lemaire in a tough spot - if something does n't work , generally you make a change .
At the same time , too many changes lead to the situation where the Devils are .
Despite all the talent at forward , there is n't much in sync because it is n't clear what they 're trying to do each time .
Therefore , there 's a team with the talent to put together a great power play on paper , but when opportunities arrive , our expectations are dashed by the team struggling to set up shots , much less score goals .
Those are man advantages wasted , fans and a team frustrated , and momentum handed right back to the other team .
I do n't believe the Devils are going to be able to be consistently threatening on a power play , much less score more goals , until roles are defined and a plan is set .
If this means an umbrella plan where Kovalchuk bombs away and the forwards try to pick up the loose puck , then fine .
If this means an overload strategy where ZZ Pops can cycle down low to open up passing and shooting lanes , then fine .
But right now , I could n't tell you what the Devils try to do on the power play given what they 've done all season .
The answer to that is simple : define units , set a plan , try it out , and then make adjustments accordingly .
The lack of a power play identity becomes a larger problem during a longer power play , where giving the first unit a long shift undercuts the second 's ability to set something up .
This tires out the first group so they have to rest longer and the second unit is some mish - mash of other players available trying to pick up where the first unit went wrong .
An additional problem is that Kovalchuk has been seen on the ice throughout entire power plays .
He 's a fantastic offensive talent , he has many skills , but I do n't feel he 's being used to his fullest by giving him the long shifts on man advantages .
It 's one thing to tell him to run the point , but the Devils have multiple players who can do a decent enough job for the second unit - if only just to keep the puck in the zone and distribute the puck .
He should n't have to play on both units with the number of players available .
Yet , he does .
So what can be done ?
Again , Lemaire needs to clearly define who is on both power play units , what their roles are , and how they will conduct themselves going into the offensive zone and how they will set themselves up .
I personally do n't have any preference as to how they are set up except that I do n't think there should be any more 5 forward units .
I feel it 's an issue of too many cooks in the kitchen , players ' styles clashing with each other in a situation where they should be meshing together .
This can be addressed by Lemaire and the coaching staff .
What the players themselves can do , I think , is simpler : relax .
It 's very weird that the Devils can have 7 minutes of power play time against Pittsburgh , put up maybe 4 or 5 shots on the power play , and then put 14 - 15 shots in even strength .
That tells me that the New Jersey players on the power play tend to get tentative and start feeling the pressure .
I do n't know what else it could be given a period like that ; it was the same way in the third period against the Islanders ( 4 - 5 shots on the power play out of 21 total in the period ) .
The pressure to make the most of the power play , to take full advantage , and it just gets to them , which I think leads to poor passes , poor puck movement into the zone , and indecision to shoot .
Again , I do n't want the Devils to fire away indiscriminately - that will just lead to lots of shots with no goals either ( or a ton of blocked shots ) .
I just want them to stop playing so nervously on the man advantage .
Perhaps that alone will lead to at least more consistently threatening power plays .
Once the Devils can do that , the goals will come and what has been an issue for the Devils in 2010 could become a strength .
When and how they will do it , I do n't know .
I would imagine , like most things , it wo n't happen overnight or just by sheer luck .
From my perspective , all we as fans can do is hope they figure that out .
I 've offered my take , I 'm sure you have your own thoughts that you 'll kindly place in the comments .

French President Nicolas Sarkozy slammed his fist on the table and threatened to pull France out of the euro at a meeting of European leaders deciding Greece 's aid package last Friday , according to Spain 's El Pais newspaper .
The newspaper cited comments by Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to members of his party on Wednesday as relayed by people present at that meeting .
The German government 's deputy spokeswoman denied the account .
" That is without any basis , " deputy spokeswoman Sabine Heimbach said of the report .
A spokesman for the Spanish Prime Minister 's office confirmed the meeting between Zapatero and other socialist party members on Wednesday , but could not immediately confirm what was said at the meeting .
Sarkozy demanded a " commitment from everyone to support Greece ... or France would reconsider its position in the euro , " according to one source cited by El Pais .
Another source present at the meeting between Zapatero and his party members and cited by the paper said : " Sarkozy ended up banging his fist on the table and threatening to leave the euro .
This forced Angela Merkel to give in and reach an agreement . "
The European Union and International Monetary Fund agreed a 110 billion euro ( $ 139.7 billion ) rescue plan for Greece last week .
But Germany , which must shoulder a good deal of the burden , had proven reluctant to commit itself to a plan .
Zapatero told his party members that France , Italy and Spain had formed a united front against Germany at the Brussels meeting and that Sarkozy had threatened to break up a traditional France - Germany " hold " on the rest of Europe , according to El Pais .

During the Grand Prix race engineer Phil Prew advised him Button would not overtake .
Whitmarsh admitted that Button ’s pass on Hamilton came “ shortly after ” that message was given .
He also said Hamilton lifted more than expected in turn eight , giving Button the chance to pass .
Speaking to Whitmarsh during the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes phone - in I asked him when Hamilton had been advised Button would n’t pass him and why he had been given that message .
Whitmarsh explained Prew had read the situation wrongly :
Shortly after [ Lewis ] was told Jenson would n’t overtake him , Jenson did overtake him .
Phil gave his opinion , as it turned out his opinion was wrong .
It ’s as simple as that .
They both had a challenge in that race from the outside – the race was a bit quicker for the Red Bulls and the McLarens .
We were consuming more fuel than we needed to so we had to find ways to save fuel .
Inevitably as you get to the end of race there is a dilemma about how hard you can race .
I think we had it amply demonstrated that a team and their drivers can get that wrong .
Both of our racing drivers want to win and they were being told to look after fuel but as a consequence of that Phil had the opinion that Jenson would n’t overtake .
Clearly that opinion was probably a wrong one .
Martin Whitmarsh
Whitmarsh added that Hamilton had lifted significantly in turn eight before Button passed him :
It was n’t expected that Lewis would lift as much as he did in turn eight .
I think for Jenson , as a racing driver , when he saw quite a big lift in turn eight he saw it as an opportunity to move up and subsequently made the pass .
Martin Whitmarsh
Drivers often lift at turn eight in Istanbul to save fuel .
Whitmarsh added that both cars were under instructions to save fuel which is why they maintained status up after Hamilton had taken the lead back from Button :
He asked a question and Phil Prew gave an instinctive and immediate response which is that he did n’t think Jenson was going to pass .
He knew that they ’d both been given the same instruction to save fuel .
Lewis understood that and was n’t about to give up first place easily .
He made a fairly robust overtake to ensure he remained in the lead .
Thereafter I think the two of them decided there was a reasonably fair and equitable equilibrium and they were looking to ensure they finished comfortably with fuel and with cars intact .

An executive from the world 's largest music company has admitted that global piracy cannot be stopped .
Francis Keeling , vice president of digital at Universal Music Group International , said : " Are you going to stop piracy ?
No you 're not .
" To try and set that as an objective is just not going to succeed .
Can we make piracy socially unacceptable ?
" Absolutely , and that has to be our ambition around the world . "
Universal 's artists include Lady Gaga and Rihanna .
Speaking at the Great Escape music convention in Brighton , Mr Keeling said : " We 've got markets like Spain and Italy , where [ people say ] ' You buy music ?
What are you doing buying music when you can get it for free ? '
" Clearly those markets are in the situation where , unless we can turn those markets around , we 're going to have a major problem having a music business there . "
Full weight
Universal has been prominent in the fight against illegal file - sharing .
It has also thrown its full weight behind the UK's Digital Economy Act , which will bring in sanctions against serial offenders , including the possibility of temporary internet suspensions .
The controversial law was approved last month and Mr Keeling stressed it was the " right solution " .
He also said he was confident the new Conservative - Liberal Democrat coalition government would " remain supportive " of the bill .
The details of the sanctions and how they will be imposed now have to be worked out .
" The solution needs to be fair , proportionate and implemented well , " Mr Keeling told delegates .
All options , including a military one , are on the table to stop Iran , US Under - Secretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy said Wednesday , backtracking from comments she made two months earlier that the military option was off the table .
In Israel for a strategic dialogue with the Defense Ministry , Flournoy told reporters Wednesday that while America ’s focus would be on imposing the new round of sanctions , it was keeping all options on the table .
“ All options remain on the table but right now our focus is on making the sanctions work , ” she said in Tel Aviv .
In April , Flournoy was quoted as saying during a visit to Singapore that a US military option on Iran is off the table in the near term .
“ The Obama administration remains fully committed to preventing Iran ’s development of nuclear weapons , ” she said Wednesday .
“ We have been pushing from the beginning for Iran to come into compliance with its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty and various United Nations resolutions .
We started off with a serious offer of engagement and were joined by international partners , and Iran chose not to engage seriously .
We most recently turned to the pressure track , the first step [ being ] sanctions .
” Flournoy will stay in Israel for several days and hold a number of highlevel discussions with the country ’s top military and defense brass about a widerange of issues , including continued American funding of various defense projects such as the Iron Dome short - range missile defense system , the Arrow ballistic missile defense system and Israel ’s interest in purchasing the stealth F - 35 fighter jet .
“ The defense relationship between Israel and US is stronger than ever ...[ and ] the US remains fully committed to Israel ’s qualitative military edge ( QME ) , ” she said .
According to Flournoy , the US maintained a policy of transparency in its contacts with Israel and regarding military sales to other countries in the region .
“ This administration has a very candid and ongoing dialogue with our Israeli counterparts on QME concerns they may have , whether on assistance to other countries in the region or prospective sales , and we try to be transparent and provide assurances , ” she said .
Flournoy said that the United States was waiting to see the results of the various inquiry panels into the IDF ’s raid last month on the Gaza flotilla while adding that Turkey appeared to be searching for a new role in the region .
“ There are areas where we have very shared perspective and cooperation [ with Turkey ] like on Iraq and there are areas where we had difference of views like on the vote at the UNSC on Iran , ” she said .
Turkey did not support the UN Security Council resolution to impose a new round of sanctions on Iran .
WEST ANTARCTICA —
At a camp here on Earth 's remotest continent , American researchers have constructed a towering drill that , like a biopsy needle , periodically plunges thousands of feet into the ice to extract an exotic marrow of frozen gases and isotopes .
Their work could settle a central question in the dispute over climate change , by documenting how greenhouse gases influenced temperatures in the past .
Only then can researchers accurately analyze climate changes that may be ...
BIRMINGHAM , Ala . 
Two years ago , Eric Bledsoe was a star point guard without the grades to meet the N.C.A.A. ’s minimum standards and needing to find a new high school .
He solved both problems by moving to A. H. Parker High School and now , after one season at the University of Kentucky , he is awaiting a lucrative payday in next month ’s N.B.A. draft .
The changes in Bledsoe ’s academic and athletic prospects have attracted the attention of the N.C.A.A. , which has sent investigators to at least three places in Alabama to ask about him .
The N.C.A.A. does not talk about its investigations , and the scope of this one is unknown .
But Bledsoe ’s academic makeover and the extra benefits he apparently received could be another blow to Kentucky Coach John Calipari , who led teams at Massachusetts and Memphis that had their records and Final Four appearances expunged after rules violations were found under his watch .
Interviews with those connected with Bledsoe ’s life in Birmingham revealed potential violations .
¶ Brenda Axle , the landlord for the house where Bledsoe and his mother moved for his senior year of high school , said that Bledsoe ’s high school coach paid her at least three months ’ rent , or $ 1,200 .
By moving there , Bledsoe was eligible to play for Parker , which he led to the Alabama Class 5A title game .
Maurice Ford , the coach , denied paying the money .
Sperm whales feeding even in the most remote reaches of Earth ’s oceans have built up stunningly high levels of toxic and heavy metals , according to American scientists who say the findings spell danger not only for marine life but for the millions of humans who depend on seafood .
A report released Thursday noted high levels of cadmium , aluminum , chromium , lead , silver , mercury and titanium in tissue samples taken by dart gun from nearly 1,000 whales over five years .
From polar areas to equatorial waters , the whales ingested pollutants that may have been produced by humans thousands of miles away , the researchers said .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ These contaminants , I think , are threatening the human food supply .
They certainly are threatening the whales and the other animals that live in the ocean , ” said biologist Roger Payne , founder and president of Ocean Alliance , the research and conservation group that produced the report .
The researchers found mercury as high as 16 parts per million in the whales .
Fish high in mercury such as shark and swordfish Ã¢â‚¬â€ the types health experts warn children and pregnant women to avoid Ã¢â‚¬â€ typically have levels of about 1 part per million .
The whales studied averaged 2.4 parts of mercury per million , but the report ’s authors said their internal organs probably had much higher levels than the skin samples contained .
“ The entire ocean life is just loaded with a series of contaminants , most of which have been released by human beings , ” Payne said in an interview on the sidelines of the International Whaling Commission ’s annual meeting .
Payne said sperm whales , which occupy the top of the food chain , absorb the contaminants and pass them on to the next generation when a female nurses her calf .
“ What she ’s actually doing is dumping her lifetime accumulation of that fat - soluble stuff into her baby , ” he said , and each generation passes on more to the next .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ultimately , he said , the contaminants could jeopardize seafood , a primary source of animal protein for 1 billion people .
“ You could make a fairly tight argument to say that it is the single greatest health threat that has ever faced the human species .
I suspect this will shorten lives , if it turns out that this is what ’s going on , ” he said .
Payne called his group ’s $ 5 million project the most comprehensive report ever done on ocean pollutants .
ADVERTISEMENT
U.S. Whaling Commissioner Monica Medina informed the 88 member nations of the whaling commission of the report and urged the commission to conduct further research .
The report “ is right on target ” for raising issues critical to humans as well as whales , Medina told The Associated Press .
“ We need to know much more about these problems . ”

Payne , 75 , is best known for his 1968 discovery and recordings of songs by humpback whales , and for finding that some whale species can communicate with each other over thousands of miles .
The 93 - foot Odyssey , a sail - and - motor ketch , set out in March 2000 from San Diego to document the oceans ’ health , collecting pencil - eraser - sized samples using a dart gun that barely made the whales flinch .
After more than five years and 87,000 miles , samples had been taken from 955 whales .
The samples were sent for analysis to marine toxicologist John Wise at the University of Southern Maine .
DNA was compared to ensure the animals were not tested more than once .

Payne said the original objective of the voyage was to measure chemicals known as persistent organic pollutants , and the study of metals was an afterthought .
The researchers were stunned with the results .
“ That ’s where the shocking , sort of jaw - dropping concentrations exist , ” Payne said .
Though it was impossible to know where the whales had been , Payne said the contamination was embedded in the blubber of males formed in the frigid polar regions , indicating that the animals had ingested the metals far from where they were emitted .
“ When you ’re working with a synthetic chemical which never existed in nature before and you find it in a whale which came from the Arctic or Antarctic , it tells you that was made by people and it got into the whale , ” he said .
ADVERTISEMENT
How that happened is unclear , but the contaminants likely were carried by wind or ocean currents , or were eaten by the sperm whales ’ prey .
Sperm whales are toothed whales that eat all kinds of fish , even sharks .
Dozens have been taken by whaling ships in the past decade .
Most of the whales hunted by the whaling countries of Japan , Norway and Iceland are minke whales , which are baleen whales that feed largely on tiny krill .
Chromium , an industrial pollutant that causes cancer in humans , was found in all but two of the 361 sperm whale samples that were tested for it .
Those findings were published last year in the scientific journal Chemosphere .
“ The biggest surprise was chromium , ” Payne said .
“ That ’s an absolute shocker .
Nobody was even looking for it . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The corrosion - resistant metal is used in stainless steel , paints , dyes and the tanning of leather .
It can cause lung cancer in people who work in industries where it is commonly used , and was the focus of the California environmental lawsuit that gained fame in the movie “ Erin Brockovich . ”
It was impossible to say from the samples whether any of the whales suffered diseases , but Wise found that the concentration of chromium found in whales was several times higher than the level required to kill healthy cells in a Petri dish , Payne said .
He said another surprise was the high concentrations of aluminum , which is used in packaging , cooking pots and water treatment .
Its effects are unknown .
The consequences of the metals could be horrific for both whale and man , he said .
“ I do n’t see any future for whale species except extinction , ” Payne said .
“ This is not on anybody ’s radar , no government ’s radar anywhere , and I think it should be . ”

The Court of Appeal has ordered a police officer and the State of Victoria to pay more than $ 140,000 in court costs for a man assaulted by police five years ago
Grant Watkins was punched in the face and had his head smashed into a wall at the St Kilda Road police complex in May , 2005 .
Mr Watkins alleged he went to the station looking for his blind girlfriend after they had had a fight .
He was arrested and threatened when he refused to be fingerprinted .
Mr Watkins was held down by the arms and punched in the face with force .
The officers involved were cleared in 2008 .
But an appeals judge overturned that decision earlier this month , ordering the state and one officer , Nathan Kaeser , to pay $ 98,000 in damages .
They have now been ordered them to pay Watkins ' legal costs

But Jack is already SCANNING the water in the dawn light .
And GODDAMMIT ...
There IS someone out there .
Really fucking FAR OUT THERE .
We can JUST make out an ARM frantically waving for help as ...
ADRENALINE KICKS IN .
INSTINCT TAKES OVER .
And Jack is PULLING OFF HIS SHIRT as he sprints for the water and he ...
DIVES IN .
And we go with him into -- THE OCEAN
As Jack 's arms CUT through the water -- his face emerging every ten strokes to take a GAPING BREATH -- a fucking machine as he POWERS towards -- THE PERSON OFF IN THE DISTANCE -- struggling to keep their head above water -- still so FAR AWAY -- 3 ( CON T'D ) : 3
And we 're MOVING TIGHTER on Jack with every stroke -- his purpose SINGULAR -- and he 's closing that distance , but --
The victim DISAPPEARS under the surface of the water .
And we 're WITH JACK in the ten seconds it takes to get to the spot where they went under -- he takes a DEEP BREATH and DIVES underneath the surface after them --
And we wait .

Deep breaths -- c'mon , man -- relax -- you 're okay -- deep breaths ...
And as Jack wraps him into a CROSS - CHEST CARRY and begins to swim back to shore , we 're CLOSE ON BOONE .
Completely SPENT .
But his lips are moving -- trying to SAY something .
Too weak .
But he WILLS HIMSELF to do it .
And finally -- BOONE Did you ... get her ?
JACK
What ?
BOONE
The woman ... out there ... I was trying to ... ( focused )
Did you get her ?
WHAT ?!
And Jack instantly turns back away from the shore , THREADS WATER with one arm , holds Boone afloat with the other - JACK'S POV - PANICKED .
HANDHELD .
Scanning the ocean from side to side --
How could he not seen ...?
And OH FUCKING SHIT !
Because there -- ANOTHER hundred yards out -- IS A WOMAN .
And she is about to go UNDER .

And as soon as they relieve Jack of the burden , he is already turning back towards the ocean -- KATE Jack !
JACK
There 's someone else out there .
A MOMENT .
Jack was spent before he swam out to get Boone and back .
But he 's going to go back in .
He 's GOT to go back in .
And Kate knows it .
And time resumes as Jack DIVES back in -- Arms , legs , heart , mind ... all furiously dedicated to saving that woman ..
But we stay HERE .
And we 're already PULLING BACK and UP .
OVER the gathered crowd at the shallows so all we see is -- JACK .
Swimming out into the ocean .
A single figure cutting through an endless expanse of BLUE .

There 's no one left to save .
END OF TEASER ACT ONE 5 EXT .
BEACH - DAY 5 We start CLOSE ON BOONE --
His blue eyes UNBLINKING as they stare out towards the ocean .
PULL BACK to find --
He 's still shirtless .
Barefoot .
And the intensity in his eyes .
If we had to guess at what he 's feeling right now , we 'd have to go with ANGER .
No sense of how long he 's been sitting here ...
But it 's been awhile .
And now Boone 's gaze floats elsewhere on the beach .
Off in the distance .
Onto JACK .
Walking towards the INFIRMARY TENT , inexplicably carrying a full length MIRROR .
And now we leave Boone to join him as -- 6 6 DOWN THE BEACH KATE moves to catch up with Jack , concern in her eyes .
Because now that we 're closer , we can clearly see -- Jack has seen better days .
UNSHAVEN .
EXHAUSTED .
And because he is who he is , beating himself up for the life he did n't save .
KATE Hey -- JACK
So what 'd they say ?
KATE ( sensitively )
Jack , maybe you should ...
JACK
Who was she ?
A beat .
Okay .
He wants to know .
NEEDS to know .
Then -- KATE
Her name was Joanna .
She was n't supposed to be on the plane .
( beat )
She went scuba diving off the Barrier reef and got an ear infection .
Doctor grounded her two days , so she bumped her flight .
Ended up with us .
6 ( CON T'D ) : 6 Jack shakes his head .
Hard to stomach the brutal irony -- JACK
She was swimming this morning .
Just swimming .
Riptide caught her . ( beat )
We 've been here six days and we never talked .
I never said a word to her .
There were -- KATE JACK Jack .
Don't. -- forty seven of us .
I did n't say a single word .
And Kate is not a big believer in feeling sorry for oneself -- KATE
You tried .
Jack finally stops walking .
Puts the MIRROR down .
Turns to look at Kate for the first time -- JACK No. I did n't .
I thought maybe I could ...
I thought I could bring him back and still have time .
I was there -- in the water ... ( beat ) I did n't try .
I decided not to go after her .
Kate does n't know what to say to that .
And that 's when it happens -- Jack goes WHITE .
KATE
What 's ...?
But Jack is n't looking at her .
He 's looking PAST her .
WAY past her .
And the SOUND DROPS OUT as we follow his gaze to -- THE OCEAN .
There .
In the shallows .
A MAN .
And we 're TOO FAR AWAY to see his face , but he 's wearing a SUIT .
And he 's WAIST DEEP in the water .
Just standing there .
Facing us .
Facing Jack .
And it 's fucking CREEPY .
KATE ( O.S. ) Jack ? 6 ( CON T'D ) : ( 2 ) 6 SOUND rushes IN -- Jack 's attention is drawn back to Kate ...
KATE
Are you okay ?
But Jack is already looking back towards the ocean , MOVING TOWARDS IT , in fact , But -- There 's no one there .
JACK
You see that ?
KATE ( confused )
See what ?
JACK
He was just standing there ... in the water .
A man .
Jack turns back to her .
DESPERATE .
Needing her to tell him he 's not going fucking nuts .
Needing her to tell him she saw the same thing he did .
KATE Jack ...
And her face says it all .
Jack is visibly distraught -- JACK
You did n't see him ?
KATE ( tenderly )
When 's the last time you slept ?
But Jack is n't in the mood for tenderness right now .
And he sure as shit is n't answering that question , either .
He just picks up the MIRROR ...
JACK
I have to put this with the rest of the gear .
And with that , Jack walks off .
And as KATE watches him go , we begin to drift -- 7 7 AROUND THE BEACH
And there 's a new feeling here amongst the castaways today .
One of LOSS .
They 've all heard about the woman who drowned -- LOST " White Rabbit " ( PINK ) 8/9/04 8 . 7 ( CON T'D ) : 7
But none of them are actually TALKING ABOUT IT .
We FIND -- MICHAEL Still a little GIMPY from his run-in with the boar .
He stands barefoot on the beach , BRUSHING HIS TEETH .
WALT stands next to his father , doing the same .
Michael holds a cup of OCEAN WATER in a coffee mug .
Brings it to his lips .
Sloshes it around his mouth .
SPITS .
Refills the mug .
Hands it to Walt .
MICHAEL
Don't swallow it , okay ?
WALT
Why not ?
MICHAEL
`Cause it 's from the ocean .
It 'll make you thirsty .
WALT
Why ?
Michael is not up for the " constant barrage of questions " thing .
Especially today .
MICHAEL
Just do n't swallow it , man .
Walt knows when to push and when not to .
So he takes the cup .
Rinses .
And SPITS .
And we PULL BACK to see Michael and Walt from afar .
SOMEONE watching them .
And it's -- 8 8 SUN She watches Michael and Walt from the TREE LINE .
Sun is snapped out of her quiet observance as -- A FINGER reaches into frame , gently touches her CHAPPED LIPS .
Sun jumps -- immediately looks at -- JIN .
He speaks softly ( but not altogether kindly ) in KOREAN .
As they 're alone , we get the benefit of SUBTITLES -- JIN
You need water .
8 ( CON T'D ) : 8 SUN No -- I 'm all right .
Thank you .
He settles down next to her .
And they sit in SILENCE for a few beats .
And we can see the death of the woman ... even though a stranger ... it WEIGHS on them , too .
And finally , it is SUN who speaks -- SUN
When will someone tell us what to do ?
JIN ( surprised )
What ?
SUN I do n't think anyone is coming .
JIN ( not so sure ) Someone will come .
Sun shakes her head .
Unable to challenge what she clearly knows is her husband 's DENIAL -- SUN
The others ... they ignore us .
If we tried harder to communicate ...
JIN
We 'll be fine .
We do n't need them .
And then , in an attempt to be reassuring -- JIN I will tell you what to do .
And if Sun were actually looking into her husband 's eyes right now , she might see the same thing we do -- Doubt .
But for now , we 're MOVING ON AS -- 9 9 A LONG PAIR OF STUNNING LEGS Tromp by Sun & Jin , dainty plastic SUNFLOWERS adorning a pair of PINK FLOP - FLOPS as the feet within them stride with great purpose towards -- A PAIR OF FANTASTICALLY CRAFTED COWBOY BOOTS .
Toes in the air .
One tapping to a tune no one can hear but its wearer .
9 ( CON T'D ) : 9 The Flip - Flops stop .
Square off against the boots .
A tense beat .
Then -- SHANNON ( O.S. )
Have you got it or what ?
And we PAN UP to reveal the Flip - Flops belong to SHANNON .
The boots , of course , are on -- SAWYER
You 're in my light , sticks .
SAWYER sits on a MAKESHIFT DECK CHAIR .
Does n't even look up as he reads a battered paperback -- " WATERSHIP DOWN . " SHANNON " Lightsticks ? "
What the hell is that supposed to -- SAWYER Light .
Comma .
Sticks .
Meaning your legs .
He turns a page .
This is a different side of Sawyer .
Less directly adversarial with Shannon .
HMMMM .
SAWYER
How 's your brother ?
SHANNON SAWYER
What do you mean how -- --
Almost drowned , did n't he ?
SHANNON ( fuck you )
Look -- while I really love my new nickname and I think it 's really sweet that you 're asking ...
SAWYER
Calm down .
I got your damn stuff .
And with that , Sawyer produces a can of BUG SPRAY from the canvas bag at his feet as Shannon SCRATCHES her leg -- SHANNON ( skeptical )
It 'll keep off sand fleas ?
SAWYER
You bet .
And it 's got aloe , too .
9 ( CON T'D ) : ( 2 ) 9 SHANNON
How much ?
SAWYER SHANNON
You serious ? --
Yeah , I 'm ...
And Sawyer finally puts his book down .
Looks at Shannon like she just might be the stupidest person in the world .
SAWYER
You in the same situation I am ?
` Cause last I checked , we were n't going nowhere for awhile .
( slowly and clearly )
Your money 's no good here .
SHANNON
So what the hell do you want ?
( then ; dawning on her )
If you think that I 'm ...
SAWYER
Five grand .
The effectively shuts her up .
After a beat -- SHANNON
I thought you said money was no good here .
SAWYER I was negotiating .
( grins ) I 'll take an IOU .
Somethin ' tells me you 're good for it .
Shannon just looks at him .
Scratches her leg ... but it almost becomes a DEFIANT SCRATCH .
Then she straightens up .
Gives him the full on EVILEST EYE EVER -- SHANNON Screw you .
And with that , she STALKS OFF .
Sawyer watches her go .
Drops the bug spray back into his bag ...
And goes back to his book .

Astrology is a load of crap , but that 's because they do n't understand it .
I could do your chart if you 'd like ... ( Kate would n't like ) Ah .
All right then .
( shakes her head ; sighs ) Geminis .
Kate smiles at her .
Claire smiles back .
A genuine bond between them .
And off this lovely moment we move BACK TO -- 11 11 EXT .
MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY AREA - DAY JACK .
Still working .
Always working .
Eyes bloodshot .
Next to the tent , Jack has managed to drag a CARGO CONTAINER to store valuable GEAR .
Right now , he 's placing the MIRROR next to a stack of what seem to be TEXTBOOKS as -- HURLEY ( O.S. )
Hey , Jack ?
Jack looks up to see HURLEY -- HURLEY Whoa --
You look tired , brother .
JACK I 'm fine .
What 's up ?
11 ( CON T'D ) : 11 HURLEY
We 've got a problem , man .
SMASH CUT TO : 12 EXT .
BEACH - WATER COLLECTION SITE - DAY 12 CLOSE ON JACK .
His eyes telling us that somehow his day actually just go WORSE -- JACK
That 's it ?
CHARLIE ( O.S. )
That 's it .
And we PULL OUT to find -- Jack stands with CHARLIE AND HURLEY .
Next to them , one of the RAIN STATIONS -- a jury - rigged TARP meant to collect water .
But right now , all their attention is on -- A RED SUITCASE .
Inside it , carefully arranged , BOTTLES OF WATER .
Some bear the OCEANIC LABEL .
All about three quarters full .
JACK
How many ?
CHARLIE Eighteen .
HURLEY
People just took what they needed `cause , y'know we were supposed to be rescued ?
But uh -- we were n't .
And it has n't rained , man .
CHARLIE
Even if we divvied it up ... split the bottles in half , it would n't be enough water for all forty - seven ...
JACK Forty - six . ( beat )
There 's forty - six now .
A quiet moment as they all absorb the implication .
Then -- HURLEY
It 's getting pretty toasty out here .
When people find out this is it , they 're gonna freak out , man .
12 ( CON T'D ) : 12 CHARLIE
And the boar 's running low until we can catch another one .
What should we tell them ?
LOST " White Rabbit " ( PINK ) 8/9/04 15 . 12 ( CON T'D ) : ( 2 ) 12
And they 're looking to Jack for these answers .
And we can FEEL his pain .
The enormous load he 's bearing .
The enormous load the others PUT ON HIM -- JACK I do n't know .
HURLEY CHARLIE
Maybe we can make one of those water - finding sticks ... --
Where should we put what we 've got ?
JACK I do n't know ...
And Jack is WALKING AWAY now , it 's just TOO FUCKING MUCH ...
But Charlie picks up the RED SUITCASE .
He and Hurley nipping at Jack 's heels as he heads back for the infirmary tent -- CHARLIE HURLEY
We should put it in the tent , yeah ? --
Maybe that dog can find water .
CHARLIE HURLEY
Probably better if no one knows how little is left ... --
Dogs can find pot and bombs , so they can find water ...
They arrive at the infirmary tent and Charlie places the suitcase of water just inside the flap .
CHARLIE ( to Jack )
If you tell the others we 're running low , we can ration it .
That way you can decide who gets ...
And that does it .
The dam breaks .
Jack stops .
SPINS ON BOTH OF THEM --
And he does n't YELL , but it 's fucking close -- JACK I 'm not deciding anything .
And Hurley visibly flinches .
Not used to this from Jack .
Shit .
Neither are we .
HURLEY ( quietly )
Why not ?
LOST " White Rabbit " ( PINK ) 8/9/04 15A. 12 ( CON T'D ) : ( 3 ) 12 Jack GRITS his teeth .
Why not ?
Why fucking not ?
12 ( CON T'D ) : ( 4 ) 12
Whatever the answer to that is , he ain't giving it to them .
So he turns .
And WALKS AWAY .
And we stay with Jack as he leaves Charlie and Hurley in his wake .
Moving closer .
CLOSER .
And finally , we 're right on his BLOODSHOT EYES as -- 13 INT .
JACK'S PARENTS ' HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK 13 CLOSE ON THAT SAME PAIR OF EYES -- but twenty years younger .
And one of them is almost SWOLLEN SHUT .
TWELVE YEAR OLD JACK stands nervously in the doorway of an imposing STUDY .
Beautiful .
Ornate .
The kind of place where you do n't want to touch stuff .
Jack currently focused on -- A WELL - WORN LEATHER CHAIR .
Its back facing us .
But someone 's in it -- A MASCULINE HAND reaches to the small end table next to the chair , picks up a GLASS OF SCOTCH ... CLINKS the ice cubes as he gently rotates his wrist .
And finally -- A FACE peers from around the chair .
Extremely handsome .
Very intense .
INTELLIGENCE dances behind his eyes .
This is DR .
SHEPHARD .
This is JACK'S FATHER .
SHEPHARD
Not the best decision , huh kiddo ?
Shephard offers a smile to his son -- but it's only with his mouth , not his EYES .
SHEPHARD
You wanna come in ?
Not really .
But Jack does anyway .
Walks up to his dad 's chair .
Of course , there 's no place for him to sit .
SHEPHARD
So how 's the other guy look ?
Jack does n't get the joke .
His father sighs -- SHEPHARD ( CONT'D )
Want to tell me what happened ?
JACK ( shrugs ) Couple guys jumped Marc Silverman .
13 ( CON T'D ) : 13 SHEPHARD Couple guys jumped Marc Silverman . ( beat )
But they did n't jump you .
JACK No .
Shephard just looks at his son for a moment .
Ca n't quite read it ... but it feels a lot like PITY .
Then --
He extends his FISTS .
Face down .
SHEPHARD Okay , Jack .
One 's got a quarter in it .
Other 's empty .
You choose right , quarter 's yours .
You choose wrong , you give me a quarter .
Jack just looks at his father 's outstretched hands for a moment .
Not sure what 's going on right now ...
SHEPHARD ( CONT'D ) Decide , Jack .
Jack deliberates another moment .
Finally --
Picks the left hand .
Shephard opens it up -- NOTHING inside .
Shakes his head -- SHEPHARD ( CONT'D )
Pay up .
Is he serious ?
Yeah .
He is .
Jack reaches into his own pocket , hands his father a QUARTER .
The old man takes it , looking over his son 's beaten face .
Downs a swallow of his drink -- SHEPHARD ( CONT'D )
Your heart 's in the right place .
Sticking up for the little guy .
( beat )
But look what happened .
You made the wrong call .
You lost , buddy .
( beat )
You failed .
And let 's stop for a second here .
Because this is one of those moments in your childhood .
One of those moments where your folks say something that just NEVER GOES AWAY .
13 ( CON T'D ) : ( 2 ) 13 Something that sticks with you .
That BECOMES you .
And Jack is listening to every fucking word of it .
SHEPHARD ( CONT'D )
Boy was on my table today .
Year younger than you , maybe .
Bad heart .
And it was a real rough one , Jack .
Got real hairy , real fast .
People were looking to me to make decisions .
Big decisions .
What to do .
How to do it .
( beat )
And I was able to make those decisions because at the end of the day after that boy died , I was able to wash my hands , come home to dinner , watch Carol Burnett and laugh until my sides hurt .
And how can I do that ?
Even when I fail -- How do I do that ?
( beat )
Because I have what it takes .
And his father actually puts his hand on Jack 's shoulder .
He does love his son .
This is said out of that love ... no matter how fucking cruel is sounds to us -- SHEPHARD
Don't choose , Jack .
Do n't decide .
Walk away from the fights .
Because when you fail -- when you make the wrong choice ?
It 's gonna hurt .
And buddy ?
When that hurt comes ?
( beat )
You do n't have what it takes .
Jack absorbs that .
And more importantly , because this is his father .
Because he is twelve .
Because this must be true -- He BELIEVES it .
A beat .
And then , his father again extends two fists -- SHEPHARD ( CONT'D )
Same rules .
Double or nothing .
Decide .
But Jack just looks at the extended hands .
Many , many , many , beats pass before Jack finally shakes his head .
No. SHEPHARD ( CONT'D ) Good boy .
13 ( CON T'D ) : ( 3 ) 13 And OFF YOUNG JACK , the lesson not only learned , but HARD - WIRED , WE COME BACK TO -- 14 14 INT ./EXT .
INFIRMARY TENT - DAY UNBLINKING .
Those same intense eyes .
Jack sits alone in the INFIRMARY TENT .
AND what 's he staring at ?
The OPEN RED SUITCASE that Charlie placed on the floor -- THE EIGHTEEN BOTTLES OF WATER .
And as if that was n't enough to worry about here 's - BOONE ( O.S. )
Why did n't you leave me ?
Jack looks up to see BOONE standing in the opening of the tent .
We get the feeling he 's been working his way up to this confrontation all morning .
And this is the last fucking thing Jack needs .
He gets up , exits the tent -- JACK
Not now , man .
BOONE I could have made it back .
( Jack ignores him ) What ?
You 're not gonna answer me ?
I told you to leave me , man .
I told you I could 've ...
JACK
You were drowning .
And Boone can't argue that .
So -- BOONE
You should 've saved her .
Jack stands .
Gets in real close to Boone .
Something about his eyes -- something FRAYED .
But what he says , he says quite SIMPLY -- JACK
But I did n't save her .
( beat )
And neither did you .
14 ( CON T'D ) : 14 And with that , Jack pushes past him and out to -- 15 15 THE BEACH Boone is n't gonna be blown off .
Stays with Jack as he moves across the beach -- BOONE
You think you 're all noble and heroic coming after me ?
I was fine .
You 're not the only one around here who knows what to do , man .
I run a business .
Who appointed you savior ?
What gives you the right to ...
And although Boone continues his rant , his voice begins to fall away .
Because Jack is n't looking at Boone anymore ...
He 's looking over Boone 's shoulder .
Because there 's something there .
No -- SOMEONE .
OFF IN THE DISTANCE 16 16 There on the TREE LINE .
Where beach meets jungle .
The MAN IN THE SUIT and he 's wearing WHITE TENNIS SHOES .
Too far away to discern the figure 's identity .
Just standing there .
AND WE'RE BACK WITH JACK 17 17 Because he 's not taking his eyes off the man this time .
He 's already walking away from Boone -- BOONE ( shouts after him ) Hey --
Do n't you walk away from me .
Where the hell are you going ?
HEY !
But Jack is BREAKING INTO A RUN .
Eyes locked -- 18 18 ON THE TREE LINE
Where the SUITED MAN turns around , heads INTO THE JUNGLE ... 19 19 AND JACK RUNS .
Stumbles in the sand -- but immediately regains his footing .
SINGLE PURPOSE .
DESPERATE . 19 ( CON T'D ) : 19 And we follow Jack ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE BEACH until he ... 20 20 EXT .
BEACH - TREE LINE - DAY BURSTS through the tree line .
The sun immediately obscured by the JUNGLE CANOPY .
And Jack comes to an ABRUPT STOP because -- The Man In The Suit is ten yards away .
Just standing still .
His back to Jack .
Close enough to make out his GRAY HAIR .
And it 's HAND - HELD .
CREEPY .
Jack takes a few tentative steps forward .
Closing the distance ...
Jack reaches out to touch his shoulder ...
And the Man SUDDENLY TURNS !
It 's Jack 's father .
SHEPHARD .
Twenty years older .
But here .
On the island .
And the SHOCK of this -- the fact that he 's actually SEEING this -- FLOORS Jack .
His eyes go WIDE as he literally staggers backwards , TRIPS -- And lands on his ass .
His eyes never leave the fact of his father .
SO FUCKING MUCH GOING ON -- but it 's almost like Jack has regressed twenty - five years .
His voice almost childlike as he utters -- JACK Dad ?
And they LOCK EYES .
But Shephard gives Jack nothing .
He just turns around .
And heads DEEPER INTO THE JUNGLE .
And OFF JACK , eyes open wide .
FROZEN .
We -- CUT TO BLACK : END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO 21 EXT .
BEACH - TREE LINE - DAY 21 JACK is exactly where we left him .
Here where the jungle meets the beach .
And he 's just BREATHING .
Fast .
ADRENALINE still pumping with the weight of what he just saw .
Or what he THINKS he just saw .
And as we begin to CLOSE IN on Jack , we realize he's not just breathing -- he 's WHISPERING something .
Over and over and over again ...
And now we 're TIGHT enough to hear it -- JACK ( whispers ) Gone ... he 's gone ... he 's gone ...
And as we begin to HEAR THE PATTER OF RAIN ON GLASS ... 22 22 INT .
JACK'S PARENTS ' HOME - STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK MARGO ( O.S. )
He 's gone , Jack .
And we find JACK'S REFLECTION in a window begin pummelled by RAIN .
The Jack we know and love .
Same age as he is on the island ... and surprisingly , equally as RUN DOWN .
JACK
He 'll be back .
And Jack turns away from the window to face -- MARGO .
His MOTHER .
Late fifties .
A crisply put together woman .
All Blue blood .
STOIC .
MARGO
This time it 's different .
Both stand in HIS FATHER'S STUDY .
Not as imposing as it was when Jack was boy -- But THE EMPTY LEATHER CHAIR is a constant presence in every shot ...
Jack looks over a mantle of PHOTOGRAPHS -- All of SHEPHARD .
Catching a fish , receiving an award , giving a speech .
Jack reaches to pick one up -- MARGO
Please do n't touch that .
22 ( CON T'D ) : 22 But Jack picks it up anyway .
Maybe DEFIANTLY .
JACK
Ever notice there are n't any pictures of me in here ?
Or you ?
MARGO ( simply )
It 's his study .
JACK Yeah .
Jack puts the photo back .
Just the sound of the RAIN for a few beats .
Then -- MARGO I want you to bring him back .
JACK MARGO ( shaking his head )
That 's good .
Yeah .
Me. --
What ?
JACK
He has n't talked to me in two months , man .
MARGO JACK
You have n't talk to him in two months .
--
He does n't want me to bring him back .
Trust me .
Let one of his " friends " ...
MARGO
He does n't have friends anymore .
( beat ; pointed )
Why do you think that is ?
Okay .
Starting to heat up a little here .
We 're definitely dropping in on some big time FAMILY SHIT -- and we do n't need to know exactly what it is to get the main idea -- WHATEVER MADE HIS FATHER RUN OFF , JACK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT .
Jack 's eyes drop under his mother 's GLARE .
Whatever it is she 's accusing him of , part of him is OWNING IT .
Then -- MARGO
He was right about you .
And that fucking hits a nerve .
Jack 's eyes dart back up , giving her a GLARE right back -- 22 ( CON T'D ) : ( 2 ) 22 JACK
Right about what ?
MARGO
You do n't understand the pressure he was under .
You -- JACK I understand pressure .
Beat .
And Jack 's eyes begin to water .
He 's TRYING to hold it together .
We 're seeing the PAIN here ...
And damn if Margo does n't see it too .
She actually SOFTENS .
Vulnerable -- MARGO Please --
You know how he gets .
He does n't ... he wo n't take care of himself .
You have to go after him .
( beat ) Please .
A moment .
ON JACK .
And this is hard from him to say , but -- JACK I 'm sorry .
I can't .
And that vulnerability in Margo ?
It is gone in a SECOND .
MARGO " I can't ? "
You do n't get to say " I can 't . "
Not after what you did .
Was it hard ?
Betraying your own father ?
Was that a tough decision ?
Oh -- but you thought you were actually helping him , did n't you ?
But you took it all away , you ...
You ruined him .
You did this .
( as near rage as she gets )
You bring you father home , Jack .
And whatever she 's talking about -- whatever Jack " did " -- it gets him .
A low blow ... but a TRUE blow .
So finally -- JACK
Where is he ?
Beat .
MARGO Australia . 22 ( CON T'D ) : ( 3 ) 22
And as the pieces of the puzzle start to fit together .
We BLAST BACK TO -- 23 EXT .
BEACH - TREE LINE - DAY 23 JACK .
Still on his ass .
Brought out of his memory by -- VOICES behind him .
Off in the distance .
And Jack looks over his shoulder -- BACK AT THE BEACH
The CASTAWAYS milling around , doing their thing .
CHARLIE .
HURLEY .
BOONE .
Responsibility .
And now Jack turns back towards THE JUNGLE .
The way his father went .
And maybe the path of madness .
TIME TO MAKE A DECISION .
So Jack gets up .
And walks into the jungle .
SMASH CUT TO : EXT .
BEACH - DAY - LATER 24 24 WALT runs FULL TILT down the beach .
WALT HEY !
HEY !
FRANTIC .
HECTIC .
SEARCHING .
And the first person he comes upon is KATE , immediately concerned -- KATE
What 's wrong ?
WALT
That pregnant lady fell down .
Off Kate 's concerned look : 25 25 OMITTED 26 26 EXT .
MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY AREA - DAY CHAOS .
EVERYONE TALKING OVER EACH OTHER as Charlie and Michael literally CARRY Claire across the beach towards the INFIRMARY TENT .
Kate beside them -- 26 ( CON T'D ) : 26 KATE CHARLIE
What happened ? --
She just dropped ...
KATE MICHAEL
I was with her before -- the heat ...
Is she breathing ? --
Where 's the doctor ?
KATE
Let 's get her inside --
And we follow them -- INSIDE THE TENT 27 27 Michael and Charlie gently lay Claire down on the makeshift BED of SEAT CUSHIONS .
CHARLIE
She 's breathing , I think ...
Kate leans over her -- KATE Claire ?
Can you hear me ?
Claire ?
Wake up ...
And THANK FUCKING GOD because Claire 's eyes flutter open .
She looks around , confused -- CHARLIE
What ...?
KATE
Claire , it 's me -- Kate .
You passed out .
Take it easy okay ?
( turns to Charlie )
She needs water .
CHARLIE Water .
Yeah .
There 's some right ...
And Charlie turns to where the RED SUITCASE was ...
But it 's gone .
CHARLIE
What the ...?!?
27 ( CON T'D ) : 27 Charlie madly pulls away various boxes , searching the tent .
But it 's pretty clear that the suitcase is n't here .
Charlie turns back to Kate ...
CHARLIE
The water 's gone .
( furious confusion ) Someone stole it .
28 28 EXT .
BEACH - A MINUTE LATER LOCKE
Where 's the doctor ?
Find Kate talking with LOCKE and SAYID , the concern apparent on their faces , clearly filled in on the situation -- KATE I do n't know .
No one can find him .
SAYID
And this was the last of the camp 's water supply ?
KATE Yeah .
SAYID Keeping it all in one place .
Foolish .
KATE SAYID
I can go into the jungle .
Maybe find some fresh water .
--
You 're not going alone -- LOCKE
When the others find out we 're out of water , it 's gonna get ugly .
And when they find out someone pinched it , it 's gonna get uglier .
I 'll go .
Camp needs you two here .
Especially with the doctor gone .
Besides -- ( that fucking smile ) I know where to look .
And speaking of looking ... 29 29 EXT .
JUNGLE - DAY JACK moves through the jungle .
29 ( CON T'D ) : 29 This guy is literally COMING APART AT THE SEAMS .
A man possessed .
Clearly in pursuit of something and someone that could n't possibly be here .
But that 's not stopping him .
Again , we 're HAND - HELD .
DISORIENTED .
No rhyme or reason to the direction that Jack is heading .
And he comes to -- A CLEARING SURROUNDED BY DENSE JUNGLE And Jack STOPS .
Looks around him .
Has no idea where he is .
And maybe he does n't care .
But we 're starting to SLOWLY SPIN AROUND HIM -- JACK , a man more lost now than ever before .
And it starts as a whisper ...
JACK
Where are you ?
Spinning FASTER NOW .
Jack louder -- JACK
Where are you ?
And we 're getting FUCKING DIZZY we 're SPINNING SO FAST as -- JACK WHERE ARE YOU ?!?
And we SLAM INTO -- INT .
CORPORATE HOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON - FLASHBACK 30 30 THE COMPLETION OF THAT WILD SPINNING AS WE FINALLY REST ON -- JACK .
And he 's standing in the middle of a HOTEL ROOM .
Crisp .
Sharp . LIFELESS .
This place is where fancy business travellers might stay - A complete CONTRAST to the organic jungle of the island .
Jack stares at the KING - SIZED BED - It has not been slept in .
HOTEL MANAGER
The maid says he has n't used the bed in the past three days .
A YOUNG HOTEL MANAGER stands a few feet behind Jack .
He looks uncomfortable .
A clear AUSTRALIAN ACCENT .
Jack wanders around the room .
Jack picks up a DIRTY BUTTON - DOWN SHIRT neatly hanging over one of the chairs .
Runs his finger over the collar -- 30 ( CON T'D ) : 30 JACK
He rent a car through your concierge ?
HOTEL MANAGER
No , sir .
Jack puts down the shirt .
Floats over to the DESK -- A chaotic , ugly representation of his father 's STATE OF MIND .
A TORN MAGAZINE , MEDICATIONS , TICKETS , RECEIPTS , CIGARETTE PACKETS .
Jack PULLS OPEN ONE OF THE DRAWERS -- INSIDE -- THREE mostly empty bottles of SCOTCH .
Jack abruptly CLOSES the drawer .
HOTEL MANAGER
Quite honestly , Mr. Shephard , I do n't think he rented a car at all .
JACK Yeah ?
Why 's that ?
HOTEL MANAGER
There was an incident a few nights ago .
Here at the hotel bar .
I had to ask Security to escort your father to his room .
Jack turns .
Maybe a little embarrassed .
Maybe a little guilty .
But definitely a little ANGRY -- JACK
What 's that have to do with renting a car ?
HOTEL MANAGER
I 'm sorry .
I should n't have ...
JACK HOTEL MANAGER C'mon .
What 's it have to do with renting a car ? -- Mr. Shephard ... The Hotel Manager shakes his hand .
He takes a BEAT .
Then -- HOTEL MANAGER
I do n't think any rental agent in Sydney would lease your father a car in his condition .
Well .
There it is .
And Jack does not like hearing it .
NOT AT ALL .
Takes a step towards the Manager -- 30 ( CON T'D ) : ( 2 ) 30 JACK
My father ... ( holding it in but it's not fucking easy ) Is a Chief of Surgery .
The Hotel Manager quickly realizes he 's crossed the line -- HOTEL MANAGER
Of course , sir .
I apologize .
And Jack is so fucking angry he wants to pound this guy , but luckily his attention is diverted as --
He spots something on the NIGHT STAND .
A WALLET .
Jack immediately crosses to it .
Picks it up .
Opens it -- Cash .
Credit Cards .
Driver 's License .
HIS FATHER'S .
Jack settles down onto the bed -- as if the AIR has been knocked out of him .
A few moments pass .
Then ... softly -- JACK
He left his wallet .
Who leaves a wallet ?
HOTEL MANAGER
Perhaps you should talk to the police , Mr. Shephard .
The Manager remains awkwardly in the center of the room , but we 're MOVING IN ON JACK -- his eyes full of DESPERATION .
As he whispers softly to himself -- JACK
Where are you ?
WE BLAST BACK OUT INTO -- 31 31 EXT .
JUNGLE - DAY COMPLETE SILENCE .
Jack stands frozen in the middle of the CLEARING where we left him .
Eerie .
No insects .
No birds .
NOTHING .
Just the sound of his own BREATHING .
And maybe it 's just that Jack is literally at the end of his fucking tether , but it 's almost like we can FEEL A PRESENCE here .
And Jack STOPS breathing because he hears something .
THE CLINK OF ICE CUBES INSIDE A GLASS .
And it 's fucking CLOSE .
Jack WHIPS AROUND -- 31 ( CON T'D ) : 31 Nothing there .
But then the CRACK OF A TWIG snapping brings his attention back to -- THE SURROUNDING JUNGLE And Jack can just make out SOMEONE RUNNING THROUGH IT -- The Man in the suit and white tennis shoes .
HIS FATHER .
JACK Wait !
And a new look of DETERMINATION falls over Jack 's eyes .
Enough of this bullshit .
ENOUGH .
He 's gonna catch him this time .
He has to .
So Jack cuts through the jungle , just catching GLIMPSES of his father up ahead -- always far off , just out of reach .
Jack pushes massive LEAVES aside -- and we 're SO CLOSE on him we lose perspective because Jack RUNS with such drive and such purpose -- GAINING now , about to finally CATCH UP when -- 32 32 THE GROUND GIVES WAY .
JACK FALLS FORWARD down an INCLINE -- FALLS ON HIS ASS -- SCRAMBLING -- SLIDING --
Tries to STOP HIMSELF with his feet but he 's moving too fast and ...
OH SHIT --
He 's flying off A ROCK SHELF and -- A ROOT is all that saves him as his body goes over and his LEGS KICK AT AIR because ...
Jack is hanging off the EDGE OF A CLIFF .
A hundred foot drop to the ground .
Out here .
ALONE .
And as we realize he 's totally FUCKED ...
END OF ACT TWO ACT THREE 33 EXT .
CLIFF FACE - DAY 33 Jack right where we left him -- CLINGING TO THE CLIFF FACE -- his grip slipping .
And we wanna milk this .
Our guy .
Our hero .
Literally facing DEATH and there is NO WAY he can escape it .
Jack tries to wedge his foot amongst some rocks , but they 're LOOSE and ...
THE ROOT he 's holding on to is PULLING FREE and --- GRIM RECOGNITION falls over Jack's WATERING EYES .
He 's going to die here .
Here on this fucking island --
And just as the root is about to POP OUT OF THE CLIFF FACE -- VOICE ( O.S. )
Take my hand .
And Jack instinctively looks up at the SOUND OF THAT VOICE -- It 's LOCKE .
Lying on his belly , extending his arm over the EDGE -- And Jack barely registers the relief of seeing him before he SLAPS his free hand into Locke 's outstretched one just as the ROOT COMES FREE , tumbles down into the abyss as -- Locke GRUNTS , pulling Jack up and over the edge to SAFETY .
Jack immediately rolls over , STARES up at the sky .
Quick shallow breaths .
Borderline HYPERVENTILATION .
LOCKE
You okay ?
Jack just nods .
Because he 's not hyperventilating at all .
He 's LAUGHING .
Louder now .
Hysterically .
And okay , maybe it's a little insane , but this is what happens when you 've been in a plane crash and have n't slept and you 're chasing your father through the jungle and you almost fucking die .
And as Locke looks on , starting to chuckle himself -- 34 OMITTED 34 35 35 INT .
INFIRMARY TENT - LATE AFTERNOON
We find CLAIRE inside the shade of the infirmary tent .
She NAPS ... not looking too hot .
PALE . 35 ( CON T'D ) : 35 CHARLIE ( O.S. )
Hey ...
Claire 's eyes flutter open to see CHARLIE settling down next to her .
CLAIRE ( disoriented )
Hey .
How long have I ...?
CHARLIE Couple hours .
Here -- it 's not much , but it's what we have .
Charlie offers her a small THERMOS CUP -- A little liquid splashes inside .
Claire takes a grateful SIP -- CLAIRE I should get up ...
NO SHE SHOULDN'T because another wave of DIZZINESS falls over her .
Charlie immediately SUPPORTS her , nurturing instinct -- CHARLIE
You just relax , yeah ?
( smiles )
Got to think about the little one .
The dizziness passes as Claire eases back down on the cushions -- CLAIRE
Thanks for the water .
CHARLIE Yeah .
A whole swallow .
( somewhat darkly )
There 'd be more if some git had n't nicked it .
CLAIRE Is Jack back yet ?
CHARLIE No .
No one 's seen him .
( seeing her concern )
Do n't worry though -- good ole '
Mr. Locke 's gone into the jungle to get you some water .
Should be back before nightfall .
35 ( CON T'D ) : ( 2 ) 35 CLAIRE Great .
Our only hunter 's gonna get eaten so that he can get the pregnant girl some more water .
CHARLIE I would n't worry , love .
( smiles conspiratorially )
You tell me who'd you rather meet in a dark alley -- whatever 's out there , or that geezer and his four hundred knives ?
Claire actually begins to GIGGLE -- CHARLIE Seriously .
Who packs four hundred knives ?
Personally ?
I only have room for two hundred .
Three hundred , the most .
The two share a nice LAUGH .
A real moment -- And then Claire becomes serious .
Contemplative -- CLAIRE
When are they going to find us ?
The rescuers ?
Beat .
CHARLIE Soon .
CLAIRE ( smiles )
Thanks , Charlie .
CHARLIE
Thanks for what ?
CLAIRE
People do n't look me in the eye here .
I think I scare them .
The baby ... ( searching for the words )
I 'm like this time bomb of responsibility waiting to go off .
Charlie considers this .
Then -- CHARLIE
You do n't scare me .
35 ( CON T'D ) : ( 3 ) 35 And off this genuinely sweet MOMENT ... 36 36 EXT .
BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON A STUNNING SUNSET throws magical light across the camp as various fires are lit - Night is falling .
36 ( CON T'D ) : 36 And we pick up SHANNON as she approaches BOONE , sitting at the edge of the ocean .
That same mix of contemplation and anger in his eyes .
SHANNON Hey , Superman -- still moping ?
Boone just keeps looking out at the water ...
SHANNON Boone ?
And Shannon actually sheds the bitch persona for a moment .
Maybe actually displaying GENUINE CONCERN -- SHANNON
It 's not your fault that ...
BOONE
Go away , Shannon .
And when she gets shut down , she snaps back into purely defensive mode .
PISSED -- SHANNON
Nice talking to you , jackass .
And Shannon STALKS off , passing -- HURLEY .
A little out of breath .
Obviously excited about something .
We PICK HIM UP as he hurries over to -- KATE AND SAYID .
They look up expectantly -- HURLEY
The Chinese people have water .
37 37 EXT .
BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON CLOSE ON AN EMPTY OCEANIC WATER BOTTLE -- just like the ones we saw in the RED SUITCASE .
PULL BACK to find -- SAYID
Where did you get this ?
Kate and Sayid confront SUN outside her makeshift Lean - To. Sayid is amped -- SAYID KATE
Where .
Did. You -- --
She does n't understand you , Sayid ... 37 ( CON T'D ) : 37 SAYID
She understands me .
( back to Sun ) Did you steal this water ?
SUN just looks at them nervously , speaks softly in KOREAN ( no subtitles here -- not when ENGLISH SPEAKERS are around ) -- SUN
This is a misunderstanding ...
And that 's when JIN arrives .
Head full of steam -- IMMEDIATELY GETS BETWEEN SAYID AND HIS WIFE -- PROTECTIVE -- JIN
Get away from her , pig !
If you touch my wife ..
Kate gets into the fray , ever the peacemaker -- KATE Easy .
Let 's just talk about this , all right ?
Sayid steps back , raises his hands in frustration , stares daggers at JIN .
Kate holds up the water bottle to Jin.
Points to it .
KATE
Is this yours ?
Jin stares at her blankly .
KATE
Who gave you this ?
And " WHO " is a word that Jin does understand , because his immediate ( albeit defiant ) reaction is to POINT DOWN THE BEACH .
Kate and Sayid turn to see -- 38 38 OFF NEAR THE FUSELAGE SAWYER .
Smoking a cigarette .
Completely oblivious to the fact that he 's just been picked out of a lineup .
BACK WITH KATE AND SAYID KATE Sonofa ... ( CON T'D ) : And Kate is set to rip Sawyer 's fucking head off , but ...
Sayid grabs her arm .
SAYID I do n't see the water .
KATE So ?
SAYID
You go after him now , he 'll give you nothing .
But if you wait ... ( beat ) A rat will always lead you to its hole .
And OFF KATE , knowing he 's right but not happy about it .
And as NIGHT finally falls on the BEACH ... EXT .
JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON 40 40 MACRO CLOSE ON A SINGLE DROPLET OF WATER suspended on a BANYAN LEAF .
And as the leaf tips , we watch that DROPLET slide down its surface and into -- 41 41 AN OCEANIC BOTTLE .
PULL BACK to find the bottle in the hand of Locke .
It 's barely a quarter full , but that 's what happens when you do it one drop at a time -- JACK sits on a rock .
Staring into the jungle .
And we get the feeling that Locke has just been letting him sit , too .
Something we should note about these two --
They can talk .
Kindred spirits .
Mutual respect .
Finally -- JACK
How are they ?
The others .
LOCKE
They 're thirsty .
Hungry .
Waiting to be rescued .
( then ; pointed )
And they need someone to tell them what to do .
Jack stiffens .
And this is an instinct .
A FEAR .
JACK Me ? I can't -- 41 ( CON T'D ) : 41 LOCKE
Why can't you ?
That 's really the question , is n't it ?
And maybe Jack has never spoken the words aloud before , but when he does , we know he believes them -- JACK Because I 'm not a leader .
LOCKE
And yet they all treat you like one .
Hm .
Hates that he 's right .
Jack knows he 's right .
JACK I do n't know how to help them .
I 'll fail , I 'll ... ( then ; quietly ) I do n't have what it takes .
And in this moment -- his father 's words travelling twenty years to find themselves coming out of his mouth -- we know that despite his own instinctual heroism , Jack BELIEVES this .
Locke nods .
Twists the cap on the bottle as he settles down across from Jack -- LOCKE
Why are you out here , Jack ?
JACK I think I 'm going crazy .
LOCKE
You 're not going crazy .
JACK No ?
LOCKE
Crazy people do n't know they 're going crazy .
They think they 're getting saner .
( smiles ; again now )
So why are you out here , Jack ?
And something about Locke -- Something HYPNOTIC about the way his eyes dance ... makes Jack open up the him -- 41 ( CON T'D ) : ( 2 ) 41 JACK I 'm chasing something .
( beat ) Someone .
LOCKE Ah. The White Rabbit . ( off Jack 's confusion ) Alice in Wonderland .
JACK Yeah , Wonderland .
Because who I 'm chasing ?
He 's not here .
LOCKE
But you see him .
JACK Yes .
But he 's not here .
LOCKE
And if I came to you saying the same thing , what would your explanation be ?
As a doctor ?
JACK ( diagnosis mode )
I 'd call it a hallucination .
Result of dehydration .
Post Traumatic Stress .
Not having slept more than two hours a night for the last week .
All of the above .
LOCKE
All right , then .
You 're hallucinating .
( beat )
But what if you 're not ?
Jack masks his fear of exactly that with a nervous laugh -- JACK
Then we 're all in a lot of trouble .
And now we begin to PUSH IN on Locke .
A man who knows of what he speaks , and what he speaks of is fucking SCARY -- LOCKE I 'm an ordinary man , Jack .
Meat and potatoes .
I live in the real world .
Not a big believer in " magic . " ( MOR E ) 41 ( CON T'D ) : ( 3 ) 41 LOC KE ( cont'd ) ( beat )
But this place is different .
Special .
The others ... they do n't want to talk about it because it scares them .
But we all know it .
We all feel it .
Is your white rabbit a hallucination ?
Probably .
( beat , here it is )
But what if everything that happened here happened for a reason ?
What if that someone you 're chasing is really here ?
41 ( CON T'D ) : ( 4 ) 41 JACK
That 's impossible .
LOCKE
Even if it is , let 's say it 's not .
And Jack is practically in a trance ... because part of him believes exactly THAT .
Softly -- JACK
Then what happens if I catch him ?
LOCKE I do n't know --
But , I 've looked into the eye of this island .
And what I saw ? ( beat )
It was beautiful .
And with that , Locke stands up .
Runs his hands down his legs , maybe to get the dirt off -- or maybe just because he likes to touch them -- and picks up his pack .
JACK Wait --
Where are you --?
LOCKE
Someone needs this water back at the beach .
JACK ( standing ) I 'll come with you .
LOCKE No .
You need to finish what you started .
And hoping Locke might actually have the ANSWER -- JACK
Why ?
LOST " White Rabbit " ( PINK ) 8/9/04 42 . 41 ( CON T'D ) : ( 5 ) 41 LOCKE
Because a leader can't lead until he know 's where he 's going .
And with that , Locke melts back into the jungle .
OFF JACK , looking after him -- a lot to think about ...
42 42 EXT .
BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON
And SOMEONE ELSE is moving briskly through the late day .
Crossing the SAND of the beach this person slips into ...
THE TREE LINE -- 43 43 And a PATCH OF DENSE FOLIAGE .
A HAND reaches in , pushes the LEAVES aside to reveal -- THREE SUITCASES .
The hider of this STASH is of course -- SAWYER .
And we 're close on him as he POPS OPEN one of the suitcases revealing an array of goodies - SUNTAN LOTION , BUG SPRAY , CANDY , CIGARETTES , LIGHTERS , MEDICINE , ALCOHOL ...
And as he reaches for a pack of the SMOKES ...
The CRACK of a twig behind him !
SPINS AROUND in time to see - 44 44 KATE RUSHING HIM .
It 's a flat - out fucking TACKLE and this girl really fucking knows what she 's doing because in a matter of seconds --
She 's PINNED Sawyer -- her KNEES pressing hard into his shoulders -- a provocative position under any other set of circumstances .
As soon as Sawyer recognizes his attacker -- SAWYER
It 's about time .
KATE ( fierce )
About time for what ?
SAWYER
I made this birthday wish four years ago .
Kate 's eyes BURN as SAYID emerges from the jungle -- SAYID Does he have it ?
LOST " White Rabbit " ( PINK ) 8/9/04 43 . 44 ( CON T'D ) : 44 SAWYER KATE
What ?
You two follow me out here ?
I wanna see a warrant ! --
Where 's the water , you -- And Sawyer suddenly PUSHES UP , TWISTS -- ROLLS OVER -- and now he 's pinning Kate down -- He GRINS , out of breath -- SAWYER
That 's better .
KATE --
Get off me ...
But Sayid is already there , PULLS Sawyer up , PUSHES him --
Fed up with the cutesy bullshit -- SAYID
Give the water to us now .
SAWYER ( pissed )
Touch me again .
Kate gets up , moves to the SUITCASES .
Pulls them open -- More BOOZE , SMOKES , ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT -- But NO WATER -- SAWYER
You really think I stole your damn water ?
SAYID
We know you gave two bottles to the Korean couple ...
Sawyer takes a step forward -- gets in Sayid 's FACE -- SAWYER I do n't give nothin ' to nobody .
KATE
It 's not here .
SAWYER ( real slow so Sayid can understand ) I traded Mr. Miyagi the last water I had for a fish he caught -- we worked it out caveman - style .
KATE ( skeptical )
You gave up your last two bottles ?
LOST " White Rabbit " ( PINK ) 8/9/04 43A. 44 ( CON T'D ) : ( 2 ) 44 SAWYER
Water has no value , Freckles -- it 's gonna rain sooner or later .
( MOR E ) 44 ( CON T'D ) : ( 3 ) 44 SAW YER ( cont'd ) ( smiles )
And hell , I 'm an optimist .
And there 's something about him -- despite the fucking bravado -- that makes it instantly clear that Sawyer is absolutely INNOCENT .
He 's telling the truth .
So they 're back to square one .
And still without water .
Sayid turns to Kate -- SAYID
Come on , let 's go .
Sayid starts back into the jungle as Kate levels Sawyer with a look .
He just SMILES .
Kate shakes her head , goes to follow Sayid when -- SAWYER Hey .
You forgot something .
Kate turns as Sawyer tosses her a large LEATHER WALLET .
Kate is confused ... but FLIPS IT OPEN TO REVEAL -- IT 'S THE MARSHAL'S BADGE .
SAWYER
Seeing as you 're the sheriff now , might as well make it official .
Ah. The IRONY .
But Kate KEEPS the badge .
Slides it into her pocket as she heads back to the beach .
Sawyer watches her go , pops a smoke into his mouth .
And as the FLAME flicks from his lighter -- 45 45 EXT .
JUNGLE - NIGHT
We 're deep in a small CAMPFIRE .
PULLING OUT OF IT TO FIND -- JACK .
Alone .
Staring into the fire .
And he's in that zone of non-sleep where he is actually HYPER - AWAKE .
And there is something about these flames that is familiar to him .
And as Jack looks deeply into them -- 46 46 INT .
HALLWAY - RECEPTION - NIGHT - FLASHBACK FLAMES flicker in BLACK & WHITE .
PULL OUT to find them on a small TELEVISION .
We 're watching a local NEWS BRAODCAST .
JACK sits in a small chair in a spartan HALLWAY , watching the wall - mounted TV -- 46 ( CON T'D ) : 46 AUSTRALIAN NEWSCASTER ( O.S. )
And wildfires continue to burn just outside Melbourne .
While local crews coordinate their efforts , an arson investigation is underway ...
And the NEWSCAST is interrupted as Jack looks up to see -- DOCTOR ( O.S. ) Mr. Shephard ?
Will you follow me , please ?
A Middle - Eastern MAN in a white lab coat -- looks like a DOCTOR .
And although we 're not entirely sure why yet , Jack 's eyes make it clear -- he does not want to follow this man .
Not at ALL .
INT .
HALLWAY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 47 47 JACK and THE DOCTOR walk along the corridor .
This place is depressing - FLICKERING FLUORESCENT LIGHTS .
WORN PAINT JOB .
DOCTOR
There are ways we can make it easier for you .
We can take a photograph if you 'd prefer ...
JACK No . I want to see him .
The The two reach THREE STAINLESS STEEL DOORS -- FREEZERS .
Doctor pulls open the middle one .
ON JACK , as he follows the Doctor -- A48 A48 INSIDE .
A GURNEY waits .
ON IT , A BODYBAG .
The Doctor looks at Jack one last time .
Then slowly , he pulls down the bag 's zipper , revealing the body inside , and of course it 's-- JACK'S FATHER .
Just as he 's appeared on the island .
Gray haired .
Sixties .
And completely lifeless .
A48 ( CON T'D ) : A48 JACK
That 's him .
LOST " White Rabbit " ( PINK ) 8/9/04 46 . A48 ( CON T'D ) : ( 2 ) A48 DOCTOR I 'm very sorry .
JACK
What happened ?
DOCTOR JACK ( sympathetic )
It 's probably best not to --
What happened ?
know the details , Mr ...
And as the Doctor begins to speak , we HOLD ON JACK -- PUSHING IN as every second brings more emotion .
A deeper sense of pain and loss .
And it is fucking DEVASTATING to watch .
DOCTOR ( O.S. )
The police found him in an alley in Kings Cross .
There was no identification , so they brought him here .
Our tox screen showed a blood alcohol content ... which for a man of his size would most likely have brought on myocardial infarction -- a sizeable and fatal heart attack .
( best bedside manner )
If it 's any consolation , it was painless .
And now we are RIGHT UP on Jack 's EYES .
And in this , the single most devastating moment of his life , the last word that comes to mind is " painless . "
And as a SINGLE TEAR drops from his eye ... EXT .
JUNGLE - NIGHT
We find that same tear sliding down his cheek back at the CAMPFIRE .
And Jack is snapped out of this quiet repose by -- THAT SOUND .
Ice cubes in a glass .
Jack immediately LEAPS TO HIS FEET .
Something moving through the JUNGLE beyond the fire .
Maybe we can just make out the WHITE TENNIS SHOES ...
And Jack is way beyond rational now as he PULLS A PIECE OF WOOD FROM THE FIRE -- a makeshift TORCH --
And he moves into the moonlight - dappled jungle -- Almost like he 's SLEEPWALKING -- following what just might be a GHOST -- And he soon comes to a NATURAL STONE ARCHWAY .
( CON T'D ) : Jack pauses -- a sense of whatever lies beyond -- but it's too fucking late to turn back now -- his journey almost at its inevitable conclusion ...
So he moves through the archway .
AND for the first time we enter our SET ... 49 49 INT .
THE VALLEY - NIGHT MOONLIGHT pierces through the obscured ceiling of this caved - in VALLEY , lighting Jack 's way --
And his father is nowhere to be seen .
But Jack hears the sound of TRICKLING WATER .
Drawn to it --
And here 's a WALL OF WATER dripping into a SHALLOW POOL .
Jack approaches -- looks into it and --
There 's a small , pale FACE shimmering under the surface .
But Jack seems more confused than scared as he reaches into the water and pulls out -- A CHINA FACED DOLL -- blonde hair , floral dress .
Jack lays the doll down , walks deeper into THE VALLEY , his torchlight illuminating the openings of a series of CAVES ...
And there are more dolls .
MANY MORE .
A TRAIL of them .
Jack follows it , raising his flaming torch as he finally comes to the source -- A SMASHED CRATE .
And right next to it -- A fallen fifteen foot - long section of WRECKAGE from our place .
The OCEANIC LOGO PROMINENT .
All around this area of the valley ; scattered pieces of LUGGAGE .
OF CARGO .
Jack looking it over ...
And then he FREEZES .
Because there , at the edge of a cave , trapped partially under a piece of wreckage is what looks like a LARGE BOX .
And Jack is drawn to it .
THIS is why he 's been led here .
THIS is what he 's supposed to find .
Yeah .
It 's a COFFIN .
END OF ACT THREE ACT FOUR 50 INT .
THE VALLEY - NIGHT 50 Jack stands right where we left him , in this moonlit cave - like VALLEY .
And he 's just FIXATED on that banged - up but surprisingly intact SIMPLE WOODEN CASKET which lies FACE DOWN in the dirt .
And this time , it 's not Jack that we PUSH INTO , but that coffin as we hear the sound of a PLANE TAKING OFF and -- INT .
SYDNEY AIRPORT - DAY - FLASHBACK 51 51 We 're in SYDNEY AIRPORT .
And here 's Jack .
Wearing the very same SUIT we saw him wearing in the Pilot .
He stands at the OCEANIC CUSTOMER SERVICE COUNTER .
And he is fucking losing it .
JACK
What do you mean you wo n't put it on the plane ?
A FEMALE AUSTRALIAN TICKET AGENT looks back at him -- TICKET AGENT I 'm sorry , Mr. Shephard , but our policy is that the body must have the proper documentation if we 're to put it on board .
I 'm afraid there 's no latitude to ...
JACK TICKET AGENT
No latitude ?
No latitude ?
--
Without the proper documents ...
JACK TICKET AGENT
You can't do this to me .
I 'm read to go now ... --
Sir , perhaps another carrier may ... JACK ( enough ) NO !
And he fucking SHOUTED THAT .
People standing around actually look over , nervously .
But Jack could care less .
He leans in to the DESK ATTENDANT , eyes burning -- 51 ( CON T'D ) : 51 JACK I want you to listen to me , okay ?
Because I 'm asking you a favor ... ( reads her name - tag ) " Chrissy ? "
I am standing in front of you wearing the same suit I 'm wearing to my father 's funeral and I 'm asking you a favor .
( beat )
In sixteen hours I need to land in LAX .
And I need that coffin to clear customs because there is going to be a hearse waiting there .
And that hearse needs to take me and that coffin to a cemetery .
Why , Chrissy ?
Why can't I just land and bring him to a funeral home and make all the arrangements there ?
Why can't I really take my time with it ?
Because I need it to be done .
I need it to be over .
And Jack suddenly realizes he 's YELLING .
Stops .
Pulls himself together .
But his eyes are watering .
And this is said softly , but not without desperation -- JACK I just need to bury my father .
And Chrissy is actually MOVED by this .
Affected by Jack 's pure emotion .
So after a beat , she NODS -- TICKET AGENT
Let me see what I can do , sir .
And as Jack finally registers some sense of RELIEF ... 52 52 INT .
THE VALLEY - NIGHT
We 're back on the island .
In this valley .
And Jack looks down at what we now know to be his FATHER'S CASKET .
Neither one of them made it to Los Angeles .
But Jack has found it .
Been led to it .
So now , finally , he 'll get to bury his father himself .
And as much as we do n't want him to do it , we have to WATCH HIM as he carefully slips his hand under the casket .
52 ( CON T'D ) : 52 Jack squats -- then with great STRAIN he manages to LIFT IT UP - pushing it on to its side -- but OH FUCK -- the lid FLIPS OPEN !
BUT THE COFFIN IS EMPTY .
Jack is confused .
Devastated .
And then , ultimately -- DEPRIVED .
Maybe the body fell out in the crash -- maybe it 's still out there in the jungle -- or maybe ...
But none of that matters now .
Because all of this pressure , this anxiety , this fucking situation is all so UNFAIR .
And that translates to pure RAGE for Jack ... ANGER at not being able to put this behind him ... and ANGER at his father for haunting him , even here ...
And Jack 's pulling a METAL ROD from the wreckage , raising it over his hand and he -- SMASHES the coffin .
Over and over .
Into fucking splinters .
And as we PULL BACK , leaving Jack to resolve his demons the only way he knows how ...
EXT .
BEACH - MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY AREA - NIGHT 53 53 We QUIETLY MOVE towards the INFIRMARY TENT -- the sense that this is the POINT OF VIEW of someone as we MOVE THROUGH THE PLASTIC FLAP AND INSIDE TO FIND -- 54 54 INT .
INFIRMARY TENT - NIGHT CLAIRE as she lies asleep .
She 's alone .
We 're looking down at her .
No -- SOMEONE'S LOOKING DOWN AT HER and ...
A bottle of WATER is brought to her chapped lips .
Claire 's eyes flicker open as the cool liquid flows into her mouth .
Someone has come to her rescue !
And Claire looks up to see her benefactor is ...
BOONE ?
He offers an awkward smile -- screws the cap on the remainder of the bottle , places another FULL ONE by her side ...
CLAIRE BOONE
How did you ...? -- Shhhh. 54 ( CON T'D ) : 54 And we do n't get much of a chance to put this all together because a VOICE from the entrance of the tent snaps us out of this quiet moment -- VOICE ( O.S. )
Where did you get that ?!
WHIP AROUND TO REVEAL -- CHARLIE .
And he ain't happy .
EXT .
BEACH - NIGHT BOONE takes a full face - plant into the SAND .
CHARLIE
Here 's your thief .
We 're out on the BEACH .
Charlie ( that old DARKNESS in full effect ) is surrounded by Michael , Hurley , Sun , Jin , Walt , Sawyer -- a few of the other survivors -- MICHAEL
Where 'd he hide it ?!
CHARLIE Dunno -- but this wanker had three bottles on him .
( to Boone ) Why 'd you do it , Pretty Boy ?
Eh? HAND - HELD .
CHAOTIC .
SCARY .
MOB MENTALITY EMERGING .
Boone surrounded on all sides , scrambles to his feet -- PANICKED -- BOONE I did n't think ...
You just left it in the tent .
And he ...
Jack just took off .
CHARLIE BOONE
Claire could 've died . --
I tried to give her some sooner but it got out of hand .
Nobody would 've understood ... CHARLIE ( to the others ) I say we throw him in the jungle and see what happens .
SHANNON runs up -- locks eyes with Boone --
No fucking idea what to do ... ( CON T'D ) : KATE & SAYID are right behind her -- KATE
What 's going on ...?
SAWYER ( nods to Boone ) Guess you got your thief .
Boone pleads to Kate -- maybe she 'll understand ...
BOONE CHARLIE
I was trying to help !
Someone needed to take responsibility .
It never -- Oh SHUT IT !
would have lasted unless ...
SLAM !
Boone goes flying into the sand again .
And it 's out of control .
Six days on the island .
The stress .
The frustration .
The situation .
This is the very worst of human nature because --
The fucking MOB wants blood .
Charlie ROUGHLY pulls Boone back up --
Pushes him into what feels like a tightly constricting CIRCLE -- And as Boone looks around at all these angry faces ... these people who might just TEAR HIM LIMB FROM LIMB -- VOICE ( O.S. ) LEAVE HIM ALONE .
And everything just STOPS .
We 're ON KATE as she turns towards the sound of that powerful voice .
And thank fucking God ... IT 'S JACK .
57 57 And he might still be unshaven .
He might be fucking exhausted .
But there is a LIGHT in his eyes now .
The same light in his eyes when he got his ass kicked on the playground twenty years ago .
And they 're ALL just staring at him .
He starts quietly at first -- 57 ( CON T'D ) : 57 JACK
It 's been six days and we 're all still waiting .
Still waiting for them to come .
( beat )
But what if they do n't ?
Jack steps forward -- engaging each person one at a time as he speaks .
Powerful .
Charismatic .
FEARLESS ... JACK
We have to stop waiting .
We need to start figuring things out .
A woman died this morning because she went for a morning swim .
( points to Boone )
He tried to save her life and now you 're about to crucify him because he took some water ?
Charlie drops his eyes -- JACK
We can't do this .
We can't just hope it 'll figure itself out .
It 's time to start organizing .
We need to figure out how we 're going to survive .
I found water -- fresh water in the valley .
I 'll take a group in at first light .
You do n't want to come ?
Then you find another way to contribute because " every man for himself " is n't gonna work anymore , people .
Last week , most of us were strangers .
But now we 're all here .
And God knows how long we 're gonna be here , but ... ( beat )
If we can't live together , we 're gonna die alone .
And as we see them -- ALL of them -- just looking at Jack .
Looking UP to him .
And yeah , there 's gonna be some bumps along the way , but it 's pretty fucking clear --
We 've just witnessed the birth of a LEADER .
CUT TO BLACK : END OF ACT FOUR ACT FIVE 58 EXT .
BEACH - NIGHT 58
And once again , CALM has come to the beach .
CHARLIE & HURLEY
Walk amongst the castaways with the RED SUITCASE -- doling out HALF - CUPS of water to the SURVIVORS as we FIND -- SUN & JIN 59 59 Sun looks at her husband as he builds them a SMALL FIRE .
SUN
Thank you .
( beat )
For getting me water today .
Jin pauses for a moment .
Looks at his wife .
Then , as simple as it is touching -- JIN
That 's what husbands do .
And now , we FLOAT OVER to -- MICHAEL & WALT 60 60 Michael watches his son sleeping .
Has his half - cup of water , but his kid 's fine .
Not worth waking him up for .
So instead , he gives his water to VINCENT .
As the dog laps it up appreciatively , we FIND -- 61 61 BOONE Sits away from the camp , ALONE .
Spared a beating , but a pariah nonetheless .
SAWYER ( O.S. )
How 's it feel ?
Boone looks up to see Sawyer .
BOONE
How 's what feel ?
SAWYER
Taking my place at the top of everyone 's most hated list .
61 ( CON T'D ) : 61 Boone just looks at him .
SAWYER Yeah .
Sucks , do n't it ?
And as Sawyer strides off to wherever it is he strides off to , we leave Boone to FIND -- JACK
He sits at a small FIRE close to the ocean .
Kate settles down next to him , hands him a cup of WATER -- JACK
Thanks .
A few beats pass as they take in the night ocean together .
KATE
Where were you today , Jack ?
JACK
Just taking care of some things .
As always , not much has to be said between these two .
In some kind of cosmic way , they just GET each other .
KATE
That 's all I 'm gonna get , huh ?
A few more beats pass .
Then -- JACK
My father died .
In Sydney .
Kate reacts -- surprised ... but instantly sympathetic .
KATE I 'm sorry .
Jack nods .
His eyes watering with the intensity of his day .
Watering with the closure he will not get .
JACK Yeah .
I 'm sorry , too .
And as the two of them sit there in this moment of quiet simplicity ...
FADE TO BLACK .

Spending cuts in Britain worst since World War II
By Chris Talbot
28 June 2010
After detailed examination of the UK coalition budget measures , the Institute for Fiscal Studies ( IFS ) said the country faces the “ longest , deepest , sustained period of cuts to public services spending at least since World War II ” .
It is the first time that a British government has proposed six consecutive years of spending cuts .
The IFS refuted the Conservative - Liberal Democrat government ’s rhetoric that the rich would “ feel more pain ” than the poor , stating , “ If you look at reforms due to be introduced in 2013 and 2014 , they hit the poorest hardest and indeed keep on hitting them more and more every year ” .
Furthermore , IFS states , “ looming cuts to public services ... are likely to hit poorer households significantly harder than richer households ” .
As experts worked through the implications of the fine print contained in the Treasury Red Book that sets out the details of the budget , it became clear that more than one million people face eviction from their homes .
Some 900,000 people in private rented accommodation will lose their housing benefit under Chancellor George Osborne ’s plan to cut housing allowance by 40 percent .
Hundreds of thousands of people who rent homes from local authorities and housing associations will be forced out of family - sized properties under the benefit changes .
A total of three million people will be affected by the housing benefit changes .
Conservative estimates suggest that 725,000 jobs will be lost in the public sector over the next five years .
Another 200,000 people are likely to lose their jobs as a result of the rise in VAT .
The current official jobless total stands at 2.51 million , or 8 percent of the workforce .
The government ’s measures will add at least another million to that figure .
The real total of unemployed and underemployed is considerably higher .
More than one million are currently in part - time employment because they are unable to find full - time work .
Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal - Democrat leader Nick Clegg told the BBC ’s Today programme that the government had been forced to take tough decisions because of the international economic situation .
“ We ’ve got this sort of economic fire - storm on our doorstep in Europe , where the markets are putting huge pressure on one country after the next , knocking on the door in Greece , in Spain , in Portugal , and so on .
There ’s a real worry that if we do n’t take action now we will be the next victim , if you like , of that kind of market panic ” .
Shadow Chancellor Alistair Darling has criticised the coalition ’s budget , warning that it risks pushing the UK into a double - dip recession and claiming Labour would not have made such drastic cuts .
The truth is that many of the cuts were already in train when the coalition came to power .
Labour planned a 20 percent across - the - board cut .
Some 70 percent of the fiscal consolidation measures had already been identified by Labour .
Had they been returned to power , Labour would have extended their proposed cuts to satisfy the financial elite .
Markets responded favourably , as the full impact of the coalition ’s budget measures were grasped .
Moody ’s , the rating agency , confirmed the government ’s AAA status and declared that the budget was a “ key step towards reversing the significant deterioration in the Government ’s financial position that occurred over the past two years ” .
The bond markets were pleased with the budget .
The yield on 10 - year gilts fell two basis points to 3.43 percent .
The reason for the markets ’ confidence is the sheer scale of the cuts .
While Osborne spoke of a 25 percent cut for every government department , the real level of cuts is likely to be 33 percent , according to the IFS .
“ Margaret Thatcher , famous , or infamous , for her eagerness to take an axe to the big state , never dared to cut so deep ” , Philip Stephens commented in the Financial Times .
As Martin Wolf points out , also in the Financial Times , that means one third from higher education , the home office , justice , transport and housing .
It is , he writes , “ unlikely to prove politically sustainable … .
It is also evident that further cuts to benefits will be needed .
According to the IFS , the cuts for the other departments would ‘ only ’ be 25 percent , in real terms , if the government could identify another £ 13bn in cuts to benefits ” .
These will come in the autumn spending review and in the reviews of public sector pensions and public sector jobs that are under way .
The Bagehot column in the Economist sounded a warning note about the cuts still to come and the reaction they will elicit :
“ Behind Mr Osborne ’s lofty ratio between spending cuts and tax rises , there are human beings .
Lots now know they will have to pay up , but many of those who will pay the most — i.e. , with their jobs — do not , yet .
When , in an authoritarian country , swathes of the population are given up to invaders or sacrificed in battle , there is n’t much the victims can do to trouble the commissars .
In Britain , there is : they can vote , of course , but also march through London , cripple the country with strikes , even riot ” .
A woman who thought she already was an ex-Mormon blogs about her efforts to officially leave the church .
Weird , I thought while laughing .
I wonder how they found me ...
But then , less than six months later , I received more LDS visitors .
Again , they asked for me by name , again they introduced themselves , and again they noted that I had n't attended church for a while .
I said that I was not a practicing Mormon , and they left .
Years went by .
I moved to different cities , got married , got divorced , moved again ...
And they always found me .
Within 2 - 3 months of moving to a new place , the Mormons would show up at my door ....
With each visit , I always explained ( while matching their politeness with my own ) , " I 'm no longer a Mormon .
I 'm never going back to church .
Sorry . "
Then one night , I was visited by an evil being .
Okay , she was n't really evil .
But she was certainly grumpy .
It was the visiting teacher for my new neighborhood .
Here we go again , I thought .
I opened the door and politely gave my I 'm - not - a - Mormon spiel .
" Yes , you are , " she replied .
" Excuse me ? "
" You were baptized , so you are still a Mormon . "
" I 'm not a Mormon if I stop practicing . "
" You are in our records as being a member of the LDS church . "
" That 's ridiculous . "
" Like it or not , you ca n't just quit . "
Rand Paul : Civil Rights Act Is “ Settled Law ” 
Doug Mataconis · · 27 comments
Two more statements this morning from Kentucky Republican Senate candidate Rand Paul that serve to clarify the kerfuffle that arose yesterday over his statements regarding the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
First , Paul was on Laura Ingraham ’s radio show this morning and said that he considered the matter to be settled law :
Kentucky Senate candidate Rand Paul acknowledged Thursday that the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 was necessary to foster racial integration , a day after stumbling into a political mess by dodging questions about whether he would have voted for the law .
Appearing on Laura Ingraham ’s show to do some clean - up after Wednesday ’s interviews , Paul said : “ There was a need for federal intervention so we ca n’t have segregation . ”
The Republican accused liberals of trying to portray him as a racist for expressing philosophical concerns about the role of government in desegregating private business , explaining that he was not interested in revisiting the law .
“ These are settled issues , ” Paul said .
“ I have no intention of bringing up anything related to the Civil Rights Act . ”
Audio here .
Second , the Paul campaign issued a statement shortly before noon stating the following :
“ Let me be clear : I support the Civil Rights
Act because I overwhelmingly agree with the intent of the legislation , which was to stop discrimination in the public sphere and halt the abhorrent practice of segregation and Jim Crow laws . ”
“ As I have said in previous statements , sections of the Civil Rights Act were debated on Constitutional grounds when the legislation was passed .
Those issues have been settled by federal courts in the intervening years . ”
“ My opponent ’s statement on MSNBC Wednesday that I favor repeal of the Civil Rights Act was irresponsible and knowingly false .
I hope he will correct the record and retract his claims . ”
That , quite honestly , should be the end of this entire episode .
Opponents will continue to bring the matter up , of course , but the only responsible answer should be to refer them back to these statements and say that the the campaign considers the matters closed .
Welcome to the world of big time politics , Dr. Paul .
( CNN ) -- Aimee Katz Zipkin , the mother of a 3 - year - old girl with a severe peanut allergy , has been too afraid to get on an airplane with her daughter , worried that passengers enjoying the snacks could endanger the child .
" If you so desire , take a bath in peanuts , " she said , " but if you 're 30,000 feet up and someone has an allergic reaction , then the plane is going to have to go into emergency landing in God knows where , so why would you want to take that risk ? "
The U.S. Department of Transportation 's recent proposals for improving air travel include the possibility of banning packets of peanuts to accommodate those allergic to the nuts .
" The Air Carrier Access Act prohibits discrimination by U.S. and foreign air carriers against individuals with disabilities , " the proposal reads .
" Airline passengers with severe allergies to peanuts have a qualifying disability . "
Blog : Hiding from nuts on planes
The DOT wants to hear from the public about this and is considering four alternative plans of action .
Should it ban peanuts from aircrafts outright ; provide a peanut - free flight when requested in advance ; install a peanut - free buffer zone around a passenger ; or do nothing ?
Allergy to peanuts and tree nuts is the leading cause of fatal and near fatal food - allergic reactions .
About 1 percent of the general population is affected by peanut and tree nut allergies , according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .
" Most deadly and almost deadly episodes are caused by ingestion , " said Dr. Anna Nowak - Wegrzyn , associate professor of pediatrics at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine 's Jaffe Food Allergy Institute .
" But we also know that if a patient is extremely sensitive or allergic then inhaling food protein can also produce a significant reaction . "
The most effective plan for peanut allergy sufferers would be a total ban on airplanes , not just a clean flight or buffer zone , she said .
" The issue is the air , " she said .
" It 's a small , confined space and the air is re-circulated .
If people five rows behind you are releasing peanut dust it does n't matter , at the end of the flight the peanut is in the air everywhere . "
Nowak - Wegrzyn added that there has n't been any systematic study on peanut allergic reactions on flights .
Food allergy diagnosis ' an inexact science '
Hundreds of comments regarding the issue have already been submitted on both regulations.gov and Cornell University 's Regulation Room , sites that provide users an opportunity to have input in federal decision making .
" My son has an anaphylactic reaction to peanuts , " one commenter , Tomas Scott Phillips , wrote .
" I find it very dangerous to serve peanuts on airlines as it is much harder to treat this reaction when you are 35,000 feet in the air . "
Lisa Beth Mckenna agreed , writing that her son has an airborne allergy to peanuts and because of this her family has n't flown for almost 15 years .
Advance reported in peanut allergy therapy
However , others do n't see why the food allergies should prompt changes .
" This should not even be considered , " Doug Eury wrote .
" I know friends and family members with peanut allergies and they consider such a ban on airplanes as an unnecessary imposition on others .
They know how to take reasonable precautions without having to have the ' nanny - state ' protect them at the inconvenience of the majority of travelers . "
One anonymous commenter wrote , " Banning peanuts is ridiculous .
Are you going to pull them out of restaurants ?
I resent having to bend my life for everyone else 's issues .
If they do n't eat the peanuts , they will not have a severe reaction . "
Some , including Rep. Bobby Bright , D - Alabama , are more concerned that taking peanuts off planes could involve a great risk -- specifically to jobs .
" The American peanut industry benefits tremendously from its business with airlines throughout the world , " Bright wrote in a letter to DOT Secretary Ray LaHood .
" [ S ]uch a regulatory change would undoubtedly have a negative impact on the industry and the tens of thousands of jobs it supports . "
Alabama is third among states in peanut production in the United States .
Russell Barker , president and CEO of the Peanut & Tree Nut Processors Association , like Bright , called the proposal a case of federal overreach .
Both are asking for research to be done before any decisions are made .
More than 10 years ago the DOT tried to issue similar guidelines for airlines to create peanut - free zones , but Congress said it would n't proceed without a scientific study .
" Let 's get the scientific research and prove that it is dangerous and then it 'll get my attention , " Barker continued .
" Nothing so far has shown me that traveling on an airplane with peanuts is dangerous . "

Tourist shock as fake sign directs visitors to official ' dogging ' area in Cotswolds
Prank :
This official - looking sign directed tourists to a popular spot for public sex
It does not feature in the official Cotswolds tourism guide .
But among the honey stoned cottages and rolling hills of the historic area known as the ' heart of England ' , visitors have been directed towards one of the areas more unpleasant sights - an ' official ' dogging area .
Pointing in the direction of a view point spot known for its spectacular scenery , anyone following the official - looking sign could be exposed to a shockingly memorable view .
The term ' dogging ' refers to the act of public sexual activity , often between complete strangers , in outdoor places and in public view .
And the Barrow Wake view point near Circencester has apparently become a popular spot .
Today a brown and white sign , designed to replicate official signs to places of public interest , had been torn down from the Cirencester bypass at Birdlip after its erection over the Bank Holiday weekend .
David Parkinson , 53 , who lives less than a mile from the ' Official Dogging Area ' said Barrow Wake 's reputation was a problem for local residents and that the sign had made the problem worse .
He said : ' It does tend to make the lives of local residents impossible .
' The viewpoint itself is one of the best in the area , fantastic views across Gloucestershire across the Malverns .
' You park there and you get accosted by people after ' stranger sex ' , I believe the terminology is .
It 's become a no - go area for residents . '
Mr Parkinson , a businessman , said he , his wife , and his daughter had all been followed by men when they were near the site , and that anyone arriving there to look at the view risked being accosted by strangers seeking sexual gratification .
Naked men were often seen in the area , day and night , with used condoms strewn across the area which is popular with walkers and tourists .
Popular :
The fake ' dogging ' sign pointed to the picturesque Barrow Wake viewpoint in the Cotswolds
Police patrol the area , but cannot be there all the time , and Mr Parkinson said locals had been avoiding it for over six years .
Last year a vigilante who filmed men meeting up for sex in a bid to clean up a woodland was prosecuted for his actions .
Colin Haw , 47 , posted the footage of a well - known dogging area on a website to name and shame those he caught in the wood near Sleaford in Lincolnshire .
The father - of - two said he reported the problem to police but was ignored so decided to take action because the area was visited by families and children .
Images shown to a court showed the self - employed mechanic and his accomplices dressed in balaclavas , combat kit and brandishing a video camera and walkie - talkies .
On occasions they would pretend to be looking for sex in order to lure gay men into the area before confronting them and demanding to know what they were doing .
The previous year NHS healthcare workers attracted controversy for issuing free condoms at popular ' dogging ' sites .
Health bosses insisted their initiative is to protect people against sexually transmitted diseases and said they had a duty to protect the dogging participants , the communities in areas where it took place and the sexual health workers who ran the outreach service .
But local councillors in Derbyshire criticised the move saying giving out free contraceptives will encourage the behaviour .
An arrestable offence under public decency laws , Gloucestershire Police said they were aware of concerns around Barrow Wake and were addressing them with an ongoing operation .
Inspector , Phil Offord , said : ' One of the key elements of the operation is to encourage local residents to report any incidents in the area .
' Our priority is to ensure that the area remains safe and beautiful for all those that live , work and visit here .
' We would like to encourage people to talk to the local policing team about any concerns they have for the area and also to report any illegal or suspicious activity so that appropriate action can be taken . '
A spokesman for Gloucestershire County Council refused to comment .
Inter Milan have reached an agreement with Rafa Benitez to become their new manager , club president Massimo Moratti has revealed .
Former Liverpool boss agrees to step into Mourinho 's shoes
Presentation
Inter Milan have reached an agreement with Rafa Benitez to become their new manager , club president Massimo Moratti has revealed .
The Serie A giants have been looking for a replacement coach since Jose Mourinho opted to take on a fresh challenge at Spanish giants Real Madrid .
The Portuguese coach departed Giuseppe Meazza at the end of the 2009 /10 campaign after guiding Inter to an unprecedented Treble , which saw them land the Serie A title , Coppa Italia and the UEFA Champions League .
Once it became apparent that Mourinho was looking to move on , rumours began circulating as to who his possible replacement might be .
Spanish coach Benitez was considered to be a leading candidate and his departure from Liverpool last week opened the door for a switch to Italy .
Inter quickly identified him as their number one choice for the role and have pressed ahead with formal negotiations .
Talks have now reached a conclusion and Moratti confirmed that Benitez has agreed to become Inter 's new coach .
" We 've got an agreement , we finalised the last details that in any case were n't important , " he told the club's .
" Tomorrow ( Wednesday ) we will say when Rafa Benitez will be presented .
" All we need is a counter - signature .
In any case I think Benitez is not in Italy and will arrive here for the presentation . "
Benitez will arrive at Inter fresh from a six - year stint at Liverpool which saw him land the Champions League crown in 2005 and the 2006 FA Cup .
He also enjoyed considerable success in his homeland with Valencia prior to moving to Anfield , winning two Primera Liga titles and the Uefa Cup .
The latest news about the MMS adds to my sense of outrage about the GOP Gulf Gusher .
All the crimes described in this piece occurred before Obama took office .
Staff members at the US agency that regulates offshore drilling used illegal drugs , accepted gifts from oil companies and falsified inspection reports , an Interior Department probe showed Tuesday .
The investigation found these violations and others at the Minerals Management Service district office in Lake Charles , Louisiana .
The inspector general ’s report also found staffers accepted sports events tickets paid for by an oil company and viewed pornography on government computers .
One of the staff members interviewed for the report was talking with an oil company about a job with them at the same time as he was inspecting the company ’s oil platforms , the report said .
Some of the staffers were involved in inspections of offshore drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico .
The probe was completed in early April and was sent , as is routine with such reports , to MMS , which had a 90 - day period to respond to the allegations in the report .
A week later , an explosion on BP ’s Deepwater Horizon offshore platform killed 11 workers and sent the rig sinking to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico , where oil has been spewing ever since from a ruptured oil well .
" Given the events of April 20 … this report has become anything but routine , " inspector general Mary Kendall said in a memo to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , whose agency includes the MMS .
Salazar called the findings of the report , which covered several years prior to his appointment in 2009 , " deeply disturbing " and said they could lead to some of the MMS staff members being fired or referred to authorities for criminal prosecution … [ emphasis added ]
Inserted from < Bay Ledger >
I would think that a lot more needed than just firing some of the MMS staff members .
Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow both had excellent segments on this issue .
First Keith :
Visit msnbc.com for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy
Now Rachel :
Visit msnbc.com for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy
Since Salazar appointed a BP VP to head the MMS , it seems clear to me that , even though the GOP caused this despicable state of affairs , his bent is to continue the GOP culture of corruption .
It ’s time for him to be replaced .
It is abundantly clear that the GOP is siding with big oil to pass the costs on to taxpayers .
It ’s time for every Republican above the rank of dog catcher to be replaced .
I ’ve heard discussion that the oil companies should mobilize a fleet of tankers to skim and store the oil in the gulf .
I think this is a good idea , but government does not have the capacity to order it .
Why have they not volunteered ?
My best guess is that the oil companies are anticipating an increase in the price of oil as a result of this disaster , and that they have their tanker fleets fully loaded , waiting to sell it at a higher price .
Admittedly I 'm a first class dork , and I have been writing about home automation for many years .
From climate control , to music , to hard core energy savings ( vampire devices not allowed ) , I use automation to make my life a little better .
For example I 'll be heading out on vacation in July and while I 'm gone , lights will turn on randomly at night , outside motion detectors will make people think someone is home , plants will get watered , chicken coop doors will go up and down , cameras will keep an eye out for the pet sitter , water mains will be watched , and I 'll be able to login remotely and check that all is well and the house has n't burned down .
The one hitch in my system for years is that since I 've been building my own UI 's for controlling the house , I 've been limited because touch screen devices were either too expensive or limited by functionality and screen size .
I 've had a touch monitor , Nokia N800 , and even an iPhone mounted to my walls .
However as soon as I got my iPad home , I knew that I 'd found the perfect touch device and started to rebuild my UI from scratch .
First I found some metal framing material at Lowes and built a mount for the wall .
Then I embedded a rare earth magnet in the wall and spackled it in place so you could n't see it .
I cut a strip of tin , flattened it , and mounted it to the back of the iPad behind some velvet .
This way when you place the iPad in the mount , it clicks and sticks to the wall ( no velcro for me ) .
With that done I moved on to a new UI .
Here 's a description of what I have so far :
All Lights Off : Basically this will shut all lights off in the house .
Everything Off : Everything non-critical ( light / appliance ) will turn off .
Television : No vampire plasma TVs .
This shuts the TV off at the outlet .
Fireplace : Gas fireplace .
Turning it on via automation puts it on a 45 minute timer .
Saves energy .
Coffee Grinder : 6:30 every morning , freshly ground coffee .
Not going to be home ?
This turns it off .
Grinder Times :
You can run the grinder at any time , and select how long to run it .
Coffee pot or espresso shot ?
Living Room Lights :
All lights in the house are controlled .
These control just the living room lights .
Percentages :
Set what level you want the lights at .
Outside Lights :
These are all the house lights and landscape lighting , which are on a timer as well .
Patio Lights : turn on all the accent lighting , and even set the brightness .
Kitchen Motion :
The kitchen lights ( like many lights in the house ) operate on a motion detector .
Sometimes you want to disable that .
Vacation Settings : Leaving ?
Clicking this button sets everything in motion .
When you return , everything is back to normal .
Sonos Settings :
While my Sonos already has a controller , this let 's me quickly jump to my favorite music , pause , or mute .
Coming soon , a Pandora page .
Thermostat : My Ecobee smart thermostat is web enabled , so this jumps to that page .
Plus , I can login from my iPhone to control my thermostat with their app .
Timers :
Need to set a reminder that the laundry will be done in 45 minutes ?
Baking something ?
This tells the kitchen iMac ( VESA mounted ) to announce the timer is set and when it is done .
Using Growl and Applescript I also get notifications on my laptop , my wife 's laptop , and a text message to my phone .
Watch Movie : Turns on the TV , sets the audio to the right input , turns on the TV , and sets the TV input to the Mac Mini Media Center .
I could even script this to open either Front Row , Hulu , or Netflix on demand .
Bedtime : Turns on the the Hall Lights , Bedroom and Master Bath lights , and puts all other lights on a 10 minute timer .
Entertain : Sets all the lighting to a certain ambiance and turns the Sonos on with a party playlist .
More Controls : Eventually I 'll have another page of controls for irrigation , music , and the security system .
So far the iPad is an outstanding touch screen solution , and I would n't be surprised if we start seeing all sorts of people using it as a kiosk .
I'm in the process of writing an ebook about automation so I 'm excited to see what other ideas I come up with during that project .
Posted by John , June 24th , 2010 - under Julia Gillard , Right wing , The Right .
Tags : ALP , Australian Labor Party
Julia Gillard is as left wing as Kevin Rudd .
She supports the same things he does .
Unlike Rudd , she has has a power base in the Labor Party .
Her authority stems from the support of people like Bill Ludwig and David Feeney , reactionaries who swung behind her for fear the ALP would lose the election with Rudd as Prime Minister .
That fear was in part sparked by the resource super profits tax .
The mining bosses overthrew Rudd .
Labor ’s addiction to polls rather than principle is a good indicator that social democracy is dead in Australia .
What is laughingly called the hard left supported Rudd .
The terms left and right in the ALP these days are meaningless , other than to describe different social networks within the Party .
They are united in their quest for power for power ’s sake , or rather for the sake of big business .
Kevin Rudd did have one faction behind him – the bourgeoisie .
That faction deserted him , partly because of the mining tax .
It was only then that the Labor hard heads – the people who gave us Senator Fielding – dumped Rudd .
Julia Gillard now has the support of the ruling class , and she will govern accordingly .
She is looking for a way out on the mining tax and the likely outcome is a super profits tax in name only .
That tells you where real power in society lies – with the bosses , not Parliament .
Gillard will make up the lost revenue with savage attacks on schools and hospitals after the election .
If Labor win .
The media and many working people will talk about her ascendancy as historic because she is a woman .
Her rise does reflect the changing nature of the role of women in society .
Women are oppressed in capitalist society .
Because Gillard is a member of the ruling class her oppression is less than that of other women and she will support the oppression of her working class sisters because that props up the capitalist system of which she is a key member .
Indeed ruling class women in the past have proven themselves to be the most enthusiastic supporters of women ’s oppression because of their own lessened oppression .
If the choice is between equal pay for equal work and more profit for the bosses Gillard will support the bosses .
If the choice is between Afghan women living , or being killed by western forces , she ’ll support their death in the name of the ANZUS alliance .
If the choice is between Israel and the oppressed women of Palestine , she ’ll support Israel as the attack dog of US imperialism in the region .
If the choice is between building worker Ark Tribe and the profits of the building magnates , Gillard will choose the multimillionaires .
If the choice is between the aboriginal women of the Northern Territory and the racist intervention , she ’ll choose racism every time .
If the choice is between refugee women and pandering to reaction , she ’ll choose reaction every time .
If the choice is between equal love and homophobia Gillard will choose homophobia .
Having a new Pope does n’t change the essentially reactionary nature of the Catholic Church hierarchy .
Labor has changed its leadership – it has n’t changed its fundamentals .
Gillard is a right winger who will rule in the interests of the bosses at our expense .
1. The Girl With the Double Dragon Tattoo 24 - year - old computer hacker Lisbeth Salander never was able to get past that part in the first Double Dragon game where Billy and Jimmy have to fight the two Abobos at the same time .
One day , after getting drunk , she got a goofy - ass tattoo to remind herself of her failure and the larger failure inherent in the fact that nobody has seriously referred to themselves as a " computer hacker " since Angelina Jolie starred in that dumb movie in 1995 .
2. The Dragon With the Girl Tattoo I dunno .
Some dragon gets an ill - advised tattoo of a girl , and all the townspeople are like , " Haha , that 's a pretty ill - advised tattoo of a girl .
It does n't look very tough . "
So he burns them all alive in their beds .
3 . The Earl With the Dragon Tattoo
This one is about some Steampunk type of shit and is therefore completely unreadable .
4 . The Girl , With the Drag on Tattoo I guess this is some kind of horrifying Fanfic - to - book - deal sensation ?
Fantasy Island gets even more fantastical after Tattoo discovers his love of cross -dressing !
When he meets 24 - year - old Lisbeth Salander - a computer hacker with a thing for Little People in drag - things get kind of confusing and unpleasant .
5 . The Girl With the Falcor Tattoo None of the other computer hackers at the computer hacking academy take 24 - year - old computer hacker Lisbeth Salander seriously , on account of her cringe - inducing Neverending Story tramp stamp .
So she burns them all alive in their beds .
As I sat down last night to watch the Lost series finale , I prepped myself for a 1 hour finale that was sure to answer all the questions they had set up for 6 years .
I soon realized that it would be longer than an hour , so I assumed I ’d be sitting here for 2 hours .
Sure enough , this finale did n’t wanna end , and after 2.5 hours of watching the finale , the show ended .
The finale reminded me a lot of this article .
You just want the column to end , and when you get to point 15 you ’re like “ crap there ’s still 10 more points this guy has to go through ” .
One thing I can promise you is this :
It wont take you 2.5 hours to read this , but it ’ll sure as hell feel like it .
Enjoy 🙂
The Canadian men ’s soccer team will play a friendly soccer match against Argentina on May 24th .
This is the soccer equivalent of the whole Lawrence Taylor saga , with Argentina being LT and Canada being the 16 year old girl .
Saddest part is the 16 year old girl prolly had a better chance of saving her dignity than the Canadians do .
ESPN will be in a constant state of arousal for the next 38 days .
Or I as like to call it , a permanent state of Lebroner Stickin with Lebron , the New Jersey Nets are officially the first team out of the Lebron James sweepstakes as lottery balls rolled out of their favor and dropped them from the 1st overall pick to the number 3 slot in this June ’s NBA draft .
After losing 70 games this season , the Nets may have just been dealt their biggest blow of the year , 6 weeks before the offseason even begins .
On a side note , I found the NBA draft lottery to be much more entertaining when the Vancouver Grizzlies were in it every year getting screwed out of the first overall pick .
The only thing more desperate than this might be the Sharks themselves :
Here I also had no idea Joe Thornton went by the alias “ biscuit ” Lance Armstrong is being accused of using steroids .
In other news , Tiger Woods enjoys casual sex .
Stat of week : Remove the Miami Heat ( 2006 ) and Philadelphia 76ers ( 1983 ) and only six teams have won the last 28 NBA championships ( Lakers , Celtics , Pistons , Spurs , Rockets , Bulls ) .
Ladies and gentlemen , parity at its finest .
10 time NBA champion and Los Angeles Lakers head coach Phil Jackson has accused Jammer blog favourite , Steve Nash , of carrying the ball when he dribbles ( for those of you wondering , this is illegal ) .
This prompted Nash to give us this : Quote of week : “ The best coach in the league , Gregg Popovich , did n’t seem to have a problem with it ” .
Ouch .
Picture of the week :
Who ’s the Boss in this picture ?
Click me Best commercial ever ?
Yes I know I say this EVERY week .
But this one is a tough one to argue against .
It ’s even got a cameo from the Queen herself ( Elizabeth , not Latifah ) Chris Bosh has narrowed down his list to 5 teams he would like to play for : New York Knicks , Miami Heat , Chicago Bulls , Los Angeles Lakers , and Toronto Raptors .
Cue this song :
As Cookie Monster so eloquently asks , can you figure out which one it is ?
I ’ll give you a hint : this team sucks and its located in Canada PS .
How brutal does Cookie Monster look now ?
Old age has caught up to this guy .
I honestly thought he was gonna die half way through that song .
Non Sports thought of the week : “ Please do n’t tell me how Lost ended last night .
I ’m up to the point where they discover a hatch ” –Conan O’Brien on twitter I ’m gonna use this spot here to shower some dap to Jammer Blog favourite Pavel Datsyuk for taking home the Top Forward Award at the World Championships .
Sticking with the Championships , can someone please tell me what purpose Evgeni Malkin served this year ?
He did nothing for the Pens before the Olympics .
Did nothing at the Olympics .
Did even less for the Pens after the Olympics .
Was almost as invisible as Crosby was in that Montreal series .
And now he pulled a no show at the World Championships .
Seriously , why did this guy even bother getting up in the morning this year ?
Irony of the week : Both the Orlando Magic and Cleveland Cavaliers retooled and built their teams this season to beat each other ( Magic , see Vince Carter .
Cavs , see Antwan Jamison ) .
Unfortunately they never got the chance to play each other because neither of em built a team that could beat the Celtics .
The Cavs did n’t have anyone to guard Kevin Garnett ( see Antwan Jamison ) and there is n’t a warm body on the Magic who has the ability to stay between Rajon Rondo and the basket .
There comes a point in every series when everyone knows who the better team is .
In the cases of Magic and Cavs , it was painfully obvious on their faces when they realized neither of em could beat Boston .
Final thought :
After six years on the air , Lost had its series finale on Sunday which I ’m assuming broke every single TV ratings record .
It ’s amazing how long ago 6 years is .
Think about it : Both Ovechkin and Crosby were n’t in the NHL 6 years ago .
Brian Burke was still with the Canucks .
Peyton Manning had n’t won a superbowl .
Kobe Bryant had never won an MVP award .
The Phoenix Coyotes were actually making money .
Bryant Reeves was still being paid by the Vancouver Grizzlies .
And most notably , Tiger Woods was keeping it in the pants .
It ’s amazing how much can change over a 6 year time period .
My prediction for the next 6 years ?
Have a great week everyone !

A 12 - year - old Indian - American activist tried to issue summons for Warren Anderson , former chief of Union Carbide over the deadliest 1984 gas disaster in Bhopal .
“ Today we are here to appeal to Warren Anderson and summon him to the Indian court where he has been charged with culpable homicide , which is the equivalent of manslaughter in America , ” Akash Viswanath Mehta said , standing outside a skyscraper on Park Avenue , which houses the law firm that represents Union Carbide .
Mehta along with his older brother , Gautama , 15 , were asked to leave the premises by the building owners who said it was private property owned by H J Kalikow .
The media was also not allowed to film on the property .
Akash , who had the 1992 summons along with a criminal chargesheet in an envelope , requested that the package be delivered to the legal offices of Kelly , Drye and Warren .
The owners of the building responded that there was no one in the office and the activists should make an appointment or send the summons by post .
“ Do you know they represent the CEO of a corporation that is absconding from justice in Bhopal India ? ” said Adrianne Raff Corwin , an activist from the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal ( ICJB ) .
“ He is being charged with culpable homicide ... they are protecting a man who is basically responsible for murdering thousands of people in India and he should be extradited from America , ” she added .
“ It is not necessary for me to be able to understand you , ” responded the building representatives who refused to identify himself .
The protest was organised by ICJB and Kids for a Better Future based in New York .
The two groups noted that their objective was to remind that Anderson was still absconding and needed to respond to the outstanding charges .
When the summon bearers were told to leave , Akash read out a statement to a handful of building owners and cops .
By the end of the demonstration the number of police officers had increased from one to six .
“ Twenty - five years ago Warren Anderson escaped arrest and his day in court .
I would like today to appear to Warren Anderson ’s conscience , his guilt and his grief and ask him to stand beside me , ” Akash said .
“ If he is truly haunted by the disaster that happened on his watch , which destroyed an entire community I ask him to come forward and make a moral statement about what the right thing is for DOW and Union Carbide to do , ” Akash added .
“ According to American law the polluter must pay and so DOW the owner of Union Carbide must pay to clean up its mess ” he said .
On the same day , another demonstration was organised outside the Indian embassy in Washington .
“ Because the Indian Prime Minister has not taken adequate action to ensure that these parties show up in court , activists are taking it into their own hands to provide summons , ” the activists said .

Polish authorities have arrested a suspected Israeli agent in connection with the murder of a Hamas operative in Dubai in January .
Officials say the agent was arrested in early June .
Media reports named him as Uri Brodsky .
Germany is seeking his extradition over a forged German passport used by one of the killers , the prosecutors say .
Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , one of the founders of Hamas 's military wing , was found dead in a Dubai hotel on 20 January .
Dubai police have said they are 99 % sure Israeli agents were involved , but Israel says there is no proof .
Extradition wrangle
On Saturday , German prosecutors said the agent had been arrested on a warrant issued by Germany , as he arrived in Poland .
" It 's now up to the Poles to decide if they are going to hand him over , " a spokesman for the federal German prosecutor 's office told AP news agency .
Israel 's foreign ministry confirmed that an Israeli citizen had been arrested in Poland but gave no futher details .
A spokeswoman for Polish prosecutors told the Associated Press news agency that a suspect , identified as Uri B , had been arrested on 4 June in connection with the Dubai murder .
The German magazine Der Spiegel reports that the Israeli embassy in Warsaw has urged the Polish authorities not to extradite Mr Brodsky .
Forged passports from Britain , the Irish Republic , France , Australia , and Germany were used in the Dubai operation , leading to diplomatic rows between those countries and Israel .
The UK and Australia have expelled Israeli nationals over the forgeries .
Israel maintains that Mabhouh was in Dubai to procure rockets for Hamas to fire into Israel from Gaza .

After taking psychedelic mushrooms , a California man gouged out his MMA training partner 's heart , eyes and tongue , all while he was still alive .
Witness testimonies detail the two men's increasing paranoia as it spiraled out of control .

On March 21 , Jarrod Wyatt of Crescent City , Calif. , killed his friend Taylor Powell after they had both drank mushroom tea .
Powell was found without most of his face , and a large incision in his chest .
Wyatt told arresting officers that he had cut out Powell 's heart and burned it because he thought Powell was possessed by the Devil .
That much we know .
The rest is a hazy collection of bizarre , disjointed remembrances , because all of the witnesses were hallucinating heavily .
But it 's possible to put together a coherent timeline .

• Wyatt , Powell , a third acquaintance , and Wyatt 's ex-girlfriend all drank mushroom tea .
Wyatt had been in a good mood before ingesting it , but the men 's behavior changed almost immediately .
Wyatt began complaining that his eyes were burning , and tried to prevent the third man from leaving , even jumping on top of his car as he drove away .
• Wyatt told police he did n't want the man to leave because he was convinced a tidal wave was coming .
Powell held him down on the kitchen floor , saying none of them could be saved from the wave , and that the world was going to come to an end .

• Wyatt and Powell fought , at point using a rear chokehold familiar from their MMA training together .
• The ex-girlfriend testified that Wyatt and Powell started wrestling on the kitchen floor , though they were later talking about surfing .
Later on she saw Powell standing over Wyatt , spitting on him , and " heard sounds she thought were sexual in nature . "

• Wyatt removed Powell 's heart while he was still alive , according to the coroner 's report .
He then cooked his body parts in the stove because he was fearful Powell was still alive and needed to " stop the Devil . "
• When police arrived , they found Wyatt standing over Powell , naked and covered in his blood .
" I killed him , " Wyatt said , and asked if they were God coming to save him .

CLEVELAND , Ohio --
The two Cleveland police officers who mistook a slain woman 's body for a dead deer and drew criticism to a department already accused of being insensitive and uncaring were suspended Tuesday for six months without pay .
Safety Director Martin Flask said the punishment should communicate to officers and the community that Cleveland demands more of its police .
" This is a clear message to the community that this conduct will not be tolerated , " Flask said in an interview Tuesday .
That conduct occurred early April 5 after horrified motorists called police to say a dead woman 's body had been dumped on the side of Interstate 90 near West 41st Street .
Patrolmen Matthew Prince and David Muniz were assigned to investigate .
Instead , they drove past Angel Bradley - Crockett 's nude body without stopping or shining their spotlight and told a dispatcher to have ODOT pick up a dead deer .
The officers , who each have more than eight years on the job , returned to West Park Cemetery where they parked their cruiser and spent nearly two hours of their shift on that day .
The incident prompted criticism of the department from throughout Northeast Ohio , including from Police Chief Michael McGrath , who sent a stern message to the department on April 9 telling officers that if they are n't dedicated then find another job .
The chief 's memo came two weeks after a commission , formed in the wake of 11 bodies being found in the East Side home of Anthony Sowell , recommended training the the city 's police to show more empathy and sensitivity .
The department 's Internal Affairs unit investigated Muniz and Prince .
The investigation did not uncover any criminal acts by the officers , according to the Cleveland prosecutor .
But Prince , 39 , and Muniz , 43 , were charged with administrative rule violations , including failing to investigate , neglecting to patrol the area they were assigned and for making false reports about what they were doing while on patrol .
" The actions of the two officers seriously diminished the image and credibility of the Division of Police and resulted in a loss of confidence by the public that the Police will respond when called , and will respond appropriately , " Flask said in a written statement Tuesday .
The city 's charter had limited Flask 's punishment to a 30 - day suspension or firing the officers .
However , in this instance the officers , who might otherwise have lost their jobs worth $ 81,800 in salary and benefits , did not object .
The suspension started Tuesday and ends in late November .
" We accept the punishment that the safety director thought was appropriate , " said Cleveland Police Patrolmen 's Association President Steve Loomis , who defended the officers as having otherwise unblemished records .
Patricia Bradley , Bradley - Crockett 's mother , declined to comment Tuesday .
Police say that the 28 - year - old woman was robbed , beaten and strangled before being dumped on the roadside .
Stephon Davis , 30 , and his 33 - year - old girlfriend , Latesha Santos , are in county jail charged with aggravated murder in her death .
With the ruling against the officers , Mayor Frank Jackson 's administration announced new measures to supervise police using technology that pinpoints the location of squad cars .
This automatic vehicle location system showed that Prince and Muniz drove past Bradley - Crockett 's body at more than 50 miles an hour and that they spent nearly two hours of their shift that day parked in a cemetery .
That technology was installed in Cleveland police cars to help dispatchers assign officers to trouble based on their location .
But the automatic - vehicle locators will now be used by supervisors to monitor officers ' movements and dispatchers were not required to check that all of the vehicles ' locators were working .
Sky Sports sources understand that Arsenal have yet to receive an offer from any club for Barcelona target Cesc Fabregas .
Gunners not soliciting approach for star midfielder
sources understand that Arsenal have yet to receive an offer from any club for midfielder Cesc Fabregas .
The Gunners star has reportedly spoken of his desire to leave North London and move to Barcelona this summer , where he started his career .
But Arsenal have denied that they have received any offer , formal or informal , for the Spain international as speculation increases that he could be on his way out of the Emirates Stadium .
sources also understand that Arsenal are not soliciting any approach for the 23 - year - old , as he is under contract at the club until 2015 .
Fabregas was snapped up by Arsene Wenger while he was in the youth ranks at Barca as a teenager , and has been at the Gunners for seven years .
However , he has only won one FA Cup and a Community Shield during his time in England , whilst the Catalan club have secured a number of Primera Division and European titles .
It seems a matter of time before Arsenal are tested with a big - money bid for the star midfielder , but they insist there has been no such offer as yet and are not looking for an approach .
Australia 's relations with Israel have hit a new low , with the Rudd Government expelling an Israeli diplomat over the fake passports affair .
The Minister for Foreign Affairs , Stephen Smith , told Parliament today that inquiries by Australian intelligence agencies into the use of fake Australian passports in Dubai had concluded the fakes were the work of a state intelligence agency .
Mr Smith said this led to the conclusion there was no doubt Israel was responsible .
" No government can tolerate the abuse of its passports , especially by a foreign government , " he said .
" This represents a clear affront to the security of our passport system . "
In the seven weeks since Republican Gov. Jan Brewer signed Arizona 's tough new immigration law , there has been a sharp increase in the number of Latinos registering to vote as Democrats , party officials say , jumping from about 100 a week before to 500 now .
Many of those registering are young Latino citizens whose parents may be undocumented .
" Before , it used to be hard , " said Luis Heredia , executive director of the Arizona Democratic Party .
" Now , they are just saying , ' Can you give me a form ? ' or , ' I am already registered , but I know someone who is n't . ' "
Heredia and others who watch voting trends are n't surprised .
As soon as Brewer signed the law on April 23 , they began predicting that Senate Bill 1070 would ignite a political backlash similar to what happened in California after voters there passed Proposition 187 , a ballot initiative to clamp down on illegal immigration by prohibiting undocumented people from receiving health care , public education and other services .
The Republican - sponsored measure was declared unconstitutional and struck down by the courts , but the damage had been done :
The 1994 measure is widely pointed to for solidifying California 's growing Latino population as Democratic and tipping the then - Republican state to a solidly Democratic one .
The recent rallies and marches by opponents show that Arizona 's immigration law has already stirred a backlash , primarily among Latinos .
But there are significant differences between Arizona and California that make it less likely for even a significant growth in the Latino voting bloc to push Arizona from red to blue anytime soon , political analysts say .
" It 's not going to have the same partisan effect , " said Louis DeSipio , a political - science professor at the University of California - Irvine and an expert on Latino politics and voting .
Arizona is overall more conservative than California and has fewer moderate and liberal voters than California , he said .
Arizona also has fewer Asian - and African - American voters , who tend to vote Democratic .
" Arizona is different in that , first , the Latino vote is lower , about 12 percent versus 21 percent , " DeSipio said .
" And even if that grows , which I predict that it will , those newly participating Arizona Hispanics , who tend to vote Democratic , have fewer non-Hispanic Democrats to ally with to shift the state 's politics . "
Similar issues
In 1994 , California was facing challenges with illegal immigration similar to Arizona 's today .
The border with Mexico near San Diego had become a major corridor for illegal immigration , and the state 's undocumented population had soared .
Like Arizona today , California also was struggling with a weak economy .
Then - California Gov. Pete Wilson , a Republican , was facing a tough re-election , similar to Brewer 's election campaign now in Arizona .
Wilson became a major supporter of Prop. 187 .
He ran television ads featuring grainy footage of immigrants rushing into the country illegally .
The commercials ended with Wilson declaring , " Enough is enough . "
Wilson won re-election , and voters overwhelmingly approved the ballot measure .
But Republicans paid a price with Latino voters , who by and large came to view Prop. 187 as an attack on California 's Hispanic population .
" It was not until Pete Wilson and the Republican Party started running these pro-Prop .
187 campaigns showing hordes of illegal immigrants streaming across the border that made Latinos in California feel like they were being scapegoated for the economic downturn , " said Rodolfo Espino , a political - science professor at Arizona State University .
In the years that followed , hundreds of thousands of Latinos registered to vote , including many previous legal permanent residents who became U.S. citizens .
" Honest to God , I was not thinking of becoming a citizen .
I was perfectly happy being a legal permanent resident , " said Ben Monterroso , a Guatemalan immigrant who lived in California at the time and now lives part - time in Arizona .
" Proposition 187 motivated me and a million others to do the same thing .
. . .
I remember having a house party with my compadres .
Fifteen of us filled out the paperwork together . "
Until Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected governor in 2003 , no Republican had won a major statewide office in California since 1994 .
Even Schwarzenegger , a liberal Republican , has been careful not to alienate California 's large Latino voting bloc .
He has said that he opposes Arizona 's immigration law , saying on NBC's " Tonight Show , " " I would never do that in California .
No way . "
Latinos galvanized
Monterroso said the passage of Arizona 's immigration law is galvanizing Latinos the same way Prop. 187 did in California .
Arizona 's immigration law makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally .
It states that an officer engaged in a lawful stop , detention or arrest shall , when practicable , ask about a person 's legal status when reasonable suspicion exists that the person is in the U.S. illegally .
" What you see in the streets , most of the marches and protests you see , people are going out and asking people to vote , " said Monterroso , who is now national director of Mi Familia Vota , a nonpartisan organization that works to increase the number of Latino voters across the country .
But whether marches and protests can translate into large numbers of Latino voters remains to be seen .
Arizona has a large untapped pool of about 400,000 unregistered Latinos eligible to vote , Monterroso said .
But Arizona does n't have the large unions that helped organize Latino voters in California .
The state also does n't have the same large network of community activists as California , said Espino , the ASU professor .
Espino said it could take years to see if the immigration law has an effect on Arizona 's political landscape .
" It took about six to 10 years before we started seeing Latinos voting in great numbers against the Republican Party and Republican candidates to make California a solidly blue state , " he said .
A poll conducted by ASU researchers indicates that 81 percent of registered Latino voters oppose SB 1070 either strongly or somewhat that and 59 percent blame Republicans .
But the poll also indicated that 60 percent of Latino voters also blame Democrats for not doing enough to block the law .
" So , yes , Latinos are putting the majority of the blame on the Republican Party , but they are not particularly enthused about how the Democratic Party stood on this , or actually sort of laid down on this , " Espino said .
Matt Roberts , communications director for the Arizona Republican Party , said he does not believe SB 1070 will create a groundswell of Latino Democratic voters .
Although the law may turn some Latino voters away from the Republican Party , it also could attract Latino voters who support tougher immigration enforcement .
" I do n't think this issue in Arizona is going to be the same as it was in California , " Roberts said .
" There is a big difference between having immigrants pay for benefits and having Arizona enforce what is a federal law . "
But Tempe resident Javier Zuluaga , 39 , a small - business owner and a Latino Republican , disagrees .
He is a member of Somos Republicans , a group trying to boost the number of Latino Republicans .
Zuluaga said Latino values mesh well with the Republican Party .
But the new immigration law is going to drive Latino voters away from the party because many Hispanics fear they will be targeted under the law even if they are U.S. citizens .
" Latinos are pro-family , " he said .
" They favor strong national defense .
They are pro-Second Amendment and pro-fiscal responsibility .
All this fits with the Republican Party .
" What does n't fit is this right - wing approach to immigration . "
Latino voters
Latinos account for about 30 percent of Arizona 's population but a much smaller share of the state 's more than 3 million registered voters .
� The Arizona Democratic Party has identified about 419,000 Hispanic voters in Arizona , or about 14 percent of all registered voters .
� About 212,000 Hispanic voters , nearly 51 percent , are registered Democrats .
� About 70,000 Hispanic voters , nearly 17 percent , are registered Republicans .

TONY JONES : Good evening , and welcome to Q&A , where answering your questions tonight we have the Shadow Minister for Innovation , Sophie Mirabella ; American - born now Beijing - based internet consultant Kaiser Kuo , who is in Australia to argue against the proposition that freedom should be absolute at tomorrow night 's IQ2 debate ; the controversial Melbourne columnist and broadcaster Helen Razer , who this week closed her Twitter account ; the Minister for Home Affairs , Brendan O'Connor ; and the founding director of GetUp , Brett Solomon , who has now moved to New York to champion online freedom .
Please welcome our panel .
Remember that Q&A is live from 9.35 Eastern Time .
If you have a question you can send it by SMS to 197 55 222 or go to our website , abc.net.au / qanda , and you can join the Twitter conversation through #qanda .
We 'll also be showing a small selection of the thousands of live Twitter comments on screen , and we 'll have a lot to say about the internet tonight .
But before we get there let 's talk politics .
A year ago Kevin Rudd was among our most popular Prime Ministers .
But according to the latest opinion polls , he 's now in danger of being voted out .
Many are saying he 's disappointed those who supported him in 2007 .
Our first question tonight comes from Daniel Guerra .
DANIEL GUERRA : Oh , thanks , Tony .
Given Kevin Rudd has turned away from the commitments such as real action on climate change and ending mandatory detention of refugees , what choice do voters have in the upcoming election if they want real , progressive change in Australia ?
TONY JONES : Brett Solomon ?
BRETT SOLOMON : How did I know you were going to ask me first ?
Well , I mean , you know , the polls today , I think , are stunning in their disappointment .
If you look at the numbers , there 's actually , you know , 14 or 15 per cent .
It 's actually literally millions of people who have changed their minds in the last couple of weeks , and I think you 're right to point out those issues around refugees and asylum seekers .
I mean , the deaths today - the missing five people , it harps back to the Howard years .
The end of processing of Afghanis and Sri Lankans , I mean these are major issues that I think that we , as a people , thought we 'd turned away from , not to mention climate change and the pushing off to the Never Never of the emissions trading scheme .
So I think that , you know , the ballot box is really the place , right ?
I mean this is where we as Australians , we exercise our democracy .
In the media , through organisations like GetUp , I think there is a whole range of different opportunities that we , as Australians , can exercise .
It 's not just actually about voting every three or four years , it 's actually about the role that we play as citizens in shaping the policies that our ( indistinct ) ...
TONY JONES : Brett , let me interrupt you , because GetUp did play a significant role in getting Kevin Rudd elected .
Any regrets ?
BRETT SOLOMON : Well , there was , you know , two people really to choose from , after all , and in fact , if you look at the parties now , I do n't think that there is that much of a difference .
I was thinking maybe Sophie might like to start working for the ALP , the policies are almost , you know , not far off .
SOPHIE MIRABELLA :
You have n't had a good look , obviously .
BRETT SOLOMON : But I mean , if you look at those issues around asylum seekers , around indigenous rights , around the emissions trading scheme , there 's actually not that much distinction between the political parties .
SOPHIE MIRABELLA :
Well , actually , the fact that there is a distinction , and with a change in leadership we saw greater distinction in some policy areas , saw the polls turn around .
Now , some people may say that the polls have changed because Kevin Rudd has failed to deliver on an ETS .
He 's failed to deliver on prices coming down .
But , remember , he got elected claiming to be John Howard light and what he 's shown the Australian people is he can come up with all the promises , but he can't deliver .
He promised to be like John Howard on border protection and he 's failed dismally and we 've seen the record number of boats : 120 boats in the last financial year .
TONY JONES : Sophie , I 'm going to take you back to the question because ...
SOPHIE MIRABELLA : Yeah .
TONY JONES : ... he may be shedding voters like confetti at the moment , but the fact is they 're not going to the coalition , and that person was asking about what progressive party would be the alternative .
SOPHIE MIRABELLA : Well , by progressive party I 'm assuming that means left - wing party .
Well , that 's not the Liberal Party .
The Liberal Party is a mainstream Party that represents mainstream views , concerns and values and ...
TONY JONES :
So tell me this : why do you think these voters are n't going to your party ?
Well , are n't going to the coalition ?
SOPHIE MIRABELLA :
Well , if you look at two party preferred vote , there has been a significant increase in the coalition .
The best position since August 2006 and , yes , of course it 's going to be a tough battle , but I think the really interesting thing about the current polls is that for the first time since I can remember voters out there are having absolute , direct personal experience with the government failing to deliver on its policies .
Whether it's the insulation in their roof being newspapers , whether it 's their room being in danger of blowing up or firing up , whether it 's the waste they 've seen at their local school and the fact that they know their school principal is intimidated into coming out publicly ...
TONY JONES : Okay .
SOPHIE MIRABELLA : ... these are direct experiences .
TONY JONES : Make your point , because it 's a political point .
It 's off the question and I 'm letting you make it .
Let 's go to Helen Razer , and if you could address yourself to the question .
HELEN RAZER : Indeed , with - you could say the same thing , Sophie .
I 'm sorry , I 'm not addressing the question but I must - I must address Sophie first .
I mean , you did n't mention WorkChoices , so I shall .
There was many people of my immediate acquaintance who had a direct experience of WorkChoices and that was one of the reasons that there was a change in government , as well , not simply because Rudd positioned himself as Howard light , although I take your point .
Absolutely , he did .
Perhaps
I 'm not as altruistic as you , but I think conceivable that - I mean , I read today that there was conniption fits in Melbourne with the Labor Party saying to Kevin Rudd , " You 're not on message .
Basically you 're doing a bad job within the media , you know , presenting what your views , separate or not from the Coalition 's as they may be , " and he has become progressively a dreadful communicator .
The man , to my mind anyway as a casual consumer of political news media , seems far more interested in what The Chaser , Robin Williams or two - bit comedians from Sydney are doing than in the national agenda .
It 's his obsession with pop culture , I think .
TONY JONES : All right , let 's go to Brendan O'Connor .
Do you want to address the question ?
Kevin Rudd has turned away from commitments such as real action on climate change , ending mandatory detention of refugees .
What choice do votes have in the upcoming election ?
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Sure , and look ...
TONY JONES :
And as you know there 's been a flow - a flood , really - of votes to the Greens .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Sure .
Look , I think that the only surprise in an election year that that we should have had would have been in the polls or the views of people did n't converge .
The fact is every election we have in this country is a two - horse race .
Every election we have in this country is close and should never be assumed .
Never assumed by a government or by an opposition .
And , look , that 's healthy for democracy and , in fact , I guess it means that government has to work harder , if it 's message is not getting out , but I think it 's unfair to categorise the government as changing its position .
The fact is it went into the last election with a commitment to introduce climate change .
It 's been stymied in the senate .
The change of leadership in the coalition , as Sophie said , did bring about a change .
It meant that for - what we did n't have was the two major parties supporting serious attention to climate change and mitigating its effects .
TONY JONES : Well , Brendan O'Connor , take us , if you can , into the caucus room today , because you were there , and let 's test the limits of free speech in politics .
What was it like , because we understand a tremendous amount of angst was directed by nervous backbenchers at the Prime Minister ?
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Well , I think the media played up the so called angst .
Each party room have their discussions around what they must do .
The Prime Minister has laid out , I believe the - and I think we forget this in the recent debate about polls , the things that have been undertaken successfully by the government .
The fact ...
TONY JONES : But was he put under pressure in the caucus room ?
That 's really what I was asking .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Well , I think , it 's important ...
TONY JONES : I 'm trying to get a sense of what it was like in there .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Sure you do .
TONY JONES :
And you 're the only person on the panel who was there .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : And caucus 's are for parties to discuss matters but the important thing is to remind - and I think the Prime Minister emphasised this - to remind the Australian people that we confronted the greatest economic challenge of our lifetime with the global financial crisis and we came out of that global financial crisis the best performing economy and that has taken up a large part of the government 's time , and as it should , Tony , because we are now - we have the second lowest unemployment amongst advanced economies .
We have the lowest deficit and debt and we have 200,000 jobs ...
TONY JONES : All right .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : ... which would n't have been there if we had n't respondent to the global financial crisis .
TONY JONES : I 'm just going to interrupt you , because a web questions has come in - just come in from Joe Kunnel or Kunnel in Victoria .
" Can the Labor Party guarantee the Prime Minister will serve a full term if re-elected , or will the leadership be handed over to Julia Gillard ? "
You might want to take that one up , Brendan O'Connor .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Look , I think that 's a nonsense .
People would like to , you know , speculate on these matters .
The Prime Minister will go to the election as our leader .
If we have the confidence of the majority of the Australian people he 'll be our Prime Minister for the full term .
I mean , there 's no question that that would be - there would be a different scenario .
TONY JONES : Let 's just hear quickly from Sophie on that .
SOPHIE MIRABELLA : Tony , if Kevin Rudd was fair dinkum about the ETS , he'd be a man of his word .
And he talked tough about going to a double dissolution .
He 'd go to it .
But he guts out because he knew what he was presenting was a dud .
He knew he could n't sell it because he probably did n't even understand it himself .
It was an absolute dud .
The Greens opposed it .
We opposed it and he should have lived up to his word but like with so many promises , he just moves on to the next sideshow and ...
TONY JONES : Okay .
No , that was n't the question at all .
The question was whether you a expected a change of leadership .
SOPHIE MIRABELLA : Well ...
TONY JONES : Let 's just have a quick answer to that question then we 'll move on .
SOPHIE MIRABELLA : Yeah .
Well , if I was the Labor Party , I would be asking myself who would be better placed to performer better against Tony Abbott and when you answer that question you will answer the question of who should be the preferred leader .
Look , if it gets desperate enough , I think there are enough people in the Labor Party who do n't have too much affection for Kevin , who would support Julia Gillard because perhaps she would be their best chance .
It depends what happens with the polls , and it depends how many other people Kevin Rudd abuses in his office behind closed doors .
TONY JONES : Okay .
I 'm going to bring in our international guest .
Kaiser Kuo , how much affection is there for Kevin Rudd in China ?
KAISER KUO : Well , he 's a Mandarin speaker and so naturally the affection is boundless .
I mean , he 's actually a pretty competent speaker of Mandarin .
HELEN RAZER : He really is ?
KAISER KUO : He really is .
He 's really not bad .
I 've heard him speak .
TONY JONES : That 's what I mean ...
KAISER KUO : I 'm just ...
TONY JONES : Sorry , go ahead .
KAISER KUO : I 'm struck by the similarities - I mean , the parallels are n't perfect , of course , but for what Barack Obama is facing in the US .
I 'm an American citizen and I watch American politics , of course , much more closely , you know .
Obama was also being chastised by people to his left for failing to attack Wall Street vigorously enough , for failing to close Guantanamo as quickly as he had promised , for not pulling out of Iraq as quickly as he'd promised - for a whole bunch of things that have been disappointing to the left .
Of course , he 's not at 14 per cent approval rating right now , but , you know , after pushing healthcare through , things really - the troops rallied again and we have a robust president once again .
TONY JONES : Yes , we had an attempt at health reform , as well .
Okay , you 're watching Q&A .
It 's live and interactive and if you 'd like to ask a question you can go to our website - the address is on the screen - to find out how to do that , how to join the studio audience or upload a video question , like this one from Thomas Karpiniec in Hobart .
THOMAS KARPINIEC :
The net is not some robot but the result of how everyone uses it .
Since the internet is effectively a democracy in its own right , do you believe that any nation should have the right to impose regulations upon it ?
Could it have its own sovereignty ?
TONY JONES : Brett Solomon , what do you think ?
You 're championing internet freedom .
Should it or could it have its own sovereignty ?
BRETT SOLOMON : Well , in a sense it does .
I mean , it is - you know , it is not just a tube or a channel , it 's a whole environment which we operate in , which we shop in , we bank in , we communicate in , we meet our lovers and we get divorces in and , of course , we do politics in .
And I think this is , from my perspective , the key issue is like how do we actually keep this sovereign space open when at the same time there 's all - it's a death by a thousand cuts .
We 've got , you know , the Chinese with the great firewall of China , we 've got the Iranians censoring the internet , we 've got the Australian government and , you know , Brendan to my right championing this internet filter , which , you know , seems to - all relatively sane people to be , you know , a crazy move , when we have got this opportunity to express in a way which we 've never been able to do before .
So I do think it 's almost like a sovereign space , but the regulation that we want to involve in it or that we want to impose upon it should be very light - handed because the more that we regulate , the more that we impose , the more that we filter , the more that we censor , the less space that 's available for us to experience in the way that we have over the last 15 years or so .
TONY JONES : Let 's hear from Kaiser Kuo on that , because you were given the role of opposing that view .
KAISER KUO : Sure , I 'll step up as villain here .
With all due respect to Brett , who I admire greatly , I think that 's a bunch of techno - utopian fallacy .
These cables , these servers or routers , they live in physical space .
They cross international borders .
There are sovereignty issues that come into play and we must not , you know , ignore these .
The kind of , you know , enthusiasm that we mustered over , say , Iran , where there was tremendous international support , including support in China , where people turned their Twitter avatars green in support of the Iranians , look what actually happened in Iran ?
Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , these were all double - edged swords .
They were used to round up dissidents .
We can live in these fantasy worlds like this but , you know , the real rules apply .
TONY JONES : Is n't that what China uses email for : to round up dissidents ?
KAISER KUO : Yeah , unfortunately yes .
I mean , and China is a terrible example of it .
China regime of censorship is particularly Draconian .
I know , I have to live there all the time but there 's no question in the minds of the Chinese that these ideas of yours that it exists somehow above the petty fray of nation states - well , that 's just nonsense .
BRETT SOLOMON : It 's not that - I do n't - I mean , the idea that it 's some sort of fantasy world , I think , is inaccurate .
I mean , the internet itself was designed as a multi- polar distributed , equal space , and I think ...
KAISER KUO :
The internet itself was designed so that governments could survive nuclear catastrophes .
HELEN RAZER : Like all technology , it is the by product of war .
You do have a point .
BRETT SOLOMON : The internet , but the World Wide Web is a ...
KAISER KUO : Sure .
BRETT SOLOMON : ... is actually designed as a space for all of us to engage in and play with in the way that we - I mean , have we ever seen such an extraordinary explosion of political participation , of personal expression ?
And I 'm not a cyber-utopianist .
I completely understand the limitations upon the internet .
I understand how the internet has been used by regimes to filter and to survey and to monitor , but if you speak to the people on the streets of Iran , which I do regularly , and you speak to the people , similarly , that you do on the streets of China , this is a lifeblood to communication , to expression ...
KAISER KUO : Absolutely .
BRETT SOLOMON : ... and a boon that 's never been experienced like this before so ...
TONY JONES : Okay .
HELEN RAZER : I 've seen you speak , Kaiser .
I 'm sorry .
TONY JONES : No , that 's okay .
Go ahead .
HELEN RAZER : I 've seen you speak and by your own admission you say the internet has no off switch .
I mean , even though China and now in Australia apparently we'd like an off switch for the internet , you can't deactivate it , so surely we have to , rather than talking about what the internet should or should n't be , because it just is .
You know , it 's such a ...
BRETT SOLOMON : But that 's actually wrong .
KAISER KUO : ( Indistinct )
TONY JONES : No , I 'm going to bring you back to something very basic , which is the question , and the question asked .
The first part of it ...
HELEN RAZER : I was getting there .
TONY JONES :
Do governments have the right or should governments have the right to regulate the internet .
That was the first part of the question .
What do you think ?
Does china have a right to regulate the internet with the great firewall et cetera , as it does ?
KAISER KUO :
It certainly has a right .
Whether it 's right in doing so is another question entirely .
I think that in 99 out of 100 instances it 's absolutely wrong in the way that it carries out internet censorship .
TONY JONES : Can you see a defence of them regulating the internet heavily , because I know that you 've actually written about the speed that information travels ...
KAISER KUO : Sure .
TONY JONES : ... as compared to when the Bill of Rights was brought down in American .
KAISER KUO : I 'll sum that up very quickly .
In the year 1789 when James Madison and his cronies wrote the Bill of Rights and really enshrined the idea of freedom of expression for the first time , what was behind the proverbial floodgates , there were - you know , there was nothing .
Information travelled at the speed of a galloping horse .
It crossed the oceans at the speed of a clipper ship .
The literacy rates were alarmingly low .
The franchise was held by only a few educated , elite men .
This was a very different world than if you fast forward to 2010 in China , where there are 404 million people using the internet , where there are twice that number of people carrying around with them every day a device capable of sending text , pictures , all over the world instantaneously , so there 's a lot more water behind that floodgate .
I argue that we should have more internet freedom in China , in Iran , everywhere , but the realities are that blowing it open with a dam buster is going to be absolutely catastrophic .
Gradualism is a preferable way to go .
I think that they 're not pushing fast enough .
I think that it 's not gradualism that 's granted by the state that matters but what 's taken by the people that really matters but in recognising that gradualism is a viable option , you must recognise that some modicum of control must exist in the time being .
HELEN RAZER :
So you 're saying free speech is all right , as long as it's only exercised by the founding fathers ?
KAISER KUO :
No , that 's not what I 'm saying at all .
That 's a complete twisting of ...
BRETT SOLOMON : Can I just jump in there ?
TONY JONES : I did n't read it like either .
BRETT SOLOMON : I understand the process of , you know , ensuring that there is n't like a revolution perhaps .
KAISER KUO : Right .
BRETT SOLOMON : Maybe I do n't .
But the point is that , you know , we have more people , more bloggers in jail in China than any other country .
We have cyber ...
KAISER KUO : And I object to that .
I think that is absolutely a horrible thing .
BRETT SOLOMON : And ...
KAISER KUO : I am not defending human rights violations here .
TONY JONES : Okay .
We 're going to come to more of this later .
I want to hear from the politicians .
Let 's hear from Brendan O'Connor first and let 's bear this in mind .
The US Ambassador , Jeff Bleich , came on this program not so long ago and very passionately said , " The internet needs to be free , the way the skies have to be free , outer space has to be free , polar ice caps have to be free , the oceans have to be free , " and he was pointing at your government and say ...
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Sure , we 'll that 's a ...
TONY JONES : ... you 're about to diminish that freedom .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : I 'm not sure the skies are entirely free .
We have to regulate the skies for a whole range of things , including aviation industry .
But , look , I think fundamentally ...
HELEN RAZER : I think it was a metaphor .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Well , I think it was - well , good on you , Helen but the fact is ...
HELEN RAZER : Tread softly .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : ... the fact is it was a mixed metaphor or at least it was not a perfect one .
The fact is this that the government believes that - we believe that the internet is a magnificent education tool .
It 's a magnificent social tool and it is an exciting virtual world that can be used and should be used by our citizens and it 's critical for people 's learning and engagement .
That is a given .
The issue then as to what we would look to restrict comes down to the national classification scheme that we have in place now .
We have a classification scheme in place now to restrict certain material .
Certain material in film , in publication and we do so because we are concerned about some material causing harm .
Either causing harm to all members of the community but particularly causing harm to minors .
Such things as ...
TONY JONES : Well ...
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Can I - but this is really important .
TONY JONES : No , we 're going to talk in more detail about the filter .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : So if we 're going to talk - sure .
TONY JONES : I promise you there are questions specifically about that .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Okay
So there 's ( indistinct ) ...
TONY JONES : I wanted to hear your general position on internet freedom and from you , Sophie Mirabella ?
SOPHIE MIRABELLA : Well ...
TONY JONES :
And bear in mind that your colleague Joe Hockey has championed internet freedom .
Do you do so equally ?
SOPHIE MIRABELLA : Oh , I 'm very familiar with Joe 's views and we have robust debates in the Liberal Party room .
As a general rule , of course , I would err on the side of saying , well , governments should be quite judicious in the exercise of any censorship , whether it's on the internet or elsewhere .
Having said that , we do , as a coalition - we would support something if we were convinced that that it did actually protect children and restrict their access .
Our problem with the government 's current proposal is we 're not convinced from a practical perspective it 's going to work .
We 're not convinced it 's actually going to do what it says and protect children .
It will - it may give parents a false sense of security .
The fact that the government has n't been able to prove to us or provide legislation to outline how it will practically work leaves a lot of questions unanswered .
TONY JONES : Okay .
No , we 're going to come to those questions .
We actually have a question in the audience from Greta Coll .
We 'll take that first .
I note some people have got their hands up .
We 'll come to you later .
GRETA COLL : My question is for Kaiser Kuo .
What is it about the internet that you think provides us with too much freedom and too much choices rather than challenging our beliefs ?
KAISER KUO : I do n't think that that 's a fair restatement of anything that I 've said .
I do n't believe that it provides us with too much freedom .
I think that there are specific circumstances and these tend to be sort of culturally determined in which freedoms can actually - when exercised poorly , can result in genuine human suffering .
Let 's take the case of India for example .
Google has been a uniform champion internationally for internet freedom .
But in India they practice censorship .
The social networking service Orkut there routinely is censored by Google at the behest of the Indian government because in its absence - in the absence of censorship , anything that impugns the honour of a Hindu nationalist party , like Shiv Sena , can result in people rioting and burning buses and it has happened .
They 've attacked internet cafes and burned them and there have been deaths that result .
There are times , and I do n't think this would happen in Australia .
I certainly do n't think it would happen in the United States , where this is a problem .
TONY JONES : Let me ask you this : you 've made an argument about the internet being a space that creates confrontation between , for example , Chinese citizens and American citizens .
About the only place them meet in large numbers is on the internet .
KAISER KUO :
That 's right .
TONY JONES :
And you talk about this distinction between red guards and rednecks .
KAISER KUO : Well , I ...
TONY JONES :
So that you actually get a very bad result from this from this interaction .
KAISER KUO : I do n't - when I point this out , I 'm suggesting that there needs to be ways to engage each other still on the internet and not with fetters on , with a little more compassion and understanding .
The rednecks - and the rednecks , of course , are , you know , the bigoted , the racist sort yahoos who - the hate filled anti-Chinese forces in the United States .
The red guards , on the other hand , are the sort of stridently nationalistic types .
These are - they 're sort of code words for them .
And they do - they do , you know , inhabit these spaces where Chinese and Americans find themselves online .
I mean , the answer is not to censor the internet .
That has nothing to do with it whatsoever .
I 'm just making an argument that these things do actually spill over .
They affect , they constrain and the strain international relations - the bilateral relations between China and the US .
HELEN RAZER : I mean , how do you gauge that and , also , how do you gauge - because I 'm desperate to know with the net filter and the other things that you oversee , such as the R18 - plus rating and what have you .
Is this evidence - based politics ?
Where is the evidence that these things - is this based on anything more than a gut feeling that certain materials will end in certain imitative behaviours ?
TONY JONES : Helen , you 've just taken us off the subject .
We 're going to go back to the internet filter shortly .
I 'm going to go to Brett Solomon just to respond to that , because there is a disillusionment about some aspects of the internet , and that is that it seems to be a place where people go to hear the views of people like them quite often and you find these spaces where you get these arguments and , you know , it is n't necessarily all positive , is it ?
BRETT SOLOMON : Well , I mean , there 's two different things here .
One is that people go to places where they want to hear and meet other people like themselves and then I think the point that Kaiser 's making is that they 're actually going to a place where they actually are hearing the opposite views of people that they dislike before they even get there and I think that , you know , from my perspective , yes , it 's true but we - where else would we have an opportunity for rednecks and red guards to actually meet ?
And I 'm sure that there is , you know , violence and aggression but there 's also contemplation and engagement and , I mean , if we just look at the 400 million users on Facebook and you think about that incredible engagement and connection that people have had across borders , across countries , across genders , across political perspectives , I mean this kind of engagement , I think , is new and , again , as I say , unheard of .
I know I 'm sounding like a cyber - utopianist and I know that , but it 's important that we see that there 's a whole spectrum of activities that are happening on the net here .
HELEN RAZER : And horrible things do happen on the internet .
Horrible things happen on Facebook daily .
One of them was Sarah Palin , of course .
The whole fiction of the death panels , evil men of the left who seemed to have no other task in life but to kill Sarah Palin 's offspring , that fiction was on Facebook .
I mean , I think Facebook 's a bit of an evil place .
I 'd sack myself .
TONY JONES : Okay .
You 're watching Q&A live and interactive .
If you 'd like to ask a question , go to our website - those of you with your hands up , we 'll come to you in a moment - the address is on your screen to find out how to do that , who to join the studio audience or upload a video question , like this one from the founder of Child Wise , Bernadette McMenamin .
Bernadette McMenamin in South Melbourne .
BERNADETTE MCMENAMIN :
Why should n't internet service providers be held much more accountable than they currently are for dissemination of illegal material , much of which is child pornography ?
Why should n't the government be supported in its efforts to prevent the sexual exploitation by introducing the filtering of child pornography ?
TONY JONES : Okay , let 's hear from Brett Solomon first ?
BRETT SOLOMON : Well , I mean , the internet filter as proposed by the government is just - it is just not going to work and for a number of reasons , but addressing the question here , I think that , you know , if we 're actually looking at protecting children , the subcategory that the filter is addressing now is refused classification .
That 's not going to stop any access to any porn sites at all .
Every single porn site that 's on the internet , apart from the ones that are in refused classification , will still be there .
The way to address this issue is through policing , through parenting and through education and all of the evidence says that .
You know , I had to agree with Sophie 's former boss ...
SOPHIE MIRABELLA : Why ?
Why ?
BRETT SOLOMON : Because ...
SOPHIE MIRABELLA : Because you 're biased ?
BRETT SOLOMON : No , because generally I disagree with many of the policies including on , you know , asylum seekers and climate change and so on but in relation to the filter , John Howard did actually pump out millions of copies of filters that could keep the home computer safe for the end user .
HELEN RAZER : Net Alert was a good thing .
I do n't know ...
BRETT SOLOMON : It was a good thing .
HELEN RAZER : I do n't know why the government suspended helpdesk support for Net Alert .
I mean , for the last eighteen months parents have n't had free government subsidised helpdesk to say , well , how do - and updates for the Net Alert at home , opt in system to say , " Well , how in heck do I use this ? "
So for the last 18 months we 've been completely unprotected .
TONY JONES : Brendan O'Connor .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Sure .
Look , the Net Alert , the previous government 's initiative , had a very , very low take up rate .
The issue about refused classification - I guess I disagree with at least one panel member , is about extreme violence , extreme sexual violence , including child pornography , which I can assure you is refused classification at a film level or any other form of medium and it has to , in my view , involve it being prevented wherever possible on the internet .
The issue about how we do that is a challenge and that 's why we 're continuing to talk to the sector about how we do that .
I do n't think there 's anybody in this room would think that if we could deny access to child pornography we should n't do that and that 's what the government is seeking to do .
Not to limit legal pornography , if you like , but to only limit what is already refused classification in film , you know , in newsagents in terms of buying certain material , on our library shelves - that type of material .
Limit it down to that .
We are dealing with the technical issues and , of course , we 'll continue to do that because what we do n't want to do is sacrifice the benefits of the internet as we go about fulfilling our objective in protecting people and also preventing outrageous , unlawful material being distributed , which exploits children .
HELEN RAZER : Not all RC material is illegal though , is it , just to get this straight ?
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : All RC material is - well , it is not - it's is unlawful in that it can not be distributed .
It does n't mean it was produced unlawfully .
But a lot of it has , yeah .
TONY JONES : Okay .
I 'm going to interrupt you because we 've got a couple of people with their hands up .
I keep promising to go to them .
They may be comments , they may be questions .
We 'll try and get a few of them .
You , sir .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : I just had a quick question for Brendan .
Is n't it the essential difference that the last time somebody took our choice away it was the national socialists with book burning and the good thing about Net Alert , was n't it , that it left the choice with the parents and with the individual citizen and the great shift that you 're advocating is to take our choice away from us ?
TONY JONES : I 'm going to take that as a comment and we 'll go up to the back there and this gentleman with his hand up right in the top corner there .
AUDIENCE MEMBER :
It 's my understanding that it is relatively simple to circumvent the proposed internet filter .
I was just wondering , if it is so simple as I have led to believe , would it not become publicly acknowledged how simple it would be and in the end redundant ?
TONY JONES : Brendan ?
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Well , that goes to the - clearly some of the technical issues that , in particular , Senator Conroy , as minister responsible for the internet , is engaged in .
But what we 've said is firstly let 's identify that material that we believe should be limited and it's consistent with the limitations placed on other forms of material or other medium .
Now , let 's first do that .
Let 's then tackle the question - the technical questions about how we do that .
I do n't think anybody - and just to ...
HELEN RAZER : They have been tackled though .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Can I just say - I mean , just in response to the question by the gentleman earlier , look , quite frankly , I 'd quite happily burn a book if it was entirely contained with child pornography and all we 're looking to do is to limit the material that 's offensive to almost everybody in the community .
TONY JONES : Brendan O'Connor , we saw on Four Corners earlier this evening that the UK , Canada , New Zealand and Scandinavia have child pornography filters at the ISP level .
They limit strictly child pornography , nothing else .
Why can't you do that here , if that 's what you 're really objecting to ?
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Well , and that 's the issue too .
It 's how we approach it .
So the first thing is we would be looking to have a refused classification list that would be applied to internet service providers .
The facts are , though , that the classification board does refuse other material of a - I would say of a highly offensive ...
BRETT SOLOMON : But , Brendan , we 've heard this .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Well , can I just say ...
BRETT SOLOMON : No , we 've heard the same point .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Hold on .
But there 's two - there 's two debates here though .
BRETT SOLOMON : But the ...
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : There 's two debates here .
Firstly , there 's how we go about ...
BRETT SOLOMON : You 've been through the consultation process ...
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Well , can I just finish ?
Can I just finish .
BRETT SOLOMON : ... and nobody wants this .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Well , can I just finish ?
I think the question ...
BRETT SOLOMON : ( Indistinct )
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Well ...
BRETT SOLOMON : Have you ever heard - can I just interrupt you ?
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Sure .
BRETT SOLOMON : Have you ever heard an American ambassador stand up publicly and say , " We 're having " healthy discussion " with Australians " ?
We 're in two wars with America and I 've never heard that phraseology .
I 've been to meeting after meeting internationally , and Australia is raised at every meeting .
This is ...
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Well , I 'd have to - sorry .
BRETT SOLOMON : This is a bad policy that wo n't work .
There are alternatives .
HELEN RAZER : Yeah , I mean ultimately it wo n't work .
It will ...
TONY JONES : No .
No .
I do n't want to appear like only the left side of my brain is working , so I 'd like to go over to this side .
Let 's hear from Kaiser .
Listening to this debate , do you have any particular thoughts ?
You 're obviously an expert on the internet .
KAISER KUO : Sure .
I mean my instincts , of course , are - I mean , as an American and as somebody who understands the banality of evil that is internet censorship , unfortunately , I think that it 's sad to see a country that so steeped in liberal traditions taking steps backward like that and sort of taking it out of the hands of teachers , of parents , of community members and putting this in the hands of government .
It 's , to me , a sad thing to see .
TONY JONES :
We 've just actually got a web question come in for you .
It 's from Matthew Solley in Kew .
" My question is directed at Kaiser Kuo .
Under what circumstances do you believe internet censorship is at all acceptable ? "
KAISER KUO : I think that I 've already answered that with the example from India , for example .
I think I could probably ...
TONY JONES :
You would n't - let 's take pornography as an example , because that 's what we 're discussing here ?
KAISER KUO : I do n't think that government mandated internet censorship ...
TONY JONES : Child pornography particularly .
KAISER KUO : ... of child pornography - I think that , you know , different communities will arrive at different solutions to these things .
The fact that a robust debate is taking place within Australia about this is a sign of a very , very healthy polity and of a liberal polity , which to me suggests that the debate should , you know , close very quickly around the idea that this is a bad idea .
HELEN RAZER : The material itself is illegal .
KAISER KUO : Right , the material itself is illegal .
HELEN RAZER : As you said , I mean , nobody wants it .
KAISER KUO :
That 's right .
HELEN RAZER : And anybody who does is not going to publicly own that .
KAISER KUO :
The other thing - right .
The other ...
HELEN RAZER :
The fact is the filter does not work to censor child pornography .
KAISER KUO : Again , right , the experience of China .
I leap the firewall of China daily .
I mean , I 'm on a VPN all day long .
I can watch pornography of an sort , you know , to my heart 's content from , you know , within the city of Beijing without any of the internet cops knowing about my nasty habits and ...
TONY JONES : I think they might know about it now , somehow .
Let 's go to this questioner down here on the floor .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Thank you .
My question is actually to the journalists on the panel , including Tony , since no one 's asking you many questions tonight .
TONY JONES : No , I do n't tend to answer them , either .
KAISER KUO :
He 'll take that as a comment .
AUDIENCE MEMBER :
Well , you were mentioning the blacklist earlier and it's quite a mysterious list .
Not many people even know what 's on it .
It 's kept private , despite being by a public - a government organisation .
John F Kennedy famously said , " Secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society . "
How , as a journalist , do you feel operating under such a regime of secrecy ?
TONY JONES : I do n't think you can just direct it at the journalists .
I 'm actually going to direct it to Sophie , because we have n't heard her for a while and then I 'll throw it back to Helen and to Brett .
SOPHIE MIRABELLA :
What 's your question ?
KAISER KUO : Is secrecy repugnant .
SOPHIE MIRABELLA : Is secrecy repugnant ?
Well ...
KAISER KUO :
In a free and open society .
SOPHIE MIRABELLA : Well , that 's - it's a rather theoretical and open question in a democracy - in a free democracy like Australia .
Yes , we have freedoms .
Yes , we have rights .
But we also have limitations .
You can go out in the street and do whatever you can and there are reasons to have secrecy .
There are issues of national security , for example , that require a certain level of secrecy .
We can't even access cabinet documents for 30 years and there are reasons for that .
But there are rights that are quite rightly not absolute .
We live in a sophisticated democracy and we can't just think in black and white .
TONY JONES : Okay , we 've got quite a few people with their hands up .
I 'm just going to go round now .
Maybe it 's best to make comments here , so we can get a sense of what the audience is feeling .
We 'll start with this gentleman here with his hand up with the glasses .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : I guess I 'd make a statement about the fact that there 's billions and billions of pages on the internet with millions of more pieces of content being added every single day .
How does a ratings organisation possibly hope to actually classify all of this stuff and to do it accurately and in a timely fashion and in a non-punitive sense so you 've got lots of great content out there which possibly is going to get court up in all of this ?
TONY JONES : Okay , keep your comments brief like that .
That gentleman at back .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Just wondering considering that we do n't have legislated the freedom - the right to freedom of speech in this country , how are we going to ensure that this censorship is n't going to spread to other parts of society or be controlled by future governments ?
TONY JONES : All right .
We can actually throw that question directly to the minister .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Well , can I - I guess ...
TONY JONES :
That 's the fear , is n't it ?
I mean , people think this is a thin edge of the wedge .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Sure .
Sure .
TONY JONES :
Whether they 're right or not , that 's what they think .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : And that 's why I think applying the refused classification benchmark is important , because the refused classification benchmark has been there for years and it has to be undertaken cooperatively between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments and it is limited .
And I guess it becomes - and it's become , over time , a benchmark that 's been accepted by the community as the line that 's drawn .
But can I say the governments , and certainly the Labor Government , would always want to ensure that we can provide as much access to material as possible , but there are certain things - very limited things - that are so harmful and so extreme that certainly the majority in the community would not want to see disseminated or accessible .
TONY JONES : Just to pick up on that person 's point down there , the young gentleman who asked that question earlier , They 're so extreme that you 're not even allowed to know what they are .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Well , again , that 's another issue which is peculiar to the internet in this sense that you would list , for example , books that were to advise how to commit a terrorist offence or to incite sedition or whatever .
Those things might be limited because of the danger to people , the state , the community .
But with respect to an address , an URL , an address on the internet , the problem is just to publicly provide those addresses out would , of course , enable certain people to seek to actually hit onto those web pages .
HELEN RAZER : I understand that but how ...
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Can I just finish the answer ?
I was just going to say , but of course the government is mindful of that and that 's why I know Senator Conroy is looking at , for example , having an independent body that is at arm 's length from government making this - possibly a retired judge - making sure that governments are not making erroneous decisions .
Now , I mean , we are only - we 're doing this because - I mean , I agree scale of the challenge is - you know , is large .
HELEN RAZER :
And the list can actually only contain 10,000 effective URLS at a time , I understand .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : No .
BRETT SOLOMON : And I think the real issue here ...
HELEN RAZER : No , that 's what ...
BRETT SOLOMON : That is right .
HIS HONOUR : ... Senator Conroy said to ...
BRETT SOLOMON : That 's true .
HELEN RAZER : It can .
That 's the truth .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : ( Indistinct )
BRETT SOLOMON :
The other point here is that , I mean , inherent historically in censorship practice is mission creep .
I mean , this is what happens .
We start off with fine intentions and over periods you have the infrastructure in place and then you start to censor things that were not originally part of the - and can I just add , just coming back to the original point around broken promises and the Prime Minister , there was a consultation that this government went through , a very extensive one , about a human rights act , that would have enshrined the right to freedom of speech and access to information and freedom of expression and opinion .
All of that stuff could be enshrined in the Australian legislative framework at various different levels but last week and without many people knowing , the government also turned its back on that process and said that they would n't be implementing a human rights act .
TONY JONES : All right .
Now , as you know , we 're running tweets across the bottom of the screen .
You can't see them here but one just came in asking for a show of hands in the audience for who is against the filter .
Can we do that ?
That 's quite a lot .
Now , that 's probably more than the voters you lost in the past week .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : I do n't know .
TONY JONES :
What do you think when you see that , Minister ?
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Well , I guess I see ...
TONY JONES :
You get the sense that there 's a lot of people against you ...
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : I get a sense that a lot of people are concerned and , therefore , the government needs to assure the community that what we 're seeking to do is to only - and I repeat this for emphasis - only limiting the information that is either unlawful - I mean , you know , I 've got - as Minister for Home Affairs I 'm responsible and I work closely with the Australian Federal Police .
There 's an actual crime centre in Canberra that deals with the prevalence of child pornography being distributed throughout our community .
HELEN RAZER : Are you increasing the funding ?
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : And I can tell you - and I have - we 've had to dedicate more resources in this area because it is a real issue .
Now , I know a lot of people do n't - fortunately do n't come across this matter but it's a serious crime .
There are people willing to use this fantastic tool , this magnificent place , the internet , for improper purposes and there is an occasion in which we have to act to protect the interests of people .
The last thing we want to do is to restrict access to material or beyond what has been refused classification in this country for years .
TONY JONES : Okay .
HELEN RAZER : I simply must say this or I 'll explode .
TONY JONES : No. No. No . I 'm going to - sorry ?
HELEN RAZER : I 'll be apoplectic .
There 'll just be like a smear of Helen on the desk .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : Well , that 's a good thing .
HELEN RAZER : Oh , to think I once voted for you .
TONY JONES :
So are you going to come to your point or just explode ?
HELEN RAZER : No. No. No. No .
The minister just insulted me and it was pretty witty .
I had no comeback .
You know , right , because you 're a sensible bloke , you 're a smart bloke , you know that the net filter is not going to block any of Dante 's seven circles of hell , do n't you ?
You know that the NX lab tests only blocked world wide web pages - Conroy has publicly said that peer to peer technology wo n't be blocked .
Now , all of that evil stuff that any rational person feels nauseated by is not going to be blocked by your filter .
It 's not .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : That 's not right .
No , child pornography can be blocked .
The issue of ...
HELEN RAZER : No , not by your filter .
Maybe by somebody else 's filter , but not by the one that you have tested .
BRETT SOLOMON : Well - well , that 's not right .
HELEN RAZER : No , it is right .
BRETT SOLOMON : Okay .
Well , we 'll disagree .
TONY JONES : No , I 'm sorry .
All right .
Okay .
Let 's move on to another aspect of the web that seems to have discovered limits of freedom .
I 'm talking about the recent Twitter controversy .
We have a question here from Trish Marinozzi .
TRISH MARINOZZI : Following the sacking of Catherine Deveny after her Logie tweets the other day , from what I can see through the use of my own Twitter account , it 's just another medium where you can have your 140 - character rant into cyberspace .
What exactly is difference between doing that and saying those exact same words in a crowded , public space ?
TONY JONES : Yeah .
Helen Razer , you 've de-Twittered , for some reason , and perhaps you could explain to us why in the course of this answer ?
HELEN RAZER : Well , I think that anybody who has endured my rants this evening would know why I might remove myself from another public forum .
It seemed like the only sensible thing to do .
I , rather like Catherine , whom I know , unsurprisingly ...
TONY JONES :
Well , you 've shared some particularly obscene exchanges over a period of time and ...
HELEN RAZER : Have we ?
How do you know , Mr Tweet ?
TONY JONES : I gather they no longer exist .
HELEN RAZER : No , they do n't .
No , I just did n't feel that I needed to - they were n't particularly obscene .
I did n't leave a Hansel and Gretel , you know , trail of obscenity breadcrumbs on the internet .
KAISER KUO :
They were n't refused classification .
TONY JONES : I said ...
HELEN RAZER : What was the question , I 'm sorry ?
TONY JONES :
It 's about - I can't remember exactly , to be honest with you .
KAISER KUO :
The question is : is it any different for you to say this in a public space or on Twitter ?
TONY JONES : No , that 's right .
KAISER KUO :
And it comes back to my first question to you : is the internet special ?
TONY JONES : That is a good question .
Because Catherine Deveny actually said , " It 's like passing notes in class . "
HELEN RAZER : Yeah .
TONY JONES : " Except in this place you pass them to the principal . "
HELEN RAZER : Yeah , I can't concur .
I think that was a little disingenuous of her to say that .
I do it for the same reason that I presume that Catherine does it : because we 're dreadful show - offs and we ...
TONY JONES : Did you find yourself crossing the line , as she evidently has found herself doing and suffered as result ?
HELEN RAZER : Well , she is far better known than I am and was , up until last week , far more gainfully employed .
So she had a lot more to lose and I do n't attract as much attention .
But , no , I mean I did n't really cross the line .
TONY JONES :
So why did you stop doing it ?
HELEN RAZER :
There reason that I - this relates to some of the things that Kaiser was hinting at earlier .
I mean , the internet - I mean , whether you are a red guard or a redneck in real life , you can turn into one of those sort of fairly ideologically two dimensional people very easily on the internet and I found that happening to myself .
TONY JONES : Yeah , Kaiser , I just want to hear you on this Twitter phenomenon and do you agree with what you 're just hearing here ?
I mean , the internet can be a dark place ?
KAISER KUO :
Well , yeah , I mean to the young woman 's question - to the young woman 's question , I think that there is absolutely not difference .
There 's absolutely no - I do n't understand why the internet is constantly treated as a different form of media from the rest of them .
I really do n't understand it .
I do n't think there 's anything special or particular .
I mean , the scale of it , of course , is much larger , the connectivity is bigger but it does n't - it does n't , you know , remove itself from the same rules that govern ...
BRETT SOLOMON : Well , I think what 's happened ...
KAISER KUO : ... other forms of media , including conversation .
BRETT SOLOMON : I think what 's happened is that because technology has kind of added itself on top of , you know , our lives , we see it as two separate spheres .
But I think we need to get past that .
I think that the virtual world and the real world is the world now and it's only going to increase in that direction so the sooner we come to terms with that , I think the easier it will be for us to legislate and to regulate and to ...
SOPHIE MIRABELLA :
But I think - I think there 's a big difference between having a chat with your mates in the pub or saying something in a crowd and then putting something out there on the record forever and ever and it highlights the dangers of some social media that perhaps a lot of young people , a lot of teenagers are putting stuff out there , whether it's on Twitter or Facebook , that could come back to haunt them and I think that 's the salient lesson out of the whole Deveny affair that you can't just treat it as a conversation with a mate saying , " Ha ha , is n't this funny . "
It 's out there forever for people to criticise and comment on .
TONY JONES : All right .
We 've got people on the floor who want to make comments or ask questions .
AUDIENCE MEMBER :
And so my question is this that it seems to me quite clear that we are already identifying the dissidents , just as they are identified in China .
We are identifying them here via the internet and via Twitter .
So my question is , panel , are the people here tonight and the people on Q&A each week identified as dissidents to our government .
TONY JONES : All right .
No , I actually will take that as a comment .
We 'll hear from this gentleman down here .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Yeah .
Defining the fine lines , we all become much more alert into where we lean , which way we go .
I wonder how much we want to focus on rights rather than restrictions .
To me , I 'm inclined to focus on what are my rights to freedom of expression , without assuming a right to offend and damage a child in the production of someone 's entertainment .
TONY JONES : Okay , we 'll take that as a comment , as well .
This gentleman here with the green cardigan , yes ?
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Green ?
Oh .
TONY JONES : Oh , well , it appears that colour from here .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Cream .
TONY JONES : Cream , I beg your pardon .
AUDIENCE MEMBER :
There 's almost an interesting bit of irony here .
I mean , there 's rednecks and red guards ...
KAISER KUO :
You really like that phrase .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : ( Indistinct ) .
But our media seeks out extremes because it 's popular , because it wants to evoke , because it wants to sell add space , and in the same sense the internet does the same .
I mean it gets extremes and extremes attract attention .
I just wonder why were not - why , because we have this continuously in our media that , you know , that we are getting extremes that one side or another does n't like .
Why do n't we just train our children to understand and be able to interpret these wisely ?
TONY JONES : Yeah , well , let 's hear from Kaiser on that and I will throw that around to some of the rest of the panel and some of the other thoughts you can pick up on as well .
Kaiser ?
KAISER KUO : I mean , the grown - ups among us have not been able to do it .
How can we possibly expect to teach this to our children ?
TONY JONES : Brett Solomon , do you want to pick upon that ?
BRETT SOLOMON : Well , I mean I think this was one of the points that I made earlier is that education is really , you know , a key part of this .
It 's about a digital education .
It 's about us understanding the scope of this internet , the speed of it and it's not just the internet .
It 's also mobile technologies , as well , which puts a- whole - nother , you know , sort of immediacy factor and a more accessible factor into it .
But I think that , you know , it 's up to government and it's also up to civil society and non-government organisation and programs like this and the media to explain both to kids and to adults - and it is trial and error , as well .
TONY JONES : I mean , in a completely free society , it would n't be up to government , would it ?
It would be up to parents to decide and to educate their children .
When the government gets involved , that 's when people start to worry .
BRETT SOLOMON : No , but I 'm not talking about the legislation or the regulation .
I 'm talking about the educative process .
TONY JONES : No , fair enough .
BRENDAN O'CONNOR : I mean , Tony , there 's a really good initiative now that 's been - Microsoft and AFP and other sponsors have been involved talking to schools about alerting parents about some potential dangers for their kids if they 're online and trying to make sure the build a bridge between the virtual world that younger people have been on and with the parents , some of whom do n't engage at all in that world .
To say that , look , I think and fundamentally whatever filter - however successful it will be ultimately the success , I think , of this approach will be enhanced fully by education , by providing the information to people about what is the internet , what are potential risks , ensuring that the students and children generally talk to their teachers and parents about any issues that cause concern .
I think education will be a key issue and that 's why we 've got this program up and running .
TONY JONES : Helen , final word .
Brief one .
Sorry .
HELEN RAZER : That 's a bit of an ask .
You can't turn the internet off .
I can only agree .
All we can do is activate our awareness of the dangers that lurk therein .
TONY JONES :
That 's a good way to end .
We 've run out of time .
Please thank our panellists : Sophie Mirabella , Kaiser Kuo , Helen Razer , Brendan O'Connor and Brett Solomon .
Okay .
It 's budget week in Canberra and next Monday Q&A will present a special budget program with the Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner and the Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey .
So go to our website to join the audience or send your questions in and join us next Monday night to see the economic decision - makers go head to head .
Well , we 'll finish tonight with an animate comment from David Knight on Kevin Rudd 's opinion poll slide .
Good night .
Video : Exotic matter free fall
A capsule of exotic matter is readied for the big drop ( Image : Institute for Quantum Optics / University of Hannover )
What do you get if you hurl a cloud of rubidium atoms , together with computer - controlled lasers and a magnetic coil , down an empty elevator shaft ?
The answer is an exotic and fragile form of matter that is in just the right state to put a key assumption of Albert Einstein ’s theory of general relativity to the test .
Advertisement
Researchers recently succeeded in creating this fragile state , known as a Bose - Einstein condensate ( BEC ) , on a 110 - metre drop down what is essentially an elevator shaft with a vacuum at its centre .
It ’s the first time a BEC has been created in free fall .
Elevators have long helped elucidate physics .
Einstein ’s “ equivalence principle ” , which underpins general relativity , says that if you stand in a falling elevator , your acceleration should effectively cancel out the pull of gravity , leaving you unable to determine whether you are in free fall or whether there is simply no gravity present at all .
Fragile state
Determining whether quantum systems are also subject to this equivalence principle might help pin down why quantum theory has so far resisted any merger with general relativity – a mystery that haunts physics .
But finding a way to test the equivalence principle at the quantum scale has proved tough .
A BEC might help .
This is an ultracold form of matter dreamed up by Albert Einstein and Satyendra Nath Bose that exists at the boundary between quantum and classical physics .
The atoms in a BEC lose their identities and behave as a single quantum object , yet they take on macroscopic dimensions .
Unfortunately , putting a fragile BEC into microgravity – which is what is needed to test the equivalence principle – is no easy matter .
Now Ernst Rasel of the University of Hannover in Germany and colleagues have done just that , during a 4.7 - second plunge .
Their trick was to create a device consisting of computer - controlled lasers and magnetic coils that can turn a cloud of rubidium atoms into an ultracold BEC “ on the fly ” .
Candid camera
The atoms are initially cooled by laser , while trapped by a magnetic field and laser beams , before being transferred to a photon - free magnetic trap for the final stage of cooling , which involves kicking out the warmest atoms until only the coldest 0.1 per cent remain .
The result is a BEC , in which all the atoms adopt a single wave pattern and so form a single quantum object .
This device was loaded into a 2 - metre- long capsule and sent down a 110 - metre - long vacuum shaft .
It was programmed to create the fragile BEC 1 second after release – once the capsule has stopped vibrating .
The team knew their experiment had worked because just after the BEC formed it was released from the trap and floated into a space between a detection laser and camera on board the capsule .
The laser shone on the condensate , producing a shadow about 0.1 millimetres long that was captured by the camera .
An instant after that , around 3 seconds after the capsule was released , it hit the ground , coming to rest in a vat of styrofoam balls 8 metres deep .
“ It sounds amazing when it ’s crashed , ” says team member Waldemar Herr .
Interference pattern
Ignazio Ciufolini of the University of Lecce in Italy says the experiment lays the groundwork for “ probing the boundary between general relativity and quantum mechanics and helping to shed light on one of the main problems in physics nowadays : the merging of general relativity with quantum mechanics ” .
He describes it as an “ outstanding ” piece of work .
To test whether quantum states obey the equivalence principle , the researchers will need to hone their device further so that it splits the Bose - Einstein condensate .
This will allow them to send it along two separate paths and then determine if there is any differences between the two waves when they are reunited .
Rasel says his team is already working to create such an interferometer to drop down the shaft .
Journal reference : Science , DOI : 10.1126/science.1189164
( CNN ) -- Several thousand barrels of North Slope crude oil spilled into a containment area along the Alaska pipeline Tuesday when an open valve at a pump station allowed oil to overflow a tank , the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company said .
Alyeska said the incident took place about 10:30 a.m. ( 2:30 p.m. ET ) during a planned pipeline shutdown while the company was conducting fire command and valve leak testing at the pump station .
The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation said a battery failed to control the valve when power was switched from the main grid during Alyeska 's tests .
The valve has been closed , shutting off the flow , the department said , but the pipeline remains shut down .
The department said the next steps would be to clean up the oil in the containment area , determine the cause of the problem and restart oil flowing in the pipeline .
No oil has been reported outside the containment area .
Mark MacIntyre , a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency in Seattle , Washington , said two EPA coordinators would arrive on the scene from Anchorage on Wednesday and have a report in the afternoon .
The pump station is near Delta Junction , about 100 miles south of Fairbanks .
Ayleska said the lined containment area that took the spill has a capacity of about 104,500 barrels .
Ayleska also said there were no injuries and the pump station was evacuated .
An incident management team and other responders were dispatched .
CNN 's Nick Valencia contributed to this report .

Whorephobia can be defined as the fear or the hate of sex workers .
Sex workers like me would argue that it also embraces paternalistic attitudes that deem us a public nuisance , spreaders of disease , offenders against decency or unskilled victims who do n't know what is good for them and who need to be rescued .
In its most violent form , whorephobia kills .
Sex workers are far more likely to be murdered than the rest of the population : the recent killings in Bradford are the most recent and saddening example .
However , it would be a mistake to think that sex workers are the only targets of these murderers .
Attackers often target sex workers because they look like easier prey .
Sometimes it is only once a non-sex worker is killed that the police take an investigation seriously .
Until sex workers are safe , no woman is safe .
If men are the ones who attack physically , women are sometimes more prejudiced than men against sex workers .
In most languages , the most common sexist insults are " whore " or " slut " , which makes women want to distance themselves from the stigma associated with those words , and from those who incarnate it .
The " whore stigma " is a way to control women and to limit their autonomy – whether it is economic , sexual , professional , or simply freedom of movement .
Women are brought up to think of sex workers as " bad women " .
It prevents them from copying and taking advantage of the freedoms sex workers fight for , like the occupation of nocturnal and public spaces , or how to impose a sexual contract in which conditions have to be negotiated and respected .
Whorephobia operates as a way of controlling and policing women 's behaviour , just as homophobia does for men .
One solution could be to reclaim the insults .
Yet the English Collective of Prostitutes was criticised by the rest of the feminist movement in the 1970s for its slogan : " All women are prostitutes . "
It was indeed misunderstood – despite being a beautiful effort to unite sex workers and other women and to identify them as similarly oppressed and sexually and economically exploited .
The first step in the fight against whorephobia is to name the oppression .
Feminist theories help to identify it as at the intersection of gender , class and sexuality .
A further step would be to fight the hate crimes sex workers suffer instead of criminalising us .
The work of Shelly Stoops in Liverpool is a good example : her Armistead Street outreach project and collaboration with the Merseyside police have helped to build trust between officers and sex workers , who feel now able to report crimes .
That said , he was not very complimentary about the response so far .
" There should be a boom over here , " he said pointing across the harbour . " Unless they put a cap on that well in a week , that oil is coming in here .
A gallon of oil goes a long way in water , any sailor will tell you that . "

The head of Sweden 's National IT Crime Unit says that following the introduction of IPRED anti-piracy legislation it has become more difficult to track down serious criminals .
This unfortunate eventuality is a side - effect of ISPs throwing away logging data to protect the privacy of their customers .
While this protects casual file - sharers , it unfortunately protects serious criminals too .
On April 1st 2009 , Sweden introduced the controversial Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive ( IPRED ) .
The law , which gives rights holders the authority to request the personal details of alleged copyright infringers , was met with stiff resistance from ISPs .
Jon Karlung , CEO of ISP Bahnhof and one of the most outspoken opponents of IPRED , quickly announced that he would take measures to protect the privacy of his customers .
Although IPRED should ’ve made it easier to track down file - sharers , there is nothing in Sweden ’s Electronic Communications
Law that dictates that ISPs have to store information about the IP addresses they allocate to their customers .
To that end , Bahnhof stopped storing user data .
No matter how many requests they received from copyright holders , there would be no data to hand over .
Later Bahnhof was joined by Tele2 , with CEO Niclas Palmstierna announcing that his company would also stop storing IP address information .
Through an increasing number of ISPs , IPRED had effectively been neutralized .
While Swedish ISPs clearly felt they had little choice but to protect the privacy of their customers against civil action related to petty file - sharing , it seems that their response to IPRED has generated an unwanted side - effect .
Anders Ahlqvist , chief of the National IT crime unit says that due to a lack of customer logging data at ISPs , it is becoming harder for the police to track down criminals carrying out serious crimes .
“ It is a major concern , for example , when minors are exploited for sexual purposes via the Internet but we can not trace the perpetrators because logging information is missing , ” says Ahlqvist .
Taking IPRED out of the equation is not an option , though .
It appears there will be a new push to introduce a data- retention directive which will close the loophole and force ISPs to store customer IP address data in future , an eventuality predicted by IFPI lawyer Peter Danowsky back in April 2009 .

SALT LAKE CITY -- African - American Latter - day Saints are remembering an important anniversary in their faith and honoring the memory of pioneer Jane Manning James with an up - coming play about her life .
Who is ...
Jane Manning James ?
Jane Manning James was an early convert to the LDS Church and the first African American woman to come to the Utah Territory as a Mormon pioneer .
She converted to Mormonism in Connecticut and traveled hundreds of miles to Nauvoo , Illinois to be with other church members .
She was taken in by and worked for the prophet Joseph Smith and his family .
She and her husband arrived in Utah in 1848 ; they had eight children .
Jane was an early African - American member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .
She lived with Joseph and Emma Smith in Nauvoo and traveled to the Salt Lake Valley , suffering prejudices with courage .
The play " I Am Jane " honors her legacy .
" Because she did it under those circumstances , I can do it , and my children will be able to do it , " says Tamu Smith , who plays the part of Jane in the play .
" I think that it would be very difficult to be the first , but I 'm very glad that she was . "
Throughout her life , Jane petitioned Church leaders to receive temple sealing ordinances but was denied .
Mormon Times :
Curtain goes up on story of black Mormon pioneer
The life story of a black Mormon pioneer so inspired Keith N. Hamilton that he began saving his money ...
" Her story resonated with me as a person of faith , one who endured many trials , yet was so forgiving and so committed to what she believed in , " says Keith Hamilton , the play 's executive producer .
One of her descendants believes Jane knows of the 1978 revelation extending the priesthood to include black men .
" I think Jane would not only be happy , she would praise it herself .
She would say , ‘ It is a blessing come true ! ' "
Louis Duffy says .
" While her physical being , of course , is gone , her spirit is well .
Her spirit is here . "

On the back of Jane 's grave marker is the depiction of a famous story in her life , an act of charity in desperate times .
It shows Jane sharing half of her flour with Eliza Partridge Lyman , which helped that family survive .
Tamra Bybee , Lyman 's descendant , grew up hearing the story .
" I think it 's a legacy , not just to these two families , but to the human race ; and that 's why it needs to be told , " Bybee says .
The play " I Am Jane " will be performed June 9- 19 at 7:30 p.m. , with Saturday matinees at 2 p.m. , at the Grand Theatre at Salt Lake Community College .

For most of human history , doctors have killed their patients more often than they have saved them .
An excellent new book , Taking the Medicine : A Short History of Medicine ’s Beautiful Idea , and Our Difficulty Swallowing It , by Druin Burch , MD , describes medicine ’s bleak past , how better ways of thinking led to modern successes , and how failure to adopt those better ways of thinking continues to impede medical progress .
The moral is not that doctors once did foolish things .
The moral is that even the best of people let themselves down when they rely on untested theories and that these failures kill people and stain history .
Bleeding and mercury have gone out of fashion , untested certainties and overconfidence have not .
Burch ’s conversation with his rowing coach epitomizes the problem :
“ I want you to keep your heart rate at 85 % of max for the next hour and a half . ”
“ Why ? ”
“ Because it ’s the best way to improve your fitness . ”
“ How do you know ? ”
“ Because I ’ve done it before and it worked .
Because that ’s what the people who win the Olympics do .
I know , I ’ve trained some of them . ”
“ But has anyone actually done an experiment ? ”
“ What on earth are you talking about ? ”
This book is Burch ’s answer to his coach ’s question .
Medicine ’s “ beautiful idea ” is that we should test all hypotheses and beliefs using the kind of tests that are reliable for determining the truth .
Instead of going by tradition , authority , theory , common sense , or personal experience , we now have effective tools to find out for sure whether a treatment really works .
The scientific method developed slowly and there were a lot of hiccups on the way .
Researchers frequently misunderstood what constituted evidence .
In an early Chinese experiment , two people were asked to run together .
One was given ginseng ; the other , who did n’t get ginseng , developed shortness of breath .
They thought that was sufficient evidence to prove that ginseng prevented shortness of breath .
Galen gave one of his potions to a lot of patients : some recovered , some died .
He thought that was evidence that the potion worked , because
All who drink of this treatment recover in a short time , except those whom it does not help , who all die .
It is obvious , therefore , that it fails only in incurable cases .
Galen ’s fallacious reasoning is easy to spot , but a 20th century doctor committed a similar error .
He gave all his patients aspirin and asserted it was 100 % effective in preventing heart attacks .
Some of them did have heart attacks , but he did n’t count them because on close questioning he found that they had omitted doses or otherwise did n’t strictly follow the aspirin protocol ( which was probably equally true of all his patients ) .
Even after the importance of randomization was recognized , there were errors in applying the principle .
In early trials , randomization was by alternate allocation , where the first subject to enroll is put in group A , the second in group B , the third in group A , etc .
But doctors tended to bend the rules to put certain patients in the treatment group .
True randomization had to be forced on doctors who thought they knew what was best for their patients and who did n’t even realize they were cheating .
Humility is required of those who have theories rather than evidence .
If they design experiments simply to confirm their prejudices , they are in danger of designing bad ones or misinterpreting results .
The more researchers want to prove that the results were due to their favored treatment , the more exhaustive should be their search for alternative and equally reasonable explanations .
Burch ’s book is a history of medicine with many intriguing stories about people , personalities , penicillin , opium , thalidomide , and the other usual subjects of medical history ; but it is also an explanation of the scientific method and a commentary on modern medicine ’s failure to rigorously and consistently apply that method .
Despite our increasing acceptance of the scientific method , the term evidence - based medicine ( EBM ) did n’t appear in the medical literature until 1991 .
Critics of scientific medicine have unfairly claimed that less than 10 % of treatments are EBM .
Burch points out that evidence does n’t just consist of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , and that we have good evidence that parachutes save lives without having to do an RCT on parachutes .
The 10 % figure is way too low : a recent study estimated that 80 % of current treatments are based on evidence .
Testing and experiment have failed to protect us from deluded cures and poisonous remedies .
They ca n’t be relied upon unless they are carried out with method and rigor .
Understanding previous mistakes helps us to avoid them .
Burch has some harsh things to say about current medical research and the processes of drug approval .
Many treatments accepted as EBM are actually based on poor quality studies .
62 % of studies change the definition of what they are studying between ethical approval and publication .
Some studies are stopped prematurely because of apparently clear benefits or risks to patients : this is usually a mistake that diminishes the quality of data .
It might be better to finish the study as planned and harm a few patients today than to harm thousands of patients later because of a false conclusion .
People worry about withholding new drugs from needy patients while they undergo testing .
They worry about the ethics of offering placebos to patients when a new drug offers an apparently effective treatment .
But history has shown that the new drugs in these trials are just as likely to harm as to help .
A drug ’s effects , even if they are moderately large , can almost never be reliably figured out on the basis of personal experience .
Doctors are still reluctant to trust science when it goes against their prejudices .
He tells how cardiologists strongly supported the first Coronary Care Units ( CCUs ) .
A study was done comparing CCU treatment to home treatment for heart attacks .
The researchers told the cardiologists that there were fewer deaths in the CCU but that the difference did n’t reach statistical significance .
The cardiologists all thought this trend was a strong enough reason to insist on CCUs .
Then the researchers admitted they had lied : the numbers were correct but reversed .
The trend had actually favored home care .
Based on the same quality of evidence , the cardiologists now did not consider the data a strong enough reason to insist on home care !
Medicine is becoming more scientific and more evidence - based every day , but we can and should do better .
What is needed is a culture , regulatory and intellectual , where every attempt is made to ensure new medical interventions are used solely in randomized trials .
Only when their effects have been determined should they become available for use outside a trial setting .
Until then there is a moral obligation on doctors to use unknown drugs and treatments only in such a way as to come to an understanding of them , and a moral obligation on patients to demand treatments that are either supported by sound evidence or only given as part of a trial which will uncover some .
This is good advice for mainstream medicine , and it is even more important for alternative medicine , which Burch does n’t address .
Since by definition “ alternative ” medicine is medicine that has not been proven effective , following these guidelines would eliminate any use of alternative medicine outside of a clinical trial .
I know , the money is n’t there and it would be difficult to implement , but the principle is irrefutably sound .
( That ’s assuming that we want to avoid using placebos and find out what really works ; but I do n’t think the general public wants that .
I suspect they would resist and prefer to cling to untested beliefs . )
Here ’s a sampling of some of Burch ’s quotable words of wisdom :
There is a bitter joke in modern medicine : the violence with which someone makes an argument is inversely proportional to the amount of evidence they have backing it up .
Trials can be full of statistics ; difficult to understand and laborious to undertake .
They have a loveliness to them all the same , and it comes from their power to uncover parts of the reality we live in .
[ It is ] our nature to prefer credulity to doubt , confidence to skepticism .
We share a tendency to simplify and confuse things , to slip into mental habits that let us down .
The idea that even the most reasonable - sounding theories should be subjected to tests probably has more potential to make the world a better place than all the drugs that doctors possess .
Economics , politics , social care and education are full of policies that are based on beliefs held as a matter of principle rather than because they are supported by objective tests .
Humility , even more than pills , is the healthiest thing that doctors have to offer .
I highly recommend this book .
It ’s well - written , entertaining , and provides much food for thought .
It ’s a great way to learn about fascinating incidents in the history of medicine and a great way to learn what constitutes truly science - based medicine and how to avoid the errors of the past , the errors in thinking that we flawed humans are all susceptible to .
John Mather , along with George Smoot , won the Nobel Prize for his work on the Cosmic Background Explorer ( COBE ) , the probe that first caught glimpses of fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) left over from the big bang .
Those fluctuations are the product of the tiny , random , quantum fluctuations in the Universe immediately after the big bang , which are now visible in the large scale structures of the current Universe , as they produced clusters of galaxies and filaments of dark matter .
For his talk at the Lindau Nobel Laureates Meeting , Mather took the audience on both a short history of the Universe , and a history of how we 've come to understand it .
Mather started out with some background on the Big Bang — although he said he preferred the term used in a Calvin and Hobbes strip , the " Horrendous Space Kablooie . "
( We 'll continue to use Big Bang for now . )
He described how , in the early 1920s , Alexander Friedman applied Einstein 's equations to the Universe , and figured it must be expanding .
Einstein asked his friends , who told him the Universe could n't be expanding , so he added the cosmological constant in order to preserve the static universe that everyone thought existed .
Friedman died a few years after and , within a year , Hubble published his famous paper , providing evidence of an expanding universe .
( " In the same year we learned that the economy could collapse , we learned that the Universe is expanding , " Mather quipped . )
Mather showed Figure One of Hubble 's paper , with red shift ( and therefore speed ) rising with a galaxy 's distance from the Earth .
Once a consensus formed around the Big Bang model , things went through a bit of a slow period .
Information on the stability of free neutrons let theorists calculate the expected elemental abundances of hydrogen and helium , and later , the existence of the CMB was predicted , but there was n't any obvious way to detect it until Penzias and Wilson 's famous experiment at Bell Labs found the faint hiss of the CMB .
Now , according to Mather , a dedicated high school student could probably manage it .
About one percent of the snowflakes you see when you tune a TV in between channels , Mather said , can be ascribed to the CMB .
A useful failure
Mather started his work on the CMB back in graduate school .
He said the idea for COBE " came from the failure of my thesis project , " which was meant to measure the CMB via balloon - borne instruments .
As that work was failing , NASA put out a request for projects , and COBE was born .
Its ability to match CMB measurements with theory , immortalized by xkcd , COBE started off a new era of cosmology .
Mather briefly described our current understanding of the Universe .
A tiny fragment of a ( possibly infinite ) collection of material started expanding at a pace faster than light as a false vacuum decayed into a true one .
Within fractions of a second , matter and antimatter annihilated , leaving a tiny bias towards matter .
As inflation apparently went missing for billions of years , a steady expansion of space time and gravitational effects produced the Universe we now see .
But about 5 billion years ago , inflation returned as the expansion of space - time started to accelerate .
" We call the cause of this acceleration dark energy , which means we do not have any idea what it is , " said Mather .
Right now , we 're on version seven of the data produced by COBE 's successor , WMAP .
And we 've now got a model for the Universe that incorporates dark matter and dark energy called ΛCDM that matches the curves returned from WMAP just as well as early inflationary cosmology theory produced a curve that matched COBE .
Next steps
To wrap up , Mather talked about his next step : the James Webb Space Telescope ( he apparently liked working with NASA so much he decided to do so full time ) .
The Webb will focus on the red and infrared portions of the spectrum , which are difficult to observe from Earth .
This difficulty is in part because the atmosphere absorbs lots of the radiation in this range , and in part because there are so many sources of interference ( your own body , Mather pointed out , pumps out about 500W ) .
The Webb will have a large sun shade that will keep it at about 40 K for its operations .
It will also feature a large array of hexagonal mirrors that will direct light to its instrument package in a manner analogous to solar energy collectors .
" Think of it as a galaxy energy concentrator , " Mather said , noting that a key decision to target the infrared was made because the very first galaxies are now red-shifted into this region .
Many other objects , like stellar nurseries and planet transits , are also visible at these wavelengths .
Unlike the Hubble , the Webb has to work right the first time , since it will orbit over a million miles from Earth .
And working in this case does n't just mean focusing — the shield and mirror are too big to fit within a launch vehicle in their final configuration , so they 'll have to be compacted and then unfold in space .
Mather talked about the extensive testing being done to make sure we can launch it with confidence , an event currently scheduled for 2014 .
This is actually the second time I 've seen Mather speak in the last month , since he fielded questions from NASA fans at the World Science Festival in early June .
That audience was very different from the collection of Nobel Laureates and academic researchers here , but he handled both situations with what can only be described as grace , providing compelling descriptions of the science while maintaining a sense of the excitement of it all .
If you ever have the chance to see him speak , grab it .

Address 750 N. Midvale Boulevard
Suspect(s ) See below

Charges : Disorderly Conduct 947.01 & Resisting A Police Officer 946.41
Victim(s ) 43 - year - old male of Madison
Mr. Gulen , in poor health , rarely leaves this bucolic spot .
Speaking over a lunch of classic Turkish food , the insistently modest Mr. Gulen , the son of a small - town imam , did not appear to be to be the type of man to wield the influence he does .
A Koran student from age 5 and preacher at 14 , Mr. Gulen gradually built a vast following .
He has inspired the founding of an international network of schools , hospitals and businesses .
There is an Islamic bank , Asya , with billions in assets ; newspapers including Zaman , Turkey ’s largest daily ; and a television station , EBRU - TV , in Somerset , New Jersey .
All these are part of what others call the Gulen movement but its self - effacing leader refers to as the Volunteer Movement .
Mr. Gulen said it had brought him no personal gain , that his only belongings were a quilt , bedsheets and a few prized books .
He said he did not know “ how many countries this movement is active in , nor do I know how many teachers and students there are . ”
Asked at one point about the work of his followers , he replied , “ I believe that calling this movement the ‘ Fethullah Gulen movement ’ is not right , and doing so is disrespectful to many people dedicated to carrying out its activities .
My role in this movement is very limited , and there is no leadership , no center , no loyalty to a center , and no hierarchy . ”
But others say that there are more than 1,000 schools in more than 110 countries , and perhaps five million members .
Emre Celik , a Turkish - Australian who presides over the Rumi Forum , a Gulen - affiliated institute in Washington , recently visited one of the more farflung schools , on the island of Zanzibar , and says more in Africa are likely .
The schools are supported by wealthy Muslim businessmen .
There are several such schools in the United States , even one in Burma .
They impart Islamic values but , unlike madrasas , employ the official curriculum of whatever state they are in and emphasize modern science and technology .
The quality of education is considered high , and competition for spots is keen .
“ He ’s inspired a lot of people , ” said Mr. Celik , who is trained in computer science .
“ People like myself , second - generation Australian Turks , the Turkish diaspora , we ’re moved by his ideas . ”

May 9 , 2010 -- The May 2 internal preselection of United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) candidates for the September 26 national elections was an example of the mobilising force of this mass party in construction .
More than 2.5 million party members participated .
This demonstrated the PSUV is the largest national political force , and highlighted its democratic and participatory nature .
The participation rate was greater than the 2.3 million people who voted to preselect PSUV candidates for governors and mayors in 2008 .
More than 3500 candidates stood in the 87 different electoral circuits , for 110 deputy and 110 alternate positions .
The national leadership , headed by PSUV president Hugo Chavez — also the Venezuela 's president — will decide a further 52 deputy and 52 alternate deputy candidates for province - based lists .
Indigenous peoples will select candidates for the parliament ’s three Indigenous seats .
The results reflected , in a contradictory manner , the desire of the grassroots to put “ new faces ” in parliament .
Of the 220 candidates pre-selected , 44 are members of the PSUV Youth .
Stark contrast
In stark comparison , the right - wing opposition ’s Roundtable of Democratic Unity was unable to find a place for some of the right - wing student “ leaders ” touted by the private media .
The PSUV pre-selection was monitored by the National Electoral Council .
The opposition , however , held unmonitored preselection ballots on April 25 in only 15 of the 87 electoral circuits , to settle the most contentious areas .
The opposition claims 300,000 voters participated .
The remaining candidates were handpicked by leaders of various small opposition parties .
Of the 106 current deputies who ran for preselection as PSUV candidates , only 38 won ; 12 as alternates .
None of the most well - known trade union leaders were pre-selected as PSUV candidates ( three were chosen as alternates ) .
But a number of worker , community and peasant activists made the list .
Women made up 51 of the candidates ( 23 deputies and 28 alternates ) .
Discontent
Despite these results , some sections of the PSUV are discontented .
State radio station RNV was dominated by calls on election night from party members denouncing ventajismo — practices such as vote buying , bribery and using state resources as part of election campaigns .
Other candidates openly broke party regulations .
Despite a ban on campaigning on polling day , pro-government website Aporrea.org published photos and videos of election campaign material outside several polling booths : at least two candidates — members of the national leadership — broke the rules .
Some party officials were condemned for using their status to call local party assemblies , which were effectively election rallies and candidate press conferences .
Opinion piece headlines published at Aporrea.com in the aftermath of the elections read : “ The infiltrated right won ” , “ Grassroots steamrolled by machinery ” and “ So Dario [ Vivas , PSUV mobilisation and propaganda coordinator ] , when will the internal campaign norms of the PSUV be applied ? ” .
Chavez , who raised criticisms about the campaigning process days before , asked in his weekly column published on the day of the election : “ Was there ventajismo and abuse of power by some of the candidates or groups or tendencies that support them ?
In the hand moved by the most intimate consciousness of each one of you , compatriots , is the sacred decision of carrying out justice wherever it necessary , voting for those that are best [ to continue the ] socialist and Bolivarian project . ”
At a meeting analysing the preselections , left - wing PSUV activist Fernando Soto Rojas said : “ We continue to drag with us the vices of the past . ”
Soto Rojas came third in the electorate he stood for , behind Robert Serra .
Serra was recently parachuted in to coordinate the government - run house repair program .
Soto Rojas said those with “ institutional support , a media presence and a more or less adequate discourse ” were able to impose themselves in a contest where “ programmatic debate was generally absent ” .
Also ahead of Soto Rojas was Juan Contreras , a respected local community activist .
Contreras , who had said the primaries were a “ trap ” , denounced the “ grotesque and vulgar ventajismo ” .
Unless “ we bury the old culture ” plagued with vices like corruption , he said , “ we will end up with more of the same ” .
More political debate , education and organisation were needed to defeat “ the right wing that is embedded in the party ” , he said .
However , discontented party militants argued that , despite problems , the PSUV had entered a new phase .
They said it was necessary to “ close ranks ” to defend the process and defeat the opposition in the September elections .
Soto Rojas said the declaration of principles approved by the recent PSUV Extraordinary Ideological Congress would be key .
The declaration defines the PSUV as anti-imperialist , anti-capitalist , socialist and internationalist .
Soto Rojas said it was the duty of all PSUV activists to reach beyond the 2.5 million “ hardcore Chavistas ” that voted in the primaries and ensure the revolutionary forces win 6 - 7 million votes in September .
A recent poll by pro-government firm GIS XXI found if elections were held now , the PSUV would win with 32.3 % against 21.9 % for the opposition .
A further 35.8 % were undecided .

Diff 'rent Strokes star Gary Coleman dead at 42
Dead at 42 : Gary Coleman , pictured here last year , died today as the result of injuries suffered earlier this week
Diff 'rent Strokes actor Gary Coleman died today as the result of injuries he suffered during a fall earlier this week .
He was 42 .
His wife , Shannon Price , 24 , made the decision to switch off his life support machine this morning .
A spokeswoman for the Utah Valley Regional Medical Centre confirmed Coleman died at 12.05 pm local time .
Family members and close friends were by his hospital bedside .
A spokesman for Coleman said : ' We are very sad to have to report Mr Gary Coleman has passed away .
' He was removed from life support ; soon thereafter , he passed quickly and peacefully .
By Gary ’s bedside were his wife and other close family members .
' Thanks to everyone for their well wishing and support during this tragic time .
Gary is now at peace and his memory will be kept in the hearts of those who were entertained by him throughout the years . '
Coleman was rushed to ICU on Wednesday afternoon after suffering what his family called ' a serious medical problem ' after falling at home and hitting his head .
He later fell into a coma and was on life support after suffering a brain haemorrhage .
TMZ , the website which broke the news of Michael Jackson 's death , was the first to report Coleman 's death .
It was the actor 's third hospitalisation this year , after suffering seizures in January and February .
The 4ft 8in star 's growth was stunted by a congenital kidney defect and he had also had two kidney transplants .
Coleman played diminutive rascal Arnold Jackson and his famous line , ' What you talkin ' ' bout Willis ? ' , became a pop culture catchphrase .
But he was never able to recapture the stardom he enjoyed as a child and teenager .
As an adult , he would appear on some programmes , but much of his work went straight to video .
Troubled star : Gary Coleman ( top right ) with Diff 'rent Strokes co-stars Dana Plato , Conrad Bain and Todd Bridges
However , he was still often in the headlines in the U.S. - mostly for the wrong reasons .
In 2007 , he was arrested after a ' heated discussion ' with his wife .
He was cited for misdemeanour disorderly conduct by Utah police .
Two years later in July 2009 , he and Price were once again involved in a domestic dispute in which his wife was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence .
His temper got him in trouble again earlier this year when he was arrested on domestic violence assault charges .
This time he spent a night in jail .
Coleman lost most of his fortune in a protracted legal battle with his adoptive parents , who had control of his wealth until he was 18 .
By the end , he was left with just $ 200,000 ( £ 140,000 ) .
Heartbreaking decision : Coleman 's wife Shannon made the decision to switch off his life support machine this morning
After menial jobs , including working as a security guard , he was forced to sell off his personal items - among them the bowling shoes he wore in Diff 'rent Strokes , which went for $ 100 .
In 1999 , he filed for bankruptcy .
Perhaps most bizarrely , he ran in California 's 2003 governor election and came eighth .
The curse of Diff 'rent Strokes is well documented .
Dana Plato , who played Kimberly Drummond , died in 1999 at the age of 35 from an overdose after a long battle with drug and alcohol addiction .
TV catchphrase : Coleman , who played Arnold Jackson , became famous for his line , ' What you talkin ' ' bout , Willis ? '
Todd Bridges , who played Willis Jackson , battled cocaine addiction for several years in his 20s .
Mug shot :
The actor after he was arrested on a domestic assault charge in January
In 1988 , he was arrested and tried for the attempted murder of Kenneth Tex Clay , a Los Angeles drug dealer , who , prosecutors argued , had been shot by Bridges while he was ' high ' .
Bridges was eventually acquitted of all charges by a jury .
Bridges , now 44 , claims to be clean from drugs and has become a Christian and speaks to young people about the dangers of narcotics .
Diff 'rent Strokes revolved around a simple premise : the adoption by white millionaire Philip Drummond of two orphaned brothers from Harlem , and their enforced relationship with their new sister .
It ran for eight seasons between 1978 and 1986 , racking up 189 episodes , attracting the kind of ratings enjoyed by Dallas , M* A * S*H and The Dukes Of Hazzard .
It turned Coleman into the highest paid actor on TV at the time , pulling in $ 100,000 each programme .

Pakistanis have a seemingly insatiable appetite for political news .
Since the news media was liberalized under former President Pervez Musharraf , that hunger is being fed like never before .
Eight years ago Pakistan had one television news channel .
Now there are 26 news channels , half of which broadcast 24 hours a day .
But most of what is on offer hardly qualifies as rigorous , fact - based news .
Rather , shows follow a familiar formula of a roundtable discussion by middle - aged men hashing out political conspiracies .
If that problem sounds familiar to an American audience , consider that in Pakistan it has taken on daunting proportions .
That media phenomenon is what today ’s video report , “ Losing the Media War in Pakistan , ” attempts to capture .
Media critics here say the problem lies with a lack of experienced reporters , and a lack of investment in investigative journalism , which has created a troubling tilt toward right - wing , highly opinionated talk shows .
After all , talk shows are cheaper to produce , and easier to make .
sabirnazar.blogspot.com
Granted , hard - hitting journalism in this country can often be dangerous , but another problem is sourcing .
The same relative handful of personalities make rounds on the talk show circuit .
Same people .
Different day .
Different channel .
Most are more opinionated than informed , and as a result , talk shows are giving prominence to incredible sources .
For example , one of the more hard - hitting hosts is questioning a politician from an Islamic party who is convinced that the United States staged the Times Square bombing .
His political résumé centers on education and religious affairs , not security , international affairs or terrorism .
At one point , he even forgets the name of the bomber .
The host does not press him to back up his claims .
Why is a national television program asking a politician without credentials in international security about a closed investigation taking part in another country ?
In some respects , the blame can be shared among conspiratorial guests , the ratings - obsessed producers who book them , and pandering hosts who play to their audience ’s worst instincts .

Greg Nielson pushed a joystick , and a video camera zoomed in on three men in moon suits and gas masks as they prepared to blow up a weapon of mass destruction less than five miles from the White House .
Later , the crew slid the rusting World War I artillery shell into a small steel vault and sealed the door .
They detonated a shaped explosive charge to cut the projectile open , and pumped in reagent to neutralize its contents : liquid mustard , an infamous chemical warfare agent .
The process is “ as safe as sliced bread , ” said Nielson , the operation leader , at a control panel in a nearby trailer .
“ Maybe safer . ”
The destruction of five poison - filled shells and 20 other suspect items ended last week .
But the strange saga of America ’s most unusual hazardous waste site is far from over .
Since 1993 , the Army Corps of Engineers has removed 84 chemical - filled shells and more than 1,000 conventional munitions , plus at least 44,000 tons of contaminated dirt and debris , from the verdant campus of American University and the manicured lawns of Spring Valley , one of Washington ’s most prestigious neighborhoods .
The toxic trash dates from 1917 and 1918 , when the military leased the then - rural campus and nearby farms to test gruesome gases .
After the war , soldiers and scientists buried lethal leftovers in unmarked pits , calling the area Death Valley .
A developer renamed it Spring Valley , and mansions sprouted .
Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson , Richard Nixon and George H.W. Bush lived here before they entered the White House .
U.S. Atty . Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. and Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , among other top officials and foreign diplomats , reside here now .
The Pentagon says 5,000 old arsenals and other former defense sites may hold hazardous waste .
But the bomb hunt here “ is the No. 1 priority , ” said Col. David Anderson , the Army Corps district commander .
“ This is the nation ’s capital . ”
The Army has spent $ 180 million and expects to spend $ 15 million more to finish the job , Anderson said .
So far , government agencies and independent studies have not found adverse health effects on American University students or the 4,000 or so residents of Spring Valley .
“ Overall , community health is very good , ” said Beth Resnick , coauthor of a 2007 study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .
“ Cancer rates overall are low .
Mortality rates are low . ”
She said a new study may focus on several people who lived near the burial pits and reportedly suffered rare cancers , blood disorders and other ailments .
It ’s not known if military waste played a role .
For now at least , the oak - shaded streets buzz with lawn mowers , not public outcry .
Property values are stable , and activists acknowledge that few residents share their suspicion that the Army Corps has downplayed dangers and concealed data , a charge the Army denies .
“ They ’re deliberately misleading people , ” said Nan Wells , who represents part of Spring Valley in local government .
“ They just want to leave . ”
Tom Smith , another Army Corps critic , said many residents have become complacent .
“ We ’ve grown a little too accustomed to having the Army in our backyards , literally in our backyards , for the last 17 years , ” he said .
The yard that causes the most concern is between the official residence of South Korea ’s ambassador , Han Duk - soo , and the white - columned house of American University ’s president , Cornelius Kerwin .
Previous digs unearthed more than 300 munitions and chemical weapons debris on the South Korean property and toxic chemicals beside the AU house .
A high fence with barbed wire guards the current excavation , known as Pit 3 .
A two - story , tent - like structure covers the hole to prevent leaks .
It also hides the men in hazmat suits and breathing apparatus on a winding street of stately homes and purple azaleas .
Engineers believed the digging was almost finished until they uncovered more than 500 pounds of jugs , beakers and other laboratory glassware this spring .
On March 29 , a broken bottle spewed smoke inside the containment tent .
Tests show the fumes came from arsenic trichloride , which is poisonous by inhalation , skin contact or ingestion .
Known as “ arsenic butter , ” the compound was used to boost the lethality of mustard , a blister agent that reportedly caused more than 1 million casualties in World War I , and to produce lewisite , dubbed the “ dew of death , ” and other chemical warfare agents .
The find was deemed so perilous that work has been halted until Army engineers can determine how to safely proceed .
“ The concern is they may find a lot more , and there ’s a real question whether the air pollution controls are adequate , ” said Paul Chrostowski , an environmental scientist who monitors the cleanup for the university .
Kerwin , the university president , was forced to abandon his home for two years when his yard was dug up .
He and his wife moved back last fall after tests showed the hazard was gone .
“ We may have to change our analysis now , ” Chrostowski said .
“ He may have to move again . ”
The long - forgotten ordnance first made news in 1993 when workers digging a utility line unearthed an arsenal .
Two years later , after removing 141 munitions , the Army Corps declared the danger over .
But local historians and amateur sleuths found old photos , logbooks and other records that suggested hazardous waste and explosives were scattered over 661 acres .
Excavations , evacuations and lawsuits have ebbed and flowed ever since .
Crews have dug up arsenic - laced lawns and spread clean soil at about 140 homes so far , and more are planned .
They recently began searching for debris by the reservoir that supplies drinking water to Washington after rusting artillery and mortar shells were found in the weeds .
“ It ’s taken years to understand the magnitude and scope ” of the pollution , said Steve Hirsh , the Spring Valley project manager at the Environmental Protection Agency .
“ This is really a unique problem . ”
The long cleanup has put the university in an uncomfortable spotlight .
School officials must balance public safety with public relations , taking pains not to spark undue alarm among the 11,000 students and their parents , as well as prospective students .
In 2001 , the university evacuated its campus day - care center and closed nearby athletic fields after dangerous levels of arsenic were found in the soil .
Medical tests of the toddlers and others proved normal .
But the day - care center stayed shut until last year , long after the contaminated dirt was scooped up and hauled away .
Artificial turf was laid on the sports fields , and a girls lacrosse team practiced there on a recent morning .
Not far away , a backhoe clawed at the soil behind a former fraternity house .
Now used by campus police , the building overlooks a ravine that was once a dump .
The Army will drill under the building this summer to look for more pollution .
David Taylor , assistant to the university president , said he was eager to see the Army complete the cleanup .
“ We told them : ‘ Do it right .
Do it thoroughly .
And then wrap it up . ’ ”
The work draws little apparent interest among students .
Only a dozen people showed up when six experts gathered recently to give presentations on the cleanup .
A senior , Michael Ginsberg , had organized the panel as part of his honors project .
“ Most students do n’t even know there were chemical weapons here , ” Ginsberg , 21 , said in frustration .
Kent Slowinski , a landscaper , leads informal tours of waste sites on campus and in Spring Valley .
He starts at the school ’s McKinley Building , where a plaque by the door reads “ Birthplace of Army Chemical Corps . ”
“ You ’ll notice it does n’t say anything about developing or testing chemical weapons on dogs , goats and other animals , ” he said grimly .
Five chemical rounds have been rendered harmless since April 16 .
All were destroyed on a patch of federal property behind Sibley Memorial Hospital , about a mile from campus .
Three held the poisonous gas arsine , one had liquid mustard and one carried lewisite .
Another 60 to 80 conventional munitions will be turned to scrap this summer .
“ We considered transporting off - site , ” said Dan Noble , the Army Corps ’ project manager .
“ But you risk traffic accidents .
This is by far the safest way to do it .
Here we have complete control . ”
The fenced compound looks like a construction site .
Front - end loaders rumble by stacks of blue barrels , filled with arsenic - laced dirt , that will be hauled to a hazardous waste dump .
More fences , cameras and an infrared laser help protect chemical rounds and other unsafe materials destined for destruction .
“ Some soldier was probably walking out here 90 years ago and a sergeant comes up to him and says , ‘ Hey you , the war ’s over .
Dig a hole .
Get rid of all this !’ ” said Anderson , the Army Corps district commander .
“ Could they ever imagine it would come to this ? ”

Body mass index is used by health practitioners and organizations to provide a rough estimate of your body fat 3 .
It correlates to some degree with more accurate measurements , such as bioimpedance scales and DEXA X - ray scans , but can overestimate or underestimate fatness in certain populations .
BMI has its limitations , because it does n't directly measure your fat , so it 's not the most reliable or valid way of determining body fat levels .
It 's easy to figure and non-invasive , though , so it is useful as one of several screening tools to determine the appropriateness of a person 's weight .
The Basics About BMI
To figure your BMI in American measurements , use an equation that includes a conversion factor : BMI = weight in pounds / ( height in inches x height in inches ) x 703 .
Many online calculators also exist .
A BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight , while a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is overweight , and 30 or more is obese .
A normal measurement falls between 18.5 and 24.9 .
Your BMI measurement is n't a diagnosis .
But when your BMI is too high , it indicates to your doctor that you may need to undergo additional tests -- such as blood work , waist circumference measurements and skinfold caliper tests -- to make sure excessive fat is n't posing a risk to your health .
A BMI that 's too low indicates that you may not be getting all the calories and nutrients you need , so you may be at risk of low energy , poor immunity and vitamin and mineral deficiencies .

You and your friend may have the same BMI , but still have different levels of fatness .
For example , when women and men have the same BMI , the woman usually has more fat because of hormonal differences .
Race can also affect BMI -- when at the same BMI , Caucasians tend to have more body fat than African - Americans and less than Asians .
An older adult likely has a greater percentage of fat than a younger adult , even though both might have the same BMI .
Sedentary people and athletes who have the same BMI also differ considerably in body fat percentage -- with athletes having lower levels .
The higher your BMI , the more likely it 's accurately assessing an excessive amount of fat .
Highly athletic people whose BMI falls into the higher side of normal or lower end of overweight may actually have a healthy amount of body fat , but an abundance of muscle that causes them to weigh more .
Muscle is denser than fat , so it takes up less space pound for pound .
You look lean and fit , but your BMI appears high .
No need to be concerned , though ; you are n't carrying excessive fat that increases your disease risk .
You and your friend may have the same BMI , but still have different levels of fatness .
Highly athletic people whose BMI falls into the higher side of normal or lower end of overweight may actually have a healthy amount of body fat , but an abundance of muscle that causes them to weigh more .
How and Where You Carry Weight Counts
Where you carry fat matters to your health , but BMI wo n't tell you this important detail .
BMI can't measure if you have a pear shape -- with more subcutaneous fat in your hips and thighs -- or an apple shape with a larger midsection .
The large midsection can be of concern , because it may indicate that you have too much belly fat , also called visceral fat .
Visceral fat can contribute to inflammation and may release compounds that raise your risk of serious health problems , such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease .
To make sure you 're not carrying too much visceral fat , measure your waist to determine the circumference .
A waist that 's 40 or more inches for a man or larger than 35 inches for a woman indicates potentially dangerous levels of visceral fat .
People whose weight seems normal according to the BMI formula may still carry too much of those pounds as fat , especially if they 're older , eat a nutrient - poor diet rich in fat and sugar , or are sedentary .
A man whose weight is normal but has 20 - plus percent body fat , or a woman who has 30 percent , may be at risk of developing some of the same health issues as people who are significantly overweight .
An estimated 30 million people fall into this category , Dr. Francisco Lopez - Jimenez , a Mayo Clinic cardiologist , told Today 's Dietitian in 2011 5 .
In these cases of normal weight obesity , BMI is not accurate nor reliable .
Doctors ask about their patients ' lifestyle habits and perform regular blood pressure , cholesterol and blood sugar screenings to help identify possible cases .

Most Valid and Reliable Body Fat Measures

For a better understanding of how much fat your body contains , you can pursue more precise measuring methods .
Body fat scales are relatively easy to find at fitness centers and hospitals .
They use electrical impedance , which sends a mild electrical current through your body to measure fat versus lean mass .
But their results can vary significantly , depending on your hydration levels and the quality of the machine .
A trained professional can use calipers to take skinfold thickness measurements at various locations on your body , including the upper arm , back of the waist and thigh .
The skinfold thickness indicates the amount of subcutaneous fat present at these various sites that is then used to estimate your body fat percentage .
This testing is more accurate than BMI , but it 's subject to the skill of the person taking the measurement .
Hydrostatic , or underwater , weighing and DEXA X - ray scans -- used primarily to analyze bone density -- are among the most accurate ways to determine your body fat .
Hydrostatic weighing carries a +/-1.5 percent margin for error , while DEXA scans are even more accurate ; they are thus considered a " gold standard " in body fat analysis .
Both require special equipment , a health professional and a monetary investment .
BMI correlates moderately with the results from these measures .

LOS ANGELES ( thefutoncritic.com ) -- HBO has released a teaser for the second season of its Danny McBride - led comedy " Eastbound & Down . "
Said video made its broadcast debut during the season premiere of " True Blood " last night .
The new season rolls out in September .
The President gives his support to those rallying to give voting representation to residents of the Nation 's Capital :
On this occasion , we remember the day in 1862 when President Lincoln freed the enslaved people of Washington , DC – nine months before he issued the Emancipation Proclamation .
I am proud that an original copy of that document now hangs in the Oval Office , and we remain forever grateful as a nation for the struggles and sacrifices of those Americans who made that emancipation possible .
Americans from all walks of life are gathering in Washington today to remind members of Congress that although DC residents pay federal taxes and serve honorably in our armed services , they do not have a vote in Congress or full autonomy over local issues .
And so I urge Congress to finally pass legislation that provides DC residents with voting representation and to take steps to improve the Home Rule Charter .
I get asked at conferences all the time what a day in the life of a literary agent is like .

ANKARA , Turkey 
For decades , Turkey was one of the United States ’ most pliable allies , a strategic border state on the edge of the Middle East that reliably followed American policy .
But recently , it has asserted a new approach in the region , its words and methods as likely to provoke Washington as to advance its own interests .
The change in Turkey ’s policy burst into public view last week , after the deadly Israeli commando raid on a Turkish flotilla , which nearly severed relations with Israel , Turkey ’s longtime ally .
Just a month ago , Turkey infuriated the United States when it announced that along with Brazil , it had struck a deal with Iran to ease a nuclear standoff , and on Tuesday it warmly welcomed Iran ’s president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and the Russian prime minister , Vladimir V. Putin , at a regional security summit meeting in Istanbul .
Turkey ’s shifting foreign policy is making its prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , a hero to the Arab world , and is openly challenging the way the United States manages its two most pressing issues in the region , Iran ’s nuclear program and the Israeli - Palestinian peace process .
Turkey is seen increasingly in Washington as “ running around the region doing things that are at cross-purposes to what the big powers in the region want , ” said Steven A. Cook , a scholar with the Council on Foreign Relations .
The question being asked , he said , is “ How do we keep the Turks in their lane ? ”

Rep. Michele Bachmann turned up on FNC’s The O’Reilly Factor , where host Bill O’Reilly desperately tried to drag a little sanity out of Bachmann .
No less than three times O’Reilly asked Bachmann whether she agreed with Obama forcing BP to put up the money , but Bachmann dodged him every time , and refused to give Obama one shred of credit for getting the victims fund .
Here is the video courtesy of Crooks and Liars :

After O’Reilly leveled Bachmann ’s claim that victims compensation fund administrator Kenneth Feinberg is a political hack , Bill - O tried to get her to talk about her extortion comments .
At about the two minute point in the interview she went on the backpedal , and claimed that she was taken out of context .
At about the three minute mark in the segment , things got ugly for Bachmann when O’Reilly said , “ I think Obama did absolutely the right thing by putting a maximum amount of pressure on these weasels …
I ’m OK with that .
I think it is the best thing that Obama did in the whole mess . ”
Bachmann answered by trying to blame Obama , “ No one is saying that this fund should n’t be set up .
The question is who administers it , but here ’s the other part , there ’s also a point of investigating what was it with responsibility from the administration .
Remember , the administration signed off on the inspection .
The administration said everything was fine going on the deep water rig .
We have n’t had that investigation yet . ”
O’Reilly asked her about her BP extortion / shakedown comments , and Bachmann defended BP again , “ I think they put pressure on them when remember he previously said he wanted a criminal investigation , so the people were around that table were thinking they might end up in the slammer , so they could end up in the slammer …. you think about it , you think about , here you have the President of the United States threatening criminal action .
They could end up in the slammer , so are they going to take money from the shareholders to give to the President to maybe keep themselves out of jail ? ”
Bachmann then claimed that Obama is an extortionist , “ There ’s nothing wrong with the President saying that .
The point is .
Is he putting pressure on with the threat of a criminal trial which is the force of government so that they ’ll give him money ?
That ’s crossing lines that we have to be careful of . ”
Notice that Bachmann was so desperate to get Bill - O off her back that she changed what she was most concerned about four times during the interview .
O’Reilly was giving her every chance he could to sound reasonable and sane , but it was hopeless .
What has gotten into O’Reilly this past week ?
O’Reilly leveled Sarah Palin after Obama ’s Oval Office address , and then he justifiably tears apart Michele Bachmann .
I would argue that O’Reilly has his finger more on the pulse of what Fox News viewers are thinking than the rest of his network does .
Michele Bachmann is a prime example of what happens to ideologue Republicans when they are challenged .
She could n’t handle O’Reilly ’s questions when they pushed her at all .
She folded up like a tent , and kept trying to dodge the subject .
Bachmann , Palin , and the rest of the Tea Party crowd fancy themselves as the future leaders of the GOP , but if they ca n’t handle Bill O’Reilly , how would they handle governing ?
Image caption Hurricanes are common in the Gulf of Mexico
Hurricanes could complicate the clean - up of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and damage other offshore pipelines , US scientists warn .
With the hurricane season looming , a study says storm - induced underwater currents may spark mudslides on the seafloor .
This could break oil pipes , but the leaks could be small and difficult to detect , they say .
The study will be released on 10 June by the American Geophysical Union ( AGU ) .
The researchers further warn that the damage could have irreversible impacts on the environment .
Hurricane studies are nothing new - scientists have long known that storms can create waves some 20 m high .
Damage to oil pipelines has also been noticed in the past , but the recent research was able to measure the huge forces hurricanes exert at great depths ( bottom stress ) .
William J Teague , one of the authors and a scientist at the US Naval Research Laboratory at Stennis Space Center in Mississippi , told BBC News : " This has been the first time that hurricane - induced bottom stress has been evaluated with simultaneous measurements of water waves and currents - and the stress on average was about 15 % to 20 % of the wind stress on the surface and as high as 40 % under the peak of the hurricane . "
The researchers found that the induced bottom stress was still critical at depths of up to 90m .
" And the most surprising thing was that the period in which this bottom stress could be damaging persisted for about a week after the hurricane passed , " said Mr Teague .
Hurricanes could potentially cause difficulties to the ongoing clean - up procedures in the Gulf of Mexico , where a BP - operated Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded and sank in April .
This triggered a spill that has so far spewed tens of thousands of barrels of oil into the ocean .
The scientists say a hurricane could disperse the oil much further into the Atlantic .
Mudslides in the ocean
The scientists based their study on the observations of the powerful category 4 Hurricane Ivan that raked the Gulf of Mexico in 2004 .
The seafloor is the foundation that supports the pipelines .
Additional stronger stress due to the waves induced by a hurricane could weaken the foundation and damage the pipelines Dr David W Wong , Oceanographer
They installed six large sensors on the seafloor to record changes induced by hurricanes in underwater currents .
The oceanographers found that currents became so strong that they triggered mudslides - powerful enough to break pipelines or other underwater equipment .
" The seafloor is the foundation that supports the pipelines .
Additional stronger stress due to the waves induced by a hurricane could weaken the foundation and damage the pipelines , " said Dr David W Wong , a co-author of the report .
The researchers then used a computer model of wave - induced current stresses to find out just how powerful hurricanes would need to be for the currents to tear up the seabed .
They discovered that even storms much weaker than the devastating Ivan could potentially disrupt the ocean floor .
This is not good news for the Gulf of Mexico , whose seabed is criss - crossed with some 50,000 km of pipelines .
The region provides almost a third of the US oil supply and about a quarter of its natural gas , but it is prone to hurricanes - especially early in the season , which officially begins on 1 June .
Outdoor Marijuana Prices Are At An All Time Low
I am a big fan of NPR ( ok , feel free to make fun of me … ) , and I came across an article dealing with falling marijuana prices in California .
The article echoed things that I have been saying since 2007 .
As more and more people flooded into Northern California , and as more people got into the medical marijuana scene , the quality of product on the streets has suffered .
Also , due to the enormous flood of mediocre pot hitting the streets ( it ’s known as the infamous ‘ turkey bag ’ weed up here in Oregon ) , the laws of supply and demand take over , and the whole industry suffers as a result .
By no means am I saying that there is no good weed in Northern California .
In fact , I have consumed some TOP QUALITY stuff from Northern Cali many times , recently .
However , what I am saying is that there are LOTS of rookies in Northern California that have flooded in from out of state .
These types of growers have only been producing crops for a couple years , and it shows in the quality / quantity that ’s working its way up and down the I - 5 corridor .
There is WAY TOO MUCH outdoor Cali on the scene , and it ’s changing the market dramatically .
The previously mentioned article states that ‘ prices are now much less than $ 2,000 a pound . ’
That number is misleading for a few reasons , but it is still interesting ( I will explain why in a minute ) .
First of all , if the article is referring to outdoor crops , then no sh#t it ’s going to go for less than $ 2,000 a pound .
Outdoor harvests have been ‘ processed ’ since October , and the longer it sits in the infamous turkey bags , the worse it ’s going to smell , look , and taste .
I have seen some outdoor turkey bags up here in Eugene , OR lately that barely resemble weed !
Also , as with any marijuana purchase , it ’s going to depend on the amount .
Are we talking one pound , ten pounds , 100 pounds , etc ?
I know a guy that just bought 25 pounds for 20g of some turkey bag ( good luck getting rid of that ! ) .
I know another guy right now that is trying to push 3 pounds of outdoor Cali for $ 4,000 .
That ’s significantly lower than the NPR analysis !
But you have to take NPR with a grain of salt ; they probably had some rookie reporter that went in wide - eyed and gullible .
If you send an East Coast reporter to the Emerald Triangle , and they are looking at hundreds of pounds and plants for the first time in their life , they will probably believe anything they are told !
The moral of the story is still valid though ; prices are dropping as more people enter the marketplace , and only the best growers will continue to thrive .
The article highlights a growing problem ; there is just too much weed on the West Coast , and the supply continues to grow ( literally ! ) .
People that have been growing killer weed for decades are now being pushed out of the market by ‘ out of staters ’ that are flooding WA , OR , and CA .
Do n’t get me wrong , if you get a medical card and grow the FINEST indoor super chronic , you will NEVER have a problem getting rid of it , anywhere or anytime .
I know a circle of friends that grow some ‘ trainwreck ’ that would demand top dollar in any market .
But , for every circle of friends like those I just mentioned , there are 1,000 circles of friends that are pumping the market with mediocre , outdoor ‘ turkey bag . ’
I remember before ‘ Operation Frozen Timber , ’ there was no outdoor Cali up here in Oregon , at least not on a large scale .
I would see ‘ nugs from Humboldt ’ every now and again when friends would go there to visit , but I never saw pounds of it here in Oregon .
The weed here at the time was probably 10 % locally grown , and 90 % imported from BC ( educated guess ) .
A BC pound came in two gallon bags , which were both inside of one heat sealed bag , and always had funny numbers , symbols , and / or initials on the corner of the heat sealed bag .
Prices ranged from about $ 2,500 to $ 3,600 depending on the factors that I named above .
Chances are , if you were paying less than that amount , you either had the ultimate hook up , or you were buying something so awful it never left your possession except on front ( and even then it probably did n’t sell ! ) .
Not everyone could get into the industry , because you had to either know ( or be ) a quality / local grower , or have ‘ a friend ’ in Washington .
From what I could tell , most of the Emerald Triangle weed stayed in Cali , and eventually made its way South down I - 5 .
That all changed when Operation Frozen Timber happened .
I will never forget when my hook at the time was complaining to me about how hard it is to find ‘ work . ’
All he had was football sized ‘ turkey bags ’ of really crappy , outdoor weed .
It lacked crystals , taste , color , etc .
Of course , he could still get batches of local for top dollar , but as far as quantity was concerned , all he had was the ‘ turkey bag . ’
It was cheap as hell , around $ 2,000 bucks a pound , but even then , I did n’t want anything to do with it .
Neither did anyone else that I knew up here in Oregon !
Now , combine the drought of BC buds on the West Coast with the passage of SB 420 in California just a few years earlier .
The unquenchable appetite for marijuana on the West Coast was not going anywhere , while at the same time unbelievably sweet rules were in place in Northern Cali .
The perfect storm for a ‘ turkey bag ’ market was created .
Now we live in a world where 90 % of the bulk product on the West Coast is outdoor , and about 10 % is super quality indoor chronic .
The people that make the 10 % reign supreme , while the people in the 90 % are left to live off a diet full of Top Ramen and PBJ sandwiches …
The problem is only going to grow , as more people move West for the ‘ marijuana gold rush ’ that you always hear investigative reporters talk about .
People with the finest weed will sell it to dispensaries and the lucky few , while the non-medical masses get to sift through the ‘ turkey bags . ’
Long time dealers and growers will continue to be pushed out , as they have to compete with so many more rookies .
There is one thing that I think could change all that ; if BC buds came back onto the scene .
I have talked to HUNDREDS of people in BC that are sitting on more indoor dank then they could ever know what to do with .
The prices are comparable to the ‘ turkey bag , ’ but the quality is undeniable .
If somehow that was to flood back onto the scene , things would change dramatically .
Dealers and dispensary owners would benefit from having access to more quality product at a reduced price .
Long time growers would benefit , because they would still be able to sell their quality product and the crappy growers would get weeded out because their crappy weed would n’t sell .
People would quit moving
West for the ‘ pursuit of medical marijuana ’ because it would n’t be as easy to compete .
But then again , who knows … maybe marijuana just becomes legal , and it can be traded like any other valuable commodity !
If that were ever to occur , who knows what would happen ( other than massive celebrations ) !
Chicago developer Jonathan " Wolf " Rentzsch has announced that he is putting his highly regarded independent developer conference , C4 , to sleep after a four - year run .
Though many of the developers who attended the conference are sad to see it go , Rentzsch told Ars that he no longer has the " spirit , " given some recent moves by Apple regarding iPhone development and a seeming lack of concern from the developer community .
C4 was inspired by both the MacHack conference as well as a one - time event in Chicago called Evening At Adler .
MacHack started in 1986 in Ann Arbor , Michigan , and had been a favorite " unconference " of Mac developers for years .
Sadly , it folded in 2005 after a brief attempt to change its focus away from the Mac and towards general programming and hacking .
Paul Kafasis , Wil Shipley , and Brent Simmons were part of the Evening at Adler panel
Evening At Adler began as a tech talk scheduled at the flagship North Michigan Ave Apple Store in Chicago by a developer known online as Drunken Batman .
When Apple canceled his talk , DB transformed it into a panel talk with 10 well - known Mac developers held at Chicago 's Adler Planetarium in October 2005 .
Mac developers and fans came from all over the Midwest to hear the likes of Wil Shipley , Gus Mueller , Brent Simmons , and Rentzsch himself discuss developing for the Mac platform .
With MacHack gone and with Evening At Adler proving that a single person could organize a small developer conference , Rentzsch launched C4 in the fall of 2006 .
Though its focus was on independent Mac developers , Rentzsch 's unstated goal was to help advance the art of software engineering .
" My hope was that developers would care primarily about user experience yet also be passionate about utilizing lingual and tooling advances , " he wrote on his blog yesterday .
" C4 was my attempt to push on the Apple community from the bottom - up . "
The conference quickly became a favorite of Mac developers , many of whom traveled from all over the world to convene in Chicago for a weekend of programming presentations and socializing .
Still , Rentzsch began to feel that his goals did n't align with the Mac — and now iPhone — developer community .
Though the controversy over section 3.3.1 of the iPhone Developer Agreement was the straw that broke the camel 's back , Rentzsch told Ars that it was merely a sign that his passions and those of the Mac developer community in general were not the same .
Section 3.3.1 was updated in the agreement with the release of iPhone OS 4.0 betas , and added a new requirement for iPhone developers to follow .
It forbids using any third - party frameworks or translation layers , such as the ability of Flash CS5 to generate an iPhone - compatible binary .
It also requires developers to use only the programming languages supported by Apple 's native APIs and tools , namely Objective - C , C , or C ++.
While Apple 's stated goal of ensuring app consistency and making sure developers are leveraging the latest features and APIs is arguably a good one , limiting developers to specific languages and development tools can definitely stifle innovation — and anger developers .
It especially is at odds with advancing the state of the art in software engineering .
" I had passion for C4 because I have passion about software engineering , " Rentzsch told Ars .
" The community 's reaction to 3.3.1 has stripped me of the passion necessary to put on C4 again . "
There were many vocal opponents of the move , including Ars .
But according to Rentzsch , the reaction among the Mac faithful was mostly to just accept Apple 's decision and , in some cases , even defend it .
It was that reaction that " broke " his spirit .
The reaction to the cancellation of C4 has been mostly forlorn .
" It 's a huge loss to the Mac and iPhone development community , " developer Jonathan Wight told Ars .
" The sessions at C4 were extremely eclectic and the format was very conducive to meeting and socializing with your fellow developers . "
Developers Craig Hockenberry and Paul Kafasis chat with Daring Fireball 's John Gruber , Macworld 's Dan Moren , and others at C4 [ 2 ] .
" I would not have been introduced to what is probably the greatest tech community in the world without C4 , " agreed Chris Cieslak .
" I , the Mac and iPhone development world , and the Chicago tech community will miss C4 dearly . "
Despite this , all were sympathetic to Rentzsch 's decision and his reasoning behind it .
" It 's disappointing but understandable , " Justin Williams told Ars .
" I 'm spending my C4 budget on a more open Android phone . "
Williams had developed two iPhone apps in the past , but ended up selling them to another developer and giving up on iPhone development due to Apple 's handling of the App Store .
Delicious Library developer Wil Shipley was even more vociferous in his disappointment .
" I 'm really saddened to see the end of C4 — it 's the only indie conference I go to , " he told Ars .
" But , also , I ’m saddened that Apple ’s inconsistent and sometimes predatory App Store policies have discouraged one of the leaders of the indie community .
" Computer programmers are an especially libertarian group — we hate rules , " Shipley explained .
" The more rules Apple passes , the more the best programmers will leave , and the App Store will be full of tens of thousands of craplets from the gold rush programmers who programmed for Windows in the ' 80s , " he said — a scary prognostication indeed .
Asked if he would consider picking up the mantle if the situation changed , Rentzsch said he had no plans for future conferences .
He told Ars he just could n't personally organize another conference , though he was confident that others might be inspired to organize their own .
" I would love to see the community set up and organize something to take its place , " developer Colin Barrett told Ars .
" I always felt like it was great to meet new people at C4 , and there are so many new people in the Apple developer space these days . "
Perhaps there is hope for the Mac developer community just yet .
A discussion has popped up on the KOffice - Devel list as to whether to discontinue the user - oriented KOffice mailing list .
Some developers are wondering whether it ’s worth it to keep this admittedly low - traffic list going .
The main argument being that if people are n’t using the list now , the few questions that do get asked may not be getting the attention they deserve .
I have an opinion on the subject , but I ’m not sure that ’s all that important .
As a technical communicator , what I ’m interested in is how others learn about and solve problems with their software , particularly in the open source arena .
KOffice does n’t have the mind share and user base that other open source productivity suites ( OK , I mean OpenOffice.org ) have , but are there channels today ’s Linux geek and her grandma use to get support for their software .
There are lots of choices , and it would be interesting and helpful to me , the KOffice and KDE teams to learn those preferences .
I ’m going to try to set up a poll here , but please use the Comments section as well .
The official question is “ How do you learn about or get help with KOffice and other KDE applications ? ”
Here are the options I ’ve thought of :
Share your journey in the comments .
Choose as many options in the poll below as you like .
Explain what you like and do n’t like about getting help .
Even if you do n’t use KDE specifically , feel free to chime in .
Exclusive : Was disregard for industry standards on BP rig worse than we thought ?
BP ’s examination of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill still has n’t determined precisely what caused the blowout , the company says .
But industry investigators crawling over the Deepwater Horizon rig and its data are finding that an accident of this magnitude required an almost perfect chain of events :
One unlikely malfunction needed to be followed precisely by another , then another , and so on , according to a preliminary investigative report I ’ve obtained .
The report was produced earlier this month by one of the teams now examining every aspect of the catastrophic spill ; I received it on the condition that I would disguise its provenance .
Reproduced below is what is probably the most interesting piece of it : A diagram created by the investigators to illustrate just how improbable this event was .
Until now , public investigations into the April 20 spill have asked what went wrong .
But what one gleans from this report — and in particular this diagram — is that that may be the wrong question .
Instead we should be asking , how did everything that had to go wrong do so , and at the same time ?
For the well operators , the implications are not good :
Unless one violated standard industry practice every step along the way , such a blowout may have been all but impossible .
The Wall Street Journal has provided the best investigative reporting on what went wrong on the rig , most crucially the failure of seals and the decisions made on the type and testing of cement .
The New York Times did a fantastic job of examining the failure of the rig ’s blowout preventer , the five - story - tall device that is the ostensible last line of defense against such accidents .
But until you see the sequence arrayed before your eyes — a full account of what actually had to go wrong — the enormity of the coincidence of events is extremely difficult to grasp .
That ’s what this diagram — labeled “ High Level Root Cause Tree ” in the original document — does ( click here for a more legible PDF ) :
You start from the bottom of the diagram , and move your way up .
The key is the linking phrases AND , or alternately , OR .
The ANDs mean that , in order for the described malfunction absolutely to take place , the one immediately below it must occur as well .
The ORs mean that the described malfunction could take place , but would n’t necessarily do so , if linked to the one immediately below it on the schematic .
But if they do take place , there can be trouble .
As you see , the chain of events starts with many moving parts , then cascades out of control — the seals on the head of the well ; the tubular casing that ’s inserted into well as it ’s drilled ; the cement used to seal the well and keep the natural gas under control ; the “ mud , ” a thick , complex , chemical - laced concoction used to lubricate and keep underground pressure from bursting to the surface .
Then comes a row of ORs : Do you have a failure to follow correct procedures when doubt is cast on your control of the pressure from the reservoir ?
If the wellhead seal fails , do fluids from below reach the actual rig 5,000 feet above the ocean floor ?
Then come some ANDs .
If the fluids do reach the rig , and there is a source of ignition to cause an explosion , you get the blowout and fire .
Teenage Boy Kills Father to Continue Playing Computer Game
A 14 - year - old boy has been arrested in Tuapse , a town in the Krasnodar district , after first killing his sleeping father with a sledge hammer and then waking his mother and demanding that she return the keyboard that she had taken away from him .
After committing the murder he calmly went and finished playing his favorite computer game “ Gothic ” .
Teenage Boy Kills Father to Continue Playing Computer Game
For the murder of his paternal father Yaroslav Melnicheko , a resident of Tuapse , is faced with a 10 - year sentence , reports Life News .
“ On the evening before the murder my brother was behaving as usual , speaking little and playing on his phone ” , says the 25 - year - old sister of the young murderer .
“ Then he watched some comedy on TV with my father .
He kept on asking when we would all go to bed . ”
Before everyone left for bed , mother and father said to their son that he was not to play on the computer again that night .
It was when Yaroslav began to protest that his mother was forced to remove the keyboard from the computer and hide it in her room .
The boy made as if he had accepted the decision and went to bed .
Then in the dead of night the teenager decided to deal with his “ wrongdoers ” .
Taking a sledge hammer , he crept into his parents ’ bedroom and attacked his father right there in his bed .
“ The teenager delivered the blows through a plastic bag , prepared in advance in order to prevent himself being splashed with blood ” , explained the investigating officer Boris Frolov .
“ He admits to having planned at first to murder his mother , but then feared he would not be able to deal with his father ” .
Having killed the head of the family , Yaroslav awoke his mother as if nothing had happened and demanded that she return the keyboard , threatening to do the same to her .
The shocked woman returned the precious item to the boy , after which he took her phone from her and locked her in the room before leaving to continue playing “ Gothic ” .
The murderer confessed to everything immediately after his arrest .
Yaroslav even took an interest in prisoners ’ conditions , asking the investigating officer before anything else : “ Will there be a computer in prison ? ”
According to investigators , the teenager did n’t even hide his satisfaction with his offense .
“ After the murder I became head of the family ” , the boy proudly declared during questioning .
It should be noted that the unfortunate role - play game “ Gothic ” , thanks to which Yaroslav got the idea of murdering his parents , has a correspondingly sinister plot : the characters of the quest fight with the aid of various kinds of weapons – axes , clubs , hammers , swords , and so on .
It was just such a weapon that Yaroslav used in real life for the reprisals against his father , in the course of which he struck the sleeping man 6 times on the head .
Relatives still do not believe what has happened and place the blame on his parents ’ excessive love .
Yaroslav was the only heir of the house and the family business – a hotel on the Black Sea coast .
Three years ago , this representative of “ golden youth ” entered the cadet corps , but in 2009 forced his parents to remove him , complaining that discipline was too strict .
According to neighbors , Yaroslav had almost no friends .
Instead the young gamer spent all his free time at the computer , playing his favorite cult games – “ Gothic ” and “ Stalker ” .

Recitation # 46 - Pick - Up Lines
Guster might be a bit vague , but I knew a girl who once thought it would be successful if you knew the song .
If I was n't married , I probably would try to use the literature lines .
Keeping one creepy eyebrow raised afterwards might actually do the trick .
If you 've got a recitation question , send it in .
And if any of the above lines succeed , I do n't know why you 're trying them , or how the hell any could work , but I 'd love to hear if they did .
When MusicRadar caught up with Rush 's Alex Lifeson , we asked him the question on everybody 's mind :
So what are your three best solos , Alex ?
The legendary guitarist needed only a moment before answering :
1. Limelight ( 1981 )
" I love the elasticity of the solo .
It 's a very emotional piece of music for me to play .
The song is about loneliness and isolation , and I think the solo reflects that .
There 's a lot of heart in it .
It 's a feel thing : you have to feel a solo as you play it , otherwise it 's going to sound stiff .
I never had that problem with Limelight .
The first time I laid it down in the studio , I feel a real attachment to it and I could tell it was special .
Even now , it 's my favorite solo to perform live .
I never get tired of it .
Each time I 'm about to play it , I take a deep breath and I exhale on that first note .
I guess that sounds corny , but for me , it releases something . "
2. Kid Gloves ( 1984 )
" That song is from our Grace Under Pressure album .
What I like about the solo is , it 's the opposite of Limelight : it 's got a hip , kind of slinky attitude , a little goofy humor .
When I play it , I feel a certain confidence , almost like a prankster , which is not the way I am in real life at all .
What 's funny about it , too , is that it has a plot to it , and I only realized that after I recorded it for the first time - I never have a plot in mind when I 'm recording solos ; I always just kind of wing them .
The Kid Gloves solo guided me ; it 's like it knew what it wanted to be and I just had to allow myself to follow . "
3. Freewill ( 1980 )
" It 's a really hard solo to play .
I think I feel a certain amount of pride in that fact alone .
Every time I play it , I 'm amazed I got through it .
It 's so frenetic and exciting .
The rhythm section too - Geddy and Neil are all over the place .
It 's probably one of the most ambitious pieces of music Rush has ever done .
In a sense , everybody 's soloing at the same time .
Recording it , I did n't have anything planned ; I was just responding to what the other guys did .
Basically , I was just trying to keep up !
But I think it worked out pretty well .
I 'm rather happy with it , and I can usually find fault with everything I do . "
One of the ideas that made our country great is the idea that the law is applied equally .
I knew there were plenty of exceptions and special deals , of course , but somehow I still believed that ultimately , justice would prevail .
Now , compare this with what happens to you if you drive down the street with an outdated inspection sticker on your car .
( I really have to stop watching those Frank Capra movies ! )
The federal agency responsible for ensuring that the Deepwater Horizon was operating safely before it exploded last month fell well short of its own policy that the rig be inspected at least once per month , an Associated Press investigation shows .
In fact , the agency 's inspection frequency on the Deepwater Horizon fell dramatically over the past five years , according to federal Minerals Management Service records .
The rig blew up April 20 , killing 11 people before sinking and triggering a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Since January 2005 , inspectors issued just one minor infraction for the rig .
That strong track record led the agency last year to herald the Deepwater Horizon as an industry model for safety . [...]
The AP sought to find out how many times government safety inspectors visited the Deepwater Horizon , and what they found .
In response , MMS officials offered a changing series of numbers .
The MMS has had long - standing issues with its data management .
At first , officials said 83 inspections had been performed since the rig arrived in the Gulf 104 months ago , in September 2001 .
While being questioned about the once - per- month claim , the officials subsequently revised the total up to 88 inspections .
The number of more recent inspections also changed — from 26 to 48 in the 64 months since January 2005 .
In the meantime , a " 60 Minutes " investigation points to gross negligence on the part of BP .

Fox News is still in full spin mode when it comes to the Gulf oil spill .
Since the explosion , the network has been touting the virtues of offshore drilling , while downplaying the damage from the Gulf spill .
However , Fox News Sunday ’s Brit Hume took it to new low today , when he doubted the size of the spill because the oil has not covered the coast yet .
Hume asked , “ Where is the oil ? ”
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :

Even though the size of the spill has been confirmed to be larger than the Exxon Valdez , Hume tried to cast doubt on the facts , “ Let ’s see if that happens .
There ’s a good question today if you are standing on the Gulf , and that is :
Where is the oil ? …
It ’s not on — except for little of chunks of it , you ’re not even seeing it on the shore yet . ”
Using Hume logic , since the oil ca n’t be seen on the shore then it must not exist .
Hume also repeated the oil industry ’s illogical talking point that the ocean will absorb the oil , “ You know where the greatest source of oil that seeps into the ocean floor is ?
It ’s from natural seepage from subterranean deposits , that ’s where most of it comes from , not from drilling accidents , so what ’s badly needed here is some perspective on our energy policies , and also on the hard realities of what really goes on when it comes to oil spills . ”
Later , Hume made Rush Limbaugh ’s argument that ocean can absorb the oil , “ The Ocean absorbs a lot . ”
A 2002 report by the Santa Barbara County Planning and Development Energy Division concluded that the ocean can handle it industry talking point is false , “ Natural seeps and spills differ in that seep rates do not , on average , exceed the marine environment ’s capacity to digest the oil , whereas spills may exceed its capacity .
Major spills overwhelm nature ’s mechanisms for processing the oil , in the short term .
The consequences include severe oiling of shorelines and mortality to organisms that are ill - prepared to live in an oil - soaked environment . ”
With the notable exception of Shep Smith , comments like Hume ’s have been the party line at Fox News .
The argument is very simplistic .
Since we ca n’t see the oil , then the oil must not be there .
This was the same argument used against atoms and molecules by science deniers in centuries past .
We ca n’t see the oxygen , but we know it is there .
Just because the oil is underwater does not mean that it is not there .
Hume ’s argument is also disingenuous because we ca n’t see much of the footage of what is going on underwater due to the fact that BP wo n’t release it .
Maybe we could see more of what is happening , if BP was honest , and not worried about criminal or legal liability .
Brit Hume and Fox News do n’t care about the lives lost or the people and environment impacted by this spill .
Their mission is to keep spreading the talking point that offshore drilling is safe , and that this spill in the Gulf is no big deal .
How To Handle Bibliolaters
By Delos McKown
Over the years I have been confronted by numerous bibliolaters : people who take the Bible to be inerrant and , thus , put it beyond intelligent criticism .
Since theirs is a particularly pernicious religion ( absurdly claiming that certain antique documents are divinely inspired ) , it has seemed important to me to develop strategies for dealing with such manifest foolishness .
Bibliolaters should not be humored by being allowed to prattle on unchallenged but should be put in the position of having to put up or shut up .
Positive good can come from making them suffer what sociologists commonly call cognitive dissonance , for it is out of intolerable intellectual and emotional conflicts within oneself that deliverance often comes .
In the early 1970s a former student of mine named Terry , mad as a hatter , returned to see me , as was his custom .
This time he brought a dirty , wraith - like little man who stank to high heaven .
" This here 's Alphonse , " Terry said , " Alphonse Rossignol .
We want you to test a spirit . "
" Test a Spirit , " I said , thinking , why me ?
" Our university has a religion department now , " I said , happily .
" Why not get one of those guys to test your Spirit ? "
" No ! " thundered Terry .
" They 're hypocrites .
Better an honest atheist any day than a hypocrite . "
" Put that way , " I said , " I do n't see how I can refuse .
What is this Spirit I 'm to test ? "
" Alphonse here 's been fasting for six weeks , " Terry said .
" Yes , that 's right , " Alphonse agreed .
" I 've been taking nothing by mouth except my own urine , sweetened with a little branch water from the creek behind my cabin .
The Bible tells you to do it . "
" Surely not ! " I expostulated , then rued my outburst as some of the weird stuff in the Bible skittered through my mind .
Taking a Bible from my bookshelf , guided by dim traces of memory and a hunch or two , my eyes soon alighted on John 7:37 - 38 , in which the King James Version ( KJV ) has Jesus say :
" If any man thirst , let him come unto me and drink .
He that believeth on me ... out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water . "
Alphonse beamed , having been justified in drinking his own pee by the very word of scripture itself , at which point he pulled a small plastic glass from his shirt pocket .
The glass stank mightily and was ringed by a dirty yellowish precipitate .
" That 's his communion cup , " Terry announced exultantly .
Deciding it was time to throw a little cold water on these proceedings , I asked Alphonse , " Do you know what follows John 7:38 ? "
He did n't , and it occurred to me that he might be illiterate , having only heardthe hypothetical imperative .
In the KJV John 7:39 appears in parentheses , which I read to Alphonse :
" But this spake he of the Spirit , which they that believed on him should receive . "
" See , " I said , " the Bible itself tells you in verse 39 not to take literally what it says in verse 38 .
It 's just a metaphor .
You 're not supposed to be drinking your own urine . "
" Jesus told me to do it , " Alphonse replied .
" Where did you see Jesus ? " I asked .
" Out back of my cabin , " said Alphonse .
" How can you be sure it was n't the devil ? " I shot back , getting down to business .
" The scriptures say that the devil can disguise himself as an angel of light ( II Corinthians 11:14 ) .
Why could n't he dress up like Jesus and try to fool a person like you ? "
Behind his grimy exterior , Alphonse blanched .
He sank down in his chair , obviously rattled by the prospect that he might have met the devil .
Meanwhile , banging hard on my desk , Terry cried out , " Now that 's testing the Spirit ! " as though they were getting their money 's worth in Spirit - testing for the first time .
Recovering from his nasty shock , Alphonse said in the sweetest , most self - assured voice imaginable , " Oh , it was Jesus all right . "
" Very well , " I said , " I can test the Spirit no further , " and ushered them out of my room .
As they went rejoicing , I closed the door and dashed to open my windows in the hope of catching a strong cross draught .
Much more of Alphonse 's essence lingered than I cared to retain .
Many moons later a very bright and clinically sane student , possessed nonetheless by fervent fundamentalism , asked if he could meet with me to discuss some bible passages .
I awaited the encounter with enthusiasm , but when the appointed hour arrived , he brought with him another student of mine , also very bright and clinically sane , but suffering a worse case of Christianity than the first one .
As though this were not enough , they also brought an elderly divine with them , Pastor Russell of the Maranatha House .
Pandemonium quickly overtook our discussion .
I would no sooner begin a rational exegesis of a passage than one of them would say , " Yeah , but what about Nehemiah 6:16 ? " or " How about Lamentations 3:42 ? " or " Have n't you forgotten Malachi 2:10 ? "
Meanwhile another one would be rustling through Deuteronomy or Obadiah commenting on how he was about to find a verse that would put a stop to what I was saying , and all the while Pastor Russell would ask above the din if I knew the Hebrew for some English phrase or other .
After three or four starts of this sort , resulting in hop - scotching through the scriptures , I had had enough .
I decided to get them out of my office pronto .
I knew it would be painful to do what I believed necessary to rid my office of the rabble ; but one has to suffer for one 's faith .
So , I fibbed .
( I still try to make it less a moral offense than it really was .
I did n't fib ; I told a lie . )
I told them that I had committed the " unforgivable sin " ( Matthew 12:31 ) .
I told them that I had blasphemed against the Holy Ghost , that there was , therefore , absolutely no hope for me , and that they were wasting precious time that might more profitably be spent on others more susceptible to their blandishments than I .
At this they stood stock still .
They were silenced in the twinkling of an eye .
Pastor Russell was the first to rally from their collective dismay .
He asked me precisely what it was that I had done when I had blasphemed against the Holy Ghost .
" Well , you should know , being a Bible scholar , " I retorted , giving him no help at all .
" I do n't think you really have blasphemed , " he said , offering me hope that I could still profit from the gospel , and offering hope that their efforts had not been utterly in vain .
" Oh , I 'm absolutely positive I have , " I said with a stern countenance , suffering the pangs of conscience bravely .
The thought that they were in the presence of a blasphemer , more loathsome than a leper , was too much for them .
They fell back as though to avoid contact with a virulent and deadly infection , and they fled my office .
My secretary saw them hastening single file down the hall , looking sideways at the wall , unnerved and hardly knowing where to turn next in their zeal to depart the infested building .
By the way , to blaspheme against the Holy Ghost one merely has to ascribe to Beelzebub responsibility for certain healings Jesus allegedly performed ( see Mark 3:20 - 29 ) , an ascription I could never honestly make .
In any case , if you can tolerate the pain of such a fib ( lie ) , then you too can rid the spaces you occupy of similar Christian zealots .
On January 27 , 1987 , I was led as a lamb to the slaughter , having been set up to debate the Rev. Dr. Norman Geisler of Dallas Theological Seminary on the subject , " Humanism vs. Christianity . "
Dubbed by its promoters as " The Main Event , " the debate was held in the ballroom at Auburn University , a room overflowing with perhaps 2,000 people , some of whom had been bused in , courtesy of local churches .
Geisler had trouble staying on the general topic , focusing rather on abortion , in the most grisly terms .
Humanists , he tells , are right in there with the Nazis in disregard of human life .
Their despicable deeds are made likely , if not inevitable , by their moral relativism .
How much firmer is the ground under Christians , who stand on moral absolutes !
During rebuttal , I said that my favorite moral absolute in scripture was in Luke 6:30 where Jesus is reported to have said , " Give to every man that asketh of thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again . "
I then turned to the Rev. Dr. Geisler and asked him for his money .
Since it was not forthcoming , I knelt on one knee and begged for it , trying to cover all spiritual bases .
With a pale look about his gills , he finally pulled out a dollar bill and waved it wanly at me to which I said , " No , not a dollar ; I want all of your money .
But I 'm not mean ; I wo n't keep your wallet or credit cards . "
Geisler did not , in fact , comply with the moral absolute in Luke 6:30 ( also see Matthew 5:42 and Luke 6:35 ) .
If he had given me his money , I would have taken it and kept it .
Thus , we would both have been blessed , I with extra cash and he with a clear conscience for having met the challenge of obeying a moral absolute of his lord .
I fear his conscience still troubles him over this episode , something I would gladly have spared him by keeping his money .
Bibliolaters are so fond of moral absolutes that I believe the rest of us should oblige them by giving them every opportunity to act thereupon .
When you next hear a Christian extolling the rock of moral absolutes upon which he or she stands , go for the cash .
It has a sobering effect that may in the long run be beneficial .
I keep hoping Geisler will come back to Auburn .
I know where there are other moral absolutes in scripture to use on him and his ilk , and so shall you .
Imagine that you are fired up to encounter some bibliolaters .
Imagine that one or more of these evangelists come to your door peddling their beliefs .
Here are a number of challenges you can issue and rejoinders you can make .
1 . Take a bottle and put some harmless ingredients in it that , when mixed , look pukey and smell the same .
Then , when an unsuspecting bibliolater rings your doorbell and starts to set you straight , ask this person to take a big swig of your concoction .
If the person is reluctant , refer to Mark 16:17 - 18 where Jesus is supposed to have said that believers will be able to pick up or drink any deadly thing without harm .
If the evangelist quotes the stock answer , " Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God . . . " ( Deuteronomy 6:16 ) , point out that you are not asking the Bible - god to drink your brew but are merely checking out the credentials of one of his alleged servants .
2. A nice variation is in Luke l0:l9 .
Here we are told that Jesus ' disciples can tread on serpents and scorpions without being hurt .
This test , of course , is not for everybody .
You may not have a rumpus room knee - deep in snakes or scorpions .
However , you could get a large empty jar , camouflage it so that one cannot look into it and then ask the bibliolater to thrust a hand into it blindly .
For that matter any harmless thing that looks threatening will do , because Luke 10:19 ends by saying that " nothing shall by any means hurt " Christians .
Any reluctance on the part of the evangelist can be taken as a sign of weak faith -- not the sort of person you would want to listen to .
3 . If you are n't too embarrassed to bring up sex , and if this person is wearing a wedding ring , ask if sex with the spouse is still going on .
If so , look horrified and point out that St. Paul clearly said ( I Corinthians 7:29 ) that Christians should cut it out , because the end of the world is near at hand .
After all , who would want to get caught Doing It when Jesus comes again ?
Think how much closer to the end we must be now than when Paul first made this important point .
Naturally you do n't want to listen to a bibliolater who pays no heed to St. Paul .
4 . In Matthew 10:18 Jesus sends out his disciples with the words , " Heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out devils . . . "
Take on a skeptical attitude and ask the evangelist for his or her credentials .
Is this person really from Jesus , or maybe from a false teacher , or , worse yet , perhaps from the devil himself ?
If the evangelist assures you that he or she was sent directly by Jesus , ask for a demonstration of healing the sick , raising the dead , or casting out devils .
If lepers are hard to come by in your neighborhood , AIDS patients could surely be substituted .
5 . After a few pleasantries , the evangelist will probably turn to the bottom line : your happiness or misery after death .
Ask how you can know that this person is presenting a picture of the real , true hell .
You will need the following as background :
I have written a story called , " Oops , Wrong Hell , " in which a young chap named Rolf Smegmaa goes by the book , believes everything in the Bible , then dies , and wakes up in hellish circumstances .
" Why ? " he asks .
He protests and asks for a review of his sentence .
When a voice booms out overhead , it is in Arabic , the language of Muhammad .
Too late Rolf realizes that the Moslem hell is the true hell , not the Christian one , and that in trying to avoid the latter he made himself a prime candidate for the former .
It goes without saying that you do n't want that to happen to you .
So , challenge the bibliolater to clear up this matter beyond all doubt .
As the evangelist leaves , express your suspicion that he or she may be trying to escape from a phony hell .
6 . Although you may appear to be pleased to see a bibliolater at your door , you must express concern over not being duped .
After all , there are so many evangelists saying different things .
You want to know all you can about this person 's spiritual legitimacy .
Ask , " Does this describe you ? "
Then read Luke 14:26 :
" If any man come to me , and hate not his father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brethren , and sisters , yea , and his own life also , he can not be my disciple . "
How does this fit in with loving others ?
If the evangelist really hates his or her ; ife , why all the concern about living forever in heaven ?
7 . In your never - ending quest to make sure that the evangelist is the genuine article , ask if this person has ever been flogged in a synagogue or dragged before governors and kings for Jesus ' sake ( Matthew 10:17 - 18 ) .
The answer is almost certain to be no .
But go on and read Matthew 10:21 - 22 :
" And brother shall deliver up brother to death , and the father the child ; and the children shall rise up against their parents , and cause them to be put to death , and ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake ... "
Look the evangelist squarely in the eye and ask , " Have you had family problems like these ? "
Then , still looking very grave , ask , " Does everybody hate you because of Jesus ? "
The answer to both questions is almost certainly no .
Say sadly that you are afraid this person is not the real article , that you must learn about Jesus from the right kind of person as described in Matthew .
8 . After the evangelist has made an opening spiel , just ask , " Are you morally perfect ? "
Christians make a big deal of saying they are " not perfect , just forgiven . "
Read Matthew 5:48 where Jesus says :
" Be ye therefore perfect , even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect . "
( Even though Matthew made up things for Jesus to say when it suited him , you do n't need to let on .
In a red-letter edition of the Bible , Matthew 5:48 is in red , and therefore Jesus must have said it . )
Then solemnly note that this is an imperative -- no if's , and 's , or but 's at all .
Bible - believers should thank you for pointing out another moral absolute .
Tell the bibliolater to come back when he or she has become perfect .
9 . If the evangelist is a woman trying to get you to join her congregation , ask if women are allowed to speak aloud there .
If the answer is yes , cite Paul 's first letter to Timothy 2:11 - 12 ( many New Testament professors do n't think Paul wrote this letter , but you do n't have to let on that you know this ) which says :
" Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection .
But I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence . "
If she still says yes , then ask why this passage is being ignored .
If it can be ignored , why can't other Bible passages be ignored ?
Indeed , why can't the whole thing be ignored ?
10 . Bibliolaters can be quite wily .
They will want you to believe everything in the Old Testament ( OT ) that is agreeable to them .
But if you quote something that they do n't believe or practice , they will tell you that they are not under the old covenant ( OT law ) but are under the new covenant of the New Testament ( NT ) religion .
Ask for the principle by which they cast off whatever they cast off in the OT and keep whatever they keep .
Why do they ignore what they ignore ?
It helps to know that the NT generally misinterprets quotes from the OT , not taking it as the literal word of the Bible - god at all but twisting it to fit Christian propaganda .
11 . If a bibliolater pleads with you to do something , such as to pray for enlightenment each day , or to read the Bible , or to attend church , present a proposal of your own .
Say , " Sure I will , if you 'll do something for me .
Go out into the woods where you wo n't be embarrassed by being seen or heard and call upon the wood spirits and water nymphs to give you good luck . "
Since this is idolatry to the evangelist , it will not be done , and you wo n't have to keep your part of the bargain either .
Also , this person will leave .
12 . It is a great delight to quote the Bible to people who say that they believe all of it ( but do n't ) and most definitely do n't like what you are quoting .
First , they will charge you with taking it out of context ; but they wo n't know the context either .
When this charge is made , ask them how the context shifts the meaning away from what it seems to say .
Be prepared to witness some squirming and some double - talk .
Second , you will be told that what you have read was n't meant literally , but is an allegory , a parable , etc .
If this ploy is used , ask why you are supposed to take what they quote as literal but they are not supposed to take what you quote as literal .
After all , what 's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander .
13 .
Ask the bibliolater , " Are you a fool for Christ ? "
If the answer is yes ( and it often is ) , simply say that a fool for Christ is still a fool and that you do n't take advice from fools .
If the answer is no , tell the person that he or she ought to be a fool , according to I Corinthians 3:18 :
" Let no man deceive himself .
If any man among you seemeth to be wise [ logic , philosophy , science , etc. ] let him become a fool !
[ moron in Greek ] , that he may be wise . "
In other words , murder your mind , reduce yourself to the level of a terrified moron , and you will live in endless bliss after you 're dead .
Remember , the fear of the Bible - god is the beginning of true wisdom ( Proverbs 9:10 ) .
Since St. Paul picks up on this , the Christian should exhibit fearful foolishness in all things .
14 .
There are three approaches you can take if you want to have a little fun -- and just possibly bring the bibliolater to right - mindedness .
( 1 ) Get this person to explain some god-awful ( so to speak ) passage from the Bible ; ( 2 ) create cognitive dissonance , confronting the person with two or more inconsistent ideas both or all of which this person wants to believe but really can't ; or ( 3 ) pretend to try to convert the person to some zany , cuckoo doctrine that you claim as your own that comes , of course , from the Bible .
In other words , turn the tables .
An example of a god- awful passage is in Exodus 21:7 where the Bible - god gives instructions to fathers about selling their daughters into slavery .
Since " maidservant " in the text means " slave , " do n't let the bibliolater tell you that this is something less than slavery ( see Deuteronomy 15:12 to clinch the case ) .
Point out that you have heard how big the Bible is on the importance of the family .
Is selling a child into slavery what one expects of a good family ?
If the bibliolater says that this is what the Bible - god told the Jews but that it does n't apply to Christians , ask why Jesus never once had anything critical to say about slavery , or Paul either .
In I Corinthians 5:1- 5 Paul tells believers to deliver a certain not - so - evildoer to Satan for the destruction of his flesh .
Just how were they to do this ?
Did Satan maintain a pick - up point somewhere in Corinth where Christians could hand evil - doers over to Satanic transport and delivery , or did the Old Nick himself pop in now and again to harvest sinners personally ?
Would the bad guy have been alive at this time or already dispatched by some approved method ?
Imagine how this passage must have warmed the heart of the Grand Inquisitor doing the holy work of burning heretics alive .
What are the flames of a half hour compared to those of eternity ?
Here is an example of cognitive dissonance .
A bright high - school student once took a summer seminar in science at Auburn University .
Upset by something I said in a special lecture , he told me that he believed everything in the Bible .
I knew that he was interested in geology and had seen a tiny bit of moon rock , so I said , " Well , I guess you believe that moon rock will turn to blood some day . "
" Why should I ? " he asked .
Turning to Acts 2:20 I read :
" The sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before that great and notable day of the Lord come . "
Knowing what he knew about the atomic and chemical structure of moon rock and how different from blood this is , and knowing he believes everything in the Bible , I left him to stew in his own juice .
It may seem cruel , but this is a good way to help people come to their right minds .
Millions are stewing in juice like this , and if we can't always plunge them under , we can turn up the fire under their stewpots .
Whatever else happens , the moon is not going to become one big blood clot in the vacuum of space .
The following is an example of how to use something cuckoo in the Bible to turn the tables .
Of course , you have to be willing to tell a little fib , to suffer even as I suffered with Pastor Russell , and to play a role without smiling or giving yourself away .
Remember that bibliolaters have certain assumptions : they are ambassadors of the Bible - god .
They are merely telling you what he wants you to believe : you are a sinner ( or unbeliever , same thing ) , you are really miserable deep down ( whether you know it or not ) , and you will be thankful someday that the evangelist set you straight .
Nothing bothers evangelists more than to have the tables turned or to have to take their own medicine .
Ask the bibliolater if he or she believes that the earth Noah 's ark settled down on was the same as the one that existed when the flood waters began to rise .
It 's almost one - hundred percent sure that the evangelist will say yes .
Then , with a knowing look , read II Peter 3:6 :
" Whereby the world that then was , being overflowed with water , perished . "
( The Greek word " perished " also means " annihilated " or " abolished . " )
Then read verse 7 :
" But the heavens and the earth , which now are . . . "
So , you see , while old Noah and his menagerie were up on those flood waters , poof !
The first world disappeared and the Bible - god made a new earth for the ark to land on .
Call this the doctrine of Two - World Creationism and claim stoutly that it must be believed for salvation .
( This ought to have special effect on the " scientific creationists " in your neighborhood . )
By this time the evangelist will need to be going , pressing business , many other lost souls to be reached , etc .
15 .
The evangelist may say that the Bible is true because of its fulfilled prophecies .
Do n't be stunned .
You can be sure that the evangelist wo n't know the actual dates of the so - called prophecies , or whether the predictions were written before or after the events in question .
In general the books of the Bible do a poor job of dating things .
Moreover , neither of you will know the details of how a particular book got from its origin(s ) into the edited form it is now in .
The likelihood is great that some predictions were made after the events in question ( such as those in Daniel ) .
Others were written with a very short - term fulfillment in mind , and still others were never fulfilled .
A short - term prophecy is found in Isaiah 7:14 - 16 .
In this famous prediction it is said that a " virgin " shall conceive .
The Hebrew word ( almah ) does not require us to believe more than that a certain " young woman " is either about to get pregnant or already is .
( The RSV , Smith and Goodspeed , and the translation of Moffatt all use " young woman . " )
The curds and honey that the babe shall eat ( 7:15 ) are royal foods , so this must be a royal baby .
In any case , by the time the baby knows how to distinguish good from bad ( at his bar mitzvah ) a certain military threat to Jerusalem will have faded away .
So , here is a prophecy that has a time span of about fifteen years .
( Nine months gestation , plus thirteen years , plus leeway for the time of the actual conception . )
The events occurred more than seven hundred years before Jesus and had to do with a certain Emmanuel , not with Jesus .
In Isaiah 53 there is a famous passage taken to be a prediction of Jesus .
Too bad , the whole chapter is in the past tense .
It has to do with somebody who has already died , not with somebody in the distant future .
In Jeremiah 31:33 - 34 we are told that the days are coming when the Bible - god will write his law in the hearts of his people .
Jews wo n't even need to be taught to know the Lord , for they shall already know him .
Alas , in nearly 2,600 years this has not happened .
Jewish babies still have to be taught Judaism .
They do n't pop out of the birth canal knowing the Bible - god and ready to do his bidding automatically .
Here is a prophecy that clearly has not been , and is not about to be , fulfilled .
16 .
When somebody quotes scripture , say that you do n't believe the Bible because its prophecies are mistaken .
This will hit hard , because the bibliolater is programmed to believe that prophecies are a strong recommendation .
Point out that Revelation 1:1 says that it contains things that must shortly ( or soon ) come to pass .
But here it is 1,900 years later and these things still have n't happened .
Does anybody think this is soon ?
Hearing this , the evangelist will routinely quote II Peter 3:8 :
" . . . one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day . "
Do n't be stymied -- this is a dodge .
If the word " shortly " has a meaning to the Bible - god different from the way humans commonly measure time , then this god has failed to communicate anything .
If he is thinking of a thousand years when we think of a day , or vice versa , then we do n't know what he means .
What kind of revelation is it that systematically confuses you ?
What is true of the Bible in this instance is true of it in general : it is no revelation at all .
I remember a day in the late ' 70s when three hulking youths , built on the football lineman model , entered my office .
" We 're from the Campus Crusade for Christ , " one said .
" How interesting ! " I replied , showing keen enthusiasm but not giving them a chance to get started .
" Why , just a couple of weeks ago there was a delegation here from the Brotherhood of Buddhist Bricklayers , and then last week some folks came by from the Cartel of Confucian Carpenters . "
By the time I got to the Junta of Hindu Hammersmiths , one began to grin , thus giving up the jig , and as I began to tell them about forthcoming visits from the Syndicate of Sikh Salmon Seiners , they wheeled and departed from my office , and I had n't even gotten around to the Junta of Jewish Gymnasts or the Menage of Moslem Morticians .
Yes , Friends and Fellow FFRF Freethinkers , even humor sometimes helps in handling bibliolaters .

“ One bad moment can derail an entire campaign , ” said Mark Macias , a former producer for New York , Miami and Phoenix stations and the author of “ Beat the Press , ” who pointed to the bad press accumulated by Sarah Palin when she was interviewed in the 2008 presidential campaign .
Now out of office , Ms. Palin may be a role model of sorts for subverting the news media ; she now rarely gives interviews , except to Fox News , which pays her to be a contributor .

The tradition of political candidates pursuing news coverage has not caught on with Sharron Angle , a Republican hoping to unseat Senator Harry Reid , the majority leader , in Nevada .
Credit ... Isaac Brekken / Associated Press
Ms. Angle , a local Republican legislator , was friendlier to the press back when she was deemed a long shot in the Senate race , according to reporters who have known her for years .
But that changed after she was enthroned as the Tea Party ’s choice to challenge Senator Harry Reid , the majority leader , this fall .
A week before the June 8 primary , her spokesman , Jerry Stacy , was quoted as saying , “ She ’s not interested in meeting up with any media or anything . ”
Ms. Angle ’s campaign strategy — if it is indeed a strategy ; a spokesman did not respond to a request for comment — is representative of a pick - and - choose media landscape .
Since the primary victory , she has showed up on Fox News and sat down with several conservative radio hosts , including Bill Manders of KOH , the dominant talk station in Reno .
“ She answers every question I ask her , ” Mr. Manders said , although he said he had advised her to give more interviews .
At the moment , said Anjeanette Damon , a longtime political reporter for The Reno Gazette - Journal who recently moved to The Las Vegas Sun , “ she is just talking to the base , people who are going to start sending her money . ”
Jason Pasco , the news director at KTVN , the CBS affiliate in Reno , called that tactic a “ disservice to our viewers , ” some of whom have been calling local stations and asking questions about Ms. Angle ’s views .
He speculated that Internet outlets like YouTube and Twitter , which allow for unfettered connections between candidates and voters , had emboldened her campaign .
“ Maybe they think they can hit the people they want to hit directly , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think that hits the undecided voters though . ”
Republican officials have said that reporters will hear from Ms. Angle in due time , once she builds up her campaign staff .
Mr. Macias said , “ If she ’s not answering all the questions , it ’s probably because she does n’t have the answers yet . ”
In the meantime , Mr. Reid ’s campaign has made Ms. Angle ’s silence a campaign issue , and the state Democratic committee has designed a Web site showing her in an underground bunker , hiding from a camera crew .

This week , pictures taken by Nasa 's Solar Dynamics Observatory were published : they show solar flares and storms in incredible detail ; the observatory will help us understand the sun 's magnetic field and how space weather is generated .
Also this week , the Hubble Space Telescope is 20 years old .
Hubble is a fantastic achievement ; at one point it seemed that , because of a flaw in the mirror , the telescope might be a dud , but it was repaired by astronauts in space and has sent back images of breathtaking clarity and beauty .
I 've heard the opinion expressed that spending money on this kind of investigation of the universe is wasteful .
With so many pressing problems here on Earth , how can we justify expending resources on studying the heavens ?
Of course this sort of investigation can bear fruit , which is of practical use to us in our daily lives .
But that 's only half an answer to the question .
At The School of Life – an educational enterprise that brings the history of ideas to bear on modern problems – I teach a class titled How to be Calm .
Among other things , we discuss how to gain a sense of perspective on one 's life and problems .
For people with a religious faith , this can be quite straightforward : if nothing else , the focus on an omnipotent , infinite God can't help making your own difficulties seem entirely surmountable .
But for those of us without faith , I propose the Hubble Deep Field Image as an excellent alternative way to get some perspective .
In 1995 , the Hubble telescope was pointed for 10 days at a patch of sky which appears completely blank to the naked eye from the Earth .
It 's a tiny piece – much smaller than the area of sky you 'd cover with your little fingernail if you held your arm outstretched .
And in that apparently blank area of sky the Hubble Deep Field Image discerned with amazing clarity more than 10,000 galaxies .
Each galaxy is made up , on average , of about 100 bn stars .
Every star could , like our sun , be orbited by planets .
That is the size of the universe we live in .
This may not be a thought that makes you feel calm .
Although many people find that this sense of scale helps make their own problems seem less enormous , it does n't work for everyone .
For some the sense of how incredibly small we actually are seems to instil terror instead .
But perhaps even terrifying perspective is important .
In 1968 , during the Apollo 8 mission , a photograph known as Earthrise was taken .
It shows the Earth , from the moon , rising across the lunar landscape .
This photograph has been called " the most influential environmental photograph ever taken " .
The sense it gave of the Earth as small , beautiful and fragile – the understanding that , whatever our differences , we 're all together on one small planet – has been credited with kick - starting the environmental movement of the 1970s .
The Apollo space missions may have come partly out of the paranoia of the cold war , but the legacy they 've left has been one that can move us out of tribalism .
Hubble 's contribution to scientific understanding has been impressive , including information about the speed at which the universe is expanding , investigating black holes and improving our estimates of its age .
But the benefits of appreciating the size and scale of our universe are n't limited to science .
If I were in charge of such things , I 'd mandate that before every climate change conference , before peace talks and trade negotiations , leaders and policians should spend some minutes contemplating the Hubble Deep Field .
This is the size of the universe we may as a species , if we 're industrious , resourceful and fortunate , get to explore .
This can be our goal : surely one worth pursuing .
With so many pressing problems on Earth , how can we afford not to try to focus on the things that unite us ?
Human beings used to cast their eyes heavenwards in search of divine inspiration , but it turns out that the stars themselves can be inspirational enough .
Sadly , the space programme is one of the casualties of our very Earth - bound financial meltdown .
Two weeks ago , President Obama announced that the US is cancelling its ambitious $ 108bn ( £ 75 bn ) Constellation programme , which aimed to put a man on Mars by 2030 .
Instead , there 's a more modest and amorphous plan to research new rocket technologies and make a new decision in 2015 .
Depressing compromises and scalings - back of big ambitions like this are likely to become increasingly familiar .
It 's pretty obvious that the current election hoopla is distracting us from thinking about the very painful decisions that are going to have to be made , but in a few days ' time those questions will come back to centre - stage .
In the meantime , Channel 4 has made an online game to refocus our attention on the unattractive financial future .
Chop or Not starts out humorously : " Startling new research suggests that if you keep spending money eventually it runs out " , but presents stark choices .
Would you rather halve pension credits , or stop grants to housing charities ?
Cut 50 % of A& Es or stop nuclear decommissioning ?
Cut all BBC funding or close some primary schools ?
The game is building up a picture of the preferences of the country : so far it 's not looking good for military spending and support for churches , while education and pensions are high on the list of spending to preserve .
Like the Hubble Deep Field Image , what this little game does really well is to give a sense of scale .
Human beings often have trouble getting an intuitive sense of very big or very small numbers ; it can be hard to fully imagine the difference in scale between a billion and a trillion .
Often it 's only by turning figures into concrete images that we can really understand them : a blue whale is as long as three double - decker buses , 1 m seconds is 12 days , while 1 trillion seconds is 30,000 years .
Releasing 10,000 prisoners sounds like a lot , and it cuts £ 247 m from the deficit , which also sounds like a substantial amount of money .
But it barely makes an impact on the row of zeroes of our £ 152bn deficit .
Shutting 40 secondary schools saves £ 1,600 m , but that still does n't make much of an impact .
It 's not happy reading .
But the only way we 're going to make sensible choices is to raise our heads and really start to understand the scale of the problems , and the opportunities that confront us .

The idea that changes in solar activity can affect our weather and climate has very much fallen out of fashion in recent times .
Most climate scientists ' efforts have been directed towards the impact of greenhouse gases on global temperatures , and what a warmer planet could mean to weather and climate .
Most , but not all , meteorologists dismiss the idea that the sun could play an important role in determining our weather , and hence climate .
This may , at least in part , be down to the fact that forecasts these days are heavily reliant on powerful supercomputers that can't incorporate the influence of the sun , simply because the precise mechanism of how the sun impacts our weather is either not understood , or impossible to model .
But it was n't that long ago that eminent climatologists such as Professor Lamb at the University of East Anglia conducted research which showed , amongst other things , a link between low solar activity and pressure patterns over Greenland .
In his day forensic analysis of weather data was the only way to forecast the weather , but sadly much of his work , and work like it , has been mostly forgotton , as the weather industry becomes more and more reliant on computer simulations of the atmosphere .
But it seems that it may becoming a fashionable area of research once more .
In my article ' Could the sun cast a shadow on global temperatures ' I featured research by Australian scientist David Archibald , who concluded that the prolonged solar minimum that we have just witnessed would lead to , amongst other things , colder European winters in the next decade .
Interestingly his research was published in 2008 long before the coldest winter in the UK since 1978 / 79 struck .
So it was with interest in April when I read that Professor Lockwood at Reading University conducted a similar analysis , and came to the same conclusion as Mr Archibald - that colder European winters in the next few years were possible because of the behaviour of the sun .
You can see an article based on his research by clicking here .
But I wanted to highlight a fascinating piece of research that has been published in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar - Terrestrial Physics .
It again shows quite clearly a link between solar activity and temperature and pressure variability across Europe .
You can read the research paper by clicking here , but here are some intriguing highlights :
1 ) A strong correlation is found between wintertime temperatures and pressure disturbances in Europe - which applies up to the most recent past and which , according to the authors , had not been previously reported .
2 ) The relationship between solar forcing and European climate is not stationary over a year , but strongly depends on the season , so simple averaging over the whole year may obscure the underlying forcing .
The solar signature is present all over the 20th century in wintertime European temperature .
3 ) Solar modulation of temperature disturbances ' are by no means small ' .
4 ) The authors believe they have uncovered a regional ( European ) expression of a global phenomena .
5 ) The study shows that the evolution of temperature disturbances remains linked with solar activity up to present .
6 ) Physical processes and feedbacks possibly linking climate variations to solar variations are not fully understood .
The authors conclude that ' the role of the sun in global and regional climatic change should be re-assessed ' .

Datenschwund bei linker Rechtshilfegruppe : Rote Hilfe hilflos
Eine Festplatte mit Mitgliederdaten verschwand aus der Geschäftsstelle der linke Rechtshilfeorganisation in Göttingen .
Der traditionell äußerst verschwiegene Verein ist zerknirscht .
Der linken Rechtshilfeorganisation Rote Hilfe ist eine Festplatte mit Mitglieder - und Kontodaten gestohlen worden .
Die Platte befand sich in einem Stahlschrank des " Roten Zentrums " in Göttingen , in dem die Bundesgeschäftsstelle des Vereins Büros hat .
Der Diebstahl wurde schon Anfang Mai begangen , ist aber erst jetzt bekanntgeworden , nachdem Mitglieder einen Brief des Rote - Hilfe - Vorstands öffentlich machten .
Die Mitgliederdaten sind heikel : Neonazis und Verfassungsschutz interessieren sich seit langem für die Rote Hilfe .
Und auch Politikern tut es nicht unbedingt gut , wenn bekannt wird , dass sie die als " linksextrem " eingestufte Organisation unterstützen .
Noch - Juso - Chefin Franziska Drohsel hätte 2007 unter dem Druck einer Kampagne der CDU fast zurücktreten müssen , als bekannt wurde , dass sie Mitglied der Roten Hilfe war .
In einer Erklärung des Vorstandes heißt es , der Diebstahl sei möglicherweise durch einen " fahrlässigen Umgang einer anderen Gruppe mit Schlüsseln begünstigt worden " .
Von einem " gezielten Einbruch " könne " jedenfalls nicht ausgegangen werden " .
In dem Gebäude haben neben der Roten Hilfe auch die Linkspartei und die DKP ihre örtlichen Geschäftsstellen .
Es sei " unwahrscheinlich , aber nicht unmöglich " , dass die Diebe mit Hilfe der gestohlenen Daten unberechtigte Abbuchungen von Konten der Rote - Hilfe - Mitglieder vornehmen .
Die Mitglieder wurden aufgefordert , " Kontobewegungen genau anzuschauen und falsche Abbuchungen zu reklamieren " .
Ein Sprecher der Göttinger Polizei sagte , die Rote Hilfe habe den Diebstahl bis Dienstag noch nicht angezeigt .
Die 1975 gegründete Rote Hilfe ist die wichtigste Hilfsorganisation für linke Polit - Aktivisten in Deutschland .
Antifas , Gipfeldemonstranten , Atomkraft - oder Hartz - IV - Gegner :
Sie alle werden von ihr unterstützt , wenn sie Anwälte , Prozesskosten oder Bussgelder nicht bezahlen können .
Weil man seit jeher Ausforschung fürchtet , ist das in der linken Szene verbreitete Bemühen um Anonymität bei der Roten Hilfe besonders stark ausgeprägt : Ortsgruppen sind oft nur über Postfächer erreichbar , die Namen der Vorstandsmitglieder werden nicht veröffentlicht , geschweige denn jene von Mitgliedern und UnterstützerInnen .
Umso unangenehmer ist der Datendiebstahl der Organisation auswachsen .
Der Bundesvorstand hatte erklärte , er bedaure die Ereignisse " zutiefst " und übernehme die " volle politische Verantwortung " für den Vorfall .
Dennoch wolle man bis zur nächsten Bundesdelegiertenversammlung im September weiterarbeiten " um dort Rede und Antwort zu stehen und für größtmögliche Transparenz zu sorgen " .
I love me a good casting rumor and this one is especially juicy .
According to SuperHeroHype via / Film , writer / director Guy Ritchie wants Daniel Day - Lewis to play Moriarty in Sherlock Holmes 2 . Eureka !
Of course this does n’t mean Ritchie will get him , or that he really does want him because nothing has been confirmed , but that does n’t mean I ca n’t salivate for a moment at the prospect of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law waging a battle of wits with Daniel Day - Lewis .
Ooooh , the possibilities are endless .
In the first Holmes flick , famed arch - nemesis Moriarty was depicted as a shadowy figure who spoke briefly , but whose identity was concealed .
Several names have been linked to the role , most notably Brad Pitt .
However , guys like Gary Oldman ( who would be fantastic too ) and Javier Bardem ( I can see it ) are also in the mix .
But let ’s be honest .
Day - Lewis is the best actor in the game , so if Ritchie were able to land him , Sherlock Holmes 2 would become one of the most anticipated sequels in years .
Although it ’s all speculation at this stage , my fingers are double - crossed it becomes a reality .
EXARCHIA ARSON
Police question 45 people after four vehicles are torched Police took in 45 people for questioning after a predawn arson attack on four parked cars in the central Athens neighborhood of Exarchia yesterday .
The attack occurred at about 1 a.m. at the corner of Tsamadou and Tositsa streets .
Firefighters soon put out the blaze .
The suspects were released several hours later .
No arrests were made .
TAX STRIKE
Officials off the job for two days
Tax officials are staging a 48 - hour strike starting today in protest at the cuts to their salaries that the government is imposing as part of its efforts to reduce public spending .
They will also be demanding the hiring of more personnel .
Judicial officials are also staging a three - hour work stoppage today .
Officer assault Five people appeared before a prosecutor in Athens on Saturday charged with disturbing the peace and attacking a police officer during the protests a day earlier against the government 's austerity measures .
The policeman had his helmet removed and was hit over the head with a piece of marble during the skirmishes on Friday .
Swift return
An Aegean Airlines flight that took off from Thessaloniki's Macedonia Airport for Athens yesterday afternoon had to make an immediate landing after developing engine problems .
The pilot made a request for an emergency landing just four minutes after taking off .
The Airbus 320 , which was carrying 146 passengers , landed at the airport safely .
Fatal accidents
One person was killed and another three injured in a car crash on Syngrou Avenue in southern Athens early yesterday .
The accident happened at about 6 a.m. when a car collided with a taxi as the two vehicles were traveling toward Piraeus .
The 64 - year - old taxi driver was killed and the three people in the car , which hit a crash barrier after striking the cab , were injured .
Meanwhile , three people were killed and one injured when two cars crashed on the national road between Patra and Pyrgos in the Peloponnese .
Hidden immigrants
A 51 - year - old Romanian truck driver was arrested at the Promachonas border crossing on Saturday night after 26 illegal immigrants were found hiding in cardboard boxes in his vehicle .
Another 21 illegal immigrants were also found hiding in a truck that was stopped in the agricultural area of Tychero in northeastern Greece on Saturday .
Two suspected traffickers were arrested .
Taking a toll
The private company responsible for managing a section of the Athens - Thessaloniki national road in central Greece , Aegean Motorway , said that charges at two of its toll stations would be going up as of today .
Drivers at the Pelasgia and Makrohori booths will have to pay 2.30 euros , while motorcycles will be charged 1.60 .
Matricide A 36 - year - old man suspected of murdering his 80 - year - old mother at her home in the village of Anakriti , near Serres in northern Greece , has been remanded in custody , sources said on Saturday .
The suspect allegedly beat his mother to death with a copper pipe after she refused to hand over her pension and because she maintained close ties with his ex-wife .
Financial reform is on the way , courtesy of Freshman Republican Senator Scott Brown ( MA ) .
The procedural vote to limit debate passed today with the precise number needed -- 60 .
Although Brown voted ' no ' yesterday , he changed his vote today , despite the fact that no additional amendments had been considered since that time .
Arlen Specter ( D - PA ) also voted in favor of the motion today .
Yesterday , he did n't cast a vote .
So where do things go from here ?
First , it 's worth noting that both of the Democrats that voted against the bill yesterday -- Senators Maria Cantwell ( D - WA ) and Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) -- did the same today .
That 's likely because no more amendments were heard , and that was exactly their complaint for voting ' no ' the first time .
But with the addition of Brown 's and Specter 's votes , it did n't matter .
Brown's Change of Heart
What changed Brown 's mind between yesterday and today .
Reid had expressed frustration that Brown had n't voted for cloture yesterday , as Brown had apparently said he would vote for the motion .
But afterward Brown released a statement saying :
As it currently stands , however , this bill would prohibit businesses in Massachusetts from continuing to do business as has been done for decades and would lead to serious job loss in our state .
Specifically , it does not address my concerns about the Volcker rule for both insurance companies and our safe custody banks - institutions that did not contribute to the financial crisis , but would be crippled by the current legislation and in turn would result in job losses .
My constituents sent me to Washington to look out for their priorities first and foremost , and I cannot in good conscience vote to end debate on a flawed bill .
I will continue to work in a bipartisan fashion in the days ahead to improve this bill for my state and my country .
Of course , the Volcker rule -- taken up by the Merkley - Levin amendment -- did n't pass since the last vote .
But Reid 's office indicates that it will be second in priority for consideration before the final vote .
So Reid 's promise that he will try to get the amendment heard is all it took .
Brown 's office released another statement today saying :
I supported moving the financial bill forward today because I received assurances from Senator Reid and his leadership team that the issues related to Massachusetts in the financial reform bill will be fixed before it is signed into law .
We are still working to ensure these commitments are fulfilled prior to a final vote .
It then alluded to the Volcker rule .*

Nivetske , Ukraine –
The residents of the little village of Nivetske , located just west of Chornobyl , are literally living on the edge .
It ’s not just the edge of the so - called “ alienation zone , ” a 30 - kilometer area where people are not supposed to settle .
Somehow , Nivetske is also on the edge of decent living standards : they have regular power blackouts , health care is out of reach , and there is no easy way to commute to the bigger towns nearby .
The list of daily challenges for the villagers , whose lives are still affacted by the world ’s worst nuclear power accident on April 26 , 1986 , is long .
“ It used to be a nice prosperous village before the Chornobyl explosion .
We had a big collective farm and were known for their cattle , ” said Anatoliy Oborsky , a Nivetske native .
“ There used to be more than 100 households and a population of 800 people . ”
More great work from Cake here from last October for Sky HD : Using the screening of Pink Floyd ’s 1984 performance of Dark Side Of The Moon ( screened on Sky Arts ) , they recreated the iconic album cover for real on London ’s Primrose Hill .
It looks fucking awesome .

Chicago - based caterers and longtime partners Dan Smith and Steve McDonagh , who went on to host the Food Network show Party Line With the Hearty Boys after winning the cooking competition show , decided to reach out to Huckabee after he compared allowing gay marriage to the legalization of drug abuse , polygamy and incest — and likened adoption by same - sex couples to getting a new pet .
Speaking to student journalists recently at the College of New Jersey , Huckabee reiterated his longstanding view that gays should not be allowed to adopt .
" Children are not puppies , " he reportedly said .
In an open letter posted on his blog , natespop , McDonagh urged Huckabee to get to know him , Smith and their 4 1/2 - year - old son Nate , whom they adopted at birth .
" Mr. Huckabee , I invite you to spend the evening with us at our home in Chicago next time you come through , " McDonagh wrote .
" You need to understand and see firsthand what a family like ours is like .
We are no less a family than yours , and in fact , we are healthier and more stable than most . "
A former governor of Arkansas and Republican presidential candidate , Huckabee now hosts his own show on Fox News and is often named as one of the GOP bigots favorites to make another run for the White House in 2012 .
Huckabee has backpedaled on his recent comments , claiming they were taken out of context and sensationalized .
" Americans are no longer going to sit silent as our families are attacked , " McDonagh wrote .
" And even though I find your comments reprehensible and irresponsible , I will open my home to you and pray that we might help you better understand the damage you could inflict . "
In a post earlier today , McDonagh said he has reached out to shows like The View in hopes they would cover the story .
" I 've tried really hard to get as much exposure with this letter as I can , " he wrote .
" It 's an earnest invitation ; not a prank or a stunt .
We thought that as restaurateurs and event planners that reaching out in this way makes it harder for him to decline . "
They have yet to hear from Mr. Huckabee .
Perhaps he 's out picking up a bottle of wine to bring to dinner .

But one of its most controversial — a lifetime ban on donation by men who 've had sex with other men — may finally be coming to an end .
Massachusetts lawmakers like Senator John Kerry are pushing an overturn of the ban .
The Red Cross , American Medical Association , and American Association of Blood Banks all want the lifetime ban to go away , though the Red Cross supports in its stead a single - year donation ban dating back to the last sexual encounter .
Blood donation
The lifetime ban was enacted in 1983 before AIDS was widely understood and has long infuriated gay rights groups since it applies to all gay men regardless of their HIV status .
Heterosexuals who engage in risky behavior , like having sex with prostitutes or HIV - positive partners , are only banned from giving blood for a year [ Boston Globe ] .
Besides the ugly unfairness of that arrangement , there 's the fact that HIV testing now allows for the detection of infection just weeks after it happens , and everybody who donates blood is screened .
Dr. Norbert Gilmore , an AIDS clinician , says the first priority for medical officials has to be keeping the trust of Americans in the blood donation system .
But we can do that and still get rid of rules that reflect the AIDS panic of the 1980s and not modern scientific advances .
" With the technology we have , the risks are so small that keeping this ban in place is like permanently grounding the entire aviation system because we 're afraid that eventually we might have a single crash , " he said [ BusinessWeek ] .
The Department of Health and Human Services is considering the change .
If the agency decides to ax the lifetime ban , the change would have to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration .
UCLA research
( pdf ) found that going to a one - year ban instead of a lifetime one would bring in 90,000 more pints of blood every year ; demolishing any ban based on sexual orientation , meanwhile , could bring in 210,000 .

Image caption Pierino Gelmini founded the drug rehabilitation centre in 1963
A high - profile former Roman Catholic priest in Italy has been charged with sexual abuse .
Pierino Gelmini , 85 , is alleged to have abused 12 young people at a drug rehabilitation centre he had founded .
He denies the charges .
Mr Gelmini left the priesthood two years ago to defend himself .
The Comunita Incontro , which runs drug rehabilitation centres worldwide , has enjoyed the support of powerful figures in Italian politics .
In 2005 , Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi gave $ 6 m ( £ 4 m ) to his organisation .
Mr Gelmini set up the Communita Incontro in 1963 in the Umbrian town of Amelia .
It has more than 200 centres in Italy - and others in France , Spain , the US , Brazil and Thailand .
The allegations against him surfaced in 2008 when nine young men said he had sexually abused them .
Another three went to police later .
The first hearing of his trial is due on 29 March 2011 .
Mr Gelmini's lawyer says " there is no proof that can support the accusations " .
Penance versus justice
The Roman Catholic Church in Italy has admitted that about 100 cases of paedophile priests have been reported to church authorities during the past 10 years .
But it is not known how many priests in the country have subsequently been defrocked under canon law - or how many have been prosecuted by police .
There has been a wave of allegations in the past few months that Church authorities in Europe and North and South America failed to deal properly with priests accused of child sex abuse , sometimes just moving them to new parishes where more children were put at risk .
Pope Benedict XVI himself has been accused of being part of a culture of secrecy , and of not taking strong enough steps against paedophiles when he had that responsibility as a cardinal in Rome .
However , his supporters say he has been the most pro-active pope yet in confronting abuse .
Last month , the Pope said the Church has " a very deep need " to acknowledge that it must do penance for its sins and " accept purification " .
However , he added that forgiveness should not be a substitute for justice .
This actually sounds like an awesome project .
Having two of my current favorite musical acts drop an album full of songs I grew up listening to … someone get me a bib because I ca n’t stop drooling .
Musical powerhouses John Legend &
The Roots are presenting fans with a fiery new offering , Wake Up !
The upcoming CD , being released by Sony Music on September 21 , 2010 , will feature soulful music from the 60’s and 70’s all with an underlying theme of awareness , engagement and consciousness — effectively telling listeners to Wake Up !
After being inspired by the recent historical Presidential election campaign of 2008 , the R&B singer Legend and hip - hop band The Roots felt a need to enter the action .
What started as plans for a single quickly developed into a passionate album representing change , hope and activism — not only referencing one particular moment in time , but on a larger scale , holding true no matter what the political climate may be .
More down bottom .
The resulting album features eleven profoundly evocative songs infused with sounds of gospel , rock and reggae inflections with hip - hop influences .
The album is highlighted by familiar tracks like “ Wholly Holy ” by Marvin Gaye and “ Little Ghetto Boy ” by Donny Hathaway mixed with the more obscure selections of Baby Huey and the Babysitters ’
“ Hard Times , ” and “ Hang on in There ” by Mike James Kirkland .
“ These songs sound so relevant now , ” Legend says .
“ On most of them , you would n’t change a lyric .
‘ Wake Up Everybody ’ ( the album ’s first single , featuring contributions from Melanie Fiona and Common ) has four verses — the first one is a general statement , the second is about education , third is about health care , and the fourth is about making a better environment .
No editing needed . ”
“ When these songs were written , people were more spiritually in tune , ” says Roots drummer / musical director Ahmir “ ? uestlove ” Thompson .
“ It was fresh from the civil rights era and there was a feeling of hope that maybe , yes , someday we will all be free .
In 2010 , not so much . ”
The album features one original composition , Legend ’s song “ Shine , ” which is featured in Academy Award - winning director Davis Guggenheim ’s upcoming documentary film Waiting for Superman .
The song , a “ Stevie - Wonder - meets - gospel ” stunner , clearly demonstrates the strengths of this specific group of musicians .
Wake Up ! blends
Legend ’s expressive , thoughtful vocal interpretations with an element of funk that only The Roots can provide .

MONTGOMERY - State school Superintendent Joe Morton today said he and other state education officials intend to bill BP for losses to the state Education Trust Fund caused by the Gulf oil spill that followed the April explosion of an oil rig .
The trust fund gets most of its money from state sales - tax and income - tax collections , and Morton said those collections would be hurt by diminished tourism on the Gulf Coast .
Morton said the state education department likely would present the first bill to BP in 30 to 45 days .
He said the department will work with Gov. Bob Riley 's office or perhaps Attorney General Troy King 's office toward filing a lawsuit if BP rebuffs the bills .
Morton said he will enlist outside '' economic experts ' ' to help develop models that clearly demonstrate how much money the trust fund lost because of the oil spill .
'' As tourism diminishes along Alabama 's Gulf Coast , as the seafood industry is crippled due to the ' no fishing ' areas of the Gulf of Mexico , as oyster and shrimping areas are decimated by the oil spill , tax receipts to the ETF will suffer , '' Morton said at a press conference attended by state school board members Randy McKinney of Orange Beach and Ethel Hall of Fairfield .
'' The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is wreaking havoc on our environment and Gulf Coast economy , '' Morton said .
'' We can not allow it also to undermine our public schools by reducing the very tax receipts that pay our teachers ' salaries and help our classrooms keep the learning environment alive daily . ''

In a somewhat surprising move , presidential advisers recently warned President Obama that there are threats in our environment which increase our risk of cancer .
These threats include chemicals , radiation , and even radio frequencies .
These threats , they surmise , add to the risk of DNA and cell damage , and increase the risk of different types of cancer in the US population .
The panel further expressed their belief that the federal government must step in to help protect its citizens from being exposed to these elements on a frequent basis .
The unfortunate truth is that technology`s greatest advances have also become one of the biggest health threats we face today .
Technological advances have given us access to things like cellular phones , advanced health scanning and detection equipment , readily available and reliable electricity , and more .
So essentially , the same thing that has propelled us forward into new frontiers has also essentially poisoned our bodies .
Even the factories that produce these modern day conveniences are responsible for the majority of our air pollution .
Our air quality , water purity , and even the ground in which we grow our produce is affected by poisonous emissions from factories and vehicles .
In a nutshell , every day we are inundated with chemical and environmental toxins .
Until now , it really has not been acknowledged by the medical or scientific community as a true contributing factor to cancer and other diseases .
Almost everything the average citizen touches , uses on their body , inhales into their lungs , and consumes is tinged with some sort of pollutant or hazardous material .
Of course , using only natural and chemical free products minimizes this exposure , but not everyone is able to do this .
Even our water is often touched by contaminants .
Chlorine , various heavy metals , pesticides , solvents and other toxic chemicals are often found in tap water , which is why many people choose to filter their water .
Even drinking water from a plastic bottle has hazards you must be aware of .
BPAs , or Bisphenol A , which is a chemical found in plastic bottles , has been linked to causing various types of cancers .
If you cook with plastic in the microwave , harmful BPAs may be leaching into your food as well , since they are more easily leached when heated .
For this reason , it is recommended that you heat your food in the microwave only in glass .
In fact , you may be better off to eliminate microwave cooking all together .
Why use a microwave at all ?
There is evidence that microwave cooking not only destroys healthful enzymes and nutrients in food , but also chemically alters your food`s composition .
These alterations in composition can cause mutations into cancer causing agents , especially with certain foods like meats .
Even your cookware can infuse your foods with hazardous chemicals .
Popular nonstick coatings that are often used in frying pans and other cookware have been suspected in causing foods to leach harmful contaminants from their surface when heated .
Linked to bird deaths , these coatings cause activists to worry about what it could do to the human body in terms of physiological damage .

On Tuesday ’s The Daily Show , John Oliver followed Republicans to the RNC winter meeting in Hawaii , where Republicans continued to talk about fiscal responsibility while enjoying an expensive Hawaiian getaway .
The point was that when Obama goes to Hawaii , to the GOP he is an elitist , but the RNC sees no irony in their own behavior .

Here is the video :
Oliver talked to several Republicans who utter the same talking point that Democrats are out of touch with average Americans , while they lounged around in Hawaii .
One meeting attendee claimed that Democrats can’t connect with people because , “ They ’re more well to do .
They had the money to go to Harvard and that kind of thing . ”
Later in the segment , Oliver said , “ It was basic common sense .
In the middle of the recession do n’t waste money on programs that we do n’t need , ca n’t afford , or simply look ridiculous , ” all the while the video showed him lounging at the resort . ”
As usual , the comedic Daily Show was the only program to point out the sheer absurdity of the Republican Party trying to score political points , by talking about Democrats being out of touch with the common man , and fiscal responsibility , from Hawaii where they decided to hold their winter meeting in the middle of a recession .
The worst part about it is that the members of the RNC seemed completely clueless .
They talk about Democrats being elitist , but fail to realize that even in good times , average Americans ca n’t afford a getaway to Hawaii .
If Republicans are serious about fiscal responsibility , they could set an example for the rest of America , but holding their winter meeting in Pittsburgh or Cleveland instead of Hawaii .

The Football League 's dramatic refusal to sanction the Premier League 's £ 400 m funding offer has left the Premier League very angry indeed .
While a senior Football League official told me it was merely the start of a negotiation process , the Premier League has other ideas .
" We 're in no rush , " said an unnamed Football League club chairman as he and 71 others headed away from the Walkers Stadium 's Great Hall after the emergency meeting at Leicester City 's ground .
" Why should we just accept what the Premier League tell us we should take ?
We need time to go away and discuss this . "
But they do n't have time .
Because the Premier League is playing hard - ball and has set a deadline of the third week in May .
It says it needs to have its spending plans in place before the AGM in early June and says it is a take - it - or - leave - it offer .
Premier League has offered £ 400 m to Football League after securing lucrative television deals
The package included an increase in parachute payments , which is the monies handed to relegated clubs to soften the financial shock of the drop .
Under the new deal this would more than double from £ 22 m over two years to a massive £ 48 m over four years .
Some Premier League clubs thought the package was too generous anyway - so there was widespread dismay that it was n't snapped up gratefully .
As far as they are concerned the Football League can " take it or leave it " .
If it chooses to leave it then the parachute payments will remain at the current level ( £ 22 m over two years ) but solidarity payments from the richest league in the world would cease .
And that would be of huge significance .
Take a League Two club for instance .
For the last three years it has received on average £ 72,000 a season from Premier League solidarity payments .
Under the Premier League 's new three - year plan , starting from next season , they would receive a bumper £ 250,000 a season .
Some may describe that as generous on the part of the top - flight , which is under no official obligation to give away anything to the lower leagues .
Others would say it only amounts to what some top Premier League players earn in less than two weeks !
But imagine how crucial that money could be to a club with an average gate of 4000 .
League
Two clubs receive only £ 430,000 a season from their own league 's broadcasting deal with the BBC and Sky .
Premier League clubs on the other hand get an average £ 40 m a season .
In League One there 's even more at stake .
At the moment clubs in the division get about £ 108,000 a season from the Premier League .
Now the Premier League is offering to increase that to £ 325,000 a year .
So why are clubs in Leagues One and Two jeopardising such vital funds ?
What 's clear is that a new fault - line has appeared in the English game between the Championship ( 23 out of 24 were in favour of the deal I 'm told ) and the 48 clubs in the lower two leagues ( where there was unanimous opposition ) .
Most of the clubs in the Championship have spent time in the top - flight in the last 18 years , so there is a natural overlap between the two leagues .
Three years ago when the Premier League offered solidarity payments for the first time , the Football League simply accepted them , just grateful for the charity .
So why now does the professional game stand on the brink of civil war ?
Since its recovery from the ITV Digital fiasco , the Football League has forged an identity , and is proud of negotiating its current lucrative broadcasting deal , the first year of which has seen impressive audiences .
Therefore there is some unease at the strings the Premier League has attached to its offer , which largely constitute a ' standardisation ' of the rulebook that governs the two leagues .
This is seen in some cases as an encroachment on the ' sovereignty ' of the Football League , and is being resisted .
But of far greater concern is the doubling of parachute payments to clubs relegated from the Premier League .
As new Football League chairman Greg Clarke suggested on Thursday , many clubs fear this injection of cash to ' ex - Premier League clubs ' could make it almost impossible in the future for a club like Blackpool , who have not benefited from such parachutes , to launch themselves into the top - flight .
Those lucky enough to be in the top two divisions now would in time secure their dominance .
And those unfortunate enough to be outside of the club at this point in time would be effectively locked out .
The Football League now has three weeks to reconvene 72 chairmen in one place at one time yet again in order to vote on the proposals .
If they approve the plan , this will go down as a small and symbolic rebellion that was quickly snuffed out .
But if Clarke cannot secure an agreement among his highly disparate gang , then the English game will be on the brink of civil war , and the Championship will ask whether a breakaway from the lower leagues is the only option .
Bolton Chairman Phil Gartside 's vision of a Premier League 2 could come to pass after all .
Katie Strang of Newsday [ that 'll be $ 5 please ] reports that " a snag regarding procedural requirements " has canceled Charles Wang 's plan to hold 2010 Islanders training camp in his native China .
ESPN picks up the report .
Chris Botta at Islanders Point Blank provides some background info from when the agreement was initially approved by the NHLPA which makes all of this sound , to use his word , " bizarre . "
Which is of course old hat for Islanders fans accustomed to Wang 's outside - the - box forays with his club .
I always figured it was Wang 's right as owner to take the club where he wants , but I certainly am not disappointed to hear the team wo n't be traveling half way around the world to train right before enduring an 82 - game ( and hopefully , longer ) NHL season .
That idea never sat well with me , as it does n't seem designed to give your team the best chance for success .
The report that a " procedural snag " -- perhaps coupled with a disagreement over a charitable NHLPA donation instead of the union 's usual fee -- has derailed a previously agreed - upon trip leaves this news wiiiiide open for speculation that there are other factors that initiated this change : Money ?
Second thoughts ?
Logistical challenges ?
A focus on NHL success over cultural enrichment ?
The union views it as the team failing to live up to an agreement .
Whatever the deeper causes , your guess is good as mine .
The greater result for me ( should this decision stand ) is that , as the Islanders prepare to lure free agents and get this rebuild program into the next gear , they wo n't have the distraction of gearing up for next season by navigating different food and different resources some 12 time zones away .
It gives us warm , fuzzy feelings to imagine kids whiling away the summer days playing an updated version of “ Cops and Robbers ” based on The Wire — bingeing on pretend Jameson , creating miniature Hamsterdams in the park , fighting over who gets to be Omar — but what about us grown - ups ?
Well , if you live in New York , you could be among the lucky few who gets to play The Wire : Paintball Edition : Jamie Hector ( Marlo ) has organized a paintball tournament for this Saturday to benefit his non-profit youth organization Moving Mountains , pitting fellow cast members against each other as “ The Streets Vs. The Law ” — including Michael K. Williams ( Omar ) , Sonia Sohn ( Kima ) , Snoop Pearson , Anwan Glover ( Slim Charles ) , and more .
Those who have always dreamed of popping a paint - cap in Omar or Snoop ’s ass without fear of violent retribution can sign up for one of three team packages ranging from $ 750 to $ 2500 , the latter of which includes a special meet - and - greet .
The game ’s out there , and it ’s play or get played — that simple .

Democratic turnout far outpaces Republican ...
Brad Friedman Byon 5/19/2010 , 3:11 pm PT
Setting aside the unverified ( and , in many cases , unverifiable ) results of yesterday 's elections for the moment , what caught my eye throughout the night were the turnout numbers , Democratic compared to Republican .
While the reported results of the races ran largely counter ( surprise ! ) to the " GOP / TeaParty - fueled Massacre Slated for November ! " meme that the corporate beltway media and related villagers have been endlessly re-enforcing with zombie - like precision over the last several weeks and months , the turnout of actual voters in the marquee state - wide primaries ( races that we detailed , along with the e-voting systems in use , in our Super-ish Tuesday Backgrounder on Monday ) seem to be of note when considering what November might actually look like when all is said and done .
I 'd caution not to take too much from these numbers as there are various mitigating factors that could be used to explain them --- or even explain them away --- as noted below , but I think the numbers themselves are very much worth noting here , as I have n't seen much coverage of this over the last 12 hours or so ...
All numbers uncertified as of now , but taken directly from the appropriate SoS website .
KY Primary Voters in U.S. Senate Race :
DEM : 520,412
REP : 351 , 927
Note : While the Republican Rand Paul v. Trey Grayson race received , hands down , the most publicity nationally , Paul would actually have come in third place had the race been an open contest between all candidates , as both of the two leading Democratic candidates Jack Conway and Daniel Mongiardo each received more votes than Paul .
But also note : KY has a similar recent history of a larger turnout in the Democrtic Senate primary , before the Republican wins in the general .
For example : 2008 Primary voters
DEM : 619,904 REP : 195,297
The Republican incumbent Mitch McConnell ended up reportedly beating Democratic candidate Bruce Lunsford ( on the 100 % unverifiable voting machines that the majority of KY voters were forced to use that year ) : 953,816 to 847,005 .
2006 Primary voters
DEM : 218,969 REP : 114,940
The Republican incumbent Jim Bunning was said to have defeated the Dem Dan Mongiardo in the general that year ( on the same unverifiable voting systems ) : 873,507 to 850,855 .
The last time there was a vacant seat being filled , as there is this year , was 1998 .
The state had not yet moved to unverifiable voting machines that year .
1998 Primary voters
DEM : 568,292 REP : 205,291
The Republican Jim Bunning was barely victorious over Democrat Scotty Baesler in the November general ( before KY moved to unverifiable touch - screen systems ) : 569,817 to 563,051
PA Primary voters , U.S. Senate ( 99.7 % reporting ) :
DEM : 1,045,653
REP : 818,727
Note : Unlike KY , PA 's most recent history has the party with the largest number of votes in the primary going on to win in the fall .
Back in 2000 however , when the incumbent Republican Sen .
Rick Santorum ran unopposed in the primary , he received fewer votes than the Democrats who would go on to lose in the fall .
But also note : Since Arlen Specter recently switched from the Republican to the Democratic Party this year , there may have been a lot of Republican - leaning voters who signed up to vote in the Democratic primary in order to vote for him this year , particularly as there was n't much of a contest on the Republican primary side with Specter having pulled out , sensing he'd be crushed by the Republican winner last night Pat Toomey .
AR Primary voters for U.S. Senate ( 92 % reporting ) :
DEM : 301,408
REP : 135,888
Note : Arkansas voters may decide which party 's primary they 'd like to vote in at the time they go to the polls and get their ballots .
So there could have been a lot of cross - over voting in yesterday 's Democratic race in particular , with Republicans voting in the Democratic contest in order to affect things --- one way or another --- before November .
And also note : Additionally , there was also a minor candidate , DC Morrison , whose positions on virtually everything , were almost identical to a far Rightwing Republican !
His entry in the race helped to ensure neither " moderate " Dem incumbent Sen.
Blanch Lincoln , nor her slightly - less Right - leaning challenger Lt. Gov. Bill Halter received a 50 % + 1 majority .
So there will be a run-off both on the Democratic side , as well as the Republican side ( where there were eight candidates last night ! ) held on June 8th .
Those numbers may be more instructive for the November outlook .
Perhaps .
OR Primary voters for U.S. Senate :
DEM : 361,850
REP : 254,970
Note : Incumbent Democratic Sen. Ron
Wyden is very popular , in the usually - reliable Democratic state , so the numbers above are n't of tremendous surprise , other than we 've been told by the corporate media ( and the GOP / Tea Party which they too - frequently represent ) that this is a year about anti-incumbency and anger at Democrats .
If the above numbers hold up in November , the Democratic incumbent Wyden should sail to easy victory .
Also note :
The primary for open Gubernatorial seat also similar had more voter D voters than R , 363,368 to 302,431 .
Fact is there were far more Democratic votes cast nationally in yesterday 's races than Republican votes .
Given the " conventional wisdom " over the last several months that the GOP was " energized " while the Dems were deflated , yesterday 's totals --- even with their noted mitigating factors , and others not noted above --- seem worth highlighting .
Again , not to make too too much of those numbers , but they do seem worth storing in your back pocket when / if you begin to hear the familiar --- and almost always wrong --- song of " conventional wisdom " coming from the blathering politico - mouthpieces and propagandists between here and November .

Mark Ekepa journeyed from Papua New Guinea to tell the shareholders of Barrick Gold Corp . how police had burned down his house near the Barrick ’s Porgera mine .
Idolia Bornones travelled from Chile to say that Barrick operations are damaging local glaciers and rivers .
But Barrick chairman Peter Munk was unrepentant as he faced the company ’s annual meeting .
Even before the visitors had a chance to speak , Munk delivered an unapologetic defence of Barrick ’s role in improving the lives of people around the world .
Munk told shareholders that corporate social responsibility is “ part of our DNA . ”
“ By moving into these countries and developing their mines , we provide – way beyond the importance of money – we provide human dignity , ” Munk said .
“ We provide an opportunity for these people to earn their money , rather than hold out their hands and depend on charity . ”
Munk said Barrick ’s wage bill is $ 4 billion a year – often paying four to six times the average local wage .
He said the presidents of Chile , Argentina and the Domincan Republic have each told him : “ Please , please , please Barrick , please put your money into our country . ”
Munk decried what he called a “ rogue element ” among some non-government agencies that want to halt all development .
“ What can they offer to those 20,000 people we employ ? ” he said .
“ What are the people going to do ?
Line up for social benefits in the remote hills of Tanzania or Peru ?
There ai n’t none . ”
Idolia Bordones said she does n’t want Barrick ’s money , however .
Bordones raises crops and bakes bread in the Huasco Valley , near the Pascua - Lama project , which is still in development .
She ’s part of a community of 250 indigenous families in “ the last unpolluted valley of northern Chile . ”
Dust from the project is blackening glaciers , causing them to melt , she said , and is harming local wetlands and forest .
“ We do not need your money , and we are not seeking compensation , ” she said .
“ We just want you to leave our lands and allow us to live in peace . ”
Barrick ’s chief executive , Aaron Regent , said the company treats all water used in mining , and said it complies with quality standards .
He said there is “ overwhelming ” local support for the project , and the company has 150,000 names in a database of those who have applied for work .
Ekepa said that in Papua New Guinea , the Porgera Mine disrupted the local economy based on alluvial mining – washing fine gold out of river sediment .
Unlike Chile , many local residents are seeking compensation because their houses are close to the mine .
There have also been clashes with local police – not related to the mine — whom Epeka said burned down his house .
He said he would like Barrick to support an investigation into police actions , and wants the company to resettle landowners who are close to the mine .
Regent said police moved in to the area because of general lawlessness .

Company officials say compensation and resettlement claims are difficult to assess because new people have flooded into the area , many of them squatting on land to which others have a legal claim .
The company reported strong first quarter results Wednesday , with gold production up 19 per cent to 2.08 million ounces .
Costs declined , while prices for both gold and copper rose .
Barrick realized $ 1,114 an ounce on its gold sales .
Net profit was a record $ 758 million or 77 cents a share on sales of $ 2.561 billion .
That compared with net profit of $ 371 million or 42 cents a share on sales of $ 1.775 billion a year ago .

Es ist natürlich so , dass der Einsatz eines „ Liquid Democracy “ - Tools für die gesamte Bundesrepublik oder für den eigenen Stadtteil noch Zukunftsmusik ist .
Das ist eine Sache , die wird wahrscheinlich erst in 20 oder 30 Jahren umzusetzen sein .
Also fangen wir auf der kleinen Ebene an ...
Zum Beispiel damit , was das vielleicht für die Willensbildung innerhalb einer Partei bedeutet , weil dafür wurde „ Liquid Feedback “ ja eigentlich entwickelt .
Es ist wichtig , zu unterscheiden : „ Liquid Democracy “ ist das Prinzip , „ Liquid Feedback “ ist die konkrete Software , die geschrieben worden ist .
Ganz klar mit dem Hintergrund : wie komme ich in Organisationen oder Gruppen zu einer Meinungsbildung ... ... ohne dass alle am gleichen
Ort sind und sich um 19 Uhr treffen müssen ... ... und ohne dass alle auf einer Mailingliste oder in einem Forum diskutieren müssen .
Das ist wie beim Tagesticker , der ist ja auch manchmal politisch .
Dort hat einer die Meinung , ein anderer eine andere , aber man kann überhaupt nicht quantifizieren , welche Meinung eigentlich die Mehrheit hat .
Und wie hilft da Lidquid Feedback ?
Das Schöne an „ Liquid Feedback “ ist : Jeder Nutzer ist gleichberechtigt .
Man hat ein moderatorenfreies System .
Es gibt nur Administratoren , die für den technischen Bereich zuständig sind .
Das heißt , kein Nutzer hat mehr Rechte als der Andere und jeder kann Initiativen in diesem System einstellen .
Jeder , der eine Meinung zu irgendeinem
Thema hat , kann diese einstellen , das kann beliebig vage oder klar ausgearbeitet sein .
Dann können alle Nutzer in diesem System sagen : ich unterstütze das oder ich mache eine Gegeninitiative .
Das ist das Schöne an „ Liquid Feedback “ :
Es lässt nur konstruktive Kritik zu .
Das bedeutet , diese übliche ablehnende Haltung , dieses „ Flame “ , das man sonst oft hat , ist dort nicht mehr möglich .
Denn man kann die Leute dort tatsächlich nur dadurch überzeugen , dass man konstruktiv etwas zur Debatte beiträgt .
Ihr habt das im Berliner Landesverband schon im Einsatz oder ?
Ja und genau das ist der Punkt : man muss ganz deutlich sagen , „ Liquid Democracy “ bzw .
„ Liquid Feedback “ ist keine Zukunftsmusik .
Das gibt es jetzt !
Es ist ein Open Source Programm und wir benutzen es in Berlin .
Dort hatten wir Anfang des Jahres den Testbetrieb : alle Mitglieder des Berliner Landesverbandes wurden eingeladen .
Dabei wurde ein Verfahren gewählt , das sicherstellt , dass nur „ Piraten “ aus dem Landesverband Berlin in diesem System drin sind .
Seit der Landesmitgliederversammlung im Februar ist es das satzungsmäßig verankerte , offizielle Meinungsbildungstool des Landesverbandes Berlin .
Und wie funktioniert das dann konkret ?
Kannst du ein Beispiel geben ?
Wir haben Liquid Feedback zur Vorbereitung unserer Landesmitgliederversammlung benutzt und das war sehr erfolgreich .
Es hat dazu geführt , dass wir eine komplett neue Satzung in Berlin geschrieben haben .
Durch Liquid Feedback wurde sie noch einmal wesentlich besser als die ursprüngliche Version .
Es hat dazu geführt , dass diese Satzung innerhalb einer Rekordzeit verabschiedet werden konnte .
Wir haben „ en bloque “ abgestimmt .
Für den ersten
Teil haben wir eine halbe Stunde gebraucht , für drei andere Paragraphen , die etwas strittig waren , etwas länger .
Insgesamt hat es also etwa zwei Stunden in Anspruch genommen , um eine komplett neue Satzung zu verabschieden .
Wenn man bedenkt , dass wir kein Delegiertensystem haben , sondern dass dort tatsächlich jeder Pirat aus dem Berliner Landesverband hinkommen konnte , der wollte , dann war das schon eine sehr beeindruckende Sache .
Dabei nutzt Liquid Feedback das so genannte Präferenzwahl - System .
Kannst du das erklären ?
Das ist ein Feature von „ Liquid Feedback “ , das unsere Demokratie leider nicht hat .
Es gibt manchmal Entscheidungen , wie zum Beispiel das Minarett - Verbot in der Schweiz .
Das wird ja oft als Beispiel gegen die direkte Demokratie benutzt .
Das Problem daran ist , dass man in der Wahlkabine steht und sich vielleicht irgendwie diffus bedroht fühlt , aber diese diffuse Bedrohung kann man gar nicht zum Ausdruck bringen , also kreuzt man „ ja “ an .
Möchte das eigentlich aber gar nicht sagen .
Eigentlich würde man lieber sagen : ich hätte lieber mehr Integration von Muslimen in meinem Land .
Das konnte man aber nicht auf den Wahlzettel ankreuzen .
Beim Präferenzsystem geht das aber ?
Genau .
Wenn man mehrere miteinander konkurrierende Geschichten hat , dann hat man die Möglichkeit , seiner Zustimmung eine Präferenz zu geben .
Man kann z.B. sagen : das hier ist meine erste
Wahl , das hier ist meine zweite Wahl , das hier ist meine dritte Wahl .
Das bedeutet also , wenn die erste Geschichte nicht genug Zustimmung findet , dann soll die zweite Geschichte bitte genommen werden und mit der dritten kann man auch noch leben .
Das Gute daran :
Da jeder tatsächlich das ankreuzen kann , was er möchte , ist niemand gezwungen , aus irgendwelchen Kompromissängsten heraus , taktisch zu wählen .
Theoretisch könnte man also in so einem
Fall wie in NRW sagen : ich möchte gerne , dass rot - grün rauskommt , ich kann aber auch mit einer Ampel - Koalition leben .
Und damit es nicht zu einer Patt - Situation kommt , kann ich so meine Präferenzen aufteilen .
Genau – das wäre natürlich auch eine Möglichkeit , die Stimmen für irgendetwas später mal abzugeben .
Wobei man dabei auch sagen muss : „ Liquid Feedback “ ist kein Wahlcomputer .
Also da hat der CCC ein ellenlanges Papier dazu geschrieben , dass Wahlcomputer nicht funktionieren .
„ Liquid Feedback “ oder jedes andere „ Liquid Democracy Tool “ wird eben nie zu einer freien , geheimen Wahl benutzt werden können .
Also erstmal ist es ein Organisationsinstrument ...
Es ist ein Organisationsinstrument , aber was man sich natürlich irgendwie vorstellen könnte , dass es irgendwann mal eine „ Liquid Democracy “ - Instanz gibt .
Und dann entscheiden die Bürger eben so : Soll hier an der Ecke ein Einkaufzentrum gebaut werden oder ein Atomkraftwerk oder ein Flughafen oder soll die Wiese so bleiben wie sie ist ?
Jetzt kandidierst
Du selber am Wochenende beim Bundesparteitag für den Vorstand der Piraten .
Wenn du dort gewählt werden solltest , ist es auch ein inhaltliches Ziel von dir , „ Liquid Feedback “ für die Piraten noch zugänglicher zu machen ?
Auf jeden Fall .
Denn wenn die Piratenpartei tatsächlich eine andere Partei sein möchte , die dieses Spielfeld des Politikbetriebes , das von den anderen Parteien über Jahre quasi zementiert wurde , aufbrechen will , dann müssen wir natürlich auch mit anderen Konzepten ankommen .
Konzepte , die es glaubwürdig machen , dass wir eine andere Partei sind .

HOBOKEN , N.J. |
With a rooftop pool and 24 - hour concierge service , the new luxury condominiums off Frank Sinatra Drive here seem an unlikely spot in need of a multimillion - dollar federal giveaway .
Yet U.S. taxpayers doled out at least $ 8 million on a public walkway and park space in front of the Maxwell Place development here overlooking the New York City skyline - an amenity the development touts alongside its entertainment lounge , rooftop hot tub and theater screening room .
But the decision to use tax dollars to fund the walkway project was made after private developers had already agreed in 2003 to pay for it - indeed , it was a key condition for getting the project off the ground , according to public records and interviews .
Still , under the so - called earmarking process , by which Capitol Hill lawmakers slip requests for pet projects into larger spending bills , Sens. Frank R. Lautenberg and Robert Menendez , New Jersey Democrats , later pushed for millions of dollars in federal funding for the project .
In the swamp of federal earmark funding , $ 8 million is n’t a lot .
But critics say the project is emblematic of why the earmark process so enrages many taxpayers .
Mr. Lautenberg and Mr. Menendez combined have received approximately $ 100,000 in campaign donations from executives of past and current developers of the Hoboken project and their employees over the years , federal election records show .
What ’s more , the developers ’ lobbyist , whose firm reaped more than $ 200,000 in lobbying fees , was a longtime senior aide to Mr. Menendez , who was a member of the House when the lawmakers secured funding for the project in 2005 .
Neither Mr. Menendez nor Mr. Lautenberg said the donations influenced their decisions .
They also said they were unaware that the developer had already agreed to spend millions of its own dollars to complete the walkway .
The public walkway and park were dedicated by city officials last year , and developers , on top of the money from the federal government , separately paid out millions of dollars for the project .
But questions persist .
Watchdog groups , while noting there was nothing illegal about earmarking federal funds for the project , question the push for taxpayer money if developers already were obligated to foot the bill .
“ If it already was going to be done by the private sector , why would we swoop in and pick up the majority of the costs ? ” said Steve Ellis , vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense .
“ That same $ 8 million could have been used on other worthwhile projects . ”
But aides said the lawmakers sought the money because the city asked for it .
“ The agreement with the private entity was made by the city and the decision to press for a federal investment was made by the city , with the state ’s support , ” Menendez spokesman Afshin Mohamadi said .
“ It would seem to me that questions about how that process came about should be asked at the local level . ”
Mr. Lautenberg ’s office agreed : “ At the request of the City of Hoboken , Sen . Lautenberg and his colleagues requested funding for this walkway and improvements to the waterfront because of its great benefit to the community , allowing residents of the area to enjoy the river and a unique open space in an urban environment , ” said Lautenberg spokesman Caley Gray .
Melanie Sloan , executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , said congressional offices probably did n’t give as much scrutiny to a request made by a city as they would have if a private company had been asking for the money directly .
The development has changed hands over the years , but the earmark ultimately benefited a subsidiary of Toll Brothers , a publicly traded company that calls itself the nation ’s leading builder of luxury homes .
The push for public funding began before Toll Brothers owned the site .
“ Toll Brothers does n’t need the money , ” Ms. Sloan said .
“ I do n’t know why anyone would be covering that cost .
The question is : How did it happen and why ? ”
‘ Sole cost and expense ’
Hoboken ’s planning board approved the project in March 2003 , leaving no doubt in a resolution that the more than 800 - unit luxury development had to include access to the Hudson River with a public park and walkway , city records show .
Within weeks of the approval , Hoboken Mayor Dave Roberts wrote to Mr. Menendez asking for federal funding , but made no mention of any involvement by private developers , according to a copy of the letter obtained by The Washington Times .
“ This project will construct the final section of North Sinatra Drive and create a single scenic roadway / pedestrian promenade along the entire length of Hoboken ’s historic Hudson River waterfront area , ” Mr. Roberts wrote .
Mr. Roberts , reached by phone , initially agreed to discuss the project , noting that it recently won a “ smart growth ” award from a New Jersey advocacy group .
Asked about his role in securing federal funding , Mr. Roberts said he would have to research the issue and did not return repeated phone messages .
Within months of Mr. Roberts ’ letter , the mayor also signed an agreement with developers to eventually transfer the park and walkway portion of the project to the city .
Under terms of that agreement , the developer would - “ at its sole cost and expense ” - construct a public access walkway and build a waterfront park , records show .
Still , the agreement did nothing to keep the federal earmark from sailing through Congress as Hoboken officials pushed for funding .
In a standard appropriations request , later reviewed by Mr. Menendez ’s office , officials stated “ no ” to a question asking whether the project had already received any other sources of funding .
While Congress was poised to set aside money for the walkway , PT Maxwell , a developer of the Maxwell project , hired a lobbying firm in September 2004 that employed Michael Hutton , a longtime congressional aide and former chief of staff to Mr. Menendez .
Mr. Hutton and other lobbyists at Bockorny Petrizzo Inc. contacted the House and Senate on federal transportation funding , among other issues .
The firm was paid more than $ 300,000 in lobbying fees .
Mr. Hutton did not return phone and e-mail messages seeking comment , while an aide in Mr. Menendez ’s office said the former staffer ’s lobbying does n’t change the fact that the congressional office was n’t apprised of the developer ’s agreement to build the walkway .
When Mr. Hutton left Bockorny Petrizzo and started his own lobbying firm , PT Maxwell switched from Bockorny Petrizzo to Mr. Hutton ’s new firm , Hutton Strategies , which received more than $ 200,000 in lobbying fees from early 2007 until the relationship ended in June 2008 .
Political support
The name of the Maxwell Place development - where one - bedroom condos start at nearly $ 500,000 and town homes at $ 1.7 million - pays homage to the old coffee factory that occupied the property for a half - century .
As early as 1999 , city officials said , they would try to push for grant funding , according to one of the earlier developers of the Maxwell site , Daniel Gans .
He said it made sense to secure public funds for the walkway because projects up and down the Hudson riverfront also had received taxpayer funding .
Although there was no guarantee in writing that public funds would help pay for the walkway , he said , “ we went forward with the expectation that the city was going to do what it could do .
The whole idea was to create open space . ”
Mr. Gans defended the federal expenditures , saying the project set aside more open space than any other private developer in the city .
He said the federal money helped with urban revitalization and open - space preservation on the waterfront .
Both Mr. Gans and a partner in a development company involved in the Maxwell project , Hoboken Brownstone , have contributed more than $ 45,000 in political donations to Mr. Menendez ’s campaigns over the years , and $ 16,000 to Mr. Lautenberg , election records show .
Mr. Gans said the donations played no role in the lawmakers ’ help in securing the federal funding .
“ It was n’t as if Bob Menendez came in and said , ‘ What can I do for you guys ? ’
It was initiated by the city , ” he said .
“ This did n’t come about through our support of them . ”
Mr. Gans said he has supported both Mr. Lautenberg and Mr. Menendez for years , before and after their work securing funds for the Sinatra walkway project .
Both lawmakers also have received significant contributions from Toll Brothers employees and executives , records show .
They ’ve given Mr. Menendez ’s campaigns at least $ 23,700 in contributions and another $ 15,400 to Mr. Lautenberg .
Leslie Paige , a spokeswoman for Citizens Against Government Waste , said the flow of contributions from developers to the politicians involved gives the appearance of “ back - scratching . ”
“ It looks like another one of these examples of payoffs to friends and political allies using taxpayer money , ” she said .
Subsequent developers , along with aides to Mr. Menendez and Mr. Lautenberg , also said the donations played no role in the lawmakers ’ work to secure the earmarks .
“ We do not comment on specific political contributions made by individual directors or employees other than to say that such contributions were in compliance with federal election rules , ” Toll Brothers spokeswoman Christine Sciarrotta wrote in an e-mail to The Times .
Ms. Sciarrotta called the project a “ successful public - private partnership ” that resulted in a “ beautiful public park and walkway along the Hoboken waterfront . ”
“ We understand the city of Hoboken sought funding as early as 1999 , ” she said .
“ Funding for these types of projects often takes many years to secure . ”
“ This was a cooperative effort between PT Maxwell , the city of Hoboken and the New Jersey Department of Transportation , ” Ms. Sciarrotta wrote .
“ For their part , PT Maxwell donated five acres of waterfront property to the City of Hoboken , and expended significant sums beyond the federal grant in cleaning up and improving the public park / walkway . ”
While PT Maxwell is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Toll Brothers , according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings , it was described in a 2006 article in New York Construction , a trade publication , as a joint venture between Toll Brothers and New Jersey - based developer Pinnacle Downtown .
Spending millions
In early December 2007 , the Hoboken City Council met to approve what might have seemed like a formality : spending millions of dollars in federal funds for the Sinatra walkway .
At the meeting , Peter Cammarano , then a council member who had worked as an attorney on Mr. Menendez ’s 2006 Senate campaign , said the federal funds came about when “ Sen. Lautenberg and congressman Menendez put an earmark into a piece of federal legislation that was the [ Department of Transportation ] bill . …
The grant money was then available to the city to subsequently put in an application . ”
Cammarano , who later became mayor , resigned from office last year just weeks after he was sworn into office and after his arrest on corruption charges .
He has pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing .
By contrast , former Hoboken community development officer Fred Bado said in a phone interview that the city applied for the money first , then Congress came through with the funds .
He said the city sought federal money because project developers had agreed to transfer the land to the city .
“ Because it was going to be a public park , they asked if we would apply for public money to help with the development of that park , and the city agreed to attempt to do that , ” he said .
He also suggested work on one section of the project to rehabilitate a pier on the waterfront might not have been as extensive without the federal money .
Still , despite the absence of any city tax dollars involved , several council members voted against awarding the federally funded construction contracts .
One council member , quoted in a Jersey Journal newspaper article covering the meeting , said , “ We could have taken the stance , ‘ Hey , you were relieved of an obligation and you should try to ingratiate yourself to the community and making a contribution elsewhere . ”

After Sweat Lodge Deaths , Will Self - Help Pause to Reconsider ?
3 Arizona sweat lodge deaths resonate through world of self - empowerment .
Jun 29 , 2010  -- Kirby Brown , a 38 - year - old decorative painter from Los Cabos , Mexico , followed her self - help guru to a six - day retreat in Sedona , Ariz . , last year , hoping for the ultimate in enlightening challenges to help her realize her dreams .
Instead , Brown died along with two others on the last day of the event , when a ceremonial sweat - lodge ritual went horribly wrong .
The leader of the ceremony , James Arthur Ray , 52 , is currently awaiting trial on three counts of manslaughter .
He has pleaded not guilty .
Meanwhile Ray , a junior college dropout with a background in telemarketing , continues to peddle his beliefs -- for a price -- on his website .
Ray 's case raises questions about how someone with so little formal training could attract followers who would trust him -- to their deaths .
And , as Ray 's past comes into focus , larger questions are bubbling up about the self - help movement and where its future may lie .
" He needs to be stopped , " said Ginny Brown , Kirby 's mother .
" How many more people have to die before he is stopped ? "
Ray declined repeated requests by ABC News for an interview , but his attorneys maintain his innocence .
Ray never forced anyone to enter or stay in the sweat lodge , they argue , and he took extensive precautions to prevent problems .
His lawyers also say participants were warned in writing and in person about the dangers .
" This was a terrible , terrible accident , " said Luis Li , Ray 's lawyer .
" It was n't a crime , Mr. Ray looks forward to his day in court . "
' The Secret '
Ray 's was a fast rise .
It began when Oprah Winfrey raved about a 2006 self - help book , " The Secret . "
Then Ray was featured in a film based on the book -- and he was catapulted to superstardom .
What had heretofore been relegated to the new - age fringe quickly became mainstream .
Ray 's book " Harmonic Wealth " became a best - seller .
He was able to cash in on his popular seminars and buy a multimillion dollar home in Beverly Hills .
He also amassed a cadre of B - list celebrity friends , such as Marla Maples and Hulk Hogan , said Hope Miller , a former employee .
Ray 's approach " just seemed like a really practical way to pull a lot of things together for me , " said one of his followers , Kristina Bivins .
" It just resonated . "
What resonated for Bivins , like many others , was James ' interpretation of " The Secret , " which practitioners say is based on a rule they call the Law of Attraction .
James Ray : ' Wealth and Harmony '
Simply put , " The Secret " says that one 's wishes can be fulfilled by properly wishing for them .
Ray 's adherents believed that by following him , and observing the Law of Attraction , they would grow rich .
And Ray preached that message throughout his " Harmonic Wealth " and " Million Dollar Mindset " books , DVDs , and seminars .
" What I do now is teach people how to create wealth and harmony in every area of their life , '' Ray said in a 2007 interview with ABC .
" The Law of Attraction says ' like attracts like , ' " Ray told his followers , " you lock into something … and BANG !
You 've got a Mercedes .
And that 's how it works . "
Brandy Amstel , a filmmaker from Texas , incorporated Ray 's teachings into her daily life .
She used a " visioning board " to try to " attract " her life goals , like winning an Oscar .
" If those are the thoughts that you 're having , then you 're going to be attracting those things into your life , " Amstel said .
Another follower , Brian Essad , who works in event production , was attracted to Ray because he wanted to take his finances to a higher level .
" I want to attract the money to my life that I 'm entitled to and I deserve , " Essad said , speaking with ABC News , near his vision board .
Essad had to reach deep into his pockets to attend several Ray events , scraping together the nearly $ 10,000 fee for the Sedona retreat .
" That 's a huge chunk of my yearly income , '' Essad said .
But Essad credits
Ray with teaching him to be more responsible with his money , even if he admits that he now has less of it .
" I do n't actually have enough cash in my account to pay all these bills , '' he told ABC .
" So I 'm just kinda putting out there what I need to attract the money I need to pay all these . "
" Once they hook into you and they realize they have a live one , they just keep coming -- until they pump you dry , " said Steve Salerno , author of " Sham : How the Self - Help Movement Made America Helpless . "
Another guru featured prominently in " The Secret " is Joe Vitale , a self - described " metaphysician . "
Instead of running high - intensity seminars , he prefers to sell individual " Rolls Royce Phantom Mastermind " sessions .
For $ 7,500 , Vitale spends three hours with clients tasting the good - life in his Rolls .
He also markets his own margarita mix , " Fit - O - Rita , " and another drink called " Youth Juice , " and a sticker of a Russian doll , for wish fulfillment .
List price : $ 39 .
But on that horrible day in Sedona last October , three of Ray 's followers who thought they were joining him in the desert to enhance their lives and fortunes died after the sweat lodge .
Twenty others were treated at hospitals .
For most participants , the five days preceding the sweat lodge incident had been filled with limit - pushing exercises , including a 36 - hour solitary fast in the desert with no food or water .
James Ray : A Pied Piper ?
" You trust a man like James Ray to show you those limits , " said Salerno .
" You trust the fact that he 's not going to lead you over the cliff .
These people become pied pipers . "
The tragedy was n't just a physical and emotional trauma .
For Ray 's followers , it was a philosophical crisis as well .
After all , how could such a horrible thing happen to people practicing the Law of Attraction ?
On Monday , ABC's Dan Harris put the question to Ray himself , on Ray 's subscriber - only Internet radio show :
James Ray :
So who do we have on the line , I apologize I do n't have the name … but I know you are holding ?
Dan Harris : Hi James .
My name is Dan Harris , I am from ABC News .
And my question is , If the Law of Attraction really works -- and you know how to use it , why have so many bad things happened to you and your followers ?
James Ray :
Well , you know Dan , um , Mickey , I think we need to flush Dan right , right on down the stream , because , um , that 's -- that 's not something that we are going to talk to here .
And if you had been following along , you would recognize that part of going down the stream is getting in the rapids .
Ray : Holocaust Brought ' Opportunities '
Ray has a history of finding the unlikely bright side of tragedy -- even history 's greatest tragedies .
Back in 2007 , Ray tried to explain the Holocaust and 9/11 in an interview with ABC .
" I know many people , for instance , of the Jewish faith and heritage , who do n't necessarily believe that the Holocaust was bad , " Ray said .
" Now , that might , that might be shocking to you , but I 've had -- I have people on record who have said , ' Hey , there was a lot of good things that came out of that , a lot of lessons , a lot of opportunities for the world . '
" I 'm suggesting to you that there 's every bit as much good in 9/11 as there was bad . "
Ray has attracted critics .
" It sounds wonderful when you say , ' You can achieve anything you want in life , ' " said Salerno .
" It does n't sound so wonderful when you say , ' If you do n't achieve something in life it 's because the universe is mad at you . ' "
An Empire Unravels
Once charged in February by Arizona authorities , with three counts of manslaughter in the sweat lodge deaths , Ray spent weeks in jail until he was able to get his bail reduced .
Investigators said they found a suitcase full of prescription drugs , including steroids , in Ray 's hotel room after the sweat lodge .
Ray has said that he needed the steroids for a medical condition .
And while he stopped making public appearances soon after the Sedona retreat , Ray has continued to preach to his followers through regular blogging , videos on his website , DVDs and other products sold through the site .
He also peddles a $ 97 monthly subscription to an Internet radio broadcast .
James Ray : Beverly Hills Mansion on the Market
Still , Ray spends most of his time behind the gates of his Beverly Hills home , now for sale for a negotiable $ 3.99 million .
Melinda Martin and several other former Ray employees say they left his company in disgust over the handling of the Sedona tragedy .
" I feel like he did n't live his integrity because ... he 's so busy ... trying to keep the magic and trying to keep the spell going that I think that he 's lost the sense , the common sense of humanity and compassion , " Martin said .
Others are similarly disillusioned .
Brandy Amstel , hospitalized after the sweat lodge , filed a civil lawsuit against Ray , which was recently settled on confidential terms .
" I wo n't do another James Ray program , '' she said .
But she 's not ruling out following another guru .
And there are " tons " to pick from , she said .
" Other leaders that follow a code of ethics , that actually care about people . "
Shanna Bowens , who was at the Sedona retreat , still believes in the Law of Attraction , but she 's disavowed all self - proclaimed thought leaders : especially Ray .
" I can't trust him and I 'm not looking to him anymore for my personal journey , " she said .
Despite all the controversy surrounding their self - help guru , many of Ray 's followers are still listening .
Essad , who saw participants break their hands in a brick - bashing exercise at a Ray event in 2008 , and who was also at the sweat lodge event , said he would go to another Ray event .
When asked why , he said , " Because of what I 'm getting out of it .
What I 'm learning from it . "
Bivins , too , still believes in Ray .
" It 's horrible what happened in the sweat lodge that three people died , but my life is better and I am so grateful for that and I 'd do it again in a heartbeat ... "
Salerno is skeptical .
" You have a lot of people in this culture who are searching for something , they are in the belief that if this does n't do it the next thing will , '' he said .
" There 's this notion that if you believe enough if you stay with the program you will someday absolutely get to the Promised Land . "
Kirby Brown 's mother , Ginny Brown , hopes for regulation in the self - help industry .
" I believe Kirby … would want that , " she said .
" I need to be her voice …
And I think part of her voice is to say people need to be able to experience things and be able to be safe …. and not be afraid of losing their life . "
James
Ray 's trial for three counts of manslaughter is set to begin later this summer , on August 31 , 2009 .
Our very own Alex Bateman has been awarded the prestigious Benjamin Franklin award !
This is an annual award presented to someone in the community who has made significant contributions to promoting open access in the life sciences .
Nominations are made by at least two members of the community and then votes are collected by the good people at bioinformatics.org .
Alex faced some stiff competition from many greats in the field yet still managed to win .
He is the third Xfam associate who has won the award , joining Ewan Birney and Sean Eddy .
Naturally , all of the Xfam members are very happy with this result and are currently glowing in the reflected glory ( or is that the result of the celebratory bubbly or the unseasonal weather ) .

Provo , Utah –
If there is any place that should have medical spending under control , this is it .
Residents are among the healthiest in the country .
Many are Mormons who do n’t smoke or drink , and outdoorsy folks devoted to active lives .
The biggest hospital is run by Intermountain Healthcare , a medical system lauded by President Barack Obama for providing high quality care while restraining costs .
Until recently , Provo seemed to be a model for the nation .
But spending on Medicare patients here has accelerated rapidly , as it has in many other areas of the country also known for cost - efficient care .
The region ’s transformation calls into question initiatives – including some in the new health care law – to encourage more profligate regions to learn from their frugal counterparts .
A major reason : Medicare recipients are receiving certain kinds of surgeries more frequently and are admitted for longer periods to intensive care units during their final days .
“ It ’s very discouraging to see costs increasing rapidly in those low - cost areas we believe to have good care , ” says Paul Ginsburg , president of the Center for Studying Health System Change , a Washington - based research group .
“ They appear to be succumbing to the same forces that have led to high costs elsewhere . ”
Experts say Medicare spending trends often parallel those in the country ’s overall health system .
In 2007 , average Medicare spending per person in the greater Provo hospital market was $ 8,064 .
That was below the national average of $ 8,682 , but far higher than it had been a few years before .
Between 2000 and 2007 , Medicare spending in the Provo region rose on average 8.6 percent a year , nearly double the average national rate of 4.7 percent , according to data from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care , which analyzes geographic variations in health spending .
Spending Rises Elsewhere
Provo ’s spending increases are n’t an aberration .
Annual average spending grew at 7 percent or more in other traditionally low - cost areas , including Oxford , Miss . ; Wausau , Wis. , and Durham , N.C. Even in Rochester , Minn. , home of the highly regarded Mayo Clinic , and Salt Lake City , where Intermountain is headquartered , Medicare costs grew faster than the national average , according to Dartmouth .
On their own , these areas are n’t big enough to bankrupt Medicare .
Still , the spending increases are particularly worrisome in places such as Provo where many providers have already made changes experts hope can hold down costs .
These include adopting electronic medical records , focusing on prevention and increasing cooperation between doctors and hospitals .
But Harvard professor Michael Chernew noted in a recent article that “ even the most efficient delivery systems must wrestle with the adoption of expensive new technologies . ”
Indeed , Provo ’s regional hospital market , which stretches south of Salt Lake City down the Wasatch mountain range and includes more than 26,000 Medicare beneficiaries , has embraced some of the less admired traits of expensive health care markets , with dueling providers competing to offer the same kinds of high - tech services .
“ The first surgical center in Utah County was built by a physician from the hospital , ” says Rulon Barlow , a former county health board commissioner who runs the student health center at Brigham Young University in Provo .
“ So what did the hospital do ?
It built a surgery center .
It was n’t too much longer that another outfit came in across the street . ”
Much of this kind of rapid expansion is fueled by the Medicare ’s traditional fee - for - service payment system , which rewards doctors who offer more services , health care experts say .
Patients , for their part , seem only too happy to get the latest that medical technology has to offer , as close to home as possible .
Physicians in the Provo region performed 17.3 percent more procedures on Medicare patients in 2008 than they did in 2000 , outpacing the median national increase of 13.7 percent , according to a Government Accountability Office study .
The largest physician - owned practice in the state is the Provo - based Central Utah Clinic , which has grown fivefold over the decade and now houses more than 110 doctors , mostly specialists .
Last year , it earned gross revenues of $ 200 million , clinic administrator Scott Barlow says , and its doctors saw 208,000 patients .
That ’s a remarkable number given that only 556,000 people reside in the Provo - Orem metropolitan area .
Central Utah Clinic ’s sprawling campus , which sits across the street from Intermountain ’s Utah Valley Regional Medical Center , has opened its own open heart program , chemotherapy center and a high - dose radiation machine so powerful that it operates behind 70,000 pound steel doors in a room called “ the vault . ”
The clinic is home to some of the only providers in the area in a number of specialties , including cardiology .
The physicians have attempted to make it a one - stop shop for patients , even building a pharmacy on the lot .
The physician - owners benefit financially from the use of these machines and facilities ( except the pharmacy , which Utah law prohibits them from owning ) , but the clinic ’s officials insist they guard carefully against performing unneeded procedures .
Dr. Scott Bingham , a cardiologist at the Central Utah Clinic , says area cardiologists have been performing fewer of the most expensive tests and surgeries in the last few years , which Dartmouth has not yet analyzed .
“ The only thing that I see increasing in Provo is the number of patients we see , ” he says .
Competitors are skeptical .
“ The gastroenterologists owning their own CT scanners , the oncologists owning their own radiation machines , ” says Dr. Wendell Gibby , a radiologist who owns his own imaging clinic .
“ If you ’ve got a million dollar scanner , you end up using it , ” he says .
Intermountain also faces competition from HCA , the for - profit hospital chain .
In 1998 , HCA , welcomed into the area by commercial insurers feeling captive to paying whatever Intermountain charged , built Timpanogos Regional Hospital in Orem , the city just north of Provo .
HCA also owns a hospital in the south .
Timpanogos opened its own heart surgery program in 2007 , and last year added two stories on top of the existing two floors .
Dr. Mike Kennedy , a family doctor and the chief of staff at Timpanogos , speculates that the area ’s higher Medicare costs are due to better care .
“ You ’re probably seeing more aggressive treatment earlier on in disease stages , ” he says .
“ If we want excellent care , it ’s going to cost excellent money . ”
‘ Trying not to cave ’
To some , it ’s inevitable low cost areas such as Provo will catch up to their more expensive peers as a greater proportion of medical spending goes toward expensive machines and nursing salaries , which are rising , says Greg Poulson , senior vice president at Intermountain .
Aggressive marketing of the latest technology also is making it more likely that patients everywhere are demanding the same novel treatments , even ones that are n’t proven to work better , Poulson says .
“ We ’re seeing a homogenization of practice , ” Poulson says .
He says “ at Intermountain we ’re trying not to cave into things that we think are value diminishing .
An example that I find frustrating is the use of robotics for surgery . ”
Yet Intermountain has embraced the technology , too , announcing in 2008 that its surgeons in Salt Lake City “ performed the first robotic surgery using the most advanced robotic surgical system in the world that utilizes 3 - D technology and high definition ( HD ) vision that virtually extends the surgeon ’s eyes and hands deep into the surgical field . ”
Utah Valley Regional has been busy growing in many areas .
It ’s added four MRI machines ; expanded its intensive and critical care units ; upgraded its trauma center ; doubled the size of its emergency room ; and built an outpatient center .
Amid all this new construction , Medicare patients in the region have been getting more and more medical attention .
Dartmouth data covering 2000 through 2005 show some treatments were performed more frequently in Provo while decreasing nationally .
Those included operations to clear blocked leg arteries and replace heart valves .
Repairs of aortic aneurisms and hospitalizations for hypertension and asthma also rose faster than the national average .
While many procedures are still performed less frequently than elsewhere , a Dartmouth study released in April singled out Provo for having the highest shoulder replacement rate in the country .
Commercial insurers say prices in Provo and the rest of Utah still remain lower than the national average .
But some experts say that could change , too .
“ We take some comfort that we have less of problem in Utah than elsewhere , ” says Dr. Kim Bateman , vice president for medical affairs at HealthInsight , a Salt Lake City - based nonprofit that Medicare has authorized to find ways to improve the quality of care in Utah and Nevada .
“ But really I think we ’re just behind them on the same curve – that we ’re going to be subject to the same kinds of cost pressures as everyone else . ”
Two weeks on , the Alvin Greene fiasco in South Carolina remains a profound mystery .
How did the “ completely unknown ” Greene — a thirty - two - year - old “ unemployed Army veteran ” who “ is facing a felony obscenity charge , ” who “ showed no signs of having waged an actual campaign , ” who is living at home with his parents , and who had no visible means of coming up with the $ 10,440 filing fee he paid to get on the ballot — manage to win the Democratic nomination for senator in a 60 - 40 landslide over “ a heavily favored former legislator and judge , ” Vic Rawl ?
Various theories have been offered , including the notion that African - American voters had some sort of Pavlovian response to a name that sounds like that of the great Al Green .
( Not that “ Rawl ” does n’t have a sonic echo of its own . )
The state ’s most prominent black politician , Congressman James Clyburn , the House majority whip , smelled a hoax .
“ I know a Democratic pattern , I know a Republican pattern , ” he told CNN .
“ And I saw in the Democratic primary elephant dung all over the place . ”
We may never find out what was behind this odd episode , now that South Carolina Democrats have abandoned any effort to do something about it .
But so what ?
Was n’t the execrable Republican incumbent , Jim DeMint , totally unbeatable anyway ?
Has n’t everyone agreed all along that DeMint was going to win overwhelmingly in November , no matter whether his opponent was Alvin Greene , Vic Rawl , or Jesus Christ ?
Well , not everyone .
Not , for example , Jack Bass , professor of humanities and social sciences at the College of Charleston , biographer of Strom Thurmond , and co-author of “ The Transformation of Southern Politics . ”
Here ’s
Bass shortly before the primary , writing at The Hill :
Despite South Carolina ’s national image as among the reddest of the red states , Senator Jim DeMint is less than a shoo - in for reelection .
Three recent polls show his approval rating in the 48 - 52 range , barely ahead of President Obama in the state , with voters indicating significant concern about DeMint ’s seemingly greater interest in stimulating a national ultra-conservative movement than in South Carolina issues and interests .
Republican - leaning independents hold the key , and DeMint is facing an as - yet little known Democratic challenger , but one with strong credentials .
Bass goes on to construct a case that a Democratic challenger running a locally tailored campaign — a campaign aimed at older voters , women , African - Americans , and moderates — just might have an outside chance .
His conclusion :
Jim DeMint remains the man to beat , but Vic Rawl gives every indication of being a stealth contender in November .
A few days later , South Carolina Dems got the stealth without the contender .
Obviously , Bass did n’t foresee the weirdness that was about to descend .
Neither did anybody else .
But Bass tends to know what he ’s talking about when it comes to his native state ( which he talks about in a deep - fried drawl that is highly persuasive to susceptible Yankees like me ) .
And if Bass is right that taking DeMint ’s seat was merely a long shot , as opposed to an outright impossibility , then somebody at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and / or the White House political operation has some ’ splainin ’ to do .

Twitter 's first tweet might not have been prosaic , but it was historic The Library of Congress is to archive every single public tweet ever made .
Twitter says since they started in 2006 , billions of tweets have been created and 55 m are sent every day .
The digital archive will include tweets from President Barack Obama on the day he was elected as well as the first tweet from co-founder Jack Dorsey .
" I think it shows the tweets are an interesting part of the historical record , " said Alex MacGillivray , Twitter 's general counsel .
" This project however is not about us , it is about our users and the fact they use the service to chronicle these amazing events .
President Obama actually tweeted after he was elected .
That is a big deal and it 's something he did .
" It is not something we imagined when we were forming the service , " Mr MacGillivray told BBC News .
In a Library of Congress blogpost entitled " How Tweet It Is " , Matt Raymond underlined the reason why these tweets deserved a home alongside better known historic documents like the Declaration of Independence .
" I 'm no PhD , but it boggles my mind to think what we might be able to learn about ourselves and the world around us from this wealth of data . "
Twitter 's Mr MacGillivray agreed .
" We have just had one of our Supreme Court justices announce his retirement and knowing what people are saying around that will be important .
" As a historian you will be able to look back at that and understand what people felt .
The same with the healthcare legislation that recently passed .
You can look back and say what where people talking about and have those views changed over time ?
We think that will be really useful . "
The microblogging service came into prominence during a number of high profile events including the Iranian elections last year , the Mumbai bombing , the Haiti earthquake and the downing of a passenger aircraft in the Hudson River .
Replay Alongside the Library of Congress announcement , Google revealed how it is going to make the Twitter archive searchable for users .
The search giant unveiled a replay feature that lets users search tweets posted at any given point in time right down to the minute .
Twitter sees itself as a new form of real - time communication Anyone wanting to know what people tweeted about on say the Haiti earthquake or the Oscars can type into the search box , select " show options " on the result page and then click " updates " .
A timeline will appear above the results allowing you to zoom in on tweets by the hour or minute .
" This will be the first time the user will have the ability to go back in time and see the conversation about a particular topic , " Dylan Casey , Google 's product manager told BBC News .
" We think this is pretty significant because up until now the discussion has been about what is happening now and with today 's replay button people will be able to go back and see what people were actually talking about around big events . "
For the moment the replay feature will only cover the last two months of tweets .
Google said later in the summer it hopes to cover the entire archive all the way back to March 2006 .

He will get pissed and make you his bitch .
Honk at him again and spider monkeys will come flying out of his butt .
Oh .
Monkeys do n't really come flying out of his butt .
I just like saying that .
I thought I would write that to get some of you angry commentators out there pissed off .
Monkeys flying out of ones butt ?
How 's that really work ?
What 's that you say ?
You do n't like off kilter descriptions ?
I 'm in your heads now !
Bwwwaaahahahaha !
Obama ’s “ anger and frustration ” at the BP oil spill
15 May 2010
The US media informed the public Thursday night that President Barack Obama was going to express his “ anger and frustration ” over the oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico during a statement to reporters at noon Friday in the White House Rose Garden .
White House officials described him as “ beyond livid ” about the spill and BP ’s inability to stop it .
Right on schedule , in the second paragraph of his prepared comments on Friday , Obama explained that he had seen firsthand “ the anger and frustration ” of the population in the Gulf , “ And let me tell you , it is an anger and frustration that I share as President . ”
This has become Obama ’s standard operating procedure .
In late January 2010 , at a press briefing , Obama “ furiously slammed Wall Street titans who raked in billions in bonuses ” ( Associated Press ) .
His press secretary Robert Gibbs let it be known that “ the president shares the American people ’s outrage on this . ”
Of course , the bonuses were paid anyway , and a Wall Street analyst understandingly remarked , “ It ’s good politics for him to say that . ”
In March 2009 Obama came forward in public to express “ dismay and anger ” over the massive bonuses for executives at AIG , which had received $ 173 billion in US government bailouts in the previous six months .
“ I do n’t want to quell anger — I think people are right to be angry .
I am angry . ”
And so forth .
One cynical commentator noted Friday that a news item headlined “ Angry Obama Expected Tomorrow ” reminded him of “ a weather forecast . ”
Yes , only the weather is far less predictable .
The Obama White House represents the interests of American big business as directly , or more directly , as any administration in history .
It has helped Wall Street to vast sums from the public treasury , intervened to destroy the living standards of auto workers , escalated the brutal war in Afghanistan and continued the Bush government ’s wholesale assault on democratic rights .
The instinctive response of the president to social disasters affecting large numbers of people , befitting the class character of his administration and his own history and personality , is a decided lack of interest .
At an April 30 press briefing , for example , ten days after the oilrig explosion off the coast of Louisiana , by which time the monumental dimensions of the disaster were obvious to anyone paying attention , Obama issued a perfunctory statement .
He made not a single reference to the 11 workers who had died , nor to the potentially devastating ecological and economic impact of the giant oil spill .
On the contrary , he devoted the final portion of his brief comment April 30 to defending , by implication , his government ’s support for offshore drilling and making clear that he continued “ to believe that domestic oil production is an important part of our overall strategy for energy security . ”
As far as concern for human life and the environment went , the remarks could not even be called going through the motions .
However , as a river of oil continued to flow out of the sea bottom , threatening to become one of the worst environmental disasters in history , and as public outrage against BP swelled , it became necessary once again for the “ angry Obama ” to make an appearance .
Despite his weak attempt at populist bluster , Obama ’s statement on Friday was a dishonest exercise in damage control , on behalf of his administration — and BP .
He sowed confusion about the size of the leak , now estimated at up to 10 times what BP had claimed , claiming “ since no one can get down there in person , we know there is a level of uncertainty . ”
The president insisted that “ our mobilization and response efforts have always been geared toward the possibility of a catastrophic event , ” which is patently untrue .
Mobilization and response efforts , to the extent that they are not directly under BP ’s control , are principally geared toward protecting the profits and “ proprietary interests ” of the oil giant .
The federal agency supposed to regulate oil - drilling operations , the Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) , under Obama as under previous administrations , is nothing more than an adjunct of the energy companies .
The Center for Biological Diversity pointed out May 7 that the MMS had approved 27 new offshore projects , under the same environmental review exemption used to approve the “ disastrous BP drilling ” since the Deepwater Horizon explosion April 20 .
This exposes Obama ’s lie Friday that he is ending the “ cozy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agency that permits them to drill . ”
Everything about Obama ’s Rose Garden appearance had a false and ritualistic quality .
The population now knows what to expect when the president wants to be seen as upset by , and sharing their feelings about the latest outrage committed by America ’s corporate elite .
He puts on a somber face , lowers his voice , speaks deliberately , and pretends , briefly , to care about the public welfare .
Harsh reality has a way of making itself felt , and this act is wearing thin .
A small army of liberal and left - liberal apologists is on hand , however , to try and shore up illusions in the Democratic Party and Obama .
After each of the administration ’s reactionary policy decisions or abject capitulations to the extreme right , the Nation magazine , for example , tells its readers that a defining moment has now arrived , when the Obama administration must make up its mind , once and for all , whether it stands with the American people or the corporate elite .
Typically , in regard to the present crisis , the Nation ’s editors write : “ The BP disaster … represents not just an ecological nightmare but a moral crisis — and an opportunity for all who care about the environment to regain the offensive , to put all politicians , including President Obama , on the spot and to demand that we move in a fundamentally new direction . ”
As though the character of the Obama administration were an open question and susceptible to change under popular pressure .
Decades of privatization , deregulation , propaganda about the wonders of the free market , as well as the accumulated greed and recklessness of the ruling elite that has emerged out of the socioeconomic and ideological conditions of the whole past period , made the BP oil spill , or something similar , inevitable .
As far as the American financial aristocracy is concerned , the global population and the physical resources of the planet are nothing but the ingredients out of which its enormous wealth is made .
Obama and his entourage appear to think they have a magical power to allay popular discontent with the public relations equivalent of a wave of a wand .
All the president has to do , according to their conception , is assume the proper persona , offer a convincing rationalization , tell the suitable lie , and the American people will fall in line .
To the extent that the ruling elite mistakes the lack of organized opposition to its atrocities — due to the worthlessness of the trade unions and official liberalism — for a lack of popular opposition , it makes a serious miscalculation .
The population seethes with anger ; it ca n’t wait for something to happen .
A great deal of confusion , of course , exists as to what that should be .
It is the job of socialists to patiently explain the implications of the present social and economic crisis and spell out the alternative .
The working population faces one catastrophe after another — industrial , financial , military or ecological — until it puts an end to the anarchic , outdated , irrational profit system .

This is a re-post of an important post from David Humphrey who has been doing a lot of experiments on top of Mozilla ’s extensible platform and doing experiments with multi-touch , sound , video , WebGL and all sorts of other goodies .
It ’s worth going through all of the demos below .
You ’ll find some stuff that will amaze and inspire you .
David ’s work is important because it ’s showing where the web is going , and where Mozilla is helping to take it .
It ’s not enough that we ’re working on HTML5 , which we ’re about finished with , but we ’re trying to figure out what ’s next .
Mozilla ’s platform , Gecko , is a huge part of why we ’re able to experiment and learn as fast as we can .
And that ’s reflected with what ’s possible here .
It ’s a web you can see , touch and interact with in new ways .
David ’s post follows :
I ’m working with an ever growing group of web , audio , and Mozilla developers on a project to expose audio spectrum data to JavaScript from Firefox ’s audio and video elements .
Today we show what we did at www2010 .
I ’m in Raleigh , North Carolina , with Al MacDonald for the www2010 conference .
We ’re here to present our work on exposing audio data in the browser .
Over the past month Corban , Charles , and a bunch of other friends have been working with us to refine the API and get new types of demos ready .
We ended - up with 11 demos , some of which I ’ve shown here before .
Here are the others .
The first was done by Jacob Seidelin , and shows many cool 2D visualizations of audio using our API .
You can see the live version on his site , or check out this video :
The second and third demos where done by Charles Cliffe , and show 3D visualizations using WebGL and his CubicVR engine .
These also show off his JavaScript beat detection code .
Is JavaScript fast enough to do real - time analysis of audio and synchronized 3D graphics ?
Yes , yes it is .
The live versions are here and here , and here are some videos :
The fourth demo was done by Corban Brook and shows how audio data can be mixed live using script .
Here he mutes the main audio , plays it , passes the data through a low pass filter written in JavaScript , then dumps the modified frames into a second audio element to be played .
It ’s a technique we need to apply more widely , as it holds a lot of potential .
Here ’s the live version , and here ’s a video ( check out his updated JavaScript synthesizer , which we also presented ) :
The fifth and sixth demos were done by Al ( with the help of many ) .
When I was last in Boston , for the Processing .js meetup at Bocoup , we met with Doug Schepers from the W3C .
He loved our stuff , and was talking to us about ideas that would be cool to build .
He pulled out his iPhone and showed us Brian Eno ’s Bloom audio app .
“ It would be cool to do this in the browser . ”
Yeah , it is cool , and here it is , written in a few hundred lines of JavaScript and Processing.js ( video 1 , video 2 ) :
This demo also showcases the awesome work of Felipe Gomes , who has a patch to add multi - touch DOM events to Firefox .
The method we ’ve used here can be taken a lot further .
Imagine being able to connect multiple browsers together for collaborative music creation , layering other audio underneath , mixing fragments vs. just oscillators , etc .
We built this one in a week , and the web is capable of a lot more .
One of the main points of our talk was to emphasize that what we ’re talking about here is n’t just a concept , and it is n’t some far away future .
This is real code , running in a real browser , and it ’s all being done in HTML5 and JavaScript .
The web is fast enough to do real - time audio processing now , powerful enough and expressive enough to create music .
And the community of digital music and audio hackers , visualizers , etc. are hungry for it .
So hungry that they are seeking us out , downloading our hacked builds and creating gorgeous web audio applications .
We want to keep going , and we need help .
We need help from those within Mozilla , the W3C , and other browsers to get this stuff into shipping browsers .
We need the audio , digital music , accessibility , and web communities to come together in order to help us build js audio libraries and more sample applications .
Yesterday Joe Hewitt was talking on twitter about how web browser vendors need to experiment more with non-standard APIs .
I could n’t agree more , and here ’s a chance for people to put their money where their mouth is .
Let ’s make audio a scriptable part of the open web .
I ’m currently creating new builds of our updated patch for Firefox , and will post links to them here when I ’m done .
You can read more about the technical details of our work here , and get involved in the bug here .
You can talk more with me on irc in the processing .js channel ( I ’m humph on moznet ) , or talk to me on twitter ( @humphd ) or by email .
One way or another , get in touch so you can help us push this forward .

Is organic food everything its advocates claim to be ?
A new study published in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture describes an experiment in which the subjects were free from human biases .
The authors found that wild birds preferred ' normal ' bird food to the organic option .
To study this burning issue , the researchers set up pairs of identical bird feeders in over 30 locations around northern England .
The feeders contained two types of the same variety of wheat seeds , one organic and one conventional .
The researchers then monitored the rate at which each seed was eaten over the course of a few weeks .
It was found that the birds preferentially ate the conventional seeds .
To make sure that there was n't something about the relative placement of the feeders , the researchers switched each pair , and found that the birds learned the new location of the conventional seeds and continued to prefer eating from that feeder .
The experiment was repeated over a subsequent winter with a different type of seed , but produced the same results .
More controlled laboratory trials with canaries found similar preferences for conventional over organic .
In an attempt to explain this disparity , the researchers analyzed the seeds and found that the conventional seed contained upwards of 10 percent more protein per seed , most likely due to the use of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers used in conventional farming techniques .

Germany will change the licence fee for public TV and radio broadcasters into a flat - rate universal household payment .
This decision was made by the prime ministers of the federal states on June 9 in Berlin .
The payment obligation , which has been subject to the existence of a suitable reception device in a household , will thereby be turned into a fee which has to be paid independent of the existence , type and number of reception devices .
The new scheme will come into force on January 1 2013 , until then the current system will remain intact .
Through the change , ARD , ZDF and national public radio broadcaster Deutschlandradio will be put in line with cultural and educational institutions such as schools , universities and theatres for which every citizen has to pay a contribution - whether they use them or not .
In May , Paul Kirchhof , a former judge at the German Constitutional Court , presented the results of a study commissioned by public broadcasters ARD and ZDF in which he recommended this scheme as a practicable model which would be in accordance with the German constitution .
The exact figure of the new fee still has to be determined , but it is already clear that it wo n't exceed the current level of € 17.98 per month .
With the change , the prime ministers react to the technical convergence of reception devices .
Access to the public channels is no longer restricted to classic TV sets and radio receivers , instead programmes are also available through the internet on computers , mobile phones and other modern devices .
The prime ministers also want to make licence fee collection less complicated and close loopholes .
As every household will have to pay the fee , the new system also puts an end to the much criticised detective - style investigations by licence fee collection organisation GEZ to uncover non-payers .

It seems foolish to write off Greece after the miracle of 2004 , but both on paper and on the pitch , this seems a fairly weak side – albeit on that is well - organised and has a good understanding between players .
Otto Rehhagel is still in charge , and having played a variety of systems throughout qualification , appears to prefer a fairly defensive 4 - 3 - 3 shape that has generally been his favoured formation throughout his nine years in charge .
That ’s not to say that he will keep the same shape throughout – indeed , it would be more of a surprise if he did n’t vary his tactics and alter personnel .
As Euro 2004 showed , Rehhagel is a tactician in every sense of the word – changing his system at will to stifle his opponents , and to exploit their individual weaknesses .
There does appear to be a pattern to Rahhagel ’s switches in formation – he always likes to have a spare centre - back .
Go through the qualification matches for this tournament , and he switched between a few different shapes , most often a 3 - 4 - 3 and a 4 - 3 - 3 .
The three - man defence is used when the opposition play two forwards , the four - man defence is used when the opposition play three .
Their formation will therefore probably depend on how Greece ’s opponents are expected to line up .
Three up top
Rehhagel himself is intent on playing three forwards , in order to occupy the opposition full - backs .
His trident will probably be Theofanis Gekas , Georgios Samaras and Dimitris Salpigidis , with Angelos Charistaes , the hero of Euro 2004 , likely to be used as a plan B .
They form a slightly lopsided front three – Gekas , prolific in the qualifiers but against very weak teams , plays a central role based largely around movement .
The two either side of him are very different players – Samaras is a tall , physical but skilful player who drops deep to the left for Greece and receives the ball to feet .
On the right - hand side will be Salpigidis , a more traditional winger who takes his starting position outside the full - back .
Midfield
As in Euro 2004 , the midfield roles are slightly difficult to understand .
The wonderful , underrated Giorgos Karagounis has the clearest job – he is the creator .
Not particularly mobile and a slightly rash tackler , he tends to float around to the right - hand side of the midfield , finding space wherever he can – with his excellent range of passing , it ’s not really an issue if he does n’t pick up the ball in central positions .
Karagounis ’ two midfield colleagues , both essentially defensive midfielders , seem to base their game around mutual understanding rather than specific positional instructions , although Alexandros Tziolis is a more energetic player than Konstantinos Katsouranis , and therefore links up with the forwards slightly more .
Strong at the back
For a team so apparently negative and defensive , the 2004 side had remarkably attacking full - backs .
That is again the case , with Loukas Vyntra the more positive of the two , getting forward to combine with his Panathinaikos teammates Karagounis and Salpigidis on the right .
Another club teammate , Nikos Spiropoulos , is also capable of providing attacking width from left - back – these two push forward when Greece revert to 3 - 4 - 3 to become wing - backs .
Sotirios Kyrgiakos of Liverpool and Vaggelis Moras of Bologna are the first - choice centre - backs .
Of course , this all assumes it ’ll be the 4 - 3 - 3 – it might well be the 3 - 4 - 3 instead , in which case Tziolis would be the favourite to be dropped from the centre of midfield , with the brilliantly - named Sokratis Papastathopoulos likely to come in .
Watch for the shift in order to keep a spare man .
Conclusion
Relatively unimpressive in their poor qualification group , Greece will nevertheless be a tricky opponent because of the tactical nous of their manager and the flexibility of their players .
The biggest problem will be scoring goals .
Gekas was the top scorer in the entire UEFA qualification for this tournament , but nine of his ten goals came against Moldova , Latvia and Luxembourg , with another against Israel .
That said , he was the Bundesliga top goalscorer in 2006 / 07 , and will need to show that form here , because Samaras ’ record of 5 goals in 33 caps and Salpigidis ’ 3 in 33 are far from impressive .
Their best chance of scoring may well be , like in Euro 2004 , from set - pieces .
Moras is 6′5 , Kyrgiakos is 6′4 , and four other outfield players are over 6 ′ – add that to Karagounis ’ excellent set - piece delivery and there is a clear threat .
They wo n’t be as good as in 2004 , but then they ca n’t be as bad as in 2008 ; the best thing to be said for Greece is that they are in a fairly weak group , and therefore could make the knockout stages .

Marine scientists have discovered a massive new plume of what they believe to be oil deep beneath the Gulf of Mexico , stretching 22 miles ( 35 kilometers ) from the leaking wellhead northeast toward Mobile Bay , Alabama .
The discovery by researchers on the University of South Florida College of Marine Science ’s Weatherbird II vessel is the second significant undersea plume recorded since the Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20 .
ADVERTISEMENT
The thick plume was detected just beneath the surface down to about 3,300 feet ( 1,000 meters ) , and is more than 6 miles ( 9.6 kilometers ) wide , said David Hollander , associate professor of chemical oceanography at the school .
Hollander said the team detected the thickest amount of hydrocarbons , likely from the oil spewing from the blown out well , at about 1,300 feet ( nearly 400 meters ) in the same spot on two separate days this week .
The discovery was important , he said , because it confirmed that the substance found in the water was not naturally occurring and that the plume was at its highest concentration in deeper waters .
The researchers will use further testing to determine whether the hydrocarbons they found are the result of dispersants or the emulsification of oil as it traveled away from the well .
The first such plume detected by scientists stretched from the well southwest toward the open sea , but this new undersea oil cloud is headed miles inland into shallower waters where many fish and other species reproduce .
The researchers say they are worried these undersea plumes may be the result of the unprecedented use of chemical dispersants to break up the oil a mile undersea at the site of the leak .
ADVERTISEMENT
Hollander said the oil they detected has dissolved into the water , and is no longer visible , leading to fears from researchers that the toxicity from the oil and dispersants could pose a big danger to fish larvae and creatures that filter the waters for food .
“ There are two elements to it , ” Hollander said .
“ The plume reaching waters on the continental shelf could have a toxic effect on fish larvae , and we also may see a long term response as it cascades up the food web . ”
Dispersants contain surfactants , which are similar to dishwashing soap .
ADVERTISEMENT
A Louisiana State University researcher who has studied their effects on marine life said that by breaking oil into small particles , surfactants make it easier for fish and other animals to soak up the oil ’s toxic chemicals .
That can impair the animals ’ immune systems and cause reproductive problems .
“ The oil ’s not at the surface , so it does n’t look so bad , but you have a situation where it ’s more available to fish , ” said Kevin Kleinow , a professor in LSU ’s school of veterinary medicine .

Israel on Thursday said a flotilla of activist aid boats bound for Gaza was an " outright provocation , " saying however that the organizers of the aid convoy were invited to unload their cargo at the Israeli port of Ashdod , where it would be transferred to Gaza following an inspection .

The " Freedom Flotilla " consists of nine ships loaded with 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid and building materials , all headed toward Gaza in defiance of a three - year Israeli closure on the territory , home to 1.5 million Palestinians .
Defense Minister Ehud Barak spoke with the foreign ministers from several countries on Thursday , while the Director - General of the Foreign Ministry , Yossi Gal , individually summoned the representatives of the countries participating in the aid convoy .
The two made it clear that there is no shortage in humanitarian aid to Gaza , as food , fuel and supplies are regularly transferred into Gaza by international organizations .
The defense minister told the foreign ministers that " Hamas , which rules Gaza , is a terror organization supported by Iran .
It smuggles weapons and rockets with the sole purpose of harming Israelis , as it has done many times in the past . "
The minister explained that Hamas has been holding Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit captive for four years , in complete isolation and in prevention of Red Cross intervention .
" For these reasons Israel must oversee the waters in the area , " Barak said .
The Israel Defense Forces announced that troops , especially the navy , have completed the preparations for the flotilla , which will likely arrive in the region over the weekend .
The preparations included a compound at the Ashdod port consisting of air conditioned tents equipped with computerized stations , metal detectors , and seating for the activists manning the ships .
The IDF is preparing for the arrival of some 800 peace activists .
The IDF said that they were ready to carry out the government 's decision to prevent the ships from reaching the Gaza shore .
Sources within the defense establishment said Thursday that the activists will be given the option of signing documents allowing Israeli authorities to deport them from the country .
Israeli officials will escort them to buses that will take them to Ben - Gurion International Airport where they will be placed on planes to take them back to their countries of origin .
However , the defense establishment believes that the operation will not go smoothly and that most of the ships ' passengers will try to create provocations and confrontations .
In case of violence , the Israel Prisons Service will jail the activists in Be'er Sheva and initiate the deportation process from there .
The IDF said Thursday that much thought was put into the preparations for the convoy 's arrival .
The plans include trained navy forces boarding the ships , with the aid of dogs , to search for weapons and explosives as well as wanted terrorists .
The IDF said that they did not know whether the ships carried these items or people , but that they were preparing for any possible scenario to prevent potential catastrophes .

Image caption Blood tests were used to measure levels of AMH
Doctors are a step closer to accurately predicting the age at which a woman will hit the menopause .
A 12 - year Iranian study of 266 women found it was possible to pinpoint the age of menopause by measuring levels of a hormone called AMH .
If proven in further studies , it potentially means women could have more control over when to start a family .
It could be particularly useful for identifying women who may have an early menopause , experts said .
AMH controls the development of follicles in the ovaries from which eggs develop .
The idea of using the hormone to help predict fertility is not a new one .
Tests are already available to look at " ovarian reserve " , which indicates if menopause is imminent .
But this is the first time researchers have worked out a formula for linking AMH levels in younger women with future age of menopause .
The issue where we would have a concern is if people become too reassured by this Stuart Lavery , British Fertility Society
In the study 266 women aged between 20 and 49 were monitored through blood samples and physical examinations at three - yearly intervals over a 12 - year period .
The researchers , who presented the results at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology conference in Rome , then worked out a mathematical model for estimating the age at menopause from AMH levels in the blood .
For the 63 women who reached menopause during the study there was consistent agreement between their " predicted " age and actual age of menopause .
On average , the difference between the predicted and actual age of menopause was only a third of a year , with a maximum margin of error of three to four years .
However only three of the women under the age of 45 hit the menopause during the study , so experts said they would like to see the formula tested in a much larger group to prove its accuracy .
' Insurance policy '
The study leader , Dr Fahimeh Ramezani Tehrani , from the Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran , Iran , said the results could enable doctors to make a more realistic assessment of women 's reproductive status " many years before they reach menopause " .
UK doctors said using AMH as a guide to future fertility was proving potentially very useful but warned women against relying on such tests as an " insurance policy " encouraging them to put off having a family .
Stuart Lavery , a consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital in London and spokesman for the British Fertility Society , said that the quality of the partner 's sperm and other medical complications such as scarred tubes all contribute to overall fertility .
" The issue where we would have a concern is if people become too reassured by this . "
Dr Dagan Wells of the Nuffield Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Oxford , said : " Given that women are tending to start their families later and later , postponing having a child until careers are established or until ' Mr Right ' comes along , foreknowledge of the length of their fertile lifespan should help them to plan ahead . "
But he said that fertility declines in the years leading up to menopause , so more research is needed to work out if AMH levels can determine the point at which fertility actually drops .
Zimbabwe police have arrested two members of a gay organisation after they posted a letter in their office from former San Francisco Mayor Willie Lewis Brown criticising the Zimbabwean president ’s opposition to homosexuality , their lawyer said on Monday .
Ellen Chadehama , 34 , and Ingatius Mhambi , 38 , are employees of the Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe ( GALZ ) organisation .
They were arrested on allegations under Zimbabwe ’s censorship laws on Friday .
Attorney David Hofisi said the two will remain in jail until Wednesday — Tuesday is a public holiday in Zimbabwe — after police seized the letter from the organisation ’s suburban offices .
Police said the letter , mounted on an office wall , “ undermined the authority of the president , ” an offence under sweeping security laws carrying a penalty of a fine or brief imprisonment .
Police raided the offices of the gay and HIV / Aids awareness group on Friday , removing documents and files .
Hofisi said he was not allowed to visit the two staff members in jail over the weekend .
“ We asked the police to release them to us so we can come with them to court on Wednesday , but they have denied that , ” he said .
‘ Champion of gay rights ’
The United States mayor ’s letter also commended the local organisation as a champion of gay rights .
Brown did not respond to requests for comment left at his San Francisco office .
President Robert Mugabe has described same - sex partners as “ lower than dogs and pigs ” but arrests of homosexuals are rare in Zimbabwe .
Mugabe , 86 , had been in power for three decades since Zimbabwe gained independence from Britain .
Last year , he entered a power - sharing coalition government with his long - time rival Morgan Tsvangirai following a disputed 2008 election .
However , the fragile partnership has been fraught with disagreements , including allegations that Mugabe ’s party has not done enough to promote democratic reforms .
Human rights organisations have called for Mugabe to face trial at the International Criminal Court on charges of political violence , vote - rigging and human rights violations by state agents over the past decade .
Homosexuality is illegal in most African countries .
Last week in Malawi , a judge sentenced a couple to a maximum 14 years in prison with hard labour after the men celebrated their engagement with a party at a hotel .
In Uganda , lawmakers are considering a Bill under which homosexuals could be sentenced to life in prison and “ repeat offenders ” could be executed .
Even in South Africa , the only African country that recognises homosexual rights , there have been reports of gangs raping lesbians .

Environmentalistsâ€™ $ 100,000 Bail for Civil Disobedience
There is a bail reduction hearing this morning for two environmental activists who protested mountain - top removal coal mining and had their bail set at $ 100,000 .
EmmaKate Martin and Benjamin Bryant took part in non-violent civil disobedience to blockade Massey Energyâ€™s regional headquarters in Boone County , W.Va .
They were charged with four non-violent misdemeanor charges of trespassing , obstructing an officer , conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor , and littering .
As Climate Ground Zero notes , violent criminals have had their bail set much lower :
Magistrates in Boone County have set bails at $ 30,000 and $ 20,000 , both with 10 % cash bond options for individuals charged with malicious wounding ; the first for intentionally hitting a man with a van and the second for stabbing a man .
Magistrate Snodgrass set a $ 2,000 bail , with $ 200 bond option , for a woman charged with felony malicious wounding for stabbing her husband in the head .
Snodgrass also set a $ 40,000 bail , with $ 4,000 bond option , for a woman arrested while driving under the influence of illegal drugs and alcohol two days after she was arrested for stabbing her husband .
This type of disproportionate response to non-violent activism is n’t an isolated instance .
For example , when activists were arrested in their non-violent campaign against the I - 69 highway project , the government argued for a high bond by saying that one of the defendants , Hugh Farrell , “ advocated literature and materials which advocate anarchy . ”
And as we have seen time and again on this site , environmental activists are hit with significantly higher sentences than apolitical , violent offenders .
( See : “ Environmentalist Sentenced to 21 Years as a â€œTerroristâ€ ; Violent Racists Receive Half That . “ )
I ’ll keep you posted later today on the outcome of the hearing .

Hess on funding innovation
In Education Unbound , Frederick Hess , director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute and Education Next editor , argues for new education service - delivery organizations that , free from the constricting norms and rules of traditional providers , focus single - mindedly on executing their model .
The challenge for reformers is to recognize that enabling such providers is not just a matter of promoting “ school choice , ” but also of freeing up the sector to a wealth of different approaches and cultivating conditions in which problem solvers can succeed and grow .
Hess argues in the selection below that funding is the fuel required for innovators to thrive .
Greenfield is a term of art typically used by investors , engineers , or builders to refer to an area where there are unobstructed , wide - open opportunities to invent or build .

New ventures can neither launch nor grow without money .
In the absence of funding , greenfield efforts become soul - sucking endeavors for their founders , proceed much more slowly than necessary , or never get off the ground at all .
The famous KIPP academies almost died before seeing the light of day because founders Mike Feinberg and David Levin had trouble assembling the few thousand dollars they needed to get started .
Raising those funds required the two to write scores of letters and make countless appeals to Houston - area donors .
As Washington Post reporter Jay Mathews has wryly recounted in his colorful history of KIPP , Work Hard , Be Nice , “ Out of more than one hundred letters , only about a third responded .
Most said , in polite corporate language , that they had never heard of KIPP and did n’t like the sound of it .
None promised money . ”
Teach For America ’s Wendy Kopp also struggled to find funding when launching TFA .
She has described [ in Public Affairs ] being schooled by Princeton faculty in just how hard it would be to raise the requisite funds , remembering , “ What [ Professor Bressler ] really wanted to know , he said in his booming voice , was how in the world I planned to raise the $ 2.5 million … .
He did n’t seem convinced .
‘ Do you know how hard it is to raise twenty - five hundred dollars ? ’ he asked . ”
Kopp has described sitting down with Texas billionaire and former presidential candidate Ross Perot , trying to get that $ 2.5 million :
All I remember is Mr. Perot talking .
He talked a lot , and I had trouble following much of what he was saying .
I was mostly just thinking ‘ I need to stay here until I get $ 1 million from this man . ’
When Mr. Perot suggested that I contact Sam Walton and other philanthropists instead , I insisted that he himself was the best possible prospect .
Finally , after two hours of back and forth , Mr. Perot agreed to offer us a challenge grant of $ 500,000 .
We would have to match his money three to one .
I ’m not sure what ultimately led Mr. Perot to this idea .
He must have realized that I was n’t planning to go anywhere until he committed to something .
Kopp remembers that Perot ’s grant was “ the catalyst we needed , ” with other donors following his lead and supplying the remaining funds “ in relatively short order . ”
Only the most hard - headed or selfless of entrepreneurs muscle through .
Those with less stomach for frustration , as well as those interested in doing well in addition to doing good , will steer their energies elsewhere .
It ’s not just about dollars , though .
The impact of venture capital in entrepreneurial hotbeds like Silicon Valley is also a product of the personal networks , mentoring , and expertise that come with it .
These networks help new enterprises get a foot in the door , and mentors provide assistance with mundane , but crucial , tasks like organizational bookkeeping , strategic planning , and governance .
Equally crucial is the quality control implicit in venture funding .
Those who worry that greenfield efforts may not be publicly run , or who are hesitant to give funds to new ventures with unproven quality , often overlook the fact that competition for venture funding in the private sector comes with intensive screening .
In a community like Silicon Valley , as a general rule only 10 percent of business plans that venture capitalists receive warrant any response at all , and only 1 percent are ever funded .
To be sure , venture investment also has its share of blemishes .
During the late - 1990s dot - com bubble , for instance , investors frequently left their skepticism behind as they flocked to a slew of dubious ventures .
So , it is not that this process is flawless , but only that it tends to exert a healthy discipline overall .
A particular challenge for schooling is that venture capital is not geographically dispersed .
While schools operate in every corner of the country , venture capital is highly concentrated .
In 2006 , one - third of all venture capital investments were made in California ’s Silicon Valley .
That figure increases to about half of all investments if Los Angeles , Orange County , and San Diego are included , and to three - fourths of all U.S. venture investment if one adds the Route 128 corridor outside Boston , New York , and metropolitan Washington , DC .
In other words , about three - fourths of all investment is made in a few California locales and in the Boston–New York–Washington nexus .
Given this natural dynamic , we cannot expect 15,000 school districts to become hotbeds of educational entrepreneurship .
Instead , the expectation should be that the requisite funding , infrastructure , and networks will likely emerge in some limited number of locales .
Greenfielders need to invest in and build these hubs , and then take care to encourage and support the ventures that are able and willing to deliver their services more broadly .
The quality control and support that the investment process provides are driven by investors tending to their self - interest and happen naturally and invisibly in places like Silicon Valley .
They impose a certain flexible but hardnosed quality control even while creating an entire ecosystem and equipping promising new ventures to take root .
For too long , these quality assurances and development processes have been overlooked by both K–12 reformers who wonder why innovations fizzle and school choice enthusiasts who seemingly expect manicured flowers to spring from a barren , rubble - strewn plain .
The Three Phases of Investment
Though all education entrepreneurs need financing to get off the ground ( venture capital ) and to support expansion ( growth capital ) , the capital market for for - profit organizations is markedly different from the one that nonprofit organizations can access ( see Figure 2 ) .
While for - profit ventures can theoretically rely on their profits , nonprofits rely on a continuous funding stream ( sustaining capital ) even once they mature .
Startup Capital
Education entrepreneurs creating for - profit enterprises traditionally raise their initial capital from individuals ( “ angel investors ” ) or venture capital firms .
As explained in the sidebar , these investors put up cash in exchange for an ownership stake ( “ equity ” ) in the new organization , and they expect that their investment will eventually yield a profit .
In 2004 , just over $ 50 million was privately invested in businesses addressing the Pre - K – 12 sector .
With success stories like Amazon , Apple , and Google , one might think that early venture investors typically do quite well for themselves .
But the reality is much more complex .
In Fool ’s Gold , Scott Shane , a professor of entrepreneurial studies at Case Western Reserve University , argues that observers focus on fabulously successful entrepreneurs , but what they do not realize is that these success stories are incredibly rare .
Only a small number of entrepreneurs are really , really successful — and , by extension , only a small number of venture investors see large returns .
The media contribute to this misperception because it is easy to tell the story of Google and of early Google investors , but it is much less interesting and more difficult to write stories about failure .
Nonprofit education entrepreneurs generally raise their startup capital from venture philanthropy firms like NewSchools Venture Fund and the Charter School Growth Fund , or from individual donors and foundations .
Only a few foundations are comfortable with taking a risk on entrepreneurial education organizations .
Those that do make these early funds available — usually multimillion - dollar grants over the course of several years — tend to be younger foundations , like the Eli & Edythe Broad Foundation , the Milton Friedman Foundation , the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation , and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , that have embraced the modern school of venture philanthropy .
Before the relatively recent emergence of these new foundations , funders tended to provide these early grants in only small increments , forcing entrepreneurs to spend enormous amounts of time and energy on fundraising from multiple donors .
In addition , foundation officials found it far more palatable to support a host of small , capacity - building grants than to make concentrated bets on greenfield ventures .
Foundation officials rarely get in trouble for failing to have an impact , but can quickly get into hot water for supporting politically contentious measures .
For this reason , traditional funders have historically preferred to support professional development , curricular reforms , mentoring programs , and similar efforts that are broadly popular and appear to be risk - free .
What Is Venture Capital ?
Crucial money for greenfield ventures is startup fund­ing — the kind of investments that are often referred to in business magazines or popular culture as “ venture capital . ”
Venture capital plays a key role in launching and supporting the firms responsible for innovation and growth in the U.S. economy .
Companies backed by venture capital include many of today ’s titans , like Intel , Microsoft , Medtronic , Apple , Google , Genentech , Starbucks , Whole Foods , and eBay .
In 2007 and 2008 , the National Venture Capital Association reports that there were more than 2,400 venture capital deals worth more than $ 13 billion in the United States , with the bulk of activity concentrated in knowledge - driven industries like software , biotechnol­ogy , medical devices , and energy .
One would normally expect to see education comfortably ensconced on a list like that — yet it is nowhere in sight .
Since such funding is largely alien to most individuals involved in K –12 education , it is worth taking a moment to understand how venture capital typically works .
What exactly is a venture capital fund ?
It is typically an invest­ment fund initiated by a group of partners who contrib­ute their own money and then raise additional dollars from outside investors .
The partnership agreement spec­ifies both the lifespan of the fund ( typically 10 years ) and the management fee .
As Joe Keeney and Daniel Pianko have explained [ in Hess , The Future of Education Entre­preneurship ] , “ The typical management fee structure is ‘ two and twenty ’ — that is , 2 percent per year of the total capital raised , plus 20 percent of the profits after …100 percent of their invested capital [ has been recovered ] at the end of the fund ’s life . ”
Over those 10 years , venture firms raise funds , pursue promising investments , and eventually exit by selling their stakes .
Given the risks , venture capital investors seek to win big or cut their losses .
For this reason , they typically provide only enough funding for a venture to reach the next stage of development , so that it can attract sup­port from those with a smaller tolerance for risk .
This need to realize investment returns leads new ventures to focus on becoming successful enough to attract buyers , which involves a private transaction or “ going public ” and selling shares of stock .
And a venture capi­talist ’s aim — to win big on the front end and get out fast once the profit is made — leads venture firms to identify an exit strategy early on .
Growth Capital
For an education entrepreneur , finding startup capital is challenging , but fundraising for growth can be even tougher .
For - profit companies that have a good track record may find that venture capital firms such as Quad Ventures are willing to invest in growth for later - stage education organizations with promising early results .
Even venture capital firms that do n’t focus on education are willing to entertain the notion if they see a successful business emerging .
Nonprofits , on the other hand , have a much more difficult time attracting growth funds .
They struggle to raise the kind of large , multiyear investments needed to support expansion because even terrific nonprofit ventures cannot deliver a handsome return to investors .
In addition , there is a perverse incentive for growing nonprofit organizations :
The better the organization is doing , the more likely donors are to drop their support , believing they have done their part or are no longer needed .
As such , many foundations seem willing to support strong nonprofit organizations and help them expand on a limited scale , but few are willing to sustain an organization as it grows over time .
It is especially difficult to raise large amounts of funding from foundations because , according to federal regulations , program officers need only spend 5 percent of the foundation ’s total assets each year in the form of grants and other expenses .
Except in unusual cases , the other 95 percent of a foundation ’s assets are not used to fund grantees but instead are invested for the long term to preserve its endowment .
If foundations are to seek a bigger impact , they may need to tap these endowments more aggressively .
One possible strategy for augmenting the available funding relies on program - related investments , which are loans that come from endowment funds .
Several foundations , including the Walton Family Foundation and the Annie E. Casey Foundation , have made program - related investments to help charter school entrepreneurs secure facilities for their schools .
There is room for more such investment : According to the Foundation Center , foundations nationwide hold nearly $ 500 billion in their endowments , but use just over $ 200 million of that for charitable loans or program - related investments — less than one - twentieth of 1 percent .
Nonprofits and philanthropies that have taken on the explicit mission of helping other nonprofits grow include the Growth Philanthropy Network , the Draper Richards Foundation , the Robin Hood Foundation , and the Tipping Point Community .
The Draper Richards Foundation , for instance , was founded by famed venture capitalist Bill Draper and seeks to give nonprofits both management knowledge ( a Draper Richards board member sits on participating nonprofits ’ boards ) and capital in their infant stages ( $ 100,000 per year for three years ) .
Another foundation that is doing things differently is SeaChange Capital Partners , which makes multimillion - dollar infusions to help established nonprofits grow .
SeaChange was founded by Chuck Harris , a retired Goldman Sachs partner .
Harris had previously worked with nonprofit organizations and noted a serious problem .
He explains [ in Philanthropy News Daily ] :
I was involved with a couple of non-profit organizations that had fantastic management , good results , a fair amount of financial discipline , and were ambitious .
And if they had been for - profit businesses at a similar stage of development , they would have gone out and raised a multi-million - dollar , multi - year round of funding tied to their business plan .
Instead , they were sending out scattershot proposals for relatively small amounts of money over short periods of time .
In other words , there was no financial certainty … [ and ] the most senior people in the organization were spending a disproportionate amount of their time fundraising as opposed to driving the ship .
It seemed to me to be a very ad hoc , inefficient , and restrictive way to grow .
SeaChange adopts Wall Street methods to support proven nonprofits with ambitious growth plans .
Harris explains the key shift is “ seek[ing ] to fund the business plans of these nonprofits rather than [ to ] fund a piece of their program … .
We plan to conduct the financing much like a private placement in the business sector , with the goal of raising $ 5 million , $ 10 million , $ 15 million for organizations on the threshold of a growth phase . ”
Scrambling for Startup Capital Eric Adler is cofounder and managing director of the SEED Foundation , a grades 7 – 12 boarding school in Washington , DC , that has won awards from Harvard University ’s Kennedy School of Government and other entities for its astonishing success sending at - risk kids to college .
Adler relates how he and cofounder Rajiv Vinnakota struggled to find funding for the initial DC boarding school .
At first , Adler explains , “ We thought we were going to build a private school . ”
After a quick survey of boarding program costs and what it would require in terms of annual funding or raising an endowment , however , Adler and his partner concluded that “ it was not economically feasible .
We would have been talking about many hundreds of millions of dollars of endowment .
Or it would have meant raising money hand - to - mouth year after year . ”
Instead , Adler and Vinnakota began looking at nonprofit models in which the government might provide startup capital and then SEED would raise money annually to sustain the school .
“ You get the slug up front because everyone needs some activation energy and some capital to get going and then after that you raise the money year after year , ” Adler explains .
But , he adds , “ We…pretty quickly concluded that that was n’t going to work , either .
Because , again , it was going to involve a level of annual fundraising that just was n’t sustainable . ”
After dismissing those two stratagies , Adler wondered , “ Could [ we ] reverse it ?
Could [ we ] go to the private sector and get the upfront slug of money in exchange for getting the public sector to promise the operating costs indefi­nitely ? ”
This led the SEED Foundation to charter schooling .
Adler recalls Vinnakota and himself approaching DC and fed­eral officials and saying , “ In exchange for the private sector putting up a whole bunch of new facility money , would you be willing , then , to pay the difference between the regular day cost and the boarding cost ? ”
And they were talking simul­taneously to philanthropists and private - sector investors , saying , “ Yes , we need to raise a bunch of money from you now , and we ’ll still have to raise some in the first few years while we ’re getting up to scale .
But once we get up to scale , we promise we ’ll never come back to you saying we wo n’t survive unless [ you ’re willing to provide additional support ] . ”
This strategy allowed the SEED Foundation to raise the required $ 25 million for the 1999 –2003 launch of the school .
Sustaining Capital
Entrepreneurial K–12 ventures launch and grow with private capital or philanthropic support .
Once up and running , however , sustainable ventures seek to rely on earned income from fees or the sale of products or services .
However , despite increasing acceptance of income - generating for - profit and nonprofit organizations , few education entrepreneurs have built models that sustain themselves on these revenues alone .
And , as Dan Katzir and Wendy Hassett of the Eli & Edythe Broad Foundation have observed [ in Hess , With the Best of Intentions ] , “ Many foundations will not support a grantee for more than a specified number of years , regardless of where the organization is in terms of its growth cycle . ”
This means that nonprofits scramble to offset the loss of philanthropic support by finding ways to sell their services or by finding new funders , while for - profits seek to achieve a scale that makes them economically viable .
One of the few successful school builders to have addressed this challenge is National Heritage Academies , a for - profit charter operator that enrolls 35,000 students in 57 schools across 6 states and has managed to attain profitability while generating impressive academic outcomes .
Even academically successful ventures , however , have found it challenging to mimic NHA ’s financial success .
Although some nonprofit education entrepreneurs can support their organization ’s ongoing operations through public funding — such as by per-pupil dollars that flow to charter management organizations — most rely , at least in part , on fundraising from individuals and foundations .
The limits to this approach are legion , however , as scholars estimate that total philanthropy to K–12 probably amounts to less than $ 3 billion a year — or less than 1 percent of all K–12 spending [ as shown in Figure 1 ] .
To date , entrepreneurial ventures have been disproportionately funded by this tiny sliver of funding — and especially by funds from younger foundations with roots in the 21st - century economy .
Some leading “ new ” philanthropies , like the Gates , Walton , and Broad Foundations , have attempted to adapt the venture investment mind - set to the social sector .
Funders have begun to weigh criteria like scalability and financial sustainability more heavily , have taken seats on nonprofit boards , and have requested regular performance updates .
This marks a shift in thinking — though it ’s a development that has also encountered skepticism as to how willing these funders actually are to take bold chances and whether their efforts sometimes cross from smart oversight into micromanagement .
Whatever one makes of such concerns , it is clear that support from philanthropic funders has proven instrumental in launching or expanding heralded greenfield ventures like KIPP , New Leaders for NewSchools , Aspire Public Schools , College Summit , Green Dot , and Achievement First .
In education circles , the two best - known venture philanthropies may be the decade - old NewSchools Venture Fund and the much younger Charter School Growth Fund .
The San Francisco - based NewSchools Venture Fund secures investments from both for - profit and nonprofit sources and then seeks to provide startup capital to ventures — both nonprofit and for - profit organizations — that are sustainable and designed to achieve scale .
The Colorado - based Charter School Growth Fund , with over $ 150 million in support , provides grants and loans to promote the growth of high - quality charter management and support organizations .
These venture philanthropists accept that some investments will fail , so long as the failures are the product of efforts to address hard , important challenges .
As the Broad Foundation ’s Katzir and Hassett have explained , “ We do not regard our grantmaking as charity … [ but ] think of our work as making investments in areas in which we expect a healthy return . ”
A blizzard of inquiries into the handling of the swine flu pandemic , which began one year ago , have been launched amid allegations that governments around the world over - reacted to the threat .
The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) has been accused of crying wolf over its decision last June to declare the H1N1 virus a pandemic , the first for 40 years , which could turn out to be the weakest in history .
Up to 15 April there had been 474 deaths from swine flu in Britain , mostly in the age group 15 to 44 , compared with 2,000 to 4,000 from seasonal flu in an average year , which targets the elderly .
Seasonal flu was driven out last winter by the novel H1N1 pandemic virus , which may therefore end up having saved lives overall from flu in the 2009 - 10 season .
Early in the pandemic , the Department of Health said it was planning on the basis of a " worst case scenario " of up to 65,000 deaths .
That figure was revised down to 1,000 deaths in the autumn , as the virus turned out to be milder and to have spread further than had been thought .
About 5.5 million people have been vaccinated in Britain , but uptake has been low among frontline health workers and groups at risk , at just 30 per cent .
The Government , which ordered 100 million doses of vaccine , announced earlier this month that it had " over - bought " 30 million doses , worth £ 150 m , which were now being exchanged for other products .
The most advanced inquiry , being conducted by the Council of Europe , began in January .
Paul Flynn , the British Labour MP who is drafting its report , has called attention to the discrepancy between the scale of the warnings and the actual threat .
" The next time someone cries wolf over a pandemic , the overwhelming majority will not take it seriously .
A pandemic cannot be whatever the WHO declares it to be , " he said .
The WHO has launched its own inquiry and the European Commission is under pressure from MEPs to establish a separate investigation .
In Britain , the Government has announced an independent review chaired by Dame Deirdre Hine .
British experts defended the national and international response to swine flu at a briefing organised by the Science Media Centre in London yesterday .
Professor Robert Dingwall , former director of the Institute for Science and Society at the University of Nottingham , said it was better for governments to prepare for the worst and then scale measures back than be faced with having to do the reverse .
" Governments are damned if they act and damned if they do n't , " he said .
Professor Neil Ferguson , of the department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College , London , said assessments of the pandemic in the early months were broadly accurate .

WASHINGTON , June 23 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. House of Representatives agreed on Wednesday to give subpoena power to the commission created by President Barack Obama to investigate BP Plc's BP.LBP.N Gulf of Mexico oil spill .
By an overwhelming vote of 420 - 1 , the Democratic - led House passed a bill to grant the commission the power to compel witnesses to testify and produce evidence .
The measure now goes to the Democratic Senate for anticipated concurrence .
Obama issued an executive order last month to create the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Oil Drilling .
Obama lacks the power to grant such a commission subpoena power , but Congress may do so , effectively giving it the ability to compel witnesses to testify and produce documents .
“ No member of Congress should be against giving the commission looking at this spill every tool in the toolbox to ensure that BP and other companies can’t stonewall , ” said Democratic Representative Lois Capps , a chief sponsor of the measure .
Last week , Senate Democrats tried to pass such legislation but Republicans managed to block it , at least temporarily .
On Tuesday , however , Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski , the top Republican on the Senate Energy Committee , made it clear she supports giving the commission clout .
“ I do n’t have any problems with subpoena power , ” she told reporters , adding that she will include it in legislation she is crafting related to the BP spill .

Computers are getting better at understanding human languages , thanks partly to algorithms that can analyse sentences for positive or negative sentiments , says Ari Rappoport of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Israel .
But picking up on sarcasm is still a problem .
“ In many cases , sarcasm is difficult even for people to recognise ” , never mind computers , he says .
Rappoport and colleagues wrote a sentiment - analysing program .
They then trained this software to recognise sarcasm by feeding it sentences that had been flagged up by human reviewers as likely to contain sarcasm .
The team used the trained program to analyse a selection of product reviews on Amazon.com and a random selection of posts on Twitter .
Three human volunteers were asked to rate the same material for sarcastic content .
The algorithm agreed with the volunteers 77 per cent of the time for Amazon.com product reviews and 83 per cent of the time for the tweets .

Nice work , really
“ It is a very exciting paper , because it attacks a problem that I did n’t really think we were ready to make headway on , ” says Lillian Lee , a natural language processing expert at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , who was not involved with the study .
David Traum , a language researcher at the University of Southern California in Marina del Rey , says that getting people to agree about what constitutes sarcasm from single utterances with little context is difficult .
“ Really all we can say is that for these cases computers are about as good as people at agreeing with other people about what is sarcastic . ”
The research was presented at the International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media in Washington DC this week .
The tool could be used by marketers to track online public sentiment surrounding brands .
Believe it or not , Blink 182 , Jimi Hendrix , the Grateful Dead and other hugely successful artists are all technically one - hit wonders .
The strict definition of a one - hit wonder is an artist or band who only has one song make the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart .
It does n’t matter how well a person ’s albums do , how many songs dominate the smaller niche Billboard charts ( like top Country of Modern Rock songs ) or , at least for our Yankee - centric view , how many top 40 songs the artist has had in other countries .
( Did you know Right Said Fred had SEVEN Top 40 hits in the U.K.?
And I ’m Too Sexy was n’t even the most successful one , a song called “ Deeply Dippy ” was ?
Over there , I ’m Too Sexy peaked at # 2 … here , it was Right Said Fred ’s only hit and peaked at # 1 .
The point of all this :
We have to just restrict this to the U.S. , because I certainly do n’t have the anthropological skill to decipher what works for British ears . )
Armed with that knowledge , I went on a hunt to try to find some of the biggest , most successful artists that , technically , are one - hit wonders .
I found far more than 11 , but these were the stand outs .
( I excluded “ no - hit wonders ” … I ’m saving them for another list once I find a few more great ones . )
1 | Jimi Hendrix
One hit : All Along the Watchtower , # 20 in 1968
It ’s amazing that an artist as influential and revered as Jimi Hendrix only had one song make the top 40 .
Even if his stuff was too edgy for mainstream audiences at the time , clearly a LOT of people were on board .
( And all three of his studio albums sold in the top five .
He just was n’t getting the singles sales or airplay for his songs which add up to make the Billboard Hot 100 ranking . )
Purple Haze peaked at # 65 , Foxy Lady at # 67 , and neither The Wind Cries Mary nor Voodoo Child even made the top 100 .
I guess Wesley Snipes was right and Woody Harrison was wrong :
White people really could n’t hear Jimi .
2 | Grateful Dead
One hit : Touch of Grey , # 9 in 1987
Go figure — an eternally loyal army of hippies does n’t translate into huge financial returns .
3 | The White Stripes
One hit : Icky Thump , # 26 in 2007
I ’m glad the White Stripes broke when they did , back before the economy became an excuse to do 49 things formulaic - ly mainstream for every one “ art ” gamble .
In the climate today , it ’s more likely that they would ’ve been cast as the “ troubled couple ” on the Amazing Race than gotten a record deal .
4 | Garth Brooks
One hit : Lost in You , # 5 in 1999
Garth Brooks is the prime example on this list of someone who just murdered a niche Billboard chart — in his case , the country one — but never crossed over to the mainstream .
He was , after all , from the final era of country singers who were n’t trying to crack through to the mainstream as Swiftly as possible .
To add exponential insult to injury , Garth ’s only top 40 single was from that rock album he made under the pseudonym “ Chris Gaines . ”
No song actually attributed to Garth Brooks has ever made the top 40 .
Ouch .
5 | Weezer
One hit : Beverly Hills , # 10 in 2005
And yet , if I walked up to 90 percent of people I ’ve ever known and said , “ You take your car to work … ” they ’d respond , “ I ’ll take my board . ”
This one surprised me a lot .
Weezer songs that really SEEM like they got a lot of exposure … Buddy Holly , Say It Ain’t So , Hash Pipe , Island
In the Sun … never even made the top 100 .
6 | Blink 182
One hit : All the Small Things , # 6 in 2000
It ’s amazing with how ubiquitous Blink 182 became in the early 2000s that they never had another top 40 hit .
I feel like there was a point where they had a song in every single teen or college comedy movie that came out for like an eight - year span .
They probably came close to getting credit for scoring the American Pie franchise .
7 | Norah Jones
One hit : Do n’t Know Why , # 30 in 2002
We ’re rapidly coming up on the ten - year anniversary of when people were just crapping themselves left and right over Norah Jones .
I think at one point she won so many Grammys that she could ’ve traded them in for a Cash4 Gold record of $ 22 .
And that was when Do n’t Know Why was on the charts .
People have continued to buy her albums — her first three albums all made it to # 1 and her fourth , last year , peaked at # 3 — but none of her singles has broken through .
8 | Rush
One hit : New World Man , # 21 in 1982
Even with the way they slapped the bass on Tom Sawyer it never got higher than # 44 .
Meanwhile , Rush has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide — that ’s Bodyguard soundtrack and Backstreet Boys Millennium territory right there , ya’ll .
9 | Janis Joplin
One hit : Me and Bobby McGee , # 1 in 1971
She also had a top 40 hit years earlier when she was part of Big Brother and the Holding Company and they did Piece Of My Heart .
But as a solo artist , just Me and Bobby McGee .
But you know all this from the Jackie Jormp - Jomp movie ( or at least that songs like Piece Of My Lung or Me and Robby McPhee were her hits ) .
10 | Iggy Pop and / or the Stooges
One hit : Candy , # 28 in 1990
I kinda feel like it might ’ve been better for Iggy Pop to just go down in history without having any mainstream hits than for a song like Candy to make a token appearance .
I mean , I left her off this list because I do n’t think she qualifies as a “ music superstar , ” but Mandy Moore is also technically a one - hit wonder who had a big single called Candy .
I should n’t be able to draw that tidy of a comparison .
11 | Public Enemy
One hit : Give It Up , # 33 in 1994
Do I even need to tell you who gets the blame for holdin ’ them down ?
—
Honorable mention : Ben Folds Five , Beck , Liz Phair , Snow Patrol , Arlo Guthrie , Merle Haggard , Warren Zevon , I - ron Butterfly , The Gorillaz , Fountains of Wayne , The Youngbloods and Patrick Swayze .

I take a look at the controversy surrounding the Lieberman - Collins bill :
It does n’t sound like a “ kill switch . ”
The bill would require the President to submit a report describing , among other things , “ The actions necessary to preserve the reliable operation and mitigate the consequences of the potential disruption of covered critical infrastructure ” ( pg. 84 lines 1 - 4 ) .
That sounds like the opposite of a kill switch : this legislation describes a process by which the president is expected to take action to ensure access to “ critical infrastructure ” - including the Internet .
There ’s plenty of room to debate the merits of the federal government dictating the security policies of private companies , the ability of the president to continually extend any provisions beyond 30 days , the value of establishing new cyber security departments within the government , and the vagueness of the language in the bill .
But this is nothing nearly so radical as some are making it out to be .
In fact , as Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs ’ web site for the bill points out , the President already has a legislative ( but of course , not technological ) “ kill switch . ”
The Communications
Act of 1934 gave the president power to shut down “ wire communications . ”
Android 2.2 is out , and it 's pretty nice !
But what 's next for Android ?
A better keyboard ?
More sexy ?
And how exactly does Google decide what goes into each version of Android anyway ?
Let 's ask Lead Android Andy Rubin .
Advertisement
The highlights , if you do n't want to read the interview below ( which is fairly interesting if you 're into Android , if I do say so myself ) :
• It 's actually " pretty random " what goes into every version of Android , and they do n't plan more than one release out
• There 's not much they can do about phones with custom UIs lagging behind on new versions of Android
• They know the keyboard could use some work
• HTC may very well be on their own with Apple 's patent lawsuit
• The next 6 months will " blow your mind "
Advertisement
Gizmodo :
So my personal thing , the one question I want to ask personally , is when is the keyboard going to get better ?
Andy : I mean , it does need a little bit of improvement .
I think we did a pretty good job given that it 's pretty generic for all different screen sizes — you have small screens , big screens , you have landscape , you have portrait .
But what I think you start needing is more specific for the device .
It 's a framework — pretty generic — and we need to do a little better job .
The voice team , I think , did a good job of basically making the keyboard kind of optional in some areas .
I speak to my phone when I 'm sending SMSes .
I speak to it , and correct it a little bit with the keyboard .
My primary use case is voice , but I think you 're right , we do need to be kind of reviving it a little bit .

A lot of that , it 's not necessarily the software — a lot of the time it 's the type of touch screen the OEM uses .
You 've seen all those tests where they have like the Droid touchscreen , the Nexus touchscreen — they 're all a little different and it's hard to make one keyboard work across all those different flavors of touch screens .
Gizmodo :
We 're up to Froyo 2.2 now , but we have devices with custom interfaces , which often lag behind latest version of Android .
People with , say , a Droid Eris or a Hero waited around 6 months or longer just to get to 2.1 , and now 2.2 is coming .
So how do you address that sort of issue and where does Google stand on that type of thing ?
Advertisement
Andy : I mean , if I was like a dictator I would enforce this stuff and everyone would have to have the same version at the same time and there would be a big switch with great fanfare , but it 's just not in the cards .
So we 'll do a great version , and if they decide to adopt it , they 'll adopt it .
The difference between those two models :
The first model , it 's really hard for people to differentiate , everybody gets the same thing .
So you are kind of commoditizing a whole slew of companies in the process and that 's painful because people will literally go out of business potentially .
In our model , it allows differentiation .
At the platform layer , it is still compatible , so the apps in the marketplace will still run in the platform .
But yeah , they have to modulate how quickly they can put their differentiating features on top of the base platform , and that 's a race .
Gizmodo :
But if you 're not running 2.1 , for instance , you can't get the official Twitter app .
Advertisement
Andy : I mean there are apps written for Vista , just like Photoshop CS5 does not run on Windows 3.1 .
I mean it 's just a fact , there 's nothing new here .
This is how it has always been and that 's why I made the distinction of legacy .
We have legacy and if somebody wants to use a feature that 's in the new OS , they really can't run that app on an older OS .
So it 's just things are happening so quickly that it becomes really obvious that we went from 2.0 to 2.2 in a very short time frame .
I think that will slow down a little bit .
I 'm actually advocating coming out with releases around the buying seasons , May and September , October .
Gizmodo :
So how does the update process go ?
How do you decide what goes into each release ?
Advertisement
Andy :
It 's pretty random .
We roadmap one release out , so we do n't plan out the year , or two years or five years like a lot of other people do .
It 's more run like an internet company would run it , so there 's a lot of iteration and what we are finding is innovation comes from all over the place .
Like the Simplify Media guys , that was a company we acquired and now their stuff is in the Froyo release .
Gizmodo : HTC been in a sort of interesting position in terms of patents — they 're licensing technology from Microsoft .
That kind of actually makes Android not free for them to use .
Are you worried about that in the future ?
Advertisement
Andy :
If I do an implementation of an MP3 codec , down the line , the guy selling the device — the guy that 's making the money — he's going to have to pay a royalty to the MPEG association , the guys who own that intellectual property around that .
If I implement the ActiveSync protocol and talked to Exchange servers , somebody 's going to have to pay Microsoft for the royalty .
And that happens in phones today — there 's no difference between Android or something else .
Gizmodo :
What is it you want to fix or add to an Android next ?
Like what 's on your list of " Things I Wished I Could Have Done " ?
Advertisement
Andy :
Well , even to me , when we released the first version , it did n't feel like a 1.0 , it kind of felt like a 0.8 .
If you look at where we were 18 months ago and where we are today , that just makes the future brighter .
Because the rate at which we went from that kind of 0.8 to 2.2 was so fast that we 're just earning how to master that type of engineering — that type of iterative engineering — and all of the innovation , I mean it 's game on .
There is going to be stuff that 's just going to blow your mind .
In 6 months .
Before it was 18 months , now it 's 6 months .
Gizmodo :
So where do you want to see Android in a year or two , in terms of bigger goals ?
Advertisement
Andy : For Android it 's a numbers game .
It 's an end product with end OEMs and product categories today , but what we demonstrated at IO was pretty unique .
We demonstrated big screen and small screen ; we demonstrated ARM processor and Intel processor , and we demonstrated stuff from different OEMs : HTC , and Sony on the TV side .
So look , we 're cross product category , cross manufacturer , cross CPU architecture , agnostic , and we have all the services pointed to the platform , and the platform is just going to go pretty broad across those product categories .
It 's never been done before .
If you look at it as a graph , we 're right in the middle of a hockey stick right now .
You do n't realize that you 're right in the middle of it until after the fact and you 're looking at it — oh that 's where it was , but we 're right in the middle of it right now .
So I think it 's just going to be exponential in the amount of adoption .

Thanks to Google VP of Engineering , and head of Android Andy Rubin for talking to us !
Terry Branstad made it official this morning , picking State Senator Kim Reynolds to be the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor .
Reynolds is a former Clarke County treasurer and past president of the Iowa county treasurer ’s association who was elected in 2008 to represent Senate district 48 in southern Iowa .
The Des Moines Register ’s Tom Beaumont published more background on Reynolds here .
His piece depicts her as “ solid on core GOP issues ” and “ focused on economic development . ”
Looks like Branstad has picked precisely the kind of candidate his former chief of staff Doug Gross would want on the Republican ticket .
Gross was one of the powers behind the throne during Branstad ’s four terms as governor and was the Republican nominee against Governor Tom Vilsack in 2002 .
Last spring and summer , Gross was among a group of business - oriented Republicans shopping around for an alternative to the leading GOP candidates for governor .
A poll the Iowa First Foundation ( headed by Gross ) commissioned at that time became the opening salvo in the project to draft Branstad back into politics .
Gross cited the poll in asserting that GOP front - runner Bob Vander Plaats was unelectable because social issues like same - sex marriage were too “ central ” in his campaign .
Gross laid out what he saw as the winning strategy for Republicans in an interview with the Sioux City Journal ’s Bret Hayworth last October :
First of all , the issue environment should be such that it will be a great Republican year .
It is the midterm for [ a ]
Democrat incumbent president , the voters are really focused on economic issues that are important for Republicans – jobs , economic development , the fiscal issues , taxes and government spending – those are all issues that are all right in the Republicans ’ wheelhouse .
The key is having candidates who can appeal to the public on those kinds of issues .
And my concern – I ’ve been pretty outspoken about this – is that it is fine for us to be socially conservative – I happen to be ( socially conservative ) myself , in terms of those issues – but those are not the issues we should lead with .
We should lead on the economic issues , because those are the ones we can win with .
From that perspective , Reynolds is a perfect choice .
Her political career has focused on fiscal and economic issues as a county treasurer and member of the IPERS board .
I see no sign of moderation in her voting record ; she has stuck to the party line in the Iowa Senate .
Scanning the list of bills she has sponsored , I see one anti-abortion bill but otherwise nothing that screams “ religious right . ”
Google searches of her name with keywords like “ abortion ” or “ gay marriage ” do n’t bring up much .
So , Reynolds fits the Gross model of being socially conservative but not talking about it in public .
Unlike some statehouse Republicans , Reynolds has n’t made news fighting marriage equality .
She steered clear of Bob Vander Plaats ’ plan to overturn gay marriage by executive order , and she has n’t taken the Rod Roberts position of demanding that legislators vote on a marriage amendment before the governor signs any state budget .
Craig Robinson observed at The Iowa Republican blog ,
She carries herself in a very professional and impressive manner , which will likely excite potential supporters .
However , while she does n’t have a record that appears hostile to socially conservative issues , she will likely do very little to appeal to values voters who supported Rod Roberts and Bob Vander Plaats in this post - primary season .
Reynolds was in the State Senate when the Varnum v. Brien Iowa Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage came down and failed to take any sort of leadership role in opposing the Court ’s ruling .
She has also been the target of criticism for her failure to protect the rights of private property owners as related to an eminent domain action in her own Senate District in which developers sought to obtain lands that would not only become a water reservoir , but also a recreational waterfront area .
The Vander Plaats supporter with the largest megaphone , WHO radio personality Steve Deace , brought up the eminent domain controversy as soon as Reynolds emerged as a likely running mate for Branstad .
Would n’t you know , Doug Gross was right in the middle of that dispute over seizing private land for recreational lakes , according to this 2006 piece from the Des Moines weekly Cityview .
I tend to agree with Robinson that putting Reynolds on the ticket leaves no clear successor to Branstad if he wins in November .
A better - known lieutenant governor like Jeff Lamberti would have immediately become the front - runner in the next GOP gubernatorial campaign .
Over at the Radio Iowa blog , Kay Henderson surveyed Iowa ’s political tradition of women candidates for lieutenant governor , which goes back to the mid-1980s .
Final note on Reynolds : Beaumont ’s piece for the Register discusses her drunk driving arrests in 1999 and 2000 .
I doubt those will become a significant campaign issue .
Reynolds has indicated that she ’s been sober since 2000 .
UPDATE : One more thing worth noting : Branstad promised repeatedly that people who signed up to receive text messages from his campaign would be the “ first to know ” about his running mate ( e.g. here , here , here and here ) .
The reality was that Branstad “ began calling key donors about the decision late Wednesday . ”
In other words , people who could afford to write five - figure checks got the word a day before the suckers who joined the “ lieuTEXTant governor ” drive .
SECOND UPDATE : Jonathan Martin of The Politico reports that the Branstad campaign sent an e-mail blast and robocalls out this morning to delegates to the GOP ’s state convention this Saturday .
Social networking companies do n't have it easy .
Advertisers covet their users ' data , and in a niche that often seems to lack a clear business model , selling ( or otherwise leveraging ) that data is a tremendously tempting opportunity .
But most users simply do n't want to share as much information with marketers or other " partners " as corporations would like them to .
So it 's no surprise that some companies try to have it both ways .
Monday evening , after an exasperating few days trying to make sense of Facebook 's bizzare new " opt- out " procedures , we asked folks on Twitter and Facebook a question :
The world needs a simple word or term that means " the act of creating deliberately confusing jargon and user - interfaces which trick your users into sharing more info about themselves than they really want to . "
Suggestions ?
And the suggestions rolled in !
Our favorites include " bait - and - click " , " bait - and - phish " , " dot - comfidence games " , and " confuser - interface - design " .
Although we did n't specifically mention Facebook in our question , by far the most popular suggestions were variations on this one from @heisenthought on Twitter :
How about " zuck " ?
As in : " That user - interface totally zuckered me into sharing 50 wedding photos .
That kinda zucks "
Other suggestions included " Zuckermining " , " Infozuckering " , " Zuckerpunch " and plenty of other variations on the name of Facebook 's Founder and CEO , Mark Zuckerberg .
Others suggested words like " Facebooking " , " Facebaiting " , and " Facebunk " .
It 's clear why folks would associate this kind of deceptive practice with Zuckerberg .
Although Zuckerberg told users back in 2007 that privacy controls are " the vector around which Facebook operates , " by January 2010 he had changed his tune , saying that he would n't include privacy controls if he were to restart Facebook from scratch .
And just a few days ago , a New York Times reporter quoted a Facebook employee as saying Zuckerberg " does n't believe in privacy " .
Despite this , we 'd rather not use Zuckerberg 's name as a synonym for deceptive practices .
Although the popularity of the suggestion shows how personal the need for privacy has become for many Facebook users , we 'd prefer to find a term that 's less personal and more self - explanatory .
No , our favorite idea came from Twitter user @volt4ire , who suggested we use the phrase " Evil Interfaces " .
The name refers to a talk by West Point Professor Greg Conti at the 2008 Hackers On Planet Earth conference .
Here 's Conti explaining Evil Interfaces to a puppet named Weena :
%3Cobject%20 width%3D%22640%22%20height%3D%22385%22%20allow%3D%22autoplay%22%3E%3Cparam%20name%3D%22movie%22%20value%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fv%2FAnV7nSNksho%26amp%3Bhl%3Den_US%26amp%3Bfs%3D1%26amp%3Brel%3D0%3Fautoplay%3D1%26mute%3D1%22%20%2F%3E%3Cparam%20name%3D%22allowFullScreen%22%20value%3D%22true%22%20%2F%3E%3Cparam%20name%3D%22allowscriptaccess%22%20value%3D%22always%22%20%2F%3E%3Cembed%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fv%2FAnV7nSNksho%26amp%3Bhl%3Den_US%26amp%3Bfs%3D1%26amp%3Brel%3D0%3Fautoplay%3D1%26mute%3D1%22%20type%3D%22application%2Fx-shockwave-flash%22%20allowscriptaccess%3D%22always%22%20allowfullscreen%3D%22true%22%20width%3D%22640%22%20height%3D%22385%22%20allow%3D%22autoplay%22%3E%3C%2Fembed%3E%3C%2Fobject%3E

As Conti describes it , a good interface is meant to help users achieve their goals as easily as possible .
But an " evil " interface is meant to trick users into doing things they do n't want to .
Conti's examples include aggressive pop-up ads , malware that masquerades as anti-virus software , and pre-checked checkboxes for unwanted " special offers " .
The new Facebook is full of similarly deceptive interfaces .
A classic is the " Show Friend List to everyone " checkbox .
You may remember that when Facebook announced it would begin treating friend - lists as " publicly available information " last December , the change was met with user protests and government investigation .
The objections were so strong that Facebook felt the need to take action in response .
Just one problem : Facebook did n't actually want to give up any of the rights it had granted itself .
The result was the obscure and impotent checkbox pictured here .
It 's designed to be hard to find — it 's located in an unlikely area of the User Profile page , instead of in the Privacy Settings page .
And it 's worded to be as weak as possible — notice that the language lets a user set their friend - list 's " visibility " , but not whether Facebook has the right to use that information elsewhere .
A more recent example is the process introduced last week for opting out of Instant Personalization .
This new feature allows select Facebook partner websites to collect and log all of your " publicly available " Facebook information any time you visit their websites .
We 've already documented the labyrinthine process Facebook requires users to take to protect their data , so I wo n't repeat it here .
Suffice to say that sharing your data requires radically less work than protecting it .
Of course , Facebook is far from the only social networking company to use this kind of trick .
Memorably , users of GMail were surprised last February by the introduction of Google Buzz , which threatened to move private GMail recipients into a public " frequent contacts " list .
As we noted at the time , Buzz 's needlessly complex " opt- out " user - interface was a big part of the problem .
OK , perhaps the word " evil " is a little strong .
There 's no doubt that bad user - interfaces can come from good intentions .
Design is difficult , and accidents do happen .
But when an accident coincidentally bolsters a company 's business model at the expense of its users ' rights , it begins to look suspicious .
And when similar accidents happen over and over again in the same company , around the same issues , it 's more than just coincidence .
It 's a sign something 's seriously wrong .
My cooking instincts are rather natural ( e.g. , sourcing ingredients from the local market , eating sustainable seafood , buying free - range - all - natural poultry , and I certainly love a steroid free steak ) but THIS is a whole other level of “ natural ” – Mommy ’s Milk , from a human mommy , not a cow , sheep or goat ...
( a visual taste of my cheese making experience ... maple caramelized pumpkin encrusted cheese with texurized concord grapes )
Offspring
I came about mother ’s milk when our daughter celebrated her 4th week birthday -- my spouse is feeding our baby with breast milk .
We are fortunate to have plenty of pumped mommy ’s milk on hand and we even freeze a good amount of it – my spouse actually thinks of donating some to an infant milk bank which could help little babies in Haiti and such but for the meantime ( the milk bank requires check - ups which takes a little while ) our small freezer ran out of space .
To throw it out would be like wasting gold .
( packed frezzer with mommy 's milk in specialized bags )
Conservation Minded
Cheese is produced throughout the world in different flavors , textures , and forms from various animals ’ milk such as goat , cow , sheep and even horse .
Cheese is valued for its portability .
Depending on the cheese it has a longer shelf life compared with fresh milk since cheese is aged .
Different flavors depend on the origin of the milk and diet of the milk host .
Cheese is made with relatively high heat ( bacteria safe ) or non pasteurized milk , which alters its flavor .
Sometimes cheeses are smoked , layered with ashes and leaves such as herbs and rubbed with alcohol such as wine or beer or salt which prohibits bacteria growth .
Cheese imbedded with spices such as cumin or fragrant mushrooms such as truffles can make a cheese shine .
All that , my over stuffed home freezer and my natural cooking instincts made me think of making cheese out of ( human ) mother ’s milk .
Step -by Step
My Spouse ’s Mommy Milk Cheese Making Experiment
( basic recipe using 8 cups of any milk - yields about ½ pound cheese )
2 cups mother ’s milk
2 cups milk ( just about any animal milk will work )
1½ - teaspoon yogurt ( must be active cultured yogurt )
1/8 - tablet rennet ( buy from supermarket , usually located in pudding section )
1 teaspoon sea salt such as Baline
1. Inoculate milks by heating ( 68 degree Fahrenheit ) then introduce starter bacteria ( active yogurt ) then let stand for 6 – 8 hours at room temperature , 68 ºF covered with a lid .
Bacteria will grow in this way and convert milk sugar ( lactose ) to lactic acid .
You can detect its presence by the tart / sour taste .
2 . After inoculating the milk heat to 86 degrees Fahrenheit then add rennet ( I use tablets which I dissolve in water ) and stir throughout .
Cover pot and do n’t disturb for an hour until “ clean break stage ” is achieved , meaning with a clean spoon lift a small piece of curd out of the milk - if it is still soft and gel - like let pot stand for an hour longer .
If curds “ break clean ” cut with a knife into a squares ( cut inside the pot a ½- inch cube pattern ) .
3 . Raise temperature slowly continuously stirring with a pastry spatula ( this will prevent clumping of cut curd ) .
This is what I call the “ ricotta stage ” if you like this kind of fresh cheese – here it is .
For cheese with a little bit more of texture heat curds to 92 degree Fahrenheit - for soft curd cheese , or as high 102 oF for very firm cheese .
The heating of the curd makes all the difference in the consistency of the cheese .
When heated the curd looks almost like scrambled eggs at this point ( curd should be at bottom of pot in whey liquid ) .
4 . Pour curd through a fine strainer ( this will separate curd from whey ) then transfer into a bowl and add salt and mix with a pastry spatula ( this will prevent curd from spoiling ) .
Whey can be drank - it is quite healthy and its protein is very efficiently absorbed into the blood stream making it a sought - after product in shakes for bodybuilders .
5 . Give curd shape by lining a container with cheese cloth ( allow any excess of cheese cloth to hang over edges of container ) .
Transfer drained , warm curd in the cheese cloth lined container ( I used a large plastic quart containers like a large Chinese take - out soup container and cut 4 holes in the bottom with the tip of my knife ) .
Fold excess cheese cloth over top of cheese then weight curd down ( with second container filled with water or such ) then store in refrigerator ( 14 hours or so – put container into a second larger container – this will catch draining whey liquid ) .
6 . Take pressed curd out of container ( flip container upside - down then unwrap carefully not to damage structure of pressed curd ) .
Rewrap pressed curd with new cheese cloth then age in refrigerator for several weeks ( cheese will form a light brown skin around week two – this is normal ) .
Age cheese longer for a more pronounced / sharper cheese flavor .
( HERE IT IS mommy 's milk cheese with beets and romaine )
Chef ’s Note : Cheese has to be rewrapped daily as long cheese cloth feels wet .
Chef ’s Note : Curdling is the process when milk is separated into solid ( curds ) and liquid which is done by introducing acids such as vinegar or a starter bacteria commonly found in yogurts .
Rennet ( enzymes from the fourth stomach from young calves stomach which breaks down mother milk ) is added too so that milk develops strong curds in the cheese making process .
( mommy 's milk cheese rolled in dehydrated porcini mushroom powder with burned onion chutney )
Is it OK
I was concerned a little bit with the thought of making cheese out of mother ’s milk .
I wondered if it was ethical - since I have n’t seen it on any restaurant menu yet .
Conclusion – my spouse agreed -- our baby has plenty back - up mother ’s milk in the freezer so whoever wants to try it is welcome to try it as long as supply lasts ( please consider cheese aging time ) .
I want to make it perfectly clear :
The mommy 's milk cheese was not produced in my restaurant nor was it sold or offered there - as misstated in some media .
( my daughter Arabella / Caroline ... nurtered with plenty of mommy 's milk ... until asleep )

“ Be ye lamps unto yourselves , be a refuge to yourselves .
Hold fast to truth as a lamp ; hold fast to the truth as a refuge .
Look not for a refuge in anyone beside yourselves .
And those , who shall be a lamp unto themselves , shall betake themselves to no external refuge , but holding fast to the truth as their lamp , and holding fast to the truth as their refuge , they shall reach the topmost height . ”

The Buddha ’s Last Instruction
Mary Oliver
“ Make yourself a light , ”
said the Buddha ,
before he died .
I think of this every morning
as the east begins
to tear off its many clouds
of darkness , to send up the first
signal — a white fan
streaked with pink and violet ,
even green .
An old man , he lay down
between two sala trees ,
and he might have said anything ,
knowing it was his final hour .
The light burns upward ,
it thickens and settles over the fields .
Around him , the villagers gathered
and stretched forward to listen .
Even before the sun itself
hangs , disattached , in the blue air ,
I am touched everywhere
by its oceans of yellow waves .
No doubt he thought of everything
that had happened in his difficult life .
And then I feel the sun itself
as it blazes over the hills ,
like a million flowers on fire —
clearly I ’m not needed ,
yet I feel myself turning
into something of inexplicable value .
Slowly , beneath the branches ,
he raised his head .
He looked into the faces of that frightened crowd .

House Minority leader and corporate bankster stooge John Boehner said he thinks taxpayers should help pick up the tab for the clean up .
“ I think the people responsible in the oil spill — BP and the federal government — should take full responsibility for what ’s happening there , ” Boehner said at his weekly press conference , according to TPM Muckraker ( emphasis added ) .
John Boehner ’s spokeman said John really did n’t mean it .
The federal government , of course , pays for stuff — including cleaning up after transactional corporations — by borrowing money and adding to the national debt .
Boehner made his comments after US Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue said everybody has to chip in for the BP oil spill clean - up .
“ It is generally not the practice of this country to change the laws after the game , ” he said .
“ Everybody is going to contribute to this clean up .
We are all going to have to do it .
We are going to have to get the money from the government and from the companies and we will figure out a way to do that . ”
Change the laws of the game ?
Since when does the American tax payer have to pay for a supposed accident by a transnational corporation ?
Since the monopoly men took over the government in the late 1800s .
It is now common practice for profits to be privatized by corporatists and banksters and the losses and downside to be socialized and paid for the chumps .
Republicans like to pretend they are for small government and minimal taxation .
Did you see your taxes go down under Bush or Reagan ?
Government continued to grow under the statist Republicans .
Bush the Lesser increased the national debt by nearly $ 5 trillion .
When Bush took office , the national debt was $ 5.73 trillion .
When he left , it was $ 10.7 trillion .
That ’s a difference of $ 4.97 trillion .
Reagan increased U.S. national debt by almost $ 1.9 trillion during his term .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
To be fair , Reagan actually cut income taxes , but an increase in Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid taxes wiped out any gain .
The bottom 40 % of households paid out more of their income in federal taxes in 1988 than they had in 1980 .
The national debt was jacked up by funding a bloated military and its harebrained schemes like Star Wars designed to enrich the military - industrial complex .
Meanwhile , the Federal Reserve continued its manipulation of the fiat money supply in order to rob the American people through inflation .
It did n’t take long for Boehner to realize he had betrayed the often recited fairy tale that Democrats are about large “ socialist ” government and ever - increasing taxes while Republicans are supposedly about smaller government and fiscal responsibility .
“ Boehner made a general statement about who is responsible for the spill , and the federal government oversight was clearly lacking , but he has said repeatedly that BP is responsible for the cost of the cleanup , ” said spokesman Michael Steel .
See Boehner ’s original quote above .
He said “ government ” should be responsible for the clean - up .
Government means the people of the United States .
It means the government will borrow trillions more from the banksters and saddle the children of our children with debt and slavery .
In Orwell ’s 1984 , Winston Smith fed truth into the flaming maw of the memory hole and paved the way for official lies .

We are in the process of redesigning our focus and approach to explore the possibilities for health promotion in a world deep in crisis .
I ’ve mentioned before that beer bloggers such as myself tend toward the fringe .
Having been through all the tried & true styles , after hundreds of pints of readily available session beers , Boston Lagers , Anchor Steams and their ilk , it ’s easy to grow weary of even good beers that are n’t uncommon or extreme .
Especially when writing , it ’s simply more interesting to review unique brews , emerging styles , or super - expensive small batch rarities .
Every now and then , though , I like to break that mold by writing about something ubiquitous , simple , sessionable , or in this case , downright unpleasant .
The History / The Style
The history of Anheuser - Busch has been documented enough , so I ’ll spare you .
‘ Chelada ’ is AB ’s macro take on the Michelada or Cerveza preparada , a beer - based mixed drink that originated in Mexico in the 1940’s .
The name is either a portmanteau of ‘ mix ’ and ‘ chela ’ ( chela , meaning ‘ chill ’ is a Mexican slang for cold beer ) or a contraction of “ Mi Chela Helada ” , meaning “ My cold beer . ”
Whatever the back story , the meaning is basically the same .
The definition of a Michelada is fairly loose , and there is no one correct version .
The standard base recipe calls for beer mixed with tomato juice and lime in a salt - rimmed glass .
Clamato , or a house made mix of tomato and clam / oyster broth can also be used , and adding spices such as Worcestershire , Tobasco , or chili powder is n’t uncommon .
In mexico , Micheladas are considered a good hangover remedy .
Sort of a beer - based bloody mary for the working - class brunch crowd .
Anheuser Busch , always on top of their marketing , has apparently realized both the popularity of Michelada in the Latino community and the growing Latino community in the US , and saw no other option but to jump on the trend .
Their version is a 4.2 % ABV mix of Bud Light and Clamato ( the proprietary version ) , with salt and lime ( likely artificial ) added .
Seeing as a 24oz .
can will set you back a measly $ 1.50 , they ’re not exactly marketing to the connoisseur crowd here .
The Tasting
Pours translucent and fizzy … looks more like grapefruit soda than beer .
Head is pillowy and white , but quickly deflates , leaving zero lacing and very little nucleation .
Smells like a bloody mary .
Peppery tomato , a hint of celery even .
Immediate taste is salt water … lots of salt water .
Diluted tomato soup and a brief peppery tinge push through the brine , followed by a barely detectable glimmer of that familiar spoiled bread Bud Light taste , a half - second reassurance that yes , there is beer in this .
The somehow welcome adjunct - laden beer taste quickly gives way to an overly salty tomato juice finish .
Aftertaste is long and acidic , inducing both a twisted facial expression and a bit of heartburn .
Mouthfeel … well I ’m hesitant to hold this beer in my mouth long enough to properly gauge its feel .
It ’s thin , but the flavor is powerfully overwhelming .
Somehow creamy and watery at the same time .
My first thought upon taking a sip is how quickly I can swallow it just to get the taste out of my mouth .
I honestly do n’t understand how anyone can drink this .
The Verdict
I ’ve had plenty of beers that I do n’t like , and a few I consider downright awful .
In every one , though , I was able to see at least what the brewer was thinking , and grasp that there is indeed a market for that type of beer .
With this , though , I just ca n’t imagine it being enjoyable .
To anyone .
I ’ll even go as far as to accept that there is a group who honestly enjoys a good Michelada after a rough Saturday night .
I see enough weekend - afternoon Bloody Mary swillers to grasp the appeal of a good hangover cure ( even though I personally do n’t enjoy them ) .
However , I can only see this mass - produced , low - cost , dare - I - say ‘ corporate ’ take on the style as the absolute bottom of the Michelada barrel .
Sorry if my words are a bit harsh , but I still have the taste of Cape Cod Bay at low - tide kicking around the back of my throat .
On the bright side , I no longer have to think when I ’m asked “ What ’s the worst beer you ’ve ever had ? ”

LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
The rate that banks charge each other for short - term loans in U.S. dollars hit another 10 - month high Tuesday , underlining growing unease over the possibility that Europe 's crisis in sovereign debt could turn into a banking crisis .
The three - month U.S. dollar London interbank offered rate , or Libor , was fixed at 0.53625 % , up from Monday 's 0.50969 % , according to the British Bankers ' Association .
Tuesday 's rate marked the highest level since early July and continues an uptrend that began in the spring .
Libor is the benchmark most widely used for short - term interest rates around the world .
The steady , ongoing rise in Libor and other key measures of tensions in the money markets were blamed for undermining sentiment in equity markets around the world Tuesday , reminding investors of the near - freeze in credit markets that threatened to shut down the global financial system in late 2008 in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers .
No 2008 rerun
The recent rise is nowhere near the same scale and looks " quite muted " compared with the levels seen at the height of the financial crisis , acknowledged Elwin de Groot , fixed - income strategist at Rabobank in the Netherlands .
But it 's also " quite clear that the situation is deteriorating day by day in a sense that it is becoming something to be worried about , " he said .
Libor , which normally adheres closely to official interest - rate expectations , blew out to around 5 % in 2008 even as the Federal Reserve was slashing its key rate from 2 % toward zero .
The spread between three - month dollar Libor and overnight index swaps , a key measure of the willingness of banks to lend to each other , soared to an extraordinary level of more than 360 basis points -- 3.6 percentage points .
By contrast , the spread between three - month dollar Libor and overnight index swaps , viewed as a gauge of how willing banks are to lend to each other , topped 30 basis points , or 0.3 percentage point , on Tuesday .
While far off the levels seen at the height of the crisis , it 's still the highest reading since last summer and has served to undermine sentiment across financial and equity markets .
Costlier to borrow
Meanwhile , the TED spread , measuring the gap between the rate on three - month Treasury bills TMUBMUSD03M , 0.098 % and three - month Libor , jumped to 37.1 basis points , or 0.369 percentage point -- its highest level since July .
The spread spiked in October 2008 to more than 460 basis points , according to FactSet Research .
In another sign of how costs are rising for companies needing to borrow funds , two - year swap spreads rose to 56 basis points , after touching the highest since May 2009 .
A swap spread is the difference between the rates to exchange floating - for fixed - interest payments and comparable - maturity Treasury yields .
Wider spreads mean banks are more hesitant to lend to each other , putting pressure on funding costs and , indirectly , the rates that homeowners and corporate lenders pay .
" The bottom line is that equity investors will continue to remain tentative until some level of stability emerges among these spreads , " said Mike O'Rourke , chief market strategist at BTIG in Chicago .
At the same time , current levels show " we are not in a complete market meltdown and perhaps one can be avoided , " wrote Greg Gibbs , an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland , in a strategy note .
But he also pointed out that confidence in the banking system " does n't have to retreat too far to have a meaningful impact when markets and positions are coming off relatively optimistic levels . "
And Libor does n't tell the full story of funding costs , according to Gibbs .
Spanish banks , for instance , are presumably paying significant margins over Libor for short - term loans , he said .
Spain 's banking woes have served to heighten tensions far beyond its borders .
The Bank of Spain over the weekend moved to seize CajaSur , a troubled regional lender , or caja , and moved to consolidate other institutions .
See European Stocks to Watch .
CajaSur 's collapse was tied to its exposure to Spain 's collapsed property bubble and highlighted worries about the strength of the nation 's banking sector .
Pete Abilla Bio Lean Stand in a Circle , 5 Whys , and a Call Center An effective exercise

Some time ago , while consulting for a huge call center , I took a group of customer service agents for a little gemba walk and a quick activity to demonstrate a few lean fundamentals .
What was scheduled for a 60 - minute exercise turned out to be an experience that awakened the agents , several of whom went on to create reports based on Toyota 's A3 problem - solving method and on the plan - do - check - act cycle ( a method for learning and improvement developed by Walter Shewhart ) , that added value to the customer and the company .
Stand in a circle I gave each of the customer service agents a pencil and a piece of paper .
We then stood quietly in the middle of the call center for five minutes .
There was no talking .
We wrote down as many things as we could observe during those five minutes .
Instruction
With a white board , still in the middle of the contact center , I had one of the agents create a tally of the items observed .
I showed the team how to create a simple tick sheet and then I asked them , “ What ’s a good way to visualize this data ? ”

Calling for a “ new mindset ” among world leaders , President Obama on Tuesday opened the working session of his international nuclear summit with dire warnings about terrorist efforts to get their hands on nuclear weapons .
Networks such as Al Qaeda have tried to acquire the material for a nuclear weapon , the president told the assembly , predicting that if they were to succeed , “ they would surely use it .
“ Were they to do so , it would be a catastrophe for the world , causing extraordinary loss of life and striking a major blow at global peace and stability , ” Obama said .
“ It is increasingly clear that the danger of nuclear terrorism is one of the greatest threats to global security , to our collective security . ”
It was a dark reminder the president ’s team has been sounding all week in public remarks , as well as in one - on - one conversations between Obama and other leaders during the last three days .
Obama opened with it Tuesday as the plenary session with leaders of 46 other nations and international agencies came to order for the president ’s summit in Washington .
At the top of the agenda is how to lock down nuclear material and arms to make sure terrorists ca n’t threaten the world community or individual nations with an atomic attack .
The White House is hoping that Obama will be able to announce specific steps toward the goal of nuclear security by the time of an afternoon news conference expected after the summit concludes .
Already , the leaders of Chile , Ukraine and Canada have promised to reduce their stockpiles of enriched uranium that can be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons .
Summit organizers at the White House also hope to release a communique after the end of the meeting .
One of the working provisions of the agreement would set a goal of securing loose materials around the world within the next four years .
Unclear at the start of business Tuesday morning is whether the leaders will move closer to supporting imposition of sanctions against Iran , an effort which Obama and Western allies are leading in hopes of curbing that nation ’s nuclear program .
Two decades after the end of the Cold War , Obama said , the “ cruel irony of history ” is that the risk of nuclear attack has gone up even as the risk of nuclear confrontation between nations has decreased .
“ Nuclear materials that could be sold or stolen and fashioned into a nuclear weapon exist in dozens of nations , ” Obama said .
“ Just the smallest amount of plutonium -- about the size of an apple -- could kill and injure hundreds of thousands of innocent people . ”
World leaders must do more than talk , he said -- they must act to promote security .
“ It requires a new mindset , ” Obama said , “ that we summon the will , as nations , as partners , to do what this moment in history demands . ”

Congress Backs Wall Street , Rejects Big Bank Break - Up
Late last night , the U.S. Senate rejected the single most important element of Wall Street reform by a vote of 33 to 61 .
The SAFE Banking
Act would have forced the break - up of the nation 's six largestbanks , and dramatically reduced the political clout of America 's financial elite .
The 61 votes against the measure are votes in favor of Wall Street 's stranglehold on our economy .
No matter what else is ultimately enacted in the name of Wall Street reform , Congress has decided that it will not confront the single greatest problem in the U.S. economy : Too Big To Fail .
On Wednesday , the Senate also voted down a $ 50 billion Wall Street tax that would have been used to fund the cost of shutting down a major failing bank .
By rejecting both the break - up bill and the bank tax , the Senate has punted on ending too - big - to - fail .
For now , it appears that Wall Street has emerged from the Great Financial Crash of 2008 with even greater political might than it wielded during the reign of George W. Bush .
In the Citizens United era , both Democrats and Republicans have decided they can only get so tough with Corporate America .
Last night , 27 Democrats joined all but three Republicans to vote against breaking up the banks .
President Barack Obama opposed both the tax and the break - up measures , and hosted J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon for dinner at the White House on Monday .
J.P. Morgan is the largest U.S. bank , and spent more money on lobbying in 2009 than any other bank .
House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - OH ) has aggressively courted Dimon for campaign cash .
The good news is , there are still some smaller - bore reforms in the legislation that are worth voting for , and it appears that some version of reform , however tepid , will ultimately be approved .
Congress will be deploying a screwdriver to perform a job fit for a bulldozer , but a few weeks ago , it was not obvious that even the screwdriver would make it through .
Shortly before the vote on breaking up the banks , Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) cut a deal with Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) that would subject all of the Federal Reserve 's bailout operations to a thorough public audit .
Despite all of the attention heaped on the Treasury Department and the Troubled Asset Relief Program , the Fed has operated as the chief bailout engine of the U.S. government , pumping $ 4.3 trillion into the banking system without almost no public disclosure .
We do n't know who received money , or on what terms , or who approved the transactions .
It now appears very likely that this information will finally see the light of day .
Obama , who had opposed a more comprehensive Fed audit , now supports the Sanders plan .
But by allowing megabanks to remain super - sized , Congress has insulated them from the fallout associated with the Fed disclosures , and given them a tool to fight other reforms .
Our giant financial institutions are not only too - big - to - fail , they are too - big - to - regulate .
There are meaningful reforms still on the table — a ban on risky proprietary trading , an overhaul of consumer protection and the reining in of the crazy derivatives casino that brought down AIG — but all will be much more difficult to enforce at the complex megabanks which currently dominate both the marketplace and Capitol Hill .
Major economic realignments are not quickly established .
It took seven years for Franklin Delano Roosevelt to pass all of his New Deal - era banking reforms .
We have known for some time that this legislation , however stringent , would be incomplete .
Hedge funds , credit rating agencies , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac all must be addressed by separate legislation .
The SAFE Banking
Act must be considered in every subsequent reform package .
Here are the Senators who voted last night to preserve Wall Street 's power .

Sarah was giving a much discussed speech at CSU last night , there was much eager anticipation from the Sarah fans and much disgust from her detractors .
For more in depth detail Palingates have the whole sorry story .
http://palingates.blogspot.com/
Sarah gave one of her slam Obama blockbusters , not forgetting to call the 2 girls who ' unearthed ' her infamous contract with the CSU ' dumpster divers ' .
In the same speech and with no apparent awareness of the cognitive dissonance praised Neda for her heroism in fighting the establishment .
After the speech , Fox 40 had an apparent open mic problem .
Basically , journalists and techies wrapping up were over heard to say that Sarah was dumb as a rock and listening to her was like riding a rollercoaster .
The fans , who were just in the middle of a YAY !
Sarah hit it out the park !
moment went nuts .
Link to them , hate to give them the attention , but they are so hilarious it 's a shame not to share .
http://www.conservatives4palin.com/...
Sarah Palin ... Happy , Beautiful and in Command
The writing on the palm , never gets old ... free advertisiing ...
Keep passing out piggy banks Mitten .
You could n't deliver this speech in a million years .
Yes , very new stuff and relevant to the college folks .
It 's clear why the Evil Empire tried to get this event canceled
.
SLAMMING the Socialists and Progressives !
The dangers of intellectuals flirting with Communism !
Talking about apologising to Dictators !
Exposing the dangers of excessively PC " cultural tolerance " SHE ROOOOOOCKKKKKKKKSSSSSS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Boy she is knocking this out of the park !
BUT WAIT !
WHAT'S THIS ?
Somethings wrong ...........
Does anyone have the email for this live feed crew ?
They are the most biased unprofessional bunch and should all be fired .
I think they knew the audio was on , their trashing her speech sounded too pointed and the clearest vocal out of the whole event .
Planned to make the morning news no doubt .
Now we know why the feed sucked .
Incompetent Lefties were handling it .
They ruin everything they touch .
We need to all call the station ... they need to be fired
Freakin wierdos those guys are ... man I wish I was there with them , I would n't let them get away with that .
They even sound like liberals ..
Read my statement above .
They said , " All you do is put a bunch of quotes together , " " Did she even make a point , " " Now I know dumbness is n't from soundbytes "
It sounded to me that the person who said " the dumbness is not just in the soundbites , " which itself is an illiterate manner of expression , was a reporter .
He had to wrtie a story about the evening .
He had an older voice .
The two younger idiots were talking about how they filled their theme papers with quotes when they had nothing better to say .
In other words the content of the speech went over their heads .
Well I have it on good authority ... Sarah has left the Building .
That is a lame cop out by the station .
Someone controlling the station 's video deliberately switched the audio feed from the mike on the podium to the mike behind the camera so that the libs there could broadcast their comments without having their faces recorded .
This is a planned , deliberate act by cowards .
What do n't you get about it being broadcast on the Fox40 website ?
The Fox40 Website ?
Tammy
Bruce was n't happy , that makes me very happy .
Here are tweets apparently Tammy sent to Fox40 ; I still do n't get how twitter works ...
@ FOX40 Whomever was engaging in the smears , they all owe your viewers and Governor Palin an apology .
Not impressed .
4 minutes ago via web Reply Retweet @ FOX40
Obviously they were unaware the mic was picking them up , and made disparaging comments about the Governor .
5 minutes ago via web Reply Retweet @ FOX40
Hi there , I just covered your livestream and was shocked by the comments of your techies and I believe reporter after the fact .
5 minutes ago via web
LOTS of chatter on the twitter about this .
@ Fox40 is getting hammered ! :)
I 'm retweeting like crazy ...
Let me just say this .
If Sarah Palin is elected President , I will not be diplomatic about it .
I am going to rub every left wingers face in it .
I am going to rub it in every liberal media persons ( redundant ) face .
I will enjoy it immensely : )
The people at Fox40 are a bunch of dirty rat fornicators
There are so , so many more , all hilarious , but I 'll leave you with that last happy thought .
Hav done my best to try and ind a transcript .
Politicusa has one , but I can't get in for some reason .
Will provide link in case you can .
Now In , transcipt
http://www.politicususa.com/...
During the live mic drama at the end , the reporters said now they know that her " dumbness does n’t come from soundbites " and wondered if she had finished ONE statement , but decided , no she had not .
They laughed derisively and made jokes about having to text their conservative friends about this .

I tweeted Palin ’s CSU Stanislaus speech tonight so you would n’t have to listen .
I thought it was going well ( sliding scale ) , and breathed a sigh of relief for her when it ended ... only to be SHOCKED by hearing reporters discussing her performance in a brutally frank manner , reminiscent of Peggy Noonan ’s open mic debacle regarding Palin .
Of course , Peggy ’s open mic moment left us wondering why the pundits were not being honest with us about Palin .
Clearly they knew she was n’t up to the task of Vice President .
But I digress ....
As we know , where ever Sarah goes , drama follows .
" I feel like I just got off a rollercoaster . "
" She did n’t finish a statement . "
" I do n’t know how you ’re gonna make a story out of that . "
" Well , that ’s the story . "
" Did she even make a point ? "
" Lots of Reagan . "
" Just put as many random quotes in as you can . "
UPDATE 2 - with thanks to Scarce in the comments
Statement from Fox 40 SACRAMENTO - Thousands of people from California and around the world tuned in to FOX40.com to listen to a speech prepared by Sarah Palin Friday evening from the campus of California State University , Stanislaus .
During that stream , several unfortunate events occurred that we hope to clear up through this statement .
First , FOX40
News was the only station streaming a live signal from CSU Stanislaus during Sarah Palin 's presentation .
Friday , we were told by officials organizing the speech that we were not permitted to beam a live signal direct from the dining hall where Sarah Palin was presenting ; instead , we were offered the opportunity to aim a FOX40 camera at a projection screen inside a room for assembled media down the hall from where Sarah Palin was due to speak .
We were cautioned by the organizers of the event that there was an ongoing audio situation .
We were faced with two decisions -- to not carry a speech of local and national importance due to the low - quality methods we'd be forced to transmit , or to provide a signal by any means necessary .
It was with the public interest in mind that we opted for the latter .
Thank you for the tips and recs folks , I 'm a bit shy of doing this but wanted you to know I am very grateful .

Dr. George Rekers is threatening to sue “ media outlets ” for defamation , and Liberty Counsel ’s Mat Staver has pledged to support him .
But what exactly does he mean ?
We have been told the following :
1. Rekers found Jo-Vanni Roman on RentBoy.com , a site designed to facilitate gay male prostitutes and their prospective johns finding each other .
2. Rekers contracted for Roman to accompany him to Europe .
In addition to ‘ luggage lifting ’ services , the contract required that Roman spend a designated amount of time with Rekers and also “ will provide George Rekers a massage for at least one hour each day of the trip in their shared rooms using the same procedures ( “ Lucien ” ) provided to George Rekers in Florida . ”
Roman has clarified the massages were nude , were sexual in nature , and that the procedures involved genital contact .
Interestingly , Rekers does not dispute – or even address – these details .
He seems relatively unconcerned about providing clarification about the particulars of the massages or the origins of their first communication .
Instead he has focused his attention , his objection , and his denial around one statement .
Rekers ’ first mention of a defamation suit was on the 6th , right after the Miami New Times reported that Roman told them that Rekers “ is a homosexual . ”
“ If today ’s news story in the Miami New Times is accurate , ” said Rekers in an e-mail to me , “ I have been advised to retain the services of a defamation attorney in this matter , because the fact is that I am not gay and never have been . ”
You may note that Rekers was not threatening defamation based on prior reporting , but on what had been claimed that day .
Then on the 11th , he reiterated his threat with a statement to NARTH .
“ I am immediately resigning my membership in NARTH to allow myself the time necessary to fight the false media reports that have been made against me .
With the assistance of a defamation attorney , I will fight these false reports because I have not engaged in any homosexual behavior whatsoever .
I am not gay and never have been . ”
Considering the earlier accusations that the Miami New Times was engaging in “ false impressions ” and “ misleading innuendo ” and “ incorrectly implying ” , I think that a pattern has developed which helps clarify exactly what Rekers fears the most .
Dr. George Rekers does not want to be thought of as a homosexual .
He so objects to this that he is willing to file a defamation suit against anyone who claims , implies , or gives the impression that he is .
And Liberty Counsel is willing to back him .
But why would Rekers and Staver focus solely on the identity and not on the facts as known ?
That is because Dr. George Rekers – and Liberty Counsel – define homosexuality differently than you or I .
We accept the concept of sexual orientation .
We allocate people into categories based on the sex towards which their attractions point .
If a person is primarily attracted to persons of the same sex , we identify them as homosexual .
It ’s just a matter of fact , and folks have little to no say in the matter .
But to Rekers , a homosexual is defined by his behavior .
Those who engage in homosexual acts are homosexuals , and if one chooses to resist temptation , then one is not homosexual .
And Rekers seems to define “ homosexual behavior ” differently from most of us .
It appears to me that he has established a line beyond which he will not go .
Erotic massage is not “ homosexual behavior ” , while oral or anal sex clearly are .
This way of thinking is evidenced in his statement to blogger Joe.my.god .
If you talk with my travel assistant that the story called “ Lucien , ” you will find I spent a great deal of time sharing scientific information on the desirability of abandoning homosexual intercourse … [ emphasis added ]
I suspect that Rekers believes himself to be truthful when he says that he did not engage in homosexual behavior and is not a homosexual .
Under the definitions he and his community use , he may have submitted to his weaknesses , but he did not cross his line in behavior and he is actively choosing not to be a homosexual .
So if Rekers does sue , this will be a fascinating case .
It will go far beyond the questions about who did what to whom , where , and in what state of undress .
Rather , this case would hinge on the question , “ How do you define homosexuality ? ”
If “ homosexual behavior ” is limited to insertive penile contact , and if “ homosexual ” is one who chooses to live a life centered around one ’s same - sex attractions , then Rekers has a basis for his objections .
But the court system is not an adjunct of the conservative evangelical Christian movement , and it is not subject to the carefully crafted language that allows Rekers a level of deniability .
Going forward with a defamation lawsuit is very risky for Rekers and Staver .
Defense will call witnesses from the mental health professions who will inform the court about modern thinking on matters of sexuality .
They will witness that it is reasonable to use the term “ homosexual ” to describe a man who is erotically aroused by same - sex contact .
They will provide testimony of Rekers ’ behavior , of the sexual nature of his contact with Roman , and possibly even a record of his activity on the RentBoy site .
Rekers and his counsel will be left trying to defend their own peculiar definition of homosexuality , and arguing that the media be punished for not adopting their language .
This would be a hard sell .
And , in the process , Dr. George Rekers runs the risk of having a court declare him to be homosexual .
And that would be truly devastating for the anti-gay movement .
Dear Straight Dope : I have been unsuccessful in finding the origin to the word " smart alec " or " smart aleck . "
Was Alec a person and what made him so smart ?
Share the straight dope on this one for us , please .
— Cindy Jimenez , Temple City , CA .
Czarcasm replies :
According to G.L. Cohen , author of Studies in Slang Part 1 ( 1985 ) , the phrase smart alec ( k ) arose from the exploits of one Alec Hoag .
A celebrated pimp , thief , and confidence man operating out of New York City in the 1840 ’s , Mr. Hoag , along with his wife Melinda and an accomplice known as “ French Jack , ” operated a con called the “ panel game , ” a method by which prostitutes and their pimps robbed foolish customers .
See www.wordwizard.com/.
A search of several of the more reliable dictionaries pretty much confirms this definition .
The Oxford English Dictionary traces it to mid-1860s slang , while the American Heritage Dictionary ( 4th ed. , 2000 ) and Brewer ’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable ( 16th ed. , 1999 ) tentatively trace the etymology of the phrase to Hoag .
The “ panel game ” consisted of sliding walls that would enable Mr. Hoag to sneak in whilst the mark was sleeping and steal valuables .
Before Mr. Hoag , a prostitute ’s accomplices would wait until the mark was asleep , then burst into the room .
But the marks got wise and would block the door with a table or chair propped up under the doorknob , thinking they would then be safe from intruders .
“ Smart ” Alec Hoag , because he never woke the victim , would be on the other side of town before the rube even knew what had happened .

Many of us who have become dependent on drink or drugs turn for help to support groups ; others , to psychotherapy .
If we persevere with either , before long we ’re likely to discover that , while active , we may have been approaching a cul de sac .
But once there , we find it opens to a path to a higher ground hitherto unbeknownst to us .
In other words , the humanity and usefulness to society that we enjoy today might never have come to pass if substance abuse had n’t demanded that we reinvent ourselves .
We need , as they say in support groups , to reach our bottom .
You ’d think that humanity had reached its collective bottom in the 20th century with World Wars I and II .
What more havoc had to be wreaked before we got the message that wholesale conflict would lead to the end of civilization ?
But , instead of “ letting go and letting God , ” to borrow from AA lingo , states remained in a defensive crouch , none more so than the victors .
As well , the United States and the Soviet Union sought to solidify their newfound dominance by building up their nuclear arsenals as if they we were still on a war - time basis cranking out munitions .
Viewed from the perspective of one who ’s suffered from substance abuse , it was as if two winos had dragged themselves from the gutter and stopped drinking .
But , hedging their bets on sobriety , they carried around pints of Everclear 190 proof grain alcohol in their pockets in case they really needed a drink , even though they knew it would kill him .
Meanwhile , however much those of us who advocate for disarmament question whether nuclear deterrence was critical to averting another world war , one has yet to occur .
But nuclear weapons ’ arguable status as the last word in national security was n’t what I had in mind when I described nuclear weapons as a gift from above .
The true gift granted by the existence of nuclear weapons is that , as weapons , they ’re essentially too big for the planet to contain .
They ’re more suitable to lighting off in outer space .
In other words , they demand that , once and for all , we step back and look at the whole subject to which nuclear weapons are a sub-category — mass warfare .
We ’ve failed to take the cue , however .
Since nuclear weapons were developed , the bulk of the reflection by the national - security world has been over the unique strategy adaptations called for by the possession of a weapon that essentially can’t be used .
Meanwhile , about the best example of deliberation that disarmament advocates can come up with is that the abolition of nuclear weapons will lead to demilitarization and the redistribution of military expenditures toward human needs and the environment .
We ’re just too emotionally invested in them — as well as economically .
The 13 - percent funding hike that the National Nuclear Security Administration is due to receive next year — a greater percentage increase than for any other government agency — is a tribute to the power of pork : its allure to Congress persons and its perceived importance to their constituents .
Besides , writes Bruno Tertrais , a “ realist ” about nuclear weapons , in the April Washington Quarterly :
The intellectual and political movement in favor of abolition suffers from unconvincing rationales , inherent contradictions , and unrealistic expectations .
A nuclear - weapons - free world is an illogical goal .
In fact , winning the abolition debate is well night impossible , especially when it arguments such as this by Tertrais need to be refuted :
All three Asian nuclear countries — China , India , and Pakistan — are steadily building up their capabilities and show absolutely no sign in being interested in abolition , other than in purely rhetorical terms .
[ As well as this ]
Smaller countries that seek to balance Western power may actually feel encouraged to develop nuclear weapons or a “ breakout ” option if they believed that the West is on its way to getting rid of them .
You can be forgiven for wondering how we ’ll ever talk ourselves off the ledge .
It turns out that the existence of nuclear weapons has done little to induce us to reexamine the tendency of our species to resort to mass warfare .
Quite the contrary , the prevalence of nuclear weapons , as well as their immensity , seem to have created a mental block , or placed a governor , on our minds .
It ’s as if we ’re prohibited from cycling our thoughts up to a frequency at which we might see our way of clear of nuclear weapons .
Bless the little children .
For they shall lead us to a nuclear - free world .
However crucial the disarmament movement — in all its manifestations from policy adepts to peace workers to radicals — is , it ’s time to recognize the truth .
The most it can hope for is to keep disarmament near the forefront of the national debate and to win minor policy points .
In other words , in and of itself , the disarmament movement is incapable of precipitating nuclear abolition .
Sweeping change can only come from the bottom up — from , in fact , the depths of the human heart .
Apologies if you ’ve heard this from me before , but , except for a few enlightened pockets , child - rearing practices around the world need a significant upgrade .
Otherwise , the planet will never produce a critical mass of humans to whom a national - security policy that puts the lives of tens of millions of people at risk is no longer tolerable .
IR ( international relations ) types may argue that the human psyche comes in a distant second to political considerations as a cause of war .
But the influential and recently deceased Swiss psychotherapist and author Alice Miller wrote ( emphasis added ) :
“ The total neglect or trivialization of the childhood factor operative in the context of violence . . . sometimes leads to explanations that are not only unconvincing and abortive but actively deflect attention away from the genuine roots of violence . ”
In other words — surprise , surprise — abusing a child predisposes him or her toward violence and , arguably , an inclination to advocate or support violent solutions to international conflict .
How do we turn that ocean liner around ?
Measures such as these have already been implemented : laws banning corporal punishment , community centers to teach parenting skills , and programs that teach high - school students childrearing ; others provide children with empathy training .
The more they ’re implemented , the more children will grow up unmarked by abuse .
In short order , fewer individuals in positions of authority will find that strategies that put enormous numbers of individuals in harm ’s way make sense .
At the end of the day ( let ’s hope not — that cliché is infused with frightening new meaning when applied to nuclear weapons ) , there ’s still time to accept the gift of the message that nuclear weapons is trying to impart to us and stare mass — and all war — down .
As Jonathan Schell writes in the Nation :
Israel is seeking global support to improve the flow of civilian goods and prevent weapons smuggling to the blockaded Gaza Strip , the government said on Friday .
Open gallery view Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shakes hands with Middle East Quartet Envoy Tony Blair on June 08 , 2010 in Jerusalem , Israel .

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , under pressure to ease Israel 's three - year siege since a deadly raid on a Gaza - bound aid ship two weeks ago , held talks on the issue with Tony Blair , Middle East envoy for the ' Quartet ' of the European Union , United Nations , United States and Russia .
" The aim of the meeting was to recruit international support behind the principle that weapons and military supportive material will not reach Gaza or Hamas , while humanitarian and civilian goods may reach the area and its residents via additional means , " Netanyahu 's office said in a statement .
Israeli naval commandos on May 31 shot dead nine Turkish activists who assaulted them with knives and clubs as they boarded the Turkish - owned ship ' Mavi Marama ' to prevent it from breaching a maritime blockade of Gaza .
On Wednesday Israel eased restrictions on goods to Gaza this week by announcing it would admit additional items such as snack foods and carbonated drinks via Israeli - controlled crossings .
The announcnement came as U.S. President Barack Obama and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas held talks in Washington on the Gaza embargo , a focus of world attention since Israel 's mid-ocean raid .
Aid groups have warned of a looming humanitarian disaster in Gaza , home to some1.5 million Palestinians , as a result of Israeli and Egyptian restrictions on imports .
Israel says its embargo on the Strip , imposed after Hamas siezed power in a bloody coup in 2007 , is aimed at preventing weapons from reaching the Iranian - backed Islamists , who have refused peace initiatives with Israel .
Christina Lais , who lives across the street from where
, was smoking a cigarette and talking with her father when she first heard sirens .
Lais told her father , who was opening an early Father 's Day gift , that she had to hang up , then began recording the incident using her iPhone .
The Oregonian obtained exclusive raw footage of the incident .
Above is the video , which contains violent content and some graphic language ; here is Lais ' account :
Lais watched as a patrol car pulled over a sedan about 6:20 p.m. less than 50 feet away from where her home sits at the northeast corner of Northeast Halsey Street and Sixth Avenue .
An officer got out of the car and told the driver to " put his hands on his head , " she said .
Two more unmarked police cars pulled up and boxed the sedan in .
Four officers approached it from all sides with Tasers at the ready , she said .
" There 's some arguing , and they tase him and then he 's shouting back something , and there 's a lot of shouting back and forth , " she said .
" Then I hear one or two gunshots , and then there was just a whole slew of shots . "
Lais ducked below a windowsill , then propped her cell phone on a wall and continued to film .
When the shooting stopped , the man " was now halfway out of the car , just kind of slumped into the gutter . "
Lais could see his gray hoodie .
" The officers shot two bean bags at him , and they were asking him to do something like show his hands .
He was totally motionless .
He was n't moving at all , " she said .
" After some time the officers came up to him and , I guess , assessed that he did n't have the gun anymore , so they picked him up by his clothing and plopped him down on the sidewalk . "
Lais , who hails from Torrance , Calif. , has lived at the old house in the middle of newer construction in the Lloyd District for about two years .
She said she was confused when the man did n't immediately receive medical attention .
" I did n't understand , " she said .
" They just kind of left him there .
After some time the paramedics arrived and checked his vitals , and you could see all the police officers kind of look at each other and shrug .
That 's when I knew that he was dead . "

Israeli interrogators tortured a Palestinian child who was detained and sent to a detention center close to a settlement near Hebron .
The child said that the interrogators used electricity in torturing him by attaching wires to his testicles .
Human Rights Commissioner in the Palestinian Territories , based in Gaza , Kiert Jorneg , stated that Israeli interrogators used wires and a battery when torturing the child by wiring his testis .
He added that the child , 15 , was kidnapped by the army in the southern West Bank city of Hebron a month ago after the soldiers claimed he hurled stones at their vehicle .
The child was kicked and beaten by the soldiers all the way until they moved him to a detention center where the interrogation and torture continued as the interrogators were trying to force him to confess that he hurled stones at the military vehicles .
He denied the interrogators ’ claims and said that he was kidnapped from the street without even knowing why was he being detained .
After beating the child , torturing him and failing to achieve a “ confession ” , the interrogators used electricity as a means of torture .
Yet , he refused to confess to something he did not commit .
The interrogators brought a battery , likely a car battery , and attached wires to his testis .
One of the interrogators even told him that after they are done with him “ he will never be able to become a father ” .
The interrogator then attached wires to the testis of the child who was bound to a chair , and used electricity an issue that forced the child to tell the interrogator that he “ will confess to anything he wants ” .
Pat statements about Britain's " Christian heritage " trip easily from the lips of Christians and non-Christians alike and these claims can sometimes be ludicrously expansive .
I am used to sitting on a panel with some bishop or other to be informed that – although it may surprise me – democracy , volunteering , human rights , justice , the rule of law , freedom , equality , schools and hospitals are all artefacts of our Christian heritage .
And motherhood .
And apple pie .
No one can deny that Christianity has had an effect on our national culture .
But there are obvious and serious flaws in such an account of British history ( Christian opposition in Britain to many of these " good things " in the past for example , or the fact that pre-Christian and non-Christian societies seem to have achieved many if not all of these advances at various times without the spur of a belief in Jesus ) .
It 's a useful corrective to this overweening narrative that the theme of this year 's Humanist Week is " humanist heritage " .
Men and women with humanist views have made a massive contribution to our national life and society .
Did you know that the first heads of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation , UN World Health Organisation , and UN Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organisation were all humanists ?
EM
Forster is famous for his novels and the sumptuous Merchant Ivory adaptations of them , but did you know he was a lifelong humanist activist as well ?
The humanist Bertrand Russell is as well known as a campaigner for peace and social justice ; less known are such humanist campaigners as 20th century anti-racism activist and advocate of Indian independence Fenner Brockway or Annie Besant , 19th - century campaigner against poverty and for contraception .
Humanists who have made significant contributions to British science range from Charles Darwin to Brian Cox , Richard Dawkins to David King .
But humanists in Britain have also made rich contributions to our artistic and literary heritage ( think Thomas Hardy , John Fowles , George Eliot , Harold Pinter , Anish Kapoor ) and to our intellectual heritage ( Amartya Sen , A J Ayer , Karl Popper ) .
Humanists from John Stuart Mill ( anti-racist and pioneering feminist as well as the father of modern liberalism ) to John Maynard Keynes to Clement Attlee demonstrate the beneficial influence of humanists on our political and social life .
Individual humanists have been in the forefront of life - improving developments in British science , politics , social policy , and charity in Britain .
But we can celebrate not just people , but organisations too .
Humanist organisations in the 19th - century pioneered housing and education projects and , in the 20th century , non-directive counselling .
They ran housing associations and adoption agencies .
This work continues today with humanist projects in Africa and India for education and the relief of poverty and in the provision of ceremonies such as funerals , attended by over 250,000 people in the UK each year and millions worldwide – a real service to the community .
This contemporary social action , support and work for the common good is backed up by a long British humanist heritage and we should all – humanist and non-humanist – be proud of this important strand in our shared history .

Suddenly , cameras are everywhere .
As this month 's cover story notes , the recent boom in video monitoring -- by both the state and businesses -- means we 're all being watched .
It 's like something out of George Orwell 's 1984 .
Except that , unlike Orwell 's protagonist Winston Smith , we can watch back -- and plenty of people are doing just that .
Which makes a difference .
The widespread installation of recording devices is not all bad : ATM cameras helped prove that Duke students accused of rape could n't have committed the crime .
And we all sympathize with the goals of preventing terrorism and crime , though it is not proven that security cameras accomplish this .
Nonetheless , the trend toward constant surveillance is troubling .
And even if the public became concerned enough to pass laws limiting the practice , it 's not clear how well those laws would work .
Government officials and private companies too often ignore privacy laws .
( In a notorious recent case , Hewlett - Packard executives were caught spying on the phone records of reporters covering the company . )
Besides , the technology of surveillance is becoming so advanced -- biologists are now attaching tiny cameras to crows ' tail feathers to observe the birds ' tool use in the wild -- that in reality there 's not much we can do to ensure privacy anyway .
Maybe that does n't matter .
Privacy is a recent phenom­enon .
For most of human history , people lived in small tribes or villages where everyone knew everyone else 's business .
Ubiquitous surveillance may be just a case of the past as prologue .
There 's a difference , though .
In the old days , ordinary people did n't have much privacy , but neither did big shots .
By contrast , today 's government officials and big corporations often want to watch us , but they do n't want to be watched in return .
Shopping malls are full of security cameras , but many have signs at the entrance telling customers that no photography or video recording is allowed .
Police cars have dashboard cameras , cities and counties are posting red- light and speed - limit cameras , and it seems that the dream of many government officials is to put every public space under 24 - hour video watch .
But try shooting photos or video of police or ­other public officials as they go about their business and you might find yourself in wrist restraints .
In recent months such cases have been piling up .
Brian Kelly of Carlisle , Pa. , was a passenger in his friend 's car when the police pulled the vehicle over for speeding .
When Kelly began videotaping , he was arrested and charged with violating a state wiretap statute and thrown in jail overnight .
Charges were dropped when the district attorney recognized that recording police in public is n't much like wiretapping .
In addition , the DA said that the police had no expectation of privacy when they themselves were recording the incident .
Michael Gannon , of Nashua , N.H. , faced similar charges when he used a front - door security camera to record what he considered to be overly aggressive behavior by a detective .
The charges against Gannon were dropped .
That 's the eventual outcome in most such cases , though sometimes photographs and video are lost in the process .
Of course , it 's understandable that police might be skittish .
Ever since the Rodney King case , police have known that video images -- whether recorded by citizens or by the authorities themselves -- can provoke controversy .
With video technology spreading so rapidly , such images are coming to light more often .
In October 2007 , an elite unit of the Chicago Police Department was disbanded after video emerged of its members shaking down barroom customers .
A policeman in Puerto Rico is under FBI investigation because video -- uploaded to YouTube -- apparently shows him executing an unarmed man .
And a Baltimore woman recently won a $ 180,000 false arrest and imprisonment lawsuit based on police videotape evidence that confirmed a different but similarly dressed woman was the one buying drugs .
Supporters of widespread surveillance often argue , " If you 're obeying the law , you have nothing to fear . "
Why should n't the same go for police officers ?
The cases above all involve accusations of extreme misconduct or errors on the part of police .
Let 's hope those are rare .
Far more common , I suspect , are cases where the existence of a video record helps protect honest cops from false charges .
The " do n't Tase me , bro " case became a YouTube sensation after footage emerged of University of Florida police using a Taser on an obstreperous student .
But ultimately that same footage was instrumental in clearing the officers of charges of wrongdoing .
Under the law , citizens have no right not to be photographed in public places .
So why should people who make their living on the taxpayers ' dime enjoy greater freedom from public scrutiny than the taxpayers themselves ?
Civil liberties groups have begun supporting the trend toward a video - enabled populace .
The Eastern Missouri chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union sends out volunteers with cameras , though they have faced police hostility at times .
Over the long haul , such efforts may be superfluous .
The widespread availability of digital cameras and video - capable cellphones means that ubiquitous surveillance on the part of the little guys is moving , if anything , even faster than ubiquitous surveillance on the part of the big boys .
And distribution tools like YouTube make it easier to get the footage to a large audience .
I think that 's a good thing .
Today 's pervasive surveillance may seem like something out of 1984 , but access to technology has become a lot more democratic since Orwell 's time .
Big Brother had a network of security cameras , but could that oppressive regime have survived a network of cellphones ?

Unrest in Central Asia ' Kyrgyzstan Is On the Brink of Collapse '
With hundreds dead and tens of thousands of refugees , ethnic violence has brought chaos to Kyrgyzstan .
Central Asia policy expert Andrea Schmitz told SPIEGEL ONLINE about the history behind the attacks on the Uzbek minority and the wobbly transitional government .
NYT :
VENICE , La. —
As Louisiana state and local officials continue to hammer BP and the federal agencies responding to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , repeatedly threatening to “ take matters into our own hands ” if the response falls short , BP said Monday morning that it was further delaying its next attempt to shut off the leak .
The oil company has been planning to attempt a procedure known as a top kill , in which heavy fluid would be pumped into the well .
Doug Suttles , chief operating officer for exploration and production , said in an interview on NBC on Monday morning that the top kill would be attempted Wednesday morning .
BP had previously said it hoped to execute the procedure on Tuesday .
Introduction
We ’ve covered custom ROMs a few times before on Android Police , telling you how and why you may want to try them out on your own Android device .
If you want to install a custom ROM onto your phone , but do n’t know which one to go for , you may want to consider Cyanogen , which is compatible with the HTC Dream , Magic , Nexus One and Motorola Droid .
I ’ve been testing the CyanogenMod for the past few weeks , and have found it to be extremely stable , whilst adding numerous features that ca n’t be found on the stock version of Android 2.1 .
Although Cyanogen is available for several devices , this review is based on Cyanogen 5.0.6 running on the Nexus One .
There may be slight differences in the build and performance of the ROM , such as the availability of Live Wallpapers , but they share a lot of similarities .
Although Cyanogen is available for several devices , this review is based on Cyanogen 5.0.6 running on the Nexus One .
There may be slight differences in the build and performance of the ROM , such as the availability of Live Wallpapers , but they share a lot of similarities .
Installation
If you ’ve already rooted your Nexus One , then installing the custom Cyanogen ROM could not be much simpler .
Simply boot in to recovery mode by holding down the trackball whilst powering on your phone .
If your phone is rooted , you ’ll see a line of text highlighted in pink at the top of screen saying “ UNLOCKED ” .
If you do n’t see this , then you need to root your phone before going any further .
Once your phone is rooted , there are a few ways you can install Cyanogen .
First , you ’ll need to download the latest image , which is available from the Cyanogen Mod forum .
The simplest way to install the image is to use an app from the Market called ROM Manager , which will allow you to back up , restore and flash new ROMs on to your phone .
You can find a full tutorial on using ROM Manager here .
Review
Performance
At first boot , Cyanogen takes a while to load , but after this I found boot times to be quicker than the stock Android 2.1 ROM !
General performance of the Nexus One also seemed to be better under Cyanogen , with no lag whatsoever when navigating around the OS .
Admittedly , the performance of the Nexus One was great already , with the Snapdragon CPU , but I can still see a difference when using Cyanogen .
Modifications
The thing that is great about Cyanogen ’s Mod is that it simply perfects a stock ROM which is already nice to use .
At first glance , there are n’t a lot of changes from Google ’s ROM , but small changes and tweaks have been made that provide some great improvements .
The minor aesthetic modifications are immediately recognizable .
The boot animation has been modified , transforming into a cyan color .
Once the phone has booted , you may also notice the slight change to the notification bar , which now curves at the top corners .
When the notification bar is dragged down , it appears transparent , which is a nice touch .
When viewing the status of your network connection , you ’re given more detail in the notification bar .
The stock 2.1 ROM simply uses “ 3 G ” , but with the Cyanogen Mod installed , it distinguishes between 3G and HSPA , so you always know whether you have a high - speed connection .
This has proved priceless when I ’ve been downloading files on - the - go , as I can see at a glance how long transfers are going to take , or how fast I can browse the web .
If you have as many applications as I do , you ’ll also appreciate the option of having up to five icons in a row on the app launcher , as opposed to four .
I ’ve quickly gotten used to having more icons being displayed , and use five icons per row by default .
Like many of the additions , you can choose whether or not to enable this in the settings .
Another modification I could n’t do without is the ability to change orientation settings .
Previously , the display would only rotate when the phone was turned to the left .
In Cyanogen , you can choose whether to keep this setting as default , or change it so that the phone ’s display rotates at either 270 or 360 degrees .
Choosing 270 degrees will allow you to rotate your phone right and left to change the orientation of the display , whereas choosing 360 degrees enables the display to appear upside down too .
Alternatively , you can turn orientation switching off altogether .
A small change has also been made to the ‘ Phone options ’ menu , which appears when you press the power button on the top of the device .
All the previous options are still present , allowing you to toggle silent and airplane mode as well as power off the phone .
In addition to this , you ’ll also find a ‘ Reboot phone ’ option , which allows you to reboot instead of shutting down and manually turning the phone back on yourself .
The final , and arguably most useful , addition to be found in Cyanogen ’s Mod is the utilization of the multi-color LED trackball .
The stock ROM uses only one color to alert users to notifications that are waiting , which means that you have to look at your phone to see what notification is waiting for you .
With Cyanogen ’s Mod , you can choose for different notifications to be signaled in different colors of your choice .
It 's always the first thing that I tell people about when encouraging them to try out Cyanogen .
Bundled Applications
In addition to the numerous modifications that are made to the OS , you ’ll also notice that you have a few extra applications available to you .
USB Tether
USB
Tether allows you to tether your phone with your PC without any additional applications or configuration .
Once you ’ve activated it by going to Settings >
Wireless & networks , and enabling ‘ Internet Tethering ’ , you ’re good to go .
Everything worked without a problem on my Windows 7 laptop , although Windows XP needed a little more help .
After installing the correct drivers for XP , everything was plain sailing .
Terminal Emulator
For those of you wanting to work your magic on a Linux terminal , the Terminal Emulator gives you full access to a plethora of commands .
Admittedly , I ’m not the most experienced user when it comes to Linux terminals , but I ’m sure someone out there can do something interesting with it !
Dev Tools is a great tool for people developing apps for Android , providing a CPU usage display and showing active processes amongst other things .
It was previously only available on the Android SDK , but its inclusion in Cyanogen ’s Mod makes it super easy for any developer to use on their phone too .
Superuser Permissions
With a rooted phone , you can use apps which require elevated ( superuser ) permissions .
CyanogenMod contains a utility called Superuser Permissions , which allows you a more fine grained control over which apps are allowed to use root and which are not .
Additionally , you can keep an eye on which apps you 've approved or denied in the past .
Drawbacks
I must admit , I ’ve struggled to find a great deal of drawbacks to using the CyanogenMod , with all its increases in performance and improvements to user experience .
However , if you install the CyanogenMod ROM , you may notice that a few things are missing .
Due to legal reasons , all of Google ’s own applications , including the Market , are n’t included .
To install these , you ’ll have to download and flash an additional image over CyanogenMod .
Once this has been done , you ’ll have a phone running a custom ROM with all of Google ’s own applications too .
Of course , a drawback for some less adventurous users will be the fact that you have to root the phone first , and then install something custom over the stock OS , which may seem scary .
In the end , however , it is all worth it .
Another thing worth mentioning is that you have to do a full wipe during the initial installation , so make sure to back up your data .
Subsequent updates are installed without the need for wiping .
Conclusion
Cyanogen ’s
Mod is one of the best available for HTC Dream , Magic , Nexus One , and Motorola Droid users .
If you have n’t used it before , I would strongly recommend that you try it out .
With a regular update schedule and a great community on hand to give you advice , you have no excuse not to .

The defense budget for fiscal year 2011 will reach 1.65 trillion dollars , setting a new record , whereas austerity is the rule for most other budget items .
President Barack Obama is keeping his promises : the commitment made by the White House in 2009 not to limit military expenses will be observed .
Never has the defense budget been so heavily padded : it will exceed total U.S. expenditures on defense during World War II .
The federal budget for fiscal year 2011 , which Congress is to vote on October 1st , will amount to 3 trillion dollars ( 2.3 trillion euros ) , not counting the amounts raised to finance basic retirement pensions .
Whereas the sum dedicated by the federal government to education only represents 2 % of expenses , 53 % of federal tax income , around 1.6 trillion dollars ( 1.25 trillion euros ) will be dedicated to military expenditures , according to Information Clearing House , a progressive U.S. website . ( 1 )
The sum includes the 717 billion dollars requested by the Pentagon , to which must be added a 200 - billion - dollar credit to finance what the White House euphemistically terms “ overseas contingency funding ” – in plain English , the Iraq and Afghanistan wars .
Plus 40 billion dollars for “ black box ” intelligence agency funding .
Another 94 billion dollars for military activities funded through NASA , the State Department , and the Department of Homeland Security , etc. $ 123 billion will be dedicated to veterans ’ benefits and health care spending , while $ 400 billion are foreseen for interest on debt raised to pay for “ prior wars . ”
In constant dollars , this is the biggest military budget the United States has ever seen .
According to the War Resisters League , in 2009 US military spending accounted for 47 % of all money spent on “ defense ” by all of the countries on the planet .
To this , one must still add in the military expenses of United States traditional allies .
In comparison , China dedicates 130 billion dollars to the military sector and Russia spends 80 billion dollars a year .

The MBA reports a record 14.69 percent of mortgage loans were either one payment delinquent or in the foreclosure process in Q1 2010 ( seasonally adjusted ) .
From the MBA : Delinquencies , Foreclosure Starts Fall in Latest MBA National Delinquency Survey
The delinquency rate for mortgage loans on one - to - four - unit
residential properties increased to a seasonally adjusted rate of 10.06 percent of all loans outstanding as of the end of the first quarter of 2010 , an increase of 59 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2009 , and up 94 basis points from one year ago , according to the Mortgage Bankers Association ’s ( MBA ) National Delinquency Survey .
The non-seasonally adjusted delinquency rate decreased 106 basis points from 10.44 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 to 9.38 percent this quarter .
The percentage of loans on which foreclosure actions were started during the first quarter was 1.23 percent , up three basis points from last quarter but down 14 basis points from one year ago .
The delinquency rate includes loans that are at least one payment past due but does not include loans in the process of foreclosure .
The percentage of loans in the foreclosure process at the end of the first quarter was 4.63 percent , an increase of five basis points from the fourth quarter of 2009 and 78 basis points from one year ago .
This represents another record high .
The combined percentage of loans in foreclosure or at least one payment past due was 14.01 percent on a non-seasonally adjusted basis , a decline from 15.02 percent last quarter .
The serious delinquency rate , the percentage of loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the process of foreclosure , was 9.54 percent , a decrease of 13 basis points from last quarter , but an increase of 230 basis points from the first quarter of last year .
Although this is a new record , Jay Brinkmann , MBA ’s chief economist added a caution on the seasonal adjustment ( see press release ) .
I 'll have notes from the conference call and graphs soon .
To whom it may concern :
Please stop using your blog to prove how smart you are .
I know that you are brilliant .
I see the PhD behind your name .
I understand your work is serious and the world needs to know just how complex the problem is and what you are doing to fix it .
The thing is , your blog is not the place to tell me about it .
I read your blog over my lunch hour , or with my morning coffee , or when I need a break from a difficult problem at work .
When you write giant swaths of text with acronyms I do n’t know and complex sentence structure , my eyes slide off your words and I am forced to go look at pictures of sleeping kittens .
It ’s not that I do n’t care , or even that there is n’t a place for the detailed analysis .
I ’m just asking that you give me a chance to get to know you before we get into the deep stuff .
Let ’s start with a nice success story that includes pictures of happy kids you helped this month .
What about a behind - the - scenes piece about what really goes on in the rehearsal hall ?
Even a list of all the great things you could do if I send money is better than what I can only imagine is recycled bits of your dissertation .
It turns out ( on your blog at least ) the super dense , scholarly articles do n’t make me trust you more , or remind me of how dire the problem is – they make me feel like there is no room for me in your organization .
They do n’t make me want to learn more , they make me leave .
I believe in you and I believe in your cause .
I want to support you and yes , I want to read your blog .
Just give me an opening *.
Love ,

A Phoenix Maryvale Precinct patrol officer faces multiple felony charges after an investigation revealed he was stealing from drug dealers , the police department announced Friday .
James Wren , 23 , who joined Phoenix police two years ago , was arrested late Thursday as part of an undercover sting .
He was booked on suspicion of conspiracy , attempted theft , attempted money laundering and aiding a criminal syndicate .
Prior to Thursday 's sting , Wren is believed to have taken nearly $ 40,000 in drug cash in two cases since 2008 .
He resigned Thursday after admitting to involvement in three incidents , according to police .
Wren is accused of working with friends from outside the police department to divvy up the money after making unreported traffic stops on couriers , who he would rob of drug money and release without making an arrest , police said .
No other officers are believed to be involved , though Wren is accused of stealing from drug dealers on duty while in uniform and in a fully - marked city patrol vehicle .
Investigators learned about the heists through a drug dealer arrested last week by Avondale police in an unrelated case , police said .
Internal affairs detectives worked with others from drug- enforcement and SWAT to arrest Wren during a sting .
Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris said
Wren 's actions " shamed the police department , the badge and the profession . "
He credited his department for arresting Wren within one week of learning about his involvement in " drug money rip offs from others involved in the narcotics business . "
Harris , a Maryvale native who began his career patrolling west Phoenix , said he recalled a drug - enforcement officer who faced charges nearly 10 years ago in a similar investigation , though such cases of misconduct are rare .
" I think this is all positive from the perspective that it shows that our policies and procedures are very appropriate , and that we take immediate action when something like this happens , " Harris said .
" To put together a complex investigation like this and bring this person to justice in just seven days , I think is indicative of how our department upholds our standards . "
Harris added that investigators found little in Wren 's background check and hiring process that showed any indication of being prone to misconduct .
The people Wren is accused of conspiring with included people he knew before becoming a police officer .
However , police said no further arrests were planned .
On Thursday , investigators baited Wren into a traffic stop where he was tempted with $ 40,000 of what he believed to be drug money for an upcoming transaction , according to investigators .
Wren made the traffic stop in the 6300 block of West McDowell Road before he became suspicious , disengaged , and drove to a Laveen police precinct where he was arrested , police said .
The officer is not accused of stealing drugs .
Phoenix police Sgt. Tommy Thompson , a department spokesman , said Wren 's aim was " not to arrest , not to impound the money , but to take the money for personal gain . "
Wren comes from a law enforcement family .
His father is a retired Phoenix police sergeant and has three other family members , both civilian and sworn , employed by the department .
Four New York University students have a vision to build Diaspora , " an open source personal web service that will put individuals in control of their data , " or essentially the anti-Facebook .
They started with just a dream and a prayer — that prayer was to raise $ 10,000 by June 1 so that they could spend the summer making their vision a reality .
They reached that goal in just 12 days .
Now , still more than two weeks away from their deadline , the team of programmers has already broke $ 100,000 , collected via the fundraising platform Kickstarter .
Team Diaspora — college kids Daniel Grippi , Maxwell Salzberg , Ilya Zhitomirskiy and Raphael Sofaer — believe that sharing information online and maintaining one 's privacy should not have to be mutually exclusive .
What they set out to build is a network that allows everyone to install their own " seed " — i.e. a personal web server with a user 's photos , videos and everything else — within the larger network .
That seed would be fully owned and controlled by the user , so the user could share anything and still maintain ownership over it .
What it looks like remains to be seen , but this answer to current Facebook culture has a hit nerve with the more than 2,300 individuals who have agreed to back the company with as little as five bucks .
Now that the guys have reached their goal , we expect them to fulfill their promise and forgo all fun this summer to build their pet project .
In a few months time we should see what $ 100,000 and a powerful vision can produce .

Seventeen persons , including nine police personnel , were injured when two low - intensity IEDs went off outside the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium ahead of the IPL match between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Mumbai Indians here on Saturday afternoon .
The police found a third device with 3.2 kg of explosive material , a timer and a battery , at Gate 8 when the match was in progress , and defused it .
The blasts caused by the improvised explosive devices surprisingly caused little panic among the spectators who had packed the stadium to capacity to watch the last league match here .
However , the match , scheduled to start at 4 p.m. , began an hour late .
One of the IEDs went off around 3.15 p.m. at Gate 12 on Cubbon Road , where hundreds of spectators had gathered to enter the stadium .
Fifteen minutes later , the other explosion took place on the footpath in front of the State Police Wireless headquarters near the Anil Kumble Circle , close to the stadium .
Reports indicated that the police defused the third explosive at Gate 8 on Queen 's Road around 7.30 p.m .
“ We were all jolted by a loud blast and people ran helter - skelter .
There were more than 500 people in front of Gate 12 and adjacent Gate 11 , ” said Zabeeulla , a water vendor in front of Gate 12 .
The authorities immediately closed the two gates , and shifted the injured to hospital , he said .
The first IED , wrapped in newspapers and plastic sheets , was placed on a six - foot - high compound wall adjacent to Gate 12 .
The protective tin sheets on the wall , a flex banner and a portion of the wall were ripped apart .
The second explosive , kept hidden in a shrub near the Anil Kumble Circle , did not cause any damage .
Police Commissioner Shankar M. Bidari said the decision to go ahead with the match was taken as about 20,000 spectators were already in the stadium , and anti-sabotage checks had been conducted inside .
Two cases have been registered .
Most likely you are surprised that such a thing exists .
You are not alone .
When I discovered Playboy in Braille years ago , it was in a box in an abandoned building .
I found myself in a state of disbelief .
The kind you feel when you ’re being chased by a leprechaun with a crossbow .
It ’s normal to not want Playboy in Braille to exist .
Because it ’s weird .
It raises too many questions .
Questions like :
Why is the government printing Playboy in Braille ?
And :
How do you explain a naked woman to a pubescent , visually impaired teen ?
“ Elka leans against a wall , wearing only a carpenter ’s tool belt .
She ’s hot .
Believe me . ”
“ Katsumi arches unnaturally over a coffee table .
You can see the whole thing . ”
“ Anja ’s Mediterranean skin is a warm brown , like the craft paper Playboy you ’re reading with your finger . ”
Playboy in Braille makes you think .
It ’s exciting but uncomfortable at the same time .
Like Courtney
Love fixing your stove .
Run your fingers over the pages , never really knowing if you ’re touching a gorgeous blonde or an essay by Tom Clancy .
Was that Cindy Crawford ’s bum , or an interview with Gore Vidal ?
Frankly , it ’s whatever you want it to be .
That ’s the glory of Playboy in Braille .
November 1995 .
Volume XLII , No. 11 .
It ’s number 2 in a 4 part series .
I do n’t know where the other parts are , but you ’d only miss them if you could read Braille .
And you can ’t , because you ’re reading this .
This would be a terrible gift for the visually impaired , because you do n’t give the visually impaired one quarter of a decade - old Playboy as a gift .
But for you ?
Put it out on the coffee table like I did .
Owning Playboy in Braille is like having a Day - Glo orange monkey that can curse in Farsi .
It gets attention .
People talk .
You want Playboy in Braille .
Playboy in Braille wants you .
At least that ’s what I think it says .
