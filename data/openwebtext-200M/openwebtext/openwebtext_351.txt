" Incroyable ! "
En quittant l'hémicycle , mercredi 2 avril , peu après minuit , le député socialiste de Dordogne Germinal Peiro est encore sous le coup de l'émotion .
Après plusieurs heures de débats houleux sur le projet de loi sur les OGM , marqués par de multiples invectives entre la droite et la gauche , l'Assemblée nationale vient d'adopter un amendement de l'opposition , défendu par le député communiste du Puy - de - Dôme André Chassaigne .
Placé au début du texte , il en modifie fortement l'équilibre .
Il indique en effet que les plantes transgéniques ne peuvent être cultivées que dans le respect " des structures agricoles , des écosystèmes locaux , et des filières de production et commerciales qualifiées ' sans organismes génétiquement modifiés ' , et en toute transparence " .
L'amendement a été voté par les élus socialistes , communistes et Verts , mais aussi par quatre élus de la majorité , qui ont fait basculer l'Assemblée .
Le projet du gouvernement stipulait seulement que la culture des OGM devait avoir lieu " dans le respect de l'environnement et de la santé publique " .
Depuis mardi 1er avril , date du début du débat sur le projet de loi , dont l'objectif est de fixer un cadre à long terme pour la coexistence des filières sur le territoire , les élus de l'opposition n'ont cessé de mettre en garde contre la menace que représentent , à leurs yeux , les cultures OGM sur les filières agricoles de qualité ( AOC , labels , agriculture biologique ) , du fait de la dissémination des pollens dans l'environnement .
" VICTOIRE POLITIQUE "
L'adoption de cet amendement représente " une avancée fondamentale pour le respect des cultures sans OGM " , car il donne une base juridique pour exclure les OGM de certaines zones du territoire , ont souligné les élus socialistes .
L'opposition revendique une " victoire politique " .
Au cours du débat , le rapporteur du texte , Antoine Herth ( UMP , Bas - Rhin ) s'est plusieurs fois opposé à des amendements qui visaient le même objectif , au nom du respect de la réglementation communautaire .
Le projet de loi transpose en effet une directive européenne de 2001 , qui fixe les principes du libre choix des agriculteurs de cultiver ou non des OGM , et interdit de déclarer des zones " sans OGM " au nom du respect de cette liberté .
" Nous avons la volonté de rester le plus près possible de la réglementation communautaire , a expliqué M. Herth .
Décider d'exclure les OGM de zones entières n'est pas possible , mais les démarches volontaires le sont . "
En revanche , la secrétaire d'Etat à l'écologie Nathalie Kosciusko - Morizet s'est démarquée de cette position , et s'en est remise à la " sagesse " de l'Assemblée , laissant aux députés la liberté de leur vote , lors de la discussion sur un amendement identique à celui défendu par M. Chassaigne , présenté par le député UMP du Puy - de - Dôme Louis Giscard d'Estaing .
Si M. Giscard d'Estaing a fini par retirer son amendement , à la demande du rapporteur , celui de M. Chassaigne a été maintenu et adopté , le vote déclenchant une explosion de joie sur les bancs de l'opposition .
L'épisode témoigne une nouvelle fois des tensions entre les ministres , Jean - Louis Borloo et Nathalie Kosciusko - Morizet , et la majorité UMP à propos des OGM .
La position de la secrétaire d'Etat lui a valu les foudres du président de la commission des affaires économiques Patrick Ollier et du député UMP de la Seine - et - Marne Christian Jacob , favorables aux biotechnologies , lors des suspensions de séance .
Il démontre également l'inquiétude de certains élus UMP devant les OGM .
Plusieurs députés de droite ayant voté l'amendement sont des élus de zones de montagne , où l'agriculture sous signe de qualité représente un poids économique et culturel important .
" Nous sommes en première lecture , le texte peut encore évoluer , déclarait l'un de ces élus , Martial Saddier ( UMP , Haute - Savoie ) à la sortie de l'hémicycle .
Mais nous avons soulevé une question importante qui doit ê tre traitée . "
" Il y a eu un peu de confusion , ce n'est pas un drame , on va corriger cela " , commentait de son côté M. Jacob .

When I visit digg , I most often get ads for shoes available at Cole Haan and Nine West .
Incidentally , I happen to like shoes from those retailers , and although I do n't really need to buy new shoes , I find myself clicking through on occasion to see what 's goin ' on in the world of overpriced footwear .
One could say I 'm the perfect victim for targeted advertising , and I would agree .
These days , the only Internet users who are n't aware that some of their activities are being tracked and used for marketing purposes are those who just joined yesterday .
In fact , almost three - quarters of those surveyed by TNS Global on behalf of consumer privacy organization TRUSTe said that they are aware that their browsing history " may be collected " for advertising purposes .
They 're not necessarily happy about it , though , and almost all have indicated that they would like to have more of a say in how their information is used .
TNS randomly selected 1,015 nationally representative adults in the US " whose households belong to TNS 's online consumer panel " for its survey .
Although only 40 percent of the group was familiar with the term " behavioral targeting , " most users were well aware of the practice .
57 percent reported that they were n't comfortable their activities tracked for advertising purposes , even if the information could n't be tied to their names or real - life identities .
Shocking !
A Cole Haan ad , again
Simultaneously , 72 percent of those surveyed said that they find online advertising annoying when the ads are not relevant to their needs , and 87 percent of the group said that under a quarter of ads are well - targeted towards them .
58 percent said that zero to 10 percent of ads are well - targeted .
TRUSTe notes that this attitude presents a conundrum for advertisers , who are simultaneously being told that consumers want to see more relevant ads but do n't want to have their activities tracked in order to make those ads relevant .
" [ N ] o matter how much we assure anonymity , there is still significant discomfort with the idea of tracking , " TRUSTe executive director Fran Maier said in a statement .
" We have a solid indication that consumers want us to find a way to get them the advertising that is relevant to them .
In order to do this , behavioral targeting is one of the most promising methods , but at the very least , it has to be made more transparent , provide choices , and deliver real value . "
In fact , an overwhelming majority ( 91 percent ) of the respondents said that they would be willing to act in one way or another to help ensure better privacy when it comes to targeted advertising if presented with the proper tools .
64 percent said that they would willingly view ads from a list of online stores and brands that they know , and 44 percent said that they would " click buttons or icons to make that happen . "
On the flip side , another 42 percent said that they would opt out of any and all tracking if they could , even if they had to view ads that were n't as relevant to them .
TRUSTe believes that education is the key to striking a balance between behavioral targeting and privacy , although the organization does not go into detail about what that education would entail .
Still , given the level of scrutiny that behaviorally targeted advertising has gotten over the last few years , more transparency on the part of marketers could go a long way in smoothing over relations with the customers they hope to woo .

A Political Prisoner : The Don Siegelman Case :
By Ernest Partridge
Today , Don Siegelman , former governor of the state of Alabama , sits in a federal prison , sentenced to a seven year term for bribery .
Every day that Siegelman remains in prison every American citizen who openly dissents from the policies and protests the criminality of the Bush / Cheney regime is less free and more vulnerable to politically motivated prosecution .
For the plain fact of the matter is that Don Siegelman is , in effect , a political prisoner .
The formal charge against him was bribery .
But , practically speaking , his offense was his political success as a Democrat in a “ red ” Republican state .
When Siegelman indicated an interest in reviving his political career , one of his accusers was heard to say , “ [ We ’re ] going to take care of Siegelman . ”
And so they did .
Larisa Alexandrovna , one of the few journalists to investigate this case in depth , writes :
For most Americans , the very concept of political prisoners is remote and exotic , a practice that is associated with third - world dictatorships but is foreign to the American tradition .
The idea that a prominent politician “ “ a former state governor “ “ could be tried on charges that many observers consider to be trumped - up , convicted in a trial that involved numerous questionable procedures , and then hauled off to prison in shackles immediately upon sentencing would be almost unbelievable .
Less “ unbelievable , ” perhaps , if we reflect upon a dominant Republican mind - set : politics as warfare , the Democrats as “ evil ” and “ the enemy , ” and not as “ the loyal opposition . ”
“ You are either with us or with the terrorists , ” said George Bush — no compromise , no alternatives , and no middle ground .
Thus the goal of the GOP warrior is not merely to defeat the Democrats ; the goal is to destroy them .
This was the objective of those who brought charges against Don Siegelman , in a case that stinks from top to bottom of political vendetta and manipulation .
It ’s a rather complicated story , which I can not recount in detail here .
Those details may be found in the Raw Story ( Alexandrovna et al ) series and the DemocracyNow Scott Horton interview , listed and linked below .
However , these are the essential elements :
The bribery charge rose out of Siegelman ’s appointment of Richard Scrushy to the Alabama hospital regulatory board , a non-paying position that Scrusky had held under two previous governors .
The appointment followed Scrushy ’s donation of a half million dollars to a Siegelman foundation and gained Siegelman no financial advantage whatever .
Of course , political favors to donors is routine in both state an federal government , as numerous ambassadorial appointments will testify .
Moreover , clearly illegal campaign contributions were received by Alabama Republican Senator Jeff Sessions and Federal Judge William Pryor , who have not been investigated much less prosecuted .
Siegelman held the distinction of serving all four elective state offices : Attorney General , Secretary of State , Lieutenant Governor and Governor .
With his prestige , popularity , and name - recognition , he was a persistent threat to the well - oiled Alabama GOP political machine .
As his daughter , Dana , describes it ,
The men and women behind this conspiracy have a lot against my dad .
My dad wanted an education lottery , brought jobs to the state , made big businesses pay their taxes , sought to completely change Alabama ’s constitution , raised teachers ’ salaries , gave African Americans jobs that Caucasians had supremacy over for years , helped in fundraisers for other Democrats , supported the arts , was well - respected on a national level , etc …
It was a battle against a truly liberal leader , not some moderate Democrat .
He held the highest offices in the state and was Alabama ’s longest running politician .
Republicans wanted their state back , and they got it .
“ They got it ”  through a stolen election .
In 2002 , Siegelman appeared to have won re-election against Republican challenger Bob Riley .
But then , in Baldwin county , Republican election supervisors ( no Democrats allowed ) , locked the doors and “ discovered ”  a “ computer glitch ”  that tilted the election to Riley , whereupon the GOP Attorney General , William Pryor , put the kibosh on Siegelman ’s appeal for a recount by sealing the ballots .
( Siegelman gives his account of the theft here ) .
While Siegelman vowed “ to come back and fight another day , ”  the GOP was determined to see to it that he was at last down for the count .
Enter Bill Canary , Republican kingmaker , friend and confidant of Karl Rove , campaign advisor to William Pryor and Bob Riley , and , not coincidentally , husband of U.S. Attorney , Leura Canary .
It was Mrs. Canary , along with U.S. Attorney Alice Martin , who brought the case against Siegelman .
Enter next , Dana Jill Simpson , a rare and endangered political animal : a republican political operative with a conscience and an allegiance to the rule of law that trumps partisan loyalty .
As Scott Horton reports , in a sworn affidavit Ms. Simpson , Riley ’s campaign attorney ,
provide[d ] a detailed specific account of what transpired , starting with [ Bill ]
Canary ’s statement “ not to worry about Don Siegelman that “ ˜his girls would take care of him . ' ” 
Then Riley ’s son asked Canary if he was sure that Siegelman would be “ taken care of , ”  and Canary told him not to worry that he had already gotten it worked out with Karl and Karl had spoken with the Department of Justice and the Department of Justice was already pursuing Don Siegelman . ” 
“ His girls ”  were Canary ’s wife Leura Canary , who as U.S. Attorney in the Middle District of Alabama , did in fact start the investigation , only dropping off when objections were raised by Governor Siegelman ’s counsel due to her obvious political bias and the U.S. Attorney in Birmingham , Alice Martin .
Ms. Simpson , who gave the affidavit , is a lifelong Republican and was a worker in the Riley campaign against Siegelman , and her account has been contemporaneously corroborated .
While communicating with Siegelman ’s attorney prior to releasing her affidavit , Simpson ’s house was demolished by a mysterious fire , and Simpson herself was forced off the road .
Mere coincidences , of course .
The judge at Siegelman ’s trial , Mark Fuller , a Bush appointee and a former member of the executive committee of the Alabama Republican party , had a well - known grudge against Siegelman .
Fuller refused to recuse himself from the case , denied bail , immediately put Siegelman in shackles and ordered him to the Atlanta federal prison .
After seven months Judge Fuller , in violation of the law , has refused to release the trial transcript without which the defendant can not appeal his conviction .
Don Siegelman has since been shuttled back and forth among several federal prisons out of touch with his attorneys and not allowed access to the internet or to press interviews .
This treatment has prompted an unprecedented demand by forty - four former state attorneys general for a Congressional investigation of the Siegelman case .
The Purge in Progress
The Siegelman Saga puts a human face on a widespread politicization of the U.S. Department of Justice .
In a similar case in Wisconsin , Georgia Thompson , a purchasing official in the state government , was convicted of corruption in a case that worked to the advantage of a Republican candidate for governor .
The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals was so shocked by the injustice of her conviction that they ordered Thompson ’s immediate release , even before issuing a ruling .
The evidence against her , said Judge Diane Wood , was “ beyond thin . ” 
The December , 2006 , firings of eight Republican U.S. attorneys , who insisted upon conducting their offices without partisan bias , has brought national attention to the political corruption of the Justice Department and has caused many to wonder about the behavior of the remaining eight - five U.S. attorneys that Alberto Gonzales saw fit to retain .
It is a troubling question .
A study by Donald Shields and John Cragan , two professors of communication , may supply an answer : “ the offices of the U.S. Attorneys across the nation investigate seven times as many Democratic officials as they investigate Republican officials , a number that exceeds even the racial profiling of African Americans in traffic stops . ” 
( The numbers : 298 Democrats , 67 Republicans , 10 “ Others ”  ) .
This apparent partisan purge of Democrats , combined with amnesty for Republicans , hits close to home .
It is reported that Carol Lam , one of the eight sacked U.S. Attorneys , was hot on the trail of my Republican Congressman , Jerry Lewis .
I ’ve heard nothing more about this investigation , so it appears that Lewis is off the hook .
So now we have in place a thoroughgoing corruption of the federal justice system .
The blindfold has been torn off the face of lady justice , as the Department of Justice becomes , in effect , an extension of the Republican Party , and possession of a public office by a Democrat becomes a de facto crime , should the hounds of the Department of Justice decide to go after said official .
The Democratic Congress has been remarkably complacent about all this .
True , they have called a few young graduates from Pat Robertson ’s Regent U. Law school to testify , they have heard from the fired U.S. attorneys , and the Democrats have promised hearings on the Siegelman case .
But its all show “ “ a bark without a bite “ “ as the White House and the Department of Justice steadfastly refuse to recognize subpoenas or allow the key players to testify under oath .
These offenses , by the way , were included among the articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon .
Unsurprisingly , these outrages by the Department of Defense have not excited much interest in the mainstream media , with the honorable exception of Keith Olbermann and Dan Abrams of MSNBC .
Abrams series , “ Bush League Justice , ”  which was broadcast last December , was magnificent , and he promised that “ we ’re not going to let this go away …
We are going to be watching very closely . ”
Six weeks later , we are awaiting the follow - up .
In addition , rumor has it that 60 Minutes is preparing a segment on the Siegelman case .
Two Roads Diverge .
The fate of Don Siegelman may reflect the fate of our republic .
We are at a crucial crossroads , one road leads to a restoration of the rule of law , and the other road leads to despotism .
If Don Siegelman ’s persecutors have their way and he serves out his term of seven years , and if the culprits who stole his re-election and railroaded him to federal lockup enjoy the fruits of their villainy and escape punishment , then the rule of law is dead in Alabama and in critical condition in Washington D.C.
Then the gangrene of lawlessness in Alabama may spread until it destroys the entire body politic .
I seem to recall a comment by some Bushie to the effect that “ we ’re pushing the limits until someone or something stops us . ” 
To date , those limits have extended well beyond the Constitution and the rule of law .
Acts of Congress are nullified by signing statements , Congressional oversight is blinded by “ executive privilege ”  and a refusal to recognize subpoenas .
Elections have been privatized and are unverifiable .
All that ’s left to the Congress to contain this burgeoning power of “ the unitary executive ”  is impeachment , and impeachment , as we all know , is “ off the table . ” 
Someone , somehow , must draw a line in the sand and say “ no further ! ” 
And then , push back “ “ and back — and back .
“ Just wait , ”  we hear , “ in less than a year there will be a new president and a new day dawning . ” 
If so , then this new day will require a new leader with qualities and capacities that are not conspicuous in any of the present - day contenders for that office .
Perhaps the next President , once in office , will surprise us with inspired leadership qualities not now apparent .
It has happened before .
But the restoration of freedom never simply “ trickles down ”  from great leaders .
It must also “ percolate up ”  from the people .
And I do n’t see much reason for hope in the American public today .
But extraordinary crises have a way of summoning extraordinary virtues .
If , somehow , we follow the road to restoration of democracy and the rule of law , we should see at the beginning of that journey the release and exoneration of Don Siegelman , the disgrace and punishment of his tormenters , and the end of political prosecution .
It will be a long and arduous road to follow .
But it is the only road worthy of our dedication and effort .

Looking to boost the Web , Sun is working on a royalty - free and open video codec and media system , company officials said Thursday afternoon .
" The main benefit is that you do n't have that now and there are markets , key markets like the Web , that are in need for the Web 2.0 experience a foundation of royalty - free for the media element , " for audio and video , said Rob Glidden , global alliance manager for TV & Media at Sun .
Detailed at the Sun Labs Open House event in Menlo Park , Calif. , the project is called Open Media Stack or the Open Media System .
It was derived out of Sun 's Open Media Commons initiative for development of royalty - free and open solutions for digital content .
Currently , proprietary solutions are relied on , such as Adobe 's Flash or royalty - bearing specifications like H.264 , Glidden said .
OMS is a recent project .
Asked about the availability of OMS technologies , Glidden said , " Stay tuned .
I have no announcements on any commercial implementations or time frame . "
OMS video is to be based on H.26 x technology .

Robots have been a passion of mine since I was a child , so imagine my excitement when I was given the opportunity to add a robotics class to our high school 's computer curriculum !
We recently celebrated our second year of offering robotics at Greater Houlton Christian Academy ( GHCA ) , the school where I teach .
During this time , we 've produced three different robots , each based on a PC running Linux .
We work with a tight budget , so we have to be creative in our design , use of materials and tools .
This results in robots that any do - it - yourself hobbyist can build .
The first robot to roam the halls of GHCA is K9 , a robot dog based on the British sci - fi show , Doctor Who .
I created K9 myself as a way to jump - start our Robotics program .
K9's main purpose is to “ ooh and ahh ” students , hopefully encouraging an interest in the field of robotics .
I used common angle iron and 1/4 nuts and bolts to assemble K9's “ skeleton ” , much like an Erector Set from years gone by .
In fact , K9's head was built using an Erector Set from 1971 !
Sheet metal provides the finished look for our class mascot .
Figure 1 . K9 was the first robot built at GHCA .
The second robot was designed by students Aaron Bither and Brian Thompson during our first year of offering robotics .
At the beginning of each school year , we start by defining a “ problem ” that we'd like to overcome , and then we proceed to brainstorm how a machine can solve this problem , what features it will need and so on .
Aaron and Brian decided to build a robot that could deliver messages from one classroom to another .
They quickly learned that what is simple for humans is usually quite complex for robots .
By the end of the school year , they had a robot that could be programmed to navigate the hallway , but much was left undone .
It was a learning experience for us all .
Our third robot , and the featured robot of this article , was designed by students Jordan McGuire , Jeromy Nevers and Barrett Jewell .
I am also part of the team , contributing ideas and guiding the students , teaching them through the hands - on process of design and construction .
The problem this group of students wanted to tackle is security , so they decided to make a “ sentry bot ” that could patrol the hallways and scan for intruders .
Again , easier said than done .
A functioning , autonomous robot has three major components : the mechanical systems , the electronic systems and the software .
Design typically begins with the mechanics of the robot , and of particular interest is the method of locomotion .
There are many ways to make a robot move , but our class adheres to the KISS principle — keep it simple , silly !
For example , we do n't build complex legs when wheels work just fine .
In fact , all three robots use ordinary lawn - mower wheels with various drive systems .
Figure 2 . The Sentry Bot
Our sentry bot uses a very simple tricycle design .
To drive a robot's wheels , we use windshield - wiper motors .
These motors can be purchased on - line for less than $ 20 US or torn out of an old car for free .
They run on 12VDC and provide very high torque at a nice rotation rate .
Our sentry bot uses two of these motors : one to drive the front wheel and the other to turn the steering strut .
Once the means of locomotion has been chosen , it 's time to design the frame .
The frame needs to be strong but not too heavy , and it must accommodate the drive system , any additional mechanical systems ( such as arms and sensors ) , the power source ( we use a 12V garden tractor battery ) and the electronics .
We decided on plywood for the sentry bot because it is relatively inexpensive and easy to work with .
We cut out the frame using a simple jigsaw .
One trick to reduce weight was to cut out sections of the interior of the plywood frame — just do n't cut out too much or the frame will become weak .
Our electronics systems consist of the main computer and interface board that connects the computer to the drive system and sensors .
Although I would love to equip every robot with a low - power embedded computer , our budget simply does not allow for this .
However , we do have access to a number of old Pentium desktop computers .
Considering the processing power of the Mars Rovers , a 200MHz Pentium is more than enough for our humble robot .
A big challenge in using old desktop computers for robotics is the power consumption .
These motherboards draw a lot of current .
Another problem is the voltages that the motherboard needs .
For the sake of time and money , we use a power inverter with the original AT power supply .
This is easy to do but not very efficient .
Future robots will use components from old laptops that are donated to us , which consume less power and can run directly off the battery .
Interface boards are designed and built in class .
The main purpose of this component is to take the low - current outputs of the PC 's parallel port and allow those outputs to power the motors .
We use transistors and relays to construct our control circuits , as well as a logic circuit to prevent motor “ twitching ” during bootup .
Our logic circuit also ensures that the motors do n't exceed any limits , such as turning the steering strut too far left or right .
Inputs from sensors are routed through buffers before going to the parallel port .
Simple , but it works !
Figure 3 . Barrett Jewell works on the interface board .
Of course , what you really want to learn about is the software and operating system that run our robots .
Yes , all three robots run Linux !
In the beginning , we experimented using DOS and QBasic .
However , we were quite limited in what we could do with DOS , so I started experimenting with Linux using K9 the robot dog .
When K9 was built , we used the Mandrake Linux distribution at our school .
Mandrake offered a minimum installation option , which was enough for the simple demands of our robots .
Since then , however , our school has switched over to Gentoo Linux , and thus our sentry bot actually runs on Gentoo .
Maybe some of you are thinking that Gentoo is overkill for a simple robot .
Maybe , maybe not .
I personally find that installing Gentoo is faster than installing most other distributions , maybe because I 've done it so many times .
A bare system ( stage 3 ) install of Gentoo is relatively small , at least compared to the storage available on the robot's hard drive .
However , Gentoo 's biggest offering is the ability to add and update the software our robot needs quickly and easily , all compiled to make our old hardware run as fast as possible .
In case you are wondering how useful it is to compile software on an old Pentium system , know that our sentry bot has network access to our computer lab .
Using distcc , a distributing compiler , our bot has the processing power of 20 Athlon 1500 + processors and more than 7GB of RAM at its disposal for compiling new software .
Trust me , sentry bot can compile source code pretty quickly .
Gentoo Linux comes with another plus — it is very Python - centric ( due to the Portage system ) .
Our school offers a class to all 8th graders where they use Python to learn the basic concepts of programming .
This provides a natural stepping stone for students who later want to take our Robotics class .
Python is both simple and powerful , and although it is an interpreted language , it runs plenty fast for the simple needs of our robots .
We use some C to interface Python to the parallel port , as well as to deal with time - critical operations , such as drift corrections .
However , most of our code is in Python .
This allows the students to make changes quickly and see immediate results in the robot 's behavior .
Because our computer lab is Linux - based , students easily can access the robot using SSH and KDE 's fish from their workstations .
Controlling the motors using Linux and Python is n't difficult .
The real challenge lies in the implementation of awareness , both of the environment and the robot 's internal conditions .
For example , a simple program coupled with a few electronic components can turn on the main drive motor for ten seconds , propelling the robot forward .
But what 's to stop the robot from drifting to the left or the right , or from running into a wall or person ?
Although the robot easily can track its progress based on time ( driving ten seconds forward ) , the speed of the motor varies with battery charge and friction .
To tell the robot to go forward exactly 50 cm requires something a bit more complicated ; it requires a feedback loop .
Most robots use motors with encoders of some sort to act as a digital “ odometer ” .
These encoders can be built using simple IR emitter / receiver pairs and a disk with holes in it .
In fact , old - style computer mice work using this very principle .
This got me thinking — instead of building a fancy encoder circuit and interface to the computer , followed by the software needed to read the encoder , why not use a simple device that provides the same information in a very computer - friendly format ?
Hence the “ invention ” of the optical mouse encoder .
Figure 4 . A Close - up of Our Optical Mouse Encoder
Like everything else about our robot , our optical mouse encoder is simple yet effective .
We took a mouse pad , cut out a circle and glued it to the main drive wheel .
We then mounted an optical mouse to the steering strut so that the mouse rests over the circular mouse pad .
As the wheel turns , the mouse pad rotates beneath the mouse , which sends very precise positioning data to the computer .
This movement easily can be read by opening and reading from the / dev / psaux or equivalent device file .
Optical mice provide a high resolution with great accuracy , so with the proper conversions , we can track our robot 's movement down to a fraction of a centimeter .
Knowing how far it has traveled , the robot can know where it is on a preprogrammed map , assuming it has n't been picked up and moved and that there is no drift or wheel slipping .
Of course , drift and wheel slipping do occur , and maps can't predict moved furniture , people or bookbags .
The robot needs a way to detect its environment , and to do this we are using sonar and bump sensors .
Typically , sonar is neither cheap nor simple , but it just so happens that I had recently “ won ” a car parking assistant at a Christmas party Yankee swap .
This device uses sonar and has three lights to tell drivers how far to back up their cars as they pull into the garage .
Well , you can't beat free , and although this device does not measure distance in the traditional sense , it was a working sonar that can detect objects that are close ( yellow light ) and really close ( red light ) .
By wiring the yellow and red LEDs to our parallel port 's input lines , our robot can detect objects as it approaches them and take action , such as stop or turn .
The sonar emitter is mounted on the front wheel strut , so the sonar is always “ looking ” in the direction the robot is heading .
Even though we 've tried to keep things simple , we still have much work to do .
Our students are looking forward to the coming school year when they can continue working with the physical platform they 've constructed .
With the majority of the hardware in place , our focus will turn to the software .
One challenge we 've already run into is making sure the robot is going perfectly straight and not drifting to the left or right .
Although it may be possible to design the hardware to lock the front wheel pointing exactly forward , there is still the issue of drift due to friction differences at each wheel .
To solve this problem , we 're turning to software .
Instead of measuring the rotation rate of the single front wheel per our current design , we recently experimented by attaching two optical mice to measure the two rear wheels .
Linux provides a separate device file for each mouse , allowing us to track both rear wheels independently and compare them .
By measuring differences in rotation rate , we can use software to adjust the steering motor until the robot is going perfectly straight .
This also will let us precisely calculate the robot's heading as it makes turns or is affected by drift and wheel slippage .
Couple this with external sensors , and we will have a robot that can know exactly where it is in our building .
Figure 5 . A Look at the Steering Mechanism and Interface Board
High school student Jordan McGuire has written software that allows the robot to correct its internal position based on sonar readings of known boundaries , such as walls .
Similar techniques can be used to detect objects that “ do n't belong ” , and then use other sensors , such as heat and motion , to detect a possible intruder during times when the building should be empty .
With Linux , it is simple to add a Webcam that can capture and send the images of an intruder via a wireless network .
A sentry bot 's best weapon is its camera .
With Linux as our operating system , we can expand the capabilities of the robot well beyond the original “ mission ” given it .
We 've even discussed adding a GPS receiver and programming the robot to fetch us milkshakes from the local ice cream stand .
Okay , maybe that 's a little far - fetched , but it is good to dream big !
Speaking of dreams and future designs , as the Robotics program matures and students are introduced to robotics at a younger age , I plan to bring in more advanced concepts .
We will still work to keep it simple , but there definitely are better ways to do some of the things we are currently doing .
For example , the power requirements of a desktop PC are unrealistic for a battery - powered robot .
Laptop components will be a great improvement , but if money were no object , embedded computers would be the way to go .
A recent donation has purchased a TS - 7260 ARM computer board for K9 that requires less than a watt of power to run .
This Linux - based board has a number of I/O ports that are better suited for interfacing to the various motors , servos and sensors of a robot when compared to a PC 's parallel port .
The other inefficiency our simple approach introduces is the burden of a central PC managing minute yet very time - sensitive tasks , like speed control of the main drive motors .
I 'm currently redesigning K9's controller board to use simple microcontrollers to unload the low - level tasks from the CPU .
Although our class may not be ready to tackle microcontrollers just yet , they definitely will be introduced to the concept and get to see the results .
I realize this article does n't give step - by - step instructions on how to build a DIY robot .
There are many good books and informative Web sites on that topic .
My goal is to share what can be done with inexpensive , easy - to - obtain parts and our favorite operating system .
Linux is loved by tinkerers and hobbyists , and an exciting and challenging extension to this line of tinkering is to add motors and sensors and autonomy .
Like peanut butter and jelly , Linux and robotics are a perfect combination !
♣ Tax Honesty Hall of Fame
Wikipedia and government publications and officials call them “ tax protesters . ”
I call them heroes .
“ What ? ” you say ?
“ Heroes ?
These guys are deadbeats , losers , unpatriotic , tax cheats , they do n't pay their “ fair share ; ” evaders , dishonest , lawbreakers .
I pay my taxes , why should n't they ?
How 's the country going to run without taxes , anyhow ? ”
Ron Paul has made it abundantly clear to anyone willing to listen : our country need not run on taxes .
The IRS can be completely eliminated merely by cutting back federal spending to the level of about a decade ago .
Why then do we still have an income tax ?
It is a means of control , of keeping the population “ in line ” and in unreasoning fear of government .
“ Confiscating the fruits of our labor through the income tax is crucial to the health of the state . ” – Ron Paul , Who are the Patriots ?
We allow the IRS leviathan to continue on its merry way , destroying countless lives , rattling its saber brazenly , and intentionally terrorizing the average working Joe .
A few of countless instances are documented in America , Freedom to Fascism , one of filmmaker Aaron Russo 's last gifts to his fellow countrymen .
Yet a voice in the wilderness , Ron Paul , continues to tell us the truth about the destructive , wasteful , and completely unnecessary nature of the income tax .
“ Abolishing the IRS altogether would trigger an avalanche of real growth in the economy . ” – Ron Paul , The Double Trouble of Taxation
In the same way that the mass media ridicules Ron Paul and his ideas , the IRS , echoed sycophantically by its media shills and parroted by the brainwashed and brain - dead , marginalizes and demonizes some of the finest patriots and heroes of the modern - day American revolution .
What is your reaction to Wesley Snipes , after being acquitted of all felony charges , sentenced to three years in prison for misdemeanors ?
It 's a good thing that the IRS is n't empowered to enforce jay - walking statutes , is n't it ?
I 've heard of rapists and murderers being treated with more compassion , but we can't allow the frightening facade of the IRS , the world 's largest organized crime syndicate and terrorist organization , to be tarnished , can we ?
“ Prosecutors said Snipes ' case was important to send a message to would - be tax protesters not to test the government . ” – Yahoo Movies
Yes , and what sort of message is that ?
The same un -American — no , inhuman — message echoed in comments responding to previous articles [ linked below . ]
It is the perennial message of the bully and his entourage , the message that says “ Bow your knee to the Almighty State , the federal government owns you and will have no other gods before it . ”
Meanwhile , unheralded , underreported , and unappreciated , a growing list of men and women can be found to have nobly stood against the tide of tax tyranny .
While some observers think the tax honesty movement is dead , others insist that it is just now reaching critical mass .
Thanks to the patriots listed here , and many others perhaps less prominent but honorable nonetheless , the Tax Honesty movement presses on .
You would do well to Google these heroes of the movement and learn from them .
Presented in no particular order :
Irwin Schiff
Joe Bannister
Sherry Peel Jackson
Lindsey Springer
Tommy Cryer
Larken and Tessa Rose
Dr. Tom Clayton
Milton William Cooper
Vernice Kuglin
Eddie Kahn
Edware and Elaine Brown
Gordon Kahl
Lynne Meredith
Wesley Snipes
Bill Benson
Richard Simkanin
What could possibly make them believe strongly enough in their cause to be willing to suffer , to have their lives destroyed by the deceitful , unchecked , and inhumanly oppressive power of the IRS ?
I urge you to learn not only from their successes but from their failures , their strategies and their mistakes .
These are patriots , tried and true .
They have stood firm against federal tyranny in America .
Many of them have paid a heavy toll for their efforts , some have paid with their lives .
Many are still paying the price , and deserve our financial support , our encouragement , and our undying gratitude .
Will you bow the knee to the IRS and condemn your fellow citizens , or will you honor them along with the other great American heroes in whose tradition they walk ?

Census Bureau back to using paper , pencil for 2010 count
WASHINGTON — Technology problems will force the government to count all of the nation 's 300 million residents the old - fashioned way in the 2010 census - with paper and pencil .
Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez was scheduled to tell a House subcommittee Thursday that the government will scrap plans to use handheld computers to collect information from the millions of Americans who do n't return census forms mailed out by the government .
The decision is part of a package of changes that will add as much as $ 3 billion to the cost of the constitutionally mandated count , pushing the overall cost to more than $ 14 billion .
The project to develop the computers ``has experienced significant schedule , performance , and cost issues , '' Gutierrez said in prepared testimony before a House Appropriations subcommittee .
``A lack of effective communication with one of our key contractors has significantly contributed to the challenges .
``As I have said before , the situation today is unacceptable , and we have been taking steps to address the issues , '' he said .
This was to be the first truly high - tech count in the nation 's history .
The Census Bureau has awarded a contract to purchase 500,000 of the computers , at a cost of more than $ 600 million .
The devices , which look like high - tech cell phones , will still be used to verify every residential street address in the country , using global positioning system software .
But workers going door - to - door will not be able to use them to collect information from the residents who did n't return their census forms .
About a third of U.S. residents are expected not to return the forms .
The Census Bureau plans to hire and train nearly 600,000 temporary workers to do the work .
Interviews , congressional testimony and government reports describe an agency that was unprepared to manage the contract for the handheld computers .
Census officials are being blamed for doing a poor job of spelling out technical requirements to the contractor , Florida - based Harris Corp .
The computers proved too complex for some temporary workers who tried to use them in a test last year in North Carolina .
Also , the computers were not initially programmed to transmit the large amounts of data necessary .
Gutierrez , who oversees the Census Bureau , said officials there were unaccustomed to working with an outside vendor on such a large contract .
The Harris Corp. issued a statement saying it still hopes to play a large role in the 2010 count .
`` The wireless handheld devices are part of a larger , multifaceted process to move from a ' paper culture ' to a more ' automated ' culture appropriate for the 21st century , '' the company said .
Despite the problems , company officials said they were ``encouraged that automation and the adoption of new technology is moving forward , even if in a more narrowly focused fashion . ''
The 2010 census was already on pace to be the most expensive ever , even taking inflation into account .
Officials now are scrambling to hold down costs while trying to ensure the count produces reliable population numbers - figures that will be used to apportion seats in Congress and divvy up more than $ 300 billion a year in federal and state funding .
Harris Corp. was awarded a $ 596 million contract in March 2006 to supply the handheld computers and the operating system that supports them .
The contract has since grown to $ 647 million .
The success - or failure - of the census could have widespread repercussions .
The Constitution has required a census every 10 years since the first one in 1790 .
It is used to apportion the 435 seats in the House of Representatives among the states .
And states and many cities use census data to draw legislative districts .
Population numbers are used to calculate billions in state and federal grants for transportation , education and other programs .
Private businesses use census data to identify labor and consumer markets .
Farmers in Venezuela recovered part of a classified American reconnaissance satellite in 1964 .
( credit : NRO ) Spysat down !
On February 14th the Pentagon held a news conference to announce that the United States was planning on firing a missile to blow up one of its errant satellites , named USA 193 , in order to prevent its hydrazine fuel from reaching the ground .
General James Cartwright , vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , denied that the planned attack on the satellite had anything to do with preventing its classified equipment from reaching the ground .
This is probably true .
As the Columbia accident demonstrated , spacecraft , even those intended to survive reentry , break up into barely recognizable pieces over large amounts of territory when they do not reenter properly .
And general officers rarely face television cameras and tell flat - out lies .
What seems more likely than senior military officials worrying about the infinitesimal chance of classified material falling into the wrong hands , is that the White House is interested in demonstrating its ASAT and missile defense capabilities and responding to China ’s January 2007 ASAT test — all under the cover of protecting public safety .
But this is not the first time that a US reconnaissance satellite has come down in an unplanned manner and caused intense embarrassment .
The most spectacular case occurred nearly 44 years ago .
Falling star On Sunday , August 1 , 1964 , the phone rang on the desk of the US Army attaché at the United States Embassy in Caracas .
The caller was a Venezuelan commercial photographer named Leonardo Davilla .
Davilla reported that what appeared to be part of a space vehicle had been found on July 7 on a farm in a remote rural region of the Andes Mountains near La Fria in Tachira State , near the Columbian border .
Two farm workers had reported it to their employer , Facundo Albarracin , who had them move the object onto his own farm .
News reached San Cristobal , where Davilla learned of it and traveled to see it .
Davilla told the Army officer that the object carried markings that read “ United States ” and “ Secret . ”
What Davilla did not mention to the Army officer was that he had photographed the object , and that Albarracin had been trying to sell it .
What Albarracin had recovered , although no one knew it yet , was the forward satellite recovery vehicle ( SRV ) from top secret CORONA reconnaissance mission # 1005 .
Star - crossed mission On April 27 , 1964 , a Thrust Augmented Thor Agena D rocket had lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base and arced to the south over the Pacific Ocean .
Aboard was the fifth KH - 4A CORONA reconnaissance satellite , with its J - 1 camera .
The KH - 4A , which improved upon its predecessor the KH - 4 by incorporating a second satellite recovery vehicle with its film - return “ bucket ” — so - called because it looked a lot like a steel kettle — more than doubled the amount of reconnaissance imagery produced by each mission .
The camera was programmed to turn on soon after the satellite reached orbit , operating intermittently for four days and filling up its first satellite recovery vehicle ( SRV ) , which was then ejected over the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii for recovery .
The SRV would be snatched out of the air by an aircraft and returned to the United States for processing .
The satellite would then shut down for up to 20 days , operating in “ zombie mode , ” with electrical power and stabilization control gas closed off .
One day before the camera was to be operated again , the spacecraft was reactivated .
It would photograph more reconnaissance targets for another four - day period before the second SRV was ejected and recovered .
USA 193 is not the first time that a US reconnaissance satellite has come down in an unplanned manner and caused intense embarrassment .
The launch of the April 1964 mission , labeled number 1005 , was uneventful .
But after 350 camera operations the film for the “ slave ” camera — the panoramic camera located in the forward part of the vehicle — broke .
Shortly afterward , the Agena power supply failed .
On April 30 , ground controllers ordered the spacecraft to eject its first SRV for reentry on southbound revolution number 47 .
The vehicle verified receipt of the command , but did not carry it out .
Various ground stations repeatedly sent commands to the satellite on 26 subsequent passes through May 20 .
On May 19 the vehicle no longer acknowledged the receipt of the commands .
Ground controllers assumed that the vehicle was headed for an uncontrolled reentry and would burn up , as had other spacecraft .
The US satellite tracking network kept close watch on the capsule .
Early calculations of its decay rate led to a prediction that it would impact in the Pacific , west of the coast of South America and about 10 degrees north of the South Pole — far from inhabited land .
But later calculations based upon better orbital trace measurements indicated that the capsule would probably come down somewhere in Venezuela .
Observation stations in the Caribbean were alerted to watch the skies on May 26 , the anticipated date of reentry .
At six minutes after midnight , on northbound orbit number 452 , observers in Maracaibo , Venezuela reported five bright objects passing overhead , heading for the South American coast and presumably the ocean .
Nearly six weeks later , the two farm workers stumbled upon the wreckage .
The Venezuelan chase When Leonardo Davilla called the U.S. embassy on August 1 and spoke to the Army attaché , he apparently was not very convincing , because the Army officer initially did nothing .
But Davilla called back on the following Monday .
The Army attaché then called the embassy ’s Air attaché to notify him of what Davilla had said .
The two officers were unable to find an aircraft to take them to Facundo Albarracin ’s farm .
On Tuesday they interviewed a commercial pilot who had seen the object and had returned to Caracas with a souvenir piece .
The Army attaché flew to La Fria , the village nearest to where the object had reportedly been found .
But when he arrived , he learned that the Venezuelan army had arrived first and had taken it to San Cristobal , the provincial capital .
He then headed to San Cristobal , where he examined it himself .

The capsule was not in good shape .
It had been heavily damaged in the impact .
Even worse , in the three weeks since it had been found , local farmers had hacked away at its skin .
They had noticed a gold disc attached to the upper section of the capsule .
This disc , made of real gold , was used as a heat dispersion mechanism during reentry .
As this and other discs melted , they sheathed the capsule in foil - thick pure gold .
The farmers had hacked at the vehicle looking for more of the discs .
Various passerby had also removed pieces , and the farmer whose ranch the vehicle had landed on reportedly gave the strobe beacon light to one of his children as a toy .
One farmer had used the parachute lines as a harness for his horse .
The Army attaché also found an American nickel and a quarter in the wreckage .
On at least one previous mission coins had been found hidden inside a recovered reconnaissance capsule and the Air Force had issued an injunction against such practices .
Obviously the injunction was being ignored .
In addition to the coins , the attaché reported finding the film that remained in the bucket .
He described it as “ well - cooked . ”
The Venezuelan army ignored the American Army officer ’s request to release the object to US authorities .
The Venezuelan army , with the American in tow , flew the wreckage to Caracas and promised to deliver it to the Americans on the following day , Friday , August 6 .
But when the object reached Caracas , it was taken directly to the office of the Venezuelan Minister of Defense .
It did not return to American hands until Tuesday , August 10 .
Apparently , the United States had to buy back its spacecraft from the Venezuelans , but not before the Minister of Defense apparently decided to keep the radio transmitter beacon as a souvenir .
The spooks arrive
By this time Air Force officers attached to the CIA had arrived in Caracas to retrieve the object .
They reported that the impact and souvenir - hunters “ have pretty well reduced internal equipment to junk . ”
The impact had compressed the capsule to about two - thirds of its original length .
The spooled film was beyond salvage .
Part of the ablator was missing , along with most of the parachute cover , the parachute ( which had not deployed ) , the thrust cone , the rocket motor , and all but one of the gold discs .
In the laconic words of the Director of the NRO , the experience “ provided valuable engineering data on non-optimum re-entry survivability . ”
By now many people knew about or had seen the top secret equipment .
But what was worse was that the story had spread beyond the people associated with the object ’s recovery .
On August 4 , the local Reuters correspondent had reported the find in a dispatch that was picked up by several wire services .
The story appeared in the Washington Star and the New York Times on August 5 , before the capsule was even back in American hands .
Photos appeared in the San Cristobal newspaper , Diario Catolico , clearly showing the film - takeup reels inside the battered capsule .
One reel was full , the other nearly empty .
To a trained eye , these would be rather obvious indicators of the presence of a camera .
In the laconic words of the Director of the National Reconnaissance Office , the experience “ provided valuable engineering data on non-optimum re-entry survivability . ”
If the efforts to retrieve the capsule in Venezuela had been somewhat comical , the comedy was not about to end .
The recovered capsule was shipped to Lockheed ’s Advanced Projects facility in Palo Alto , California via a “ secure air route , ” probably involving one of the CIA ’s murky airline operations .
But this was not sufficient for the spooks , who also created a dummy package that they would ship via normal military transportation back to the United States .
The dummy package was a crate filled with paper , pieces of wood , and scrap metal .
It was addressed for shipment to the home of a Defense Intelligence Agency officer assigned to the Pentagon .
But the shipping manifest declared that the cargo weighed 250 pounds when it actually weighed only 80 pounds .
When the cargo reached McGuire Air Force Base the weight discrepancy was noticed by customs officials , who assumed that they had intercepted a drug shipment .
They opened the carton and found only the inexplicable junk , shipped at considerable expense back to the United States .
They contacted the addressee and informed him that they were “ going to investigate . ”
The officer stalled them and made a frantic call to the CIA to “ cut this one off . ”
The CIA , through its contacts with the Customs Bureau , retrieved and destroyed the box six days later .
Another , albeit minor , breach of security was averted .
The CORONA operations team evaluated the causes for the Agena and camera problems and attempted to fix them .
When the battered capsule finally reached Lockheed in Palo Alto , it was carefully examined by the CORONA team .
They evaluated it and recommended several changes pertaining to future reentry vehicles .
First , all classification markings were removed from orbital CORONA vehicles before launch ; objects clearly labeled “ Secret ” were likely to draw unwanted attention if recovered .
Second , a new label was substituted offering , in eight languages , a “ reward for return to American authorities ” of the recovered part .
Finally , vehicle inspection procedures were reinforced to protect against the stowage of more souvenirs during fabrication and checkout .
Ice stations and cold wars
This event represented the most serious breach of security during the entire CORONA program , but it was not the only one .
In 1959 a Discoverer reentry vehicle — without any classified material aboard — had reportedly come down on Spitzbergen Island in the Arctic Circle .
Air Force officers raced to the scene , but did not locate the craft and they suspected that the Soviet Union might have retrieved it .
This incident formed the basis for the novel and later movie Ice Station Zebra .
However , neither the Soviet Union nor the later Russian government has ever confirmed that they retrieved a capsule .
More to the point , a key Air Force official involved in the launch doubted that it was ever recovered .
He noted that it was highly unlikely that the vehicle could have come down and hit the only bit of dry land amid millions of square kilometers of ocean .
Thereafter all classification markings were removed from orbital CORONA vehicles before launch ; objects clearly labeled “ Secret ” were likely to draw unwanted attention if recovered .
In the 1990s Sergei Khrushchev , the son of Nikita Khrushchev and himself a former Soviet aerospace engineer , claimed that in the 1960s the Soviet Union had retrieved parts from several American reconnaissance satellites and that in one case some film had been recovered by peasants who used it to cover their house .
However , it seems far more likely that if any materials or film were actually recovered , they came from some of the hundreds of spy balloons that the United States had floated over the Soviet Union in the 1950s , most of which were shot down or fell somewhere in the vast Soviet arctic .

Hundreds of these classified balloons with their high tech camera equipment came down in the Soviet Union and China in the 1950s and some were recovered .

Office records refer to only one other incident besides the Venezuelan caper .
Apparently , pieces of a reconnaissance satellite were recovered in England in the 1960s , although not properly identified until later .
There may have been other incidents of classified American satellites falling to the ground and being recovered , but they have never been made public — something that many in the National Reconnaissance Office certainly wish had been the case with USA 193 .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
An investment executive who paid more than $ 20 million for an original , handwritten copy of the Magna Carta presented the ancient paper Monday to the media and plans to loan it to the National Archives .
People photograph the rare copy of the Magna Carta before it 's auctioned at Sotheby 's New York in December .
David Rubenstein , the founder of the private equity company Carlyle Group , was the top bidder during a December auction at Sotheby 's , and said buying it and displaying it is a way " to show my appreciation for the country which has been very good to me . "
The National Archives considers the manuscript " a milestone in constitutional thought " from the 13th century , and plans to place it on public display later this month .
Rubenstein in the 1970s was the chief lawyer for a Senate panel that reviewed constitutional amendments .
The original Magna Carta was signed in 1215 .
Rubenstein's is one of four remaining copies of the document commissioned by the King of England in 1297 to establish basic human rights as part of English law .
A scholar 's contemporary translation of the Latin describes the right of the country 's people " to be free and to have all its rights fully and its liberties entirely , " as among the 37 principles described in the Magna Carta .
Watch what young people have to say about this document »
Rubenstein , before founding the Washington - based Carlyle Group , was also a domestic policy adviser during the Carter administration .
He is from Baltimore , Maryland .
The fragile paper is displayed in a sealed viewing box to protect it from damage .
Sotheby 's auctioned the document on behalf of the Ross Perot Foundation , which had purchased it in the 1980s from a British family who had kept the document for the previous 500 years .
" It has a few wrinkles , " Rubenstein told reporters .
" Any of you who are 700 years old , you 'd have a few wrinkles as well , but for something that 's as old as it is , it 's in very good shape , and I know that it will be kept in excellent shape , hopefully for another 700 years . "
The Magna Carta will be on public display starting March 12 in the West Rotunda Gallery of the National Archives Building .

Britain is on the brink of a diplomatic crisis with Russia which could see the expulsion of several diplomats from London and tit - for - tat reprisals by Moscow .
The Foreign Office and Downing Street are preparing to send a strong signal to the Kremlin following its refusal to extradite Andrei Lugovoi , the former KGB agent suspected of murdering Alexander Litvinenko last November .
On Monday , Russian prosecutors formally announced that Mr Lugovoi would not be handed over to the UK , on the grounds that Russia 's constitution prevents his extradition .
The government was last night considering counter - measures to show Britain 's extreme displeasure at the Kremlin 's decision , and the seriousness with which it takes the " terrible " murder of Mr Litvinenko - a British citizen and fierce critic of the Russian president , Vladimir Putin .
The options include the possible expulsion of Russian diplomats from the London embassy , and the withdrawal of cooperation in several areas , including education , trade , social affairs and counter - terrorism .
Yesterday a spokesman for Russia 's foreign ministry , Mikhail Kamynin , warned that London was in danger of jeopardising its relationship with Moscow .
" I do n't understand the position of the British government .
It is prepared to sacrifice our relations in trade and education for the sake of one man , " he said , adding : " Our position is clearly in line with Russia 's constitution and legislation . "
British officials say the foreign secretary , David Miliband , is weighing the options .
He will not announce a decision before next week , when the Foreign Office is expected to present a report to parliament setting out the punitive steps Britain will take .
Foreign Office officials are bracing themselves for immediate and furious reprisals from Moscow , which could include the tit - for - tat expulsion of UK diplomats .
President Putin has angrily dismissed as " stupidity " Britain 's request for Mr Lugovoi 's extradition .
The Kremlin has already waged a campaign of intimidation and harassment against Britain 's ambassador in Moscow , Tony Brenton , carried out by activists from the Russian youth group Nashi .
Pro-Kremlin protesters picketed the British embassy , jumped in front of the ambassador 's car and heckled his speeches .
The anti-UK campaign has spread to the British Council , which has been raided by tax officials wearing balaclavas , and was last month told to move out of its offices in the city of Yekaterinburg .
At the same time , both BP and Shell have been forced to yield major gasfield assets to Russia 's state gas firm , Gazprom .
Since the Crown Prosecution Service charged Mr Lugovoi with murder in May , Kremlin officials have encouraged the Russian media to blame Mr Litvinenko's death on the exiled Russian former oligarch Boris Berezovsky and MI6 .
Television channels have also run lengthy interviews with a Russian who claimed that MI6 tried to hire him , and that Mr Litvinenko poisoned himself .
In a surreal press conference in Moscow , Mr Lugovoi blamed the murder on Tony Blair , Mr Berezovsky , and the Georgian mafia .
Privately , Downing Street officials believe the Kremlin could have delivered Mr Lugovoi for trial in London , had it wanted to .
At a minimum , Britain wanted Moscow to signal clearly that it regretted Mr Litvinenko 's killing and would make sure nothing like it happened again .
No such signal has been forthcoming .
The director of public prosecutions , Sir Ken McDonald QC , has made clear that it would not be " acceptable " for Mr Lugovoi to be tried in Russia instead , since the court system there is susceptible to political pressure .
On Tuesday , Gordon Brown expressed his frustration with Moscow .
His spokesman said : " Russia 's refusal to extradite Mr Lugovoi is extremely disappointing .
We deeply regret that Russia has failed to show the necessary cooperation . "
Mr Putin is personally incensed by the UK's failure to extradite Mr Berezovsky to Moscow , where he has been charged with money laundering and with attempting to plot a coup against the president .
Mr Litvinenko , who lived in north London with his wife and young son , died last November , aged 44 , three weeks after being poisoned at the Millennium hotel in Mayfair with radioactive polonium - 210 .
His associates later claimed that he wrote a deathbed statement accusing Mr Putin of being behind his poisoning .
CHICAGO – For nearly 26 years , the affidavit was sealed in an envelope and stored in a locked box , tucked away with the lawyer 's passport and will .
Sometimes he stashed the box in his bedroom closet , other times under his bed .
It stayed there – year after year , decade after decade .
Then , about two years ago , Dale Coventry , the box 's owner , got a call from his former colleague , W. Jamie Kunz .
Both were once public defenders .
They had n't talked in a decade .
" We 're both getting on in years , " Kunz said .
" We ought to do something with that affidavit to make sure it 's not wasted in case we both leave this good Earth . ''
Coventry assured him it was in a safe place .
He found it in the fireproof metal box , but did n't read it .
He did n't need to .
He was reminded of the case every time he heard that a wronged prisoner had been freed .
In January , Kunz called again .
This time , he had news :
A man both lawyers had represented long ago in the murder of two police officers , Andrew Wilson , had died in prison .
Kunz asked Coventry to get the affidavit .
" It 's in a sealed envelope , " Coventry said .
" Open it , " Kunz said , impatiently .
And so , Coventry began reading aloud the five - line declaration the lawyers had written more than a quarter - century before :
An innocent man was behind bars .
His name was Alton Logan .
He did not kill a security guard in a McDonald 's restaurant in January 1982 .
" In fact , " the document said , " another person was responsible . ''
* * *
They knew , because Andrew Wilson told them :
He did it .
But that was the catch .
Lawyer - client privilege is not complete ; most states allow attorneys to reveal confidences to prevent a death , serious bodily harm or criminal fraud .
But this case did n't offer that kind of exception .
So when Andrew Wilson told his lawyers that he , and not Alton Logan , had killed the guard , they felt powerless – aware of information that could free a man they believed to be innocent , but unable to do anything with that knowledge .
And for decades , they said nothing .
As they recall , Wilson – who was facing charges in the February 1982 murders of police officers William Fahey and Richard O'Brien – was even a bit gleeful about the McDonald 's shooting .
To Kunz , he seemed like a child who had been caught doing something naughty .
" I was surprised at how unabashed he was in telling us , " he says .
" There was no sense of unease or embarrassment .
...
He smiled and kind of giggled .
He hugged himself , and said , ' Yeah , it was me . '''
Alton Logan already had been charged with the McDonald 's shooting that left one guard dead and another injured .
Another man , Edgar Hope , also was arrested , and assigned a public defender , Marc Miller .
Miller says he was stunned when his client announced he did n't know Alton Logan and had never seen him before their arrests .
According to Miller , Hope was persistent : " You need to tell his attorney he represents an innocent man . ''
Hope went a step further , Miller says :
He told him Andrew Wilson was his right - hand man – " the guy who guards my back " – and urged the lawyer to confirm that with his street friends .
He did .
Miller says he eventually did tell Logan 's lawyer his client was innocent , but offered no details .
First , though , he approached Kunz , his fellow public defender and former partner .
" You think your life 's difficult now ? "
Miller recalls telling Kunz .
" My understanding is that your client Andrew Wilson is the shooter in the McDonald 's murder . ''
Coventry and Kunz brought Wilson to the jail law library and this , they say , was when they confronted him and he made his unapologetic confession .
They did n't press for details .
" None of us had any doubt , " Coventry says .
And , he adds , it was n't just Wilson 's word .
Firearms tests , according to court records , linked a shotgun shell found at McDonald 's with a weapon that police found at the beauty parlour where Andrew Wilson lived .
The slain police officers ' guns also were discovered there .
Now the lawyers had two big worries :
Another killing might be tied to their client , and " an innocent man had been charged with his murder and was very likely ... to get the death penalty , " Kunz says .
But bound by legal ethics , they kept quiet .
Instead , they wrote down what they 'd been told .
If the situation ever arose where when they could help Logan , there would be a record – no one could say they had just made it up .
They say they did n't name Wilson , fearing someone would hear about the document and subpoena it .
They did n't even make a copy .
But on March 17 , 1982 , Kunz , Coventry and Miller signed the notarized affidavit : " I have obtained information through privileged sources that a man named Alton Logan ... who was charged with the fatal shooting of Lloyd Wickliffe ... is in fact not responsible for that shooting ... "
Knowing the affidavit had to be secret , Wilson 's lawyers looked for ways to help Logan without hurting their client .
They consulted with legal scholars , ethics commissions , the bar association .
Kunz says he mentioned the case dozens of times over the years to lawyers , never divulging names but explaining that he knew a guy serving a life sentence for a crime committed by one of his clients .
There 's nothing you can do , he was told .
Coventry had another idea .
He figured Wilson probably would be executed for the police killings , so he visited him in prison and posed a question :
Can I reveal what you told me , the lawyer asked , after your death ?
" I managed to say it without being obnoxious , " Coventry says .
`` He was n't stupid .
He understood exactly what I was asking .
He knew he was going to get the death penalty and he agreed . ''
Coventry says he asked Wilson the same question years later – and got the same answer .
But ultimately , Wilson was sentenced to life in prison without parole .
His death penalty was reversed after he claimed Chicago police had electrically shocked , beaten and burned him with a radiator to secure his confession .
( Decades later , a special prosecutor 's report concluded police had tortured dozens of suspects over two decades . )
Logan 's case was working its way through the courts , too .
During the first of two trials in which he was convicted , Coventry walked in to hear part of the death penalty phase .
" It 's pretty creepy watching people deciding if they 're going to kill an innocent man , " he says .
The lawyers had a plan if it came to that :
They would appeal to the governor to stop the execution .
But with a life sentence , they remained silent .
Still , there were whispers .
When Logan changed lawyers before his second trial , Miller says the new lawyer approached him .
He had heard that Miller knew something more .
Loading ...
Loading ...
Loading ...
Loading ...
Loading ...
Loading ...
Please , he asked , can you help ?
Miller says he told him he could do nothing for him .
But he says he repeated the words he had uttered to Logan 's first lawyer , more than a decade earlier :
" You represent an innocent man . ''
* * *
In prison , Alton Logan heard the news : First , Andrew Wilson had died .
Second , there was an affidavit in his case .
" I said finally , somebody has come ( forward ) and told the truth , " Logan says .
" I 've been saying this for the past 26 years : It WASN'T me . ''
In January , the two lawyers , with a judge 's permission , revealed their secret in court .
Two months later , Marc Miller testified about his client 's declaration of Logan 's innocence .
But an affidavit and sworn testimony do not guarantee freedom – or prove innocence .
And Alton Logan knows that .
After spending almost half his 54 years as an inmate , this slight man with a fringe of gray beard , stooped shoulders and weary eyes seems resigned to the reality that his fate is beyond his control .
" I have to accept whatever comes down , " he says , sitting in a visitor 's room at the Stateville Correctional Center in Joliet .
He insists he 's not angry with Edgar Hope – the man who first said he was innocent – or even Andrew Wilson .
He says he once approached Wilson in prison and asked him to " come clean .
Tell the truth . "
Wilson just smiled and kept walking .
Nor is Logan angry with the lawyers who kept the secret .
But he wonders if there was n't some way they could have done more .
" What I can't understand is you know the truth , you held the truth and you know the consequences of that not coming forward ? '' he says of the lawyers .
" Is ( a ) job more important than an individual 's life ? ''
The lawyers say it was about their client – Wilson – not about their jobs , and they maintain that the prosecutors and police are at fault .
Kunz says he knows some people might find his actions outrageous .
His obligation , though , was to Andrew Wilson .
" If I had ratted him out ... then I could feel guilty , then I could not live with myself , " he says .
" I 'm anguished and always have been over the sad injustice of Alton Logan 's conviction .
Should I do the right thing by Alton Logan and put my client 's neck in the noose or not ?
It 's clear where my responsibility lies and my responsibility lies with my client . ''
On April 18 , Logan will be in court as his lawyer , Harold Winston , pushes for a new trial .
Along with the affidavit , Winston has accumulated new evidence , including an eyewitness who says Logan was n't at McDonald 's and a letter from an inmate who claims Wilson signed a statement while in prison implicating himself in the murder – and clearing Logan .
But obstacles remain .
Logan can't depend on Edgar Hope .
According to his attorney , Hope probably will exercise his Fifth Amendment rights against self - incrimination .
And he 'll have to deal with eyewitnesses .
His lawyer says one person changed her story in the two trials , but a second , the security guard injured in the shooting , did not .
( A third , who has since died , had acknowledged that Wilson and Logan looked alike . )
Logan prefers not to look too far ahead or think too far back .
He refuses to dwell on missed opportunities – marriage , children , job .
" You cannot live with the situation I 'm in and say , ' What if ? ' ''
He says if he is released , he 'll move to Oregon to be with his brother .
" After spending 26 years in this hellhole , I want to get as far away from here as I possibly can , " he says .
Last month , the Chicago Sun-Times , in an editorial , urged the attorney general or governor to release Logan , noting his claims of innocence " ring achingly true . "
( The state has declined comment on the case . )
Logan keeps a copy of the 26 - year - old affidavit in his cell .
Every now and then , he reads the single paragraph , trying to divine what the lawyers were thinking and if this piece of paper will help unlock the prison doors .
He 's not banking on it .
" I 'm not sold on it , " he says .
" The only time I 'll be sold is when they tell me I can go . ''
For now , though , Alton Logan waits .
The heavy prison doors clank behind him as he walks down the corridor to his cell .
He does not look back .

Yes , the Pope is coming to the US this week , but the real news is that Harry Potter author JK Rowling is also in the country and has just stepped into a New York City courtroom to testify in her lawsuit against a fan - created lexicon .
The lawsuit has generated a wave of media coverage , though little of it is talking about what an important test of US fair use law the case could become .
Rowling will testify today after winning an injunction last November against Steve Vander Ark and his publisher .
Vander Ark is the main author of the online Harry Potter Lexicon ( currently featuring Google ads for " Gay Dumbledore T - shirts , " a product that I was not previously aware existed ) , a site that Vander Ark has turned into a book .
When the news was announcement , Rowling sued , claiming that a fan web site was one thing , but a complete paperback lexicon was another .
Not only did she not want Vander Ark to profit from her work in this way , but Rowling made it clear that she had plans of her own to publish a lexicon .
" There is a big difference between the innumerable Harry Potter fan sites ' latitude to discuss the Harry Potter Works in the context of free , ephemeral web sites and unilaterally repackaging those sites for sale in an effort to cash and monetarily on Ms. Rowling 's creative works in contravention of her wishes and rights , " says the federal complaint , filed last year in New York .
As we noted at the time , lexicons for popular series are common and both Narnia and Middle - Earth have multiple such guides .
Although the works have generally been considered a " transformative " use of an author 's work and world , Rowling is prepared to argue that the new lexicon does not , in fact , pass the fair use four - part test found in US copyright law .
If backed up by a judge , the case could place further limits on fair use and give authors more control over their plots , characters , and fake spells , long after the books are published .
In the books , Harry has a reputation as something of a rulebreaker and troublemaker at Hogwarts , but he 's caused a fair bit of legal hufflepuff in the real world , too .
Interest in the novels was so strong that unauthorized translations began popping up only days after the English version became available ; while the official French translator needed months to get a translation out , a 16 - year old did it in a few days ... and was promptly picked up by the French police .
When the final book in the series came out , someone also went to the effort of photographing every page of a prerelease copy and posting the entire archive to the Internet ( if the leaker really wanted to do us all a favor , he should have left off the epilogue and rewritten the ending , too ) .
The leaker did n't manage to strip the camera 's serial number from the EXIF metadata in the files , though , providing a potential means of identification .
Scholastic does n't appear to have gone after the snapper , who should next time pick up the digital equivalent of Harry 's invisibility cloak before attempting to scoop the world .
Are hybrid cars too quiet for their own good ?
Jana Littrell certainly thinks so .
Littrell , who is blind , was walking through a bank parking lot in the East Bay town of Albany a year ago when her foot was run over by a Toyota Prius backing out of a parking space .
She was n’t injured and the driver apologized effusively , she recalled .
But the experience shook her up .
“ It has definitely put me more on my guard , ” said Littrell , who teaches Braille to newly blind adults .
“ But I do n’t know how much good that ’s going to do me if I ca n’t hear the car coming . ”
Concerns are growing that quiet - running hybrids such as the Prius pose a hazard to pedestrians , especially the 1.3 million Americans who are legally blind .
The problem occurs when the cars are running at very low speeds on electric power , making about as much noise as a golf cart .
“ There ’s this silent - but - deadly zone where we cannot hear these cars , ” said Bryan Bashin , a Sacramento management consultant .
“ We ’re not just worried about blind people .
It ’s a hazard to pets , joggers , young children , cyclists , people who have their back turned .
. . . ”
Federal traffic safety regulators report that no deaths or serious injuries have been attributed to quiet - running hybrids .
But an ongoing study at UC Riverside has produced some of the first scientific evidence that hybrids may pose a hazard to pedestrians , according to preliminary results to be released today .
Meanwhile , the issue is drawing attention from the auto industry , state lawmakers and federal regulators .
It even spawned at least one Silicon Valley start - up that ’s trying to develop an audible pedestrian warning system for hybrids .
Bashin , who is sightless , is working with the National Federation of the Blind to push legislation that could eventually require installation of “ noise emitting ” devices on hybrids and other vehicles that run at least part of the time on electric power .
That prospect does n’t sit well with some car owners .
The message board at greenhybrid.com , a website for hybrid enthusiasts , has seen lively debates over the issue .
In one recent post , a Toyota Camry hybrid owner wrote that “ the world around us is getting louder and along come hybrids and WHAM !
They get blasted by a group claiming they are too quiet . ”
The debate comes as hybrids are becoming increasingly common .
More than 350,000 were sold in the U.S. last year , according to marketing information firm J.D. Power and Associates .
Prius owner Sarah Forth of Silver Lake knows the issue from both sides .
“ I noticed the cars creeping up on me when I was walking around , ” Forth recalled .
“ After I got one , I put two and two together and realized , ‘ I ’m a road hazard in this car . ’ ”
The vehicles are powered by a combination of gasoline and electricity and are prized for their fuel economy .
They ’re particularly popular in California , which buys almost half the hybrids sold in the U.S. by Toyota Motor Corp. , the leading hybrid maker .
And coming soon : cars powered only by electricity that produce very little engine noise at any speed ( although , as with hybrids , air flow and tire noise would become noticeable above 20 or 25 miles per hour ) .
Currently , most of the concern is directed at the top- selling Prius and vehicles such as the Camry that use similar gasoline - electric engines .
The Honda Civic , the No. 4 - selling hybrid in America , is noisier because it employs a system that almost never switches into electric - only mode .
The UC Riverside study has found that test subjects had to be 40 % closer to silent - running hybrids than to cars with traditional gasoline engines before they could hear them .
“ Our preliminary findings could mean that there is an added danger with hybrid cars , particularly at intersections and parking lots , ” said Lawrence Rosenblum , a psychology professor doing the study .
Toyota engineers are looking for a solution , but have yet to come up with one .
“ Vehicle safety and pedestrian safety are at the top of our list , ” spokesman Bill Kwong said .
“ At this point , we ’re trying to balance the needs of sight - impaired people with other sociological concerns such as noise pollution . ”
One problem has been in isolating exactly what sounds most people associate with an approaching vehicle , such as the engine revving , the fan belt , tire noise or other sounds .
Artificial warning cues “ like chirping or chimes are not identified by test subjects as a vehicle at all , ” the automaker said .
Interim solutions include training guide dogs for the blind to detect cars by sight as well as sound .
Training schools such as Guide Dogs for the Blind in San Rafael and Guide Dogs of the Desert near Palm Springs have added Priuses to their training regimens partly in response to concerns about hybrid cars .
Longer term , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has promised to launch a wide - ranging investigation into the issue and several states are considering legislation .
A bill soon to be headed to the governor of Maryland would create a task force to conduct a study and recommend solutions .
A group of Stanford University students has formed a company -- Santa Clara - based Enhanced Vehicle Acoustics -- that is developing an after - market product for Toyota hybrids that goes beyond simply making a noise to alert nearby pedestrians .
For example , by linking to the vehicle ’s computer , the system would be able to direct its sounds to the right or left to warn pedestrians that the car is about to make a turn .
Bashin and other advocates for the blind are sympathetic to complaints from hybrid fans .
But , he asked , “ what am I supposed to do , stay home ? ”

Military heat ray gun zaps 60 Minutes reporter David Edwards and Chris Tackett
Published : Friday February 29 , 2008

Print This Email This " You have to feel the ray gun to believe it , " says 60 Minutes correspondent David Martin , speaking about a non-lethal weapon the Pentagon has developed , " and there 's only one way to do that . "
Martin was reportedly " zapped " 17 times for this piece , demonstrating the effects , as well as the possibility that a person could reduce the impact with shields of various materials .
" The gun is really an antenna which shoots out this very high - frequency radio beam that penetrates the skin to a depth of 1/64 of an inch , which is just deep enough to hit the nerves , " says Martin .
" And it creates this instantaneous sensation of heat which makes anyone who is hit with it try to get out of the way as fast as possible .
" And the second you do get out of the way , the pain goes away , " Martin continued .
" And the point is that this gun , which has a range of roughly half a mile - the exact range is classified - can make you stop whatever it is you 're doing . "
It seems that is the intended benefit of this weapon , which Martin says causes the sensation of being scalded with hot water .
He asks , " How many innocent lives have been lost by someone approaching a check - point and not heeding the warning signs that American soldiers were giving them ...?
Now you have this gun .
If you shoot that ray gun at someone and they keep coming you can safely assume that they have evil intent and have cleared the way to use more lethal force , which would be their rifle . "

Motivation
This post describes how to program scalable web applications with Erlang and Python using computational parallelism .
Caching and load balancing are well documented elsewhere and beyond the scope of this post .
Web applications , by nature , span two drastically different programming domains :
The high - level web design and development domain and the low - level , high - performance , and distributed domain .
Since the internet has provided a bridge between these two domains , it ’s now possible to realistically provide high - level user interfaces to high - performance back - end applications .
I prefer to do as much programming in Python and the Django web framework as possible because it ’s just so easy .
ErlyWeb is an Erlang web framework which should provide similar features to Django , though I ’ve never used it .
In a web application setting , it ’s easy to have too many Apache / Python processes which max out server memory or the CPU .
For those tasks , I like Erlang .
Erlang has parallelism and distribution primitives , which are arguably more elegant than Python ’s concurrency primitives , and has SMP support .
Erlang + Python Communication
It seems like a no - brainier to use domain specific languages to ease development efforts in the corresponding domain but the tricky part is making multiple languages communicate when multiple domains are spanned .
MochiMedia is a small company that builds many of their products around Erlang +
Python and , after shopping around , I chose to use their method of interfacing between the two languages : HTTP + JSON .
The data being sent between the two languages is serialized , sometimes with JSON , and then passed along via HTTP .
This has a few benefits .
First , since HTTP is being used , my Erlang cluster can be across the internet from my Python front - end server .
Second , since I ’m using an independent intermediate representation to serialize the data ( JSON ) , any component of the application stack may be swapped out for something completely new .
Here ’s how it ’s done :
Use MochiWeb to enable the Erlang nodes to communicate over HTTP .
The latest version of Erlang and OpenSSL headers are needed to compile MochiWeb .
Create a MochiWeb project skeleton .
Since MochiWeb is a framework , a script is provided to help create a web server which uses MochiWeb .
Modify the request handler to understand JSON .
The only Erlang that really needs to be modified is in [ project name ] / src / [ project name ] _web.erl .
This is where the processing code goes ( ex : map / reduce ) .
On the Python side , a simple urllib2.urlopen can be used to build Request objects to send to Erlang .
Django comes pre-packaged with SimpleJSON to serialize the body of the HTTP request :
def send_to_erlang ( data ) : url = " http://erlang.nodes.tld:8000/ " body = json.dumps ( data ) headers = {' Content - Type ' : ' application/jsonrequest ' , ' User - Agent ' : ' Python / Project / 0.1'} urlopen ( Request ( url , body , headers ) )
Parallelism
Kevin Smith , of Hypothetical Labs , did a great interview with Bob Ippolito , CTO at MochiMedia , which is a great case study for Erlang +
Python .
Bob talks in - depth about the engineering tasks the model helps overcome .
Computation tasks which can be executed in parallel are key to utilizing Erlang ’s distributed parallelism .
A relatively small message with big computations is the desired abstraction .
For example , the Django web interface could wrap an Erlang distributed map / reduce implementation .
The Erlang book enumerates many different paradigms for Erlang distributed parallelism and for programmers who already have an idea , the plists library takes care of all the distribution automatically .
A programmer with at least a little experience in both Erlang and Python should be able to hack their way through to a fully functional and scalable web application from here .

American spy satellite downed in Peru as US nuclear attack on Iran thwarted
Russian Military Intelligence Analysts are reporting today that one of the United States most secretive spy satellites , the KH - 13 , targeting Iran was ' destroyed in its orbit ' with its main power generator powered by the radioactive isotope Pu-238 surviving re-entry and crashing in a remote region of the South American Nation of Peru , and where hundreds are reported to be ill from radiation poisoning .
American spy satellite downed in Peru as US nuclear attack on Iran thwarted
Western media reports are stating that the US spy satellite debris hitting Peru was caused by a meteor , but which , according to these reports , would be ' impossible ' as the size of 30 - meter crater , if caused by a meteorite , would have hit the ground with about as much energy as 1 kiloton tactical nuclear weapon , and which would have been recorded by the seismic stations around the World .
Most astonishing about these reports , however , are that they state that it was the Americans themselves who destroyed their own spy satellite with the attack upon it being made by the United States Air Forces ' 30th Space Wing located at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California .
This incident further fuels the intrigue involving the United States War Leaders plans to attack Iran in their attempt to engulf the entire Middle East in Total War , but , against which , according to Russian Military Intelligence Analysts , a ' high ranking and significant ' faction of the American Military Establishment is opposed to .
This can be further evidenced by this past few weeks unprecedented announcement by the United States Air Force that 6 nuclear armed cruise missiles were removed , without authorization , from their secure holding facility , located in North Dakota at the Minot Air Force Base , and flown to Barksdale Air Force Base , located in Louisiana , where they were left ' unattended ' for ' nearly 10 hours ' .
It is interesting to note , too , that Barksdale Air Force Base is where the United States President was ' ordered ' to report to on September 11 , 2001 by the United States Air Force Strategic Command prior to his being ' transferred ' under ' armed escort ' to Offutt Air Force Base Strategic Command Center near Omaha , Nebraska , where the first ' truce ' between Americas War Leaders and its Military Forces was ' negotiated ' by billionaire Warren Buffett as intermediary between the rival power blocs .
Though the rival American power blocs do seem to have maintained their uneasy truce , and which have , to date , prevented further attacks within the United States itself , these latest events , according to these reports , appear to show that this truce is now breaking down over threats and planning by the American War Leaders to attack Iran , and which Russia has warned would be ' catastrophic ' .
What remains unknown to us , at this time , is what counter - planning the American War Leaders have in store for furthering their war aims against Iran as the United States Military have ' clearly signaled ' that it will not allow nuclear weapons to be used , even to the extent of denying to their War Leaders one of their most prized spy satellites used to guide their nuclear cruise missiles to their intended Iranian targets .
As the American peoples desire for war appears to be exhausted , and with new polls showing their President and Congress ' approval ratings at ' record lows ' , these reports paint a frightening picture of an American War Leadership determined to engulf the entire World in Total War in order to perpetuate their hegemony .
Not since last century 's German Nazi and Japanese Empire's has the World seen such naked aggression towards the capture of the Earth 's resources , and which caused the deaths of nearly 100 million people , but which the United States and its Western Allies now seem determined to see through to its brutal , and bloody end .

Hillary Clinton Campaign Rented Out Her Donor Mailing List Posted by Pile ( 7613 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
Political campaigns spend thousands , even millions of dollars to acquire good mailing lists .
Last year , New York Sen. Hillary Clinton took the unusual step of renting out some of her lists .
The transaction once again highlights the Clintons ' connections to a businessman who now faces questions from the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Reports from Clinton 's campaign show that on Dec. 3 , it collected payment for renting out three mailing lists , the sale of which netted them $ 8,225 .
It was an unusual transaction , according to Roger Craver , a liberal guru of the political direct - mail industry .
" As a general rule , a campaign will not let its donor list out into the markets until the campaign is over , " he said .
" This is the mother 's milk of small - gift fundraising , and they use these lists frequently . "
There are no records that any other presidential candidates rented out mailing lists last year .
Several sources who work in political consulting and in direct mail , who would not speak for attribution , said they were surprised by the deal , as well as its low price .
According to one direct - mail professional , $ 800,000 would have seemed like a more plausible price for a quality list .
A political consultant suggested that the list broker 's unidentified client could have rented the list as a sample one — to do a test - run mailing .
But most intriguing of all was the renter of the Clinton list : a list brokerage company that is a subsidiary of one of the data - collection industry titans , Info U.S.A .
Info U.S.A.'s CEO is Vinod Gupta , a close ally of both Clintons .
Gupta 's empire also includes the Opinion Research Corporation , which conducts the political polling for the television network CNN .
Vin Gupta has a long history of giving and raising campaign money for the Clintons , and gave $ 1 million for the 2000 Millennium Celebration , a New Year 's Party thrown by the Clintons .
When he was president , Bill Clinton named Gupta to the Kennedy Center board of directors .
Gupta also got to sleep in the Lincoln bedroom .
He gave another million to the Clinton Presidential Library .
The library is run by the National Archives , but Bill Clinton raised the money for its construction and always refused to identify his major donors .
Last fall , ABC News reported that the library rented out a portion of its donor list to a list broker — the same one that rented Hillary Clinton 's campaign lists .
Gupta spent $ 900,000 of corporate money flying the Clintons to various destinations .
The Clinton campaign said in May that Info U.S.A. had been reimbursed to comply with federal campaigning and ethics rules .
After the Clintons left the White House , Gupta hired Bill Clinton as a consultant .
It 's one of two continuing business relationships he has had since leaving office , and it has been worth $ 3.3 million , in addition to the options on 100,000 shares of stock .
When challenged about that outlay of cash to the former president , Gupta has said Clinton is worth $ 40 million to the company .
Kevin Starke is a stock analyst in Connecticut who follows Gupta 's company .
" If it were me , and I had hired Bill Clinton to the tune of $ 3 million , I think I would try to make a fairly distinct case for why that was money well spent , and I 'm not entirely clear on why he has n't done so , " Starke said .
The corporate spending on behalf of the Clintons helped fuel a shareholder lawsuit against Gupta and 10 corporate directors .
There are plenty of other allegations in the suit about homes , cars , and a yacht for Gupta .
A Delaware chancery court judge dismissed some of the allegations involving the Clintons .
But the case is still proceeding .
It has led to an informal inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission , which is also asking if Gupta misspent corporate funds .
" It 's not a company that 's threatened with bankruptcy or anything like that .
It needs probably to be run with more of a view toward generating value for all shareholders , and not just the main shareholder , " Starke said .
Info U.S.A. did not respond to interview requests this week .
The Clinton campaign said Wednesday that the lists were rented out by her 2006 Senate campaign committee — and that the rentals took place before she began her formal campaign for president last January .
That would mean the rental fees went unpaid for at least 11 months .
Starke , the analyst , cites Info U.S.A. data showing that on average , it settles accounts within 64 days .

Gravity waves are global events .
Much like the ripples on a massive pond , these large - scale waves can propagate from an atmospheric disturbance over thousands of miles .
These waves are maintained by the gravitational force of Earth pulling down and the buoyancy of the atmosphere pushing up .
Until now it has been hard to link atmospheric gravity waves with other atmospheric phenomena , but new research suggests that gravity waves passing over storms can spin up highly dangerous and damaging tornados …
Suddenly gravity waves become very important and may help to forecast where and when tornados may strike …
In a nutshell , meteorologist Tim Coleman of the National Space Science and Technology Center in Huntsville ( Alabama ) sums up what gravity waves are :
“ They are similar to waves on the surface of the ocean , but they roll through the air instead of the water .
Gravity is what keeps them going .
If you push water up and then it plops back down , it creates waves .
It ’s the same with air . ” – Coleman
A large number of things may cause gravity waves ( not to be confused with gravitational waves , the ripples in space - time ) , including intense disturbances caused by storm systems , a sudden change in jet stream location or wind shear .
The strong oscillation will then travel for hundreds or even thousands of miles .
See a gravity wave in action over Iowa …
Far from gravity waves being a mild curiosity , it seems that they have a large part to play with other atmospheric dynamics down here on the ground .
Tim Coleman and colleagues have found that the passage of gravity waves over the top of storms could intensify or even create tornados .
It is all down to the angular momentum of the spinning storm .
When storms are large , they slowly rotate .
If for some reason they shrink in scale , the spin will increase ( imagine an ice - skater spinning on the ice with her arms outstretched , as she brings her arms in , she spins faster ) .
This is the fundamental rule of angular momentum conservation , as the size of a storm contracts , the faster it spins .
Ultimately , if the conditions are right , intense tornados can be generated , a huge amount of angular momentum in a tiny volume .
Now gravity waves are believed to have a part to play .
As they pass over a storm , the pressure of the overlying gravity wave propagation will compress the storm .
As this occurs , a vast amount of angular momentum is forced into a smaller volume .
The seeding of baby tornados is therefore possible .
Gravity waves also come in sets ; one wave will follow another , each periodically compressing the storm , intensifying tornado generation .
So keep your eyes peeled for incoming gravity waves during a storm … tornados may spin to life …

It is customary for the geek lair to contain lots of computers , disassembled electronics , and other gadgets which have long since lived out their usefulness .
Although the geek lair –a nerds equivalent to the all powerful bat - cave– is quite interesting to bear witness to , it often lacks worthy lighting which is replaced by boring light bulbs and florescent eye sores .
Most of the things mentioned hereafter will only send you into a downward spiral when courting the opposite sex .
However your office , bedroom , dungeon , or hidden underground chamber with multiple levels of security , will look awesome .
Tron Cube
The Tron Cube requires a steady hand and some DIY skills , but is simple enough for even the most klutzy and uncoordinated of geeks .
The cube is made of clear plex with a color changing LED bulb and a carefully cut adhesive material on the inside .
$ 10 Cloud Lamp
With most of a geek ’s salary being put towards the latest in tech , a cheap lighting alternative with cool results might just do the trick without leaving a hole in your wallet .
The setup is incredibly simple and is made within minutes using a few household items .
Although the actual lamp does n’t look too cool sitting on a white PVC base , a quick trip to your local flea market should have it looking spiffy in no time .
SteamPunk Lamp
If you prefer the mad scientist / industrial revolution look over the more chic alternatives , a lamp made of copper tubing and cool light bulbs might be your cup of tea .
The best thing about do - it - yourself projects such as these is the fact that you can always add your own flavor to whatever you ’re making .
A few extra pipes , knobs , and maybe an oil pressure gauge would make this look like it ’s right out of Frankenstein .
Philips Living Color Egg
For those who wish to rid themselves of the extra weight in their wallet , Philips has created an egg - shaped device which can be pointed at a wall for the perfect ambient lighting .
The Living Color Egg is controlled via a wireless remote which conveniently indicates every available color and allows you to change the saturation and intensity of the light .
Smooth color transitions and soft hues will definitely bring the romance back into your cave .
Hand Grenade Oil Lamp
Made from an actual grenade , the lamp burns for 24 hours on one refill and provides yet another thing to worry about when leaving the house .
Still , it makes for good conversation before your date leaves after realizing that your entire DVD collection consists of Battle Star Galactica and Star Trek .
Wet Lamp
The Wet Lamp is a little out of the ordinary as far as lighting goes , but the eerie refraction of light through the water will always hold a place in our hearts .
It ’s a little on the expensive side but you turn it on by dipping a silver rod into the water !
This might make for an excellent accessory , while at the same time endangering every piece of work and technology on your desk .
How quaint .
A speaker introducing Republican presidential candidate John McCain at a rally here Tuesday ridiculed Democratic contender Barack Obama for his intention to meet with “ world leaders who want to kill us ” and pointedly referred to the Illinois senator as “ Barack Hussein Obama . ”
Local conservative radio host Bill Cunningham went on to describe Obama as “ a hack Chicago , Daley - style politician who is picturing himself as change . ”
“ When he gets done with you , all you ’re going to have in your pocket is change , ” he said .
McCain later condemned Cunningham ’s remarks and apologized to Obama .
Cunningham ’s introduction came before McCain had arrived at the rally of about 400 people in Hamilton County Memorial Hall .
The radio host told the crowd he ’d had a dream about “ Barack Hussein Obama ’s wonderful life a year from today . ”
In the dream , he said , Obama was president and had just met with Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and was set to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il .
Then , Cunningham said , Obama was going to “ saddle up next to Hezbollah . ”
“ All ’s going to be right with the world when the great prophet from Chicago takes the stand , and the world leaders who want to kill us will simply be singing [ Kumbaya ] together around the table with Barack Obama , ” Cunningham continued .
Some members of the audience laughed , cheered and applauded during Cunningham ’s remarks ; others said they were embarrassed by them .
Speaking to reporters after the rally , McCain apologized for the remarks and said he took “ full responsibility . ”
“ Any offense that was inflicted I apologize for , ” he said , adding that he was outside the building when Cunningham spoke .
“ Whatever suggestion was made that was in any way disparaging to the integrity , character [ or ] honesty of either Sen. Obama or Sen. Clinton was wrong , and I condemn it . ”
Asked whether Obama ’s middle name was an appropriate topic for discussion during the campaign , McCain said , “ No , it is not . ”
“ I absolutely repudiate such comments , and again , I will take responsibility .
It will never happen again , ” the Arizona senator said .
Aides to McCain said Cunningham was invited to speak by local Republican officials who organized the event with the campaign .
McCain said he had never met Cunningham , though Cunningham said he ’d met McCain twice at Ohio events .
Beverly Weeks , a 59 - year - old nurse who identified herself as an independent , said she was “ mortified ” by Cunningham ’s remarks .
“ I ’m . . .
Cincinnati- raised , and to go up and make it comedy . . . " she said .
“ There were people around me . . . who were embarrassed , and some were even saying they wanted to get up and leave . ”
Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said the candidate accepted the apology : “ We appreciate Sen. McCain ’s remarks .
It is a sign that if there is a McCain - Obama general election , it can be intensely competitive but the candidates will attempt to keep it respectful and focused on issues . ”
Cunningham attacked McCain on his radio show shortly after the rally , at one point saying he would vote for Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton .
“ To have John McCain repudiate me when he did n’t hear the remarks at all .
. . .
He did n’t hear ‘ em ! ” Cunningham said .
“ He just threw me under the bus to the national media . ”

· Wind , water and solar sources to fuel building · German parliament to be the world 's greenest
The German Reichstag is expected to become the greenest parliament building in the world , thanks to a decision to rely solely on renewable energy .
From late summer the building is due to swap to green power sources such as water , wind and solar energy , replacing the conventional power that it has largely relied upon until now .
Its extensive refurbishment in the late 1990s , including the glass cupola designed by the British architect Sir Norman Foster , had already won it plaudits .
Ecologists praised the building 's energy efficiency , which has led to a 94 % cut in its carbon emissions .
Its roof makes passive use of solar power and natural light and its thick , well - insulated 19th - century walls help retain warmth in winter and reduce the need for air conditioning in summer .
At the moment biofuel generators in the basement produce 40 % of the building 's energy , for lighting , heating , the flow of air conditioning and water , while the rest comes mainly from coal and nuclear supplies .
But in future the Reichstag , which has been the home of Germany 's parliament for nine years , will go a step further , entirely abandoning conventional sources in favour of renewables , which will be provided by an outside supplier .
A parliamentary subcommittee agreed last week to seek bids from renewable energy producers to replace that conventional power use , and expects to choose a supplier by late summer .
Currently , it costs approximately € 3 m ( £ 2.3 m ) a year to provide the energy that keeps the building 's lights on , air conditioning flowing and water running .
Parliamentarians hope that the switch to clean energy will boost Germany 's reputation as one of the greenest countries in the world and help the renewable energy sector .
Germany has one of the most globally successful and innovative clean energy industries .
Boosted by a subsidy system , around 13 % of its electricity comes from renewable power - mostly wind - a figure that is set to rise to 27 % over the next 12 years .
The greening of the Reichstag fits in with a growing trend in zero-emission homes in Germany , with some homes so energy - efficient that they even produce power .
The owners are allowed to sell their surplus back to the grid for generous returns .
The imagination of the science fiction author Sir Arthur C Clarke bubbled over with ideas about the future of science , technology and human society .
Here , BBC science and technology staff look at some that came true , and some that did not .
1. SPACE ELEVATOR
A space elevator consists of a ribbon of material strung between a spacecraft and an anchor on Earth .
The tether would be used to transport material from Earth into space .
Space elevators would link Earth to objects in geostationary orbit
Sir Arthur first talked about the concept in his 1979 novel The Fountains of Paradise , in which engineers construct a space elevator on top of a mountain peak on a fictional island .
He embellished these concepts in his 1981 technical paper The Space Elevator : Thought Experiment , or Key to the Universe ?
Although he brought the concept of a space elevator to a wider audience , the idea was first conceived by Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1895 .
The idea may sound like it should remain in the realm of science fiction , but many take it seriously .
Nasa has had a long - running space elevator research project , and recent developments with carbon nanotubes have raised the possibility of developing a tether strong enough to connect a ship to Earth - previously one of the key challenges .
For the last three years there has even been a competition , run by the Elevator : 2010 project , which awards prizes of $ 500,000 to help develop the technology .
2. MILLENNIUM BUG
The millennium bug gripped governments and businesses as the countdown to the year 2000 began .
The Y2 K bug , as it was also known , referred to potential problems arising from older computer systems that could not recognise 2000 as the year coming after 1999 .
Some of Sir Arthur 's predictions date back to the 1950s
People were warned not to fly over the New Year , and were told that there could be potential problems with banking and even gas and electricity supplies .
In interviews , Sir Arthur said he outlined what may have been " the first account , outside the technical literature , of the now - dreaded millennium bug , its cause and its cure . "
The prediction was made in a chapter of his 1990 novel The Ghost from the Grand Banks .
In the end , the Y2 K bug had little effect on businesses as the clocks struck midnight .
3. SPACE GUARD
This Clarke prediction not only came true , it did so with the name that he bestowed in his 1972 novel Rendezvous with Rama .
The eponymous rendezvous occurs in 2131 , when astronomers working with Project Spaceguard , Earth 's defence system against asteroid strikes , detect an alien probe hurtling towards the Solar System .
The Hayabusa probe landed on the potato - shaped asteroid Itokawa
Alien probes may not be frequent visitors in reality , but asteroids and meteorites are ; hence a 1992 Nasa investigation into how to monitor these visiting bodies and assess the threat they may pose .
It was named the Spaceguard Survey .
The primary aim of US policy now is to map 90 % of Near Earth Objects ( NEOs ) .
Britain also has a national information service for NEOs , although lobby groups such as - you guessed it - Spaceguard UK would like the government to commit more resources to the issue .
In The Hammer of God , Sir Arthur envisaged that a rogue asteroid could be deflected from its Earth - bound course by landing on it and fitting thrusters .
In 2005 the Japanese Hayabusa probe did land on asteroid Itokawa , though deploying thrusters and attempting a deflection is still science fiction .
4. COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES
Arthur C Clarke was not the first to suggest using geostationary orbits - his ideas built on earlier work by Herman Potocnik and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky .
His conceptual leap , outlined in a 1945 article in Wireless World magazine , was to propose using a set of satellites in geostationary orbit to form a global communications network .
GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITES
1 . Geostationary satellites " parked " over equator travel at same direction and speed as Earth revolves .
Each " footprint " covers 40 % of globe .
Directional antennae are aimed and fixed in position with no need for tracking
2. Satellites at lower orbits must travel faster than Earth revolves to avoid being pulled out of orbit by gravity , so they need tracking .
Many do not follow an equatorial path
The key property of a satellite orbiting precisely 35,786 km ( 22,240 miles ) above the equator is its speed , which mimics the rotation of the Earth below .
So it remains always over the same place .
The first satellite was placed into geostationary orbit in 1964 , just 19 years after Sir Arthur 's paper .
Syncom 3 orbited above the Pacific Ocean and beamed pictures from the Tokyo Olympics to the US later that year - the first trans -Pacific TV transmission .
Networks of satellites in this orbit now provide services including phone calls , data transmission , and TV signals for most of the world 's inhabited regions .
Meteorological and ground observation satellites also follow the path Sir Arthur mapped out , and the term Clarke Orbit is sometimes used to describe their trajectory .
What he did not foresee was the development of the transistor and later the integrated circuit , which mean satellites are far smaller than the objects he sketched out , which would have used valve technology and needed regular maintenance .
5. ATOMIC TRAVEL
Prelude to Space was not only Arthur C Clarke 's first published science fiction novel , it was the prelude to a career that produced a number of suggestions about how humankind might journey into space .
The 1951 book envisaged bringing nuclear energy into use , powering a craft named Prometheus .
Nasa 's Jimo concept would have sent nuclear power into space
Arguably the author was out - imagined by US planners in the early days of the Cold War , whose Project Orion concept involved craft propelled by detonating a series of nuclear bombs behind them .
Orion did not get off the ground ; but life eventually imitated Sir Arthur 's art in the Soviet Union , which launched a number of satellites powered by nuclear reactors .
Cosmos 954 crashed in Canada in 1978 , with contamination of the surrounding area .
Nasa revived the nuclear concept a few years ago with Project Prometheus , a research initiative that would have sent nuclear - powered probes out to explore the cosmos .
Its most heralded component was the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter ( Jimo ) , which would use its huge power source to zoom from one exciting Jovian satellite to the next looking for water and life .
But Nasa 's Prometheus has died ; and there is little sign of any space agency taking the nuclear option further .
6. EARTHQUAKE PREVENTION
In Richter 10 , his 1990 collaboration with science fiction author Mike McQuay , Sir Arthur tells the story of an attempt to predict and prevent earthquakes .
The plan is to " spot weld " the earth¿s tectonic plates at 50 strategic locations , stopping their movement and therefore stopping the catastrophic splits that cause earthquakes .
The welding was to be done by detonating powerful nuclear bombs deep inside the Earth .
The plan is initiated to prevent a huge quake splitting California from the North American mainland .
At the moment this scenario remains almost completely in science fiction .
Earthquake prediction is an inexact science with no standard , reproducible technique used by scientists .
In addition , tectonic forces are huge ¿ able to build mountains , create deep ocean basins and tear continents apart .
" Spot welding " an earthquake fault would probably have very little long term effect when pitted against these monstrous movements .
In any case , the plan outlined in Richter 10 is foiled when a terrorist attack destroys the facility where the work is being carried out .
7. BRAIN BACKUP
Sir Arthur often explored the idea of backing up or transferring the human brain on to a computer .
In his book 3001 : The Final Odyssey he wrote of future beings : " As soon as their machines were better than their bodies , it was time to move .
" First their brains , and then their thoughts alone , they transferred into shining new homes of metal and of gemstone . "
" In these they roamed the galaxy .
They no longer built spaceships - they were spaceships "
It was an idea he thought would be useful for people wanting to pass their memories and personalities on at the end of their lives .
" When their bodies begin to deteriorate you transfer their thoughts so their personalities would be immortal , " he told the BBC in 2005 .
" Just save it on a CD - Rom and plug it in - simple ! "
Although scientists have not quite reached this stage yet , projects are starting to lay the foundations .
For example Gordon Bell , a researcher at Microsoft , is working on a project called MyLifeBits which aims to digitally store " a lifetime 's worth of articles , books , cards , CDs , letters , memos , papers , photos , pictures , presentations , home movies , videotaped lectures , and voice recordings "
The latest version of the project also allows him to capture phone calls , instant messenger transcripts , television , and radio to build up a virtual surrogate memory of his life .
8. PEOPLE FREEZING
Arthur C Clarke 's pre-occupation with interplanetary space travel led him to consider how humans could survive for the long periods needed to cross vast tracts of space .
One of the answers he came up with , outlined in the story The Songs of Distant Earth , was cryogenic suspension .
Cryogenic storage still has a number of issues to overcome
The plot sees the human race having to leave Earth in a convoy of spaceships as the Sun is about to explode .
Currently , cryogenic preservation of living people is impossible , and in many countries it is illegal to attempt it .
More than 150 people , mainly in the US , have been frozen in liquid nitrogen after their death .
But even the companies running these projects admit that freezing cannot be reversed and there is no proof that it would preserve peoples ' identities , even though there is evidence that brain structure can survive the process .
In medicine , very cold conditions are used to store organs before transplantation and to store eggs and sperm , and as a way of removing warts .
Grisly Killing in Germany Woman Flushed Murdered Husband Down Toilet
Police in Germany suspect a 52 - year - old woman of murdering and chopping up her husband .
She told her children : " You wo n't see him again , I flushed him down the toilet . "
Neighbors indeed heard a lot of flushing , and the woman is missing , along with a number of kitchen knives .
WHAT are the consequences of a world in which regulators rescue even the financial institutions whose recklessness and greed helped create the titanic credit mess we are in ?
Will the consequences be an even weaker currency , rampant inflation , a continuation of the slow bleed that we have witnessed at banks and brokerage firms for the past year ?
Or all of the above ?
Stick around , because we ’ll soon find out .
And it ’s not going to be pretty .
Agreeing to guarantee a 28 - day credit line to Bear Stearns , by way of JPMorgan Chase , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York conceded last Friday that no sizable firm with a book of mortgage securities or loans out to mortgage issuers could be allowed to fail right now .
It was the most explicit sign yet of the Fed ’s “ Rescues ‘ R’ Us ” doctrine that already helped to force the marriage of Bank of America and Countrywide .
But why save Bear Stearns ?
The beneficiary of this bailout , remember , has often operated in the gray areas of Wall Street and with an aggressive , brass - knuckles approach .
Until regulators came along in 1996 , Bear Stearns was happy to provide its balance sheet and imprimatur to bucket - shop brokerages like Stratton Oakmont and A. R. Baron , clearing dubious stock trades .
And as one of the biggest players in the mortgage securities business on Wall Street , Bear provided munificent lines of credit to public - spirited subprime lenders like New Century ( now bankrupt ) .
It is also the owner of EMC Mortgage Corporation , one of the most aggressive subprime mortgage servicers out there .
Icelandic singer Bjork performs during her concert the Volta Tour in Tokyo February 22 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Kim Kyung - Hoon
SHANGHAI ( Reuters ) - China will tighten its controls over foreign singers and other performers after Icelandic singer Bjork shouted “ Tibet ! Tibet ! ” at a Shanghai concert last weekend , the Ministry of Culture said on Friday .
Bjork chanted the name of the Chinese - ruled Himalayan region after performing her song “ Declare Independence ” , which she has used in the past to promote independence movements in other places such as Kosovo .
The performance “ not only broke Chinese laws and regulations and hurt the feelings of Chinese people , but also went against the professional code of an artist , ” the ministry said in a statement quoted by the official Xinhua news agency .
“ Any attempt to separate Tibet from China will definitely be opposed by the Chinese people and all righteous men across the world . ”
The ministry said it would investigate the concert and handle the matter according to the law .
It did not elaborate .
Bjork said on her Web site that her references to independence were more personal than political , but she added :
“ The fact that it has translated to its broadest meaning , the struggle of a suppressed nation , gives me much pleasure .
I would like to wish all individuals and nations good luck in their battle for independence . ”
The Free Tibet Campaign , a British - based organization which calls for an end to China ’s rule of Tibet , issued a statement saying it was delighted by Bjork ’s performance .
“ She ’s shown more courage than politicians like ( British Prime Minister ) Gordon Brown and ( British Foreign Secretary ) David Miliband , whose public silence on these issues during recent trips to China is a source of shame for the British people , ” the campaign said .

A unnamed Trinidadian student was arrested for fabricating his transcripts and recommendation when he transferred to Yale from Columbia , and could do 25 big ones in prison if convicted .
There are also possible federal charges for " stealing " thousands in financial aid — although he pleaded not guilty .
You gotta admit the kid showed gumption : we think the whole " college - application fraud " thing may have actually been a piece of performance art !
It 's clearly a comment on the hysteria that spawned an entire college - prep industry , beginning with Baby Einstein and the murderously competitive race to get into the exclusive pre-schools .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - A U.S. Customs inspection of a laptop computer that found child pornography does not constitute an unreasonable search and seizure , a U.S. federal appeals court ruled on Monday .
Michael Arnold argued the U.S. Constitution ’s protections against searches without reasonable suspicion should have barred a 2005 search of his laptop at Los Angeles International Airport upon returning from the Philippines .
He was later charged with child pornography and related crimes .
A lower court agreed with Arnold , but on Monday the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that decision , saying reasonable suspicion is not necessary to check laptops or other electronic devices coming over border checkpoints .
“ Arnold has failed to distinguish how the search of his laptop and its electronic contents is logically any different from the suspicion - less border searches of travelers ’ luggage that the Supreme Court and we have allowed , ” Diarmuid O’Scannlain wrote for a three - judge panel .
Greenspan warns of worst crisis since World War II Reuters

There will be many casualties from the unfolding financial market crisis , which will lead to a large - scale overhaul of international banking regulations , codes and risk management , former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said .
Writing in the Financial Times , the former Fed chief said much of the financial system 's risk - valuation models failed , not because they were too complex but because they were " too simple to capture the full array of variables governing that drive global economic reality " .
" The crisis will leave many casualties .
Particularly hard hit will be much of today 's financial risk - valuation system , " he wrote .
While insisting that current risk management models and econometric forecasting methods remain " soundly rooted in the real world , " he said risk management can never be perfect .
" It will eventually fail and a disturbing reality will be laid bare , prompting an unexpected and sharp discontinuous response , " Greenspan said .
He added , however , that he hoped one of the casualties from the worst U.S. financial crisis since World War Two would not be the spirit of broad self - regulation within financial markets .
Although he said the Basel II international banking regulatory framework would almost definitely be revamped and financial institutions ' financial models would need to be re-drafted , Greenspan warned against over - regulation .
" It is important , indeed crucial , that any reforms in , and adjustments to , the structure of markets and regulation not inhibit our most reliable and effective safeguards against cumulative economic failure : market flexibility and open competition , " he said .
FULL FINANCIAL TIMES ESSAY AT THIS LINK
The Bush administration , never known for its veracity on any issue , once again is playing the “ 9/11 card ” in an desperate attempt to continue violating the Fourth Amendment rights of the American people .
US Attorney General Michael Mukasey , a darling of Senate Democrats prior to his confirmation as Bush ’s top lawyer , said in speech on Thursday at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco that the September 11 , 2001 attacks could have been prevented , “ if the government had been able to monitor an overseas phone call to the United States , ” according to the San Francisco Chronicle .
Mukasey went on to claim that “ we knew that there had been a call from someplace that was known to be a safe house in Afghanistan and we knew that it came to the United States .
We did n’t know precisely where it went .
You ’ve got 3,000 people who went to work that day , and did n’t come home , to show for that . ”
Correctly calling Mukasey on his mendacious pronouncements , Chronicle reporter Bob Egelko writes :
Mukasey did not specify the call to which he referred .
He also did not explain why the government , if it knew of telephone calls from suspected foreign terrorists , had n’t sought a wiretapping warrant from a court established by Congress to authorize terrorist surveillance , or had n’t monitored all such calls without a warrant for 72 hours as allowed by law .
The Justice Department did not respond to a request for more information .
A congressional investigation found in 2003 that the National Security Agency had intercepted messages between one of the Sept. 11 hijackers and an al Qaeda safe house in the Middle East as early as 1999 , but had not shared the information with other agencies .
( Bob Egelko , “ Mukasey Backs Bush Efforts on Wiretapping , ” San Francisco Chronicle , March 28 , 2008 , Page B - 1 )
That we are supposedly to believe that the National Security Agency , the largest and most secretive outfit in the US intelligence “ toolbox , ” was somehow “ blinded ” by “ unreasonable ” civil liberties concerns , and were “ following the letter of the law ” regarding warrantless wiretapping of foreign terrorist organizations , beggars belief .
In fact , prior to , and even after 9/11 , the United States and their favorite clique of murderous intelligence assets , the Afghan - Arab database known as al - Qaeda , were preoccupied with a series of destabilization operations that stretched from Central Asia to the Balkans .
From Chechnya to Kosovo , al - Qaeda operatives and their BND - CIA - MI6 handlers were subverting Russian and Yugoslavian national sovereignty and fomenting rebellion alongside dodgy Saudi and Gulf “ charities ” that served as a cats - paw for Western imperialist interests .
As with all strategic intelligence operations undertaken by the United States and their “ friends , ” the Saudis were playing a double - game : seemingly advancing the regional interests of their US partners in crime , al - Qaeda - linked Saudi “ charities ” were simultaneously wedded to a game plan they hoped would lead to the creation of a reactionary , far - right Islamist beachhead in the heart of Central Europe .
That they did so with US - NATO collusion is beyond question .
According to Balkan analyst , Christopher Deliso :
After 9/11 , the Saudi charity organizations not only became more secretive : they became more hostile , at times showing classic signs of organized intelligence activity .
…
However , despite these abundant reasons for concern , UNMIK signed a memorandum of understanding on February 5 , 2002 , with the Al Haramain Foundation , which was allegedly supporting refugees from Macedonia …
Less than a month after the agreement was signed , on March 11 , 2002 , the U.S. Treasury officially blocked the accounts of Al Haramain ’s Somalia and Bosnia and Herzegovina branches .
Yet the Kosovo branch was left untouched .
Al Haramain , back in 1999 , ran something called the Kosovo Relief Fund out of its Ashland , Oregon , headquarters , back in the days when NATO and the Islamists were fighting for the same goal –expulsion of the Serbs from Kosovo .
At that time , the known terrorist and al - Qadi’s “ business partner , ” Abdul Latif Saleh , who was later mysteriously removed from Albania , questioned , and released by the CIA , was serving as charge de affaires at the Saudi embassy in Tirana .

The United States and their NATO partners continued their brazen , if underhanded , support of al - Qaeda after 9/11 , which had disastrous consequences that reverberated far beyond Afghanistan and Iraq .
On March 11 , 2004 multiple train bombs ripped through Madrid ’s public transportation system killing 191 and wounding 1,755 mostly working - class Spaniards .
The two chief organizers of the Madrid attacks , Saud al - Otaibi and Abdel Karim al Meyati , “ had both fought for the Izetbegovic government in Bosnia during the 1990s , ” according to Deliso .
Three years later , when suicide bombers struck the London public transportation system , killing 52 and wounding 700 individuals , an MI6 / al - Qaeda operative , Haroon Rashid Aswat , was fingered as the mastermind of the attacks .
According to analyst Nafeez Mosaddeq
Ahmed , during a 2001 interview with the London - based Arabic daily al - Sharq al - Aswat , al - Qaeda / al - Muhajiroun leader Omar Bakri described the relationship between British intelligence and the operations in Kosovo and al - Muhajiroun ; Aswat had joined the operation in 1995 :
Bakri boasted that al - Muhajiroun sent Muslim youths on jihad training courses in Virginia , Michigan and Missouri … where they learned various techniques for guerrilla warfare , for making explosives and using shoulder - mounted missiles .
…
The training was organised by a British security firm that is managed by a Muhajiroun member .
In other words , Bakri and his al - Muhajiroun organisation have not merely been tolerated by British authorities despite involvement in al - Qaeda recruitment , terrorist training , and incitement to violence , murder and terrorism ; they were actively protected by British security services in the late 1990s , operating as recruiting agents for British covert operations in the Balkans , especially in Kosovo .
( Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed , The London Bombings : An Independent Inquiry , London : Duckworth , 2006 , p. 153 )
Undeterred by seemingly insignificant things such as facts , The Wall Street Journal ‘s editorial page heartily endorsed the AG ’s “ reasoning ” at the Commonwealth Club .
Mukasey claimed that telecom immunity from lawsuits for their “ cooperation ” with the Bush regime ’s illegal surveillance of American citizens caught in NSA electronic driftnets was “ vital ” :
‘ Forget the liability ’ the phone companies face , Mr. Mukasey said .
‘ We face the prospect of disclosure in open court of what they did , which is to say the means and the methods by which we collect foreign intelligence against foreign targets . ’
Al Qaeda would love that .
The cynics will call this ‘ fear - mongering , ’ but most Americans will want to make sure we do n’t miss the next terror call .
( “ One Missed Call , ” The Wall Street Journal , March 29 , 2008 , Page A8 )
This finely crafted piece of dissimulation by Bush ’s AG is a craven pack of lies worthy of Bill O’Reilly , Fox News or , indeed , the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal .
But what about those phone calls that NSA was presumably unable to monitor and that USAG Mukasey alleges “ could have prevented ” the September 11 attacks ?
Paul Thompson and the History Commons demolishes the claim and reports
Early 2000 - Summer 2001 : NSA Intercepts Communications between Hijackers in US and Al - Qaeda Communications Hub The NSA intercepts approximately 14 calls between the hijackers in the US and an al - Qaeda communications hub in Sana ’a , Yemen , run by Ahmed al - Hada , who is hijacker Khalid Almihdhar ’s father in law ( see August 5 - 25 , 1998 ) .
The first calls are made by Almihdhar and are intercepted during the spring and summer of 2000 ( see Spring - Summer 2000 ) .
More calls are made by hijacker Nawaf Alhazmi after the bombing of the USS Cole in October 2000 ( see Mid- October 2000 - Summer 2001 ) .
The final call from the US is intercepted just a few weeks before 9/11 ( see ( August 2001 ) ) .
The NSA intercepted the hijackers ’ calls outside the US before this ( see Early 1999 and December 29 , 1999 ) and continues to do so in 2000 ( see Summer 2000 ) after Almihdhar returns to Yemen ( see June 10 , 2000 and ( Mid-June - Mid - July 2000 ) ) .
Some of the calls may only contain non-operational information , as they are between Almihdhar and his wife .
[ 9/11 COMMISSION , 7/24/2004 , PP .

However , the calls are also used to relay messages to the 9/11 hijackers .
[ EMBASSY OF YEMEN ( WASHINGTON ) , 2/13/2002 ; MSNBC , 2/14/2002 ; MSNBC , 5/2005 ]
The CIA is the lead agency monitoring the communications hub .
It has planted bugs inside the house and is wiretapping all calls ( see Late August 1998 ) .
Intercepts of calls to and from the hub are a major plank of the US intelligence community ’s effort to fight al - Qaeda .
Also involved is the FBI , which is using phone records to plot these calls on a map ( see Late 1998 - Early 2002 ) .
Some of the calls intercepted by US intelligence come from bin Laden ’s satellite phone in Afghanistan ( see August 5 - 25 , 1998 and Late August 1998 ) .
After 9/11 , counterterrorism officials will say that the number was one of the hottest targets being monitored by the NSA and was an “ intelligence bonanza . ”
[ Los Angeles Times , 12/21/2005 ; WRIGHT , 2006 , PP . 343 ]
As I wrote earlier this month , the NSA — and other U.S. intelligence agencies — did “ connect the dots ” that may have prevented the 9/11 attacks .
That they chose not to do so , reflected Bush administration desires to protect on - going U.S. intelligence operations elsewhere and “ certain foreign interests ” notably those of Saudi Arabia , the Gulf monarchies and Pakistan .
Mukasey ’s posturing is a dodge on two fronts : it continues the 9/11 cover - up narrative first floated by U.S. National Security Advisor ( now Secretary of State ) Condoleezza Rice that “ no one could have imagined ” the 9/11 terrorist operation , that the hijackers “ acted alone ” without active support networks inside the U.S. , and finally , Mukasey ’s duplicities serve as a justification for on - going domestic intelligence operations that target the American people .
The retroactive immunity sought by the Bush administration for giant telecommunications corporations have little to do with “ protecting the Homeland . ”
It is , however , a propitious mechanism for inoculating corporate executives and their shareholders for their criminal complicity with the Bush regime , as America is transformed into a “ post - Constitutional ” police state .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Why should American taxpayers have to pay to bailout reckless lenders and borrowers ?
The website Angryrenter.com , launched just last week , has a vitiation demanding that Congress not pass any bailout programs that reward risky borrowing and lending .
To wit : " Let the free market sort it out ! "
The petition is gathering 40 to 50 signatures per hour , according to spokesman Adam Brandon , who adds that the site is already getting 15,000 visitors a day .
" There 's a huge segment of the country saying , ' We do n't want our money used for a bailout , ' " said Brandon .
AngryRenter.com is backed by FreedomWorks , the conservative , free - market Washington - based lobbying group run by former House majority leader Dick Armey .
" A third of the American public rents , " Brandon pointed out .
" They 're saying ' I 've been saving for a mortgage for years .
I could have jumped in on a subprime loan too .
Now I 'm going to have to pay for a government bailout . "
' We wanted to buy too '
Many CNNMoney.com readers agree , expressing outrage at the idea of seeing their taxes used to keep people in homes they never should have purchased .
" We are both working professionals who would have liked to buy , " said Matthew Haas , a community development organizer who moved to Los Angeles with his wife in 2003 .
They opted not to pay bubble prices , and are still renting despite ample income .
" Now we have hit [ the alternative minimum tax ] and are finding out our tax dollars are going to bail out others . "
" Where is value , morally , as a country ? " he said .
" Is it taking taxpayer money and applying it to people who should never have bought , people who were flippers ? "
Many people would prefer the government do nothing at all to prop up the housing market -- especially those hoping to buy in a more affordable market .
Patrick Killelea has been blogging about the housing bubble at Patrick .
net for four years from San Francisco , where it takes a not - so - small fortune to buy .
" Bailouts reward bad behavior .
I 've been diligently saving , denying myself lots of things so I can afford to buy , yet the government is saying we have to keep all these people in their homes , " said the Web site programmer and author .
" Well , wait a minute !
Why can't I spend more than I can afford and have the government bail me out . "
Fat profits
StoptheHousingBailout.com is another newly minted site devoted to the bailout backlash .
" I just got really angry , " said blogger Morgan Ward Doran , an L.A. - based attorney who is n't professional involved with the housing industry .
" Everyone I hear from is against the bailouts . "
Doran argues that lenders , brokers and home builders all made huge profits by overbuilding houses pushing through poorly underwriten loans , and now they want taxpayers to cushion their fall .
Indeed , there is a provision in the Senate bailout bill that would give extensive tax breaks to home builders , which has some people especially incensed .
The Laborers International Union of North America calculated recently that many of the largest builders , such as Pulte homes ( PHM , Fortune 500 ) and Lennar Corp. ( LEN , Fortune 500 ) , could receive many hundreds of millions of dollars in tax rebates .
" The government thinks it should help the people who cheated and robbed us , " writes CNNMoney.com reader Jordan Fogal of Houston .
Most people who are against bailouts trust the market more than the government .
The fastest way to return to normalcy is to let the market work , according to Angryrenter.com 's Adam Brandon .
He acknowledges that the impact on some homeowners will be devastating , but that things will get even more painful if we do n't let the free market work its magic .
" I feel terrible for people losing their homes , " said Brandon , " but the sooner we let the market sort this out , the sooner we can get back to growth .
When the government gets involved , it can delay the inevitable . "
In yet another set of survey results that surely tells us all we need to know about the state of our great nation , British youngsters innocently state that Sir Winston Churchill was the first man to walk on the moon , the Telegraph smirks .
Befuddled tykes , aged between four and ten , confused the iconic and eerily baby - faced WWII PM with the iconic and completely forgettable - faced Neil Armstrong , who did the lunar - shuffle four years after Churchill 's death .
The results of the survey , commissioned by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in cahoots with the rather more respectable Royal Astronomical Society , sadly suggest that primary school children are perhaps not getting the proper grounding in science they need .
Other sobering results included a third of kids expressing the belief that Earth is not officially a planet .
Where Churchill was concerned , the association appeared to be with a talking nodding insurance dog .
Reassuringly , though , the survey did indicate that children are eager to replace their mental ragbag of Wikipedia - grade unfacts with greater knowledge of astronomy .
The first step for teachers on this path to youngster - enlightenment must surely be to explain the many and significant differences between Sir Patrick Moore and Mr Jonathan Cainer , Esq . ®
A common concern of most Ajax applications has been around their resulting accessibility .
While , arguably , it ’s possible to design some form of a usable web page without the use of JavaScript it should be possible – with the additional scripting information – to provide a better experience to users .
It ’s at this point that the ARIA specification comes into play .
A large set of interaction is defined within it which is able to help web applications communicate directly to a screen reader in an effective manner .
To get a feel for what this interaction looks like , take the example of ARIA Live Regions ( more info ) .
With this functionality it would be possible to keep a live - updated list of users and allow the screen reader to keep up - to - date .
Observe the following ARIA - marked - up HTML :
< b> Active Users :</b> < p id =" users - desc " >A list of the currently - connected users .
</p> < ol aria - live = " polite " aria - relevant = " additions removals " aria - describedby =" users - desc " id =" users " >
< li>John </li > < li> Mary </ li > < li> Ted </li > < li>
Jane</li > </ol >
A couple settings are used to make this piece of HTML particularly interactive to the screen reader ( the actual JavaScript that will update this list is left out – but needless to say nothing , in particular , is needed beyond simple DOM insertion and removal ) .
aria - live= ” polite ”
How polite the live area is ( as in , how likely is it to butt in to what the user is currently listening to / interacting with ) .
The default is ‘ polite ’ – in that it waits until all forms of user interaction have been completed before describing the updates to the user .
aria - relevant= ” additions removals ”
Only notify the user about new node additions and removals .
Since we wish to provide the user with a live list of users we can expect them to be both transitioning online and offline – this will give us the appropriate level of updates to make this possible .
aria - describedby=” users-desc ”
A pointer to the element that describes the contents of the live area .
If the user
wishes to know more about what the contents of the field represent this element can be read to them .
What ’s most important about all of this , though , is that ARIA is n’t just a pipe dream of functionality :
It ’s implemented , today , in Firefox 2 and even more - so in the upcoming Firefox 3 .
The Google Reader team recently took advantage of this and added full ARIA support to their application .
It ’s safe to say that Google Reader is not a trivial application by any stretch , allowing this to demonstrate the feasibility of ARIA within large - scale web application projects .
In the course of their implementation they built a tool , AxsJAX , which injects ARIA usability enhancements into many pages using a bookmarklet , greasemonkey , or Fire Vox ( a Firefox screenreader ) .
They started by seeding a number of Google applications with this drop - in accessibility support ( along with a few others , including the XKCD web comic ) .
I continue to be impressed with what can be accomplished with ARIA – and seeing the work that Google has been putting forth by implementing this functionality in their applications has been incredibly enlightening and encouraging .

There are ( at least ) three different issues you 've brought up --
the use of the term Hybrid NFA / DFA , whether Tcl does what
Michela does , and on - the - fly DFA constructions .
* Hybrid NFA/DFA
The first problem is your use of the term " hybrid NFA / DFA " , which
unfortunately has been defined in Friedl 's _Mastering Regular
Expressions_ to mean something different from what you mean .
Friedl does n't ever define what a DFA or NFA is .
He only says
that NFAs provide submatch information and backreferences , and
DFAs do n't but run faster .
The closest he comes to admitting that
these are n't really definitions is in the sidebar on p.
180 :
As a programmer , if you have a true ( mathematically speaking )
NFA regex engine , it is a relatively small task to add support
for backreferences .
A DFA 's engine 's design precludes the
adding of this support , but an NFA 's common implementation
makes it trivial .
In doing so , you create a more powerful
tool , but you also make it decidedly nonregular ( mathematically
speaking ) .
What does this mean ?
At most , that you should
probably stop calling it an NFA , and start using the phrase
``nonregular expressions , '' since that describes ( mathematically
speaking ) the new situation .
No one has actually done this ,
so the name ``NFA '' has lingered , even though the implementation
is no longer ( mathematically speaking ) an NFA .
What does all this mean to you , as a user ?
Absolutely
nothing .
As a user , you do n't care if it 's regular , nonregular ,
unregular , irregular , or incontinent .
So long as you know
what you can expect from it ( something this chapter will
show you ) , you know all you need to care about .
http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/248
This " quacks like a duck " approach to calling things NFAs or
DFAs cannot accomodate implementations that run a DFA pass first
and then an NFA pass only to find submatches , or that manage to
use nothing but DFAs to find submatches .
So Friedl calls them
" hybrid NFA / DFAs " , because they kind of quack like both .
Table 4 - 1 ( p. 145 ) , which classifies programs by " engine type " ,
lists GNU awk , GNU grep / egrep , and Tcl as " Hybrid NFA / DFA " .
The sidebar on p. 182 expands on this classification :
I 've said several times that a DFA can't provide capturing
parentheses or backreferences .
This is quite true , but it
certainly does n't preclude hybrid approaches that mix
technologies in an attempt to reach regex nirvana .
The
sidebar on page 180 told how NFAs have diverged from the
theoretical straight and narrow in search of more power , and
it 's only natural that the same happens with DFAs .
A DFA's
construction makes it more difficult , but that does n't mean
impossible .
GNU grep takes a simple but effective approach .
It uses a
DFA when possible , reverting to an NFA when backreferences
are used .
GNU awk does something similar -- it uses GNU grep's
fast shortest - leftmost DFA engine for simple " does it match "
checks , and reverts to a different engine for checks where
the actual extent of the match must be known .
Since that
other engine is an NFA , GNU awk can conveniently offer
capturing parentheses , and it does via its special gensub
function .
Tcl 's regex engine is a true hybrid , custom built by Henry
Spencer ( whom you may remember having played an important
part in the early development and popularization of regular
expression [ p. 88 ] ) .
The Tcl engine someitmes appears to
be an NFA -- it has lookaround , capturing parentheses ,
back - references , and lazy quantifiers .
Yet , it has true
POSIX longest - leftmost match ( [ p. 177 ] ) , and does n't suffer
from some of the NFA problems that we 'll see in Chapter 6 .
It really seems quite wonderful .
Thus the use of " hybrid NFA - DFA " to describe Michela 's work
unfortunately makes it sound , to those who know these terms only
through Friedl 's book , like it's no different than GNU grep or Tcl .
Your one - sentence description makes it sound , to me , like it
* is* different from both the awk / grep hybrid and from Tcl ; if
it 's not too late , you might try to change the name to something
other than " hybrid " .
* What does Tcl 's regex do ?
Let 's assume a regexp with capturing parentheses but not
backreferences .
( That is , / the ( cat|dog ) ran / is okay , but
/( cat|dog ) eat \ 1 / is not . )
Let 's also assume POSIX - style longest
match semantics are the goal .
Tcl 's regex first runs an unanchored DFA search to find p , the
ending position of the shortest match ( meaning the match with
leftmost end ) .
If there is no match , stop , returning failure .
If the caller does n't care about any match position info , stop ,
returning success .
Otherwise , it 's time to figure out the exact
position of the leftmost longest match .
The leftmost longest match must start at or before p. Tcl's
regex loops over every character position from the beginning of
the string to p , trying an anchored DFA search to find the length
of the longest match starting at the current position .
When it
finds a match , it stops the loop : that 's the leftmost longest
match .
If the caller only cares about the position of the overall match
( $0 ) but not any of the capturing parentheses ( $ 1 , $ 2 , ... ) ,
then stop , returning success .
Otherwise , it 's time to figure
out the positions of the capturing parentheses .
The algorithm up to this point is :
match ( re , text , match , nmatch )
{
etext = text + strlen ( text ) ;
p = shortest ( /.*re / , text , etext ) ;
if ( p == NULL )
return false ;
if ( nmatch == 0 )
return true ;
for(q = text ; q <= p ; q++ ) {
eq = longest ( / re / , q , etext ) ;
if ( eq != NULL ) {
match [ 0 ] . start = q ;
match [ 0 ] . end = eq ;
break ;
}
}
if ( nmatch == 1 )
return true ;
dissect ( re , match [ 0 ] . start , match [ 0 ] . end , match ) ;
}
The function dissect determines the position of every subexpression
in re , saving the ones corresponding to capturing parentheses .
It does this by recursing over the structure of the regexp and
searching using DFAs corresponding to the subpieces .
To dissect a concatenation , Tcl figures out the longest possible
match for the first half and checks whether the remainder matches
the second half .
If so , done .
If not , find the next longest
possible match for the first half , and so on :
dissect ( re , text , etext , match )
{
if ( re is concat : left right ) {
for ( middle = etext ; middle >= text ; middle = p - 1 ) {
p = longest ( / left / , text , middle ) ;
if ( p == NULL )
break ;
if ( longest ( / right / , p , etext ) == etext ) {
dissect ( left , text , p , match ) ;
dissect ( right , p , etext , match ) ;
}
}
panic ( " cannot dissect concat " ) ;
}
To dissect an alternation , Tcl tries each choice looking for the
one that uses all the text :
if ( re is alt : left|right ) {
if ( longest ( / left / , text , etext ) == etext )
dissect ( left , text , etext , match ) ;
else
dissect ( right , text , etext , match ) ;
}
If dissect comes across a capturing parenthesis , then it can
record the match .
if ( re is capture n : ( subexpr ) ) {
match [n ]. start = text ;
match [n ] . end = etext ;
dissect ( subexpr , text , etext , match ) ;
}
}
( The regexp is actually a directed graph that might have cycles ,
not a tree ; regexps like a* are rewritten into ( aa * | ) . )
Note that there is no backtracking here : each step determines
the subdissection and then moves on .
There is no " and if that
does n't work , ... " .
An obvious optimization would be to make dissect do nothing if
the re being considered contained no capturing parens .
The Tcl
code I 'm looking at appears not to do that .
The run-time of this algorithm is a little tricky to analyze .
On a regexp of length m on a text of length n , and ignoring the
time to construct DFAs / NFAs from regexps ...
If no submatch info is required it takes O ( n ) time .
If only match [ 0 ] is required this it O ( n ^ 2 ) time .
The top - level concatenation dissection requires O( n ^ 2 ) time .
In
the worst case you cut off just one character , making the next
levels O ( 1^2 ) and O ( ( n - 1 ) ^2 ) .
Repeating that gives O( n ^3 ) time .
Alternations might force you to do this multiple times , but no
more than m , which would be O( m * n ^3 ) time .
I 'm not sure how things like repetition or empty strings affect
the run-time .
The fact that a* is rewritten into an effectively
infinite - length regular expression can probably bump the m up
to n , so that you could force O( n ^4 ) behavior if you really tried .
Anyway , at least the run time is polynomial !
* On - the - fly DFA constructions
Thompson 's 1968 CACM paper is hard to classify , since it does n't
mention the terms NFA or DFA .
If you 're willing to read between
the lines then the compiled code is really an encoding of an NFA
that runs a subset simulation as it reads the input .
It 's kind
of building the DFA on the fly , if you view each successive CLIST
as a DFA state , but it 's not caching any of the DFA states that
it builds , so it 's more like an NFA subset simulation .
Since
it does n't cache at all , it 's slower , but it can't possibly build
an exponentially - large machine .
Spencer 's
Tcl regex builds the DFA on the fly from the NFA
representation , using a cache to speed the DFA simulation .
The
cache has a fixed maximum size , though , so it can't end up
building an exponentially - large machine either .

The International Space Station depends on regular deliveries of experimental equipment and spare parts as well as food , air and water for its permanent crew .
From 2008 , Europe 's Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) has been one of its indispensable supply spaceships .
After launch , ATV is well protected at the top of Ariane 5 during a three - minute , high - pressure aerodynamic ascent .
100 minutes after liftoff , ATV becomes a fully automatic spacecraft navigating toward the International Space Station .
ATV uses its laser - guided rendezvous sensors to dock precisely and safely , becoming a habitable extension of the Station .
The 45 m³ pressurised module can deliver up to 6.6 tonnes of equipment , fuel , food , water and air for the crew , and is used to raise the Station 's altitude , which naturally decreases over time due to atmospheric drag .
Six months later , loaded with 6.4 tonnes of waste , ATV separates from the Station and burns up during a controlled reentry high over the Pacific Ocean .
YOUNGSTOWN , Ohio ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Youngstown , Ohio , has seen its population shrink by more than half over the past 40 years , leaving behind huge swaths of empty homes , streets and neighborhoods .
Now , in a radical move , the city - which has suffered since the steel industry left town and jobs dried up - is bulldozing abandoned buildings , tearing up blighted streets and converting entire blocks into open green spaces .
More than 1,000 structures have been demolished so far .
Under the initiative , dubbed Plan 2010 , city officials are also monitoring thinly - populated blocks .
When only one or two occupied homes remain , the city offers incentives - up to $ 50,000 in grants - for those home owners to move , so that the entire area can be razed .
The city will save by cutting back on services like garbage pick - ups and street lighting in deserted areas .
" When I grew up in the 1950s , the city was at its peak , " said Father Ed Noga , who heads St. Patrick 's on Youngstown 's South Side .
" There were kids everywhere and everyone converged on downtown .
You went to eat , to shop and to go to the movies . "
Today , downtown is positively sleepy and even somewhat derelict .
Residents have to drive out of town to shop for clothes or housewares .
And while foreclosures have long been a scourge in this city , they have recently skyrocketed along with the rest of the country , up 178 % in February from a year ago .
" Abandoned houses here are like rainfall in the spring , " said Mayor Jay Williams , " That has gone on for decades . "
Growth strategy failed
For a while , Youngstown , with its population at just over 80,000 , hoped to return to its boomtown roots , when 165,000 residents called it home .
" We long pursued a policy of growth , " said the city 's energetic young mayor .
" We went after all these things that would make Youngstown a city of 150,000 again . "
There were some harebrained schemes .
" A blimp factory was going to put the city back on the map , " Williams said .
" That represents a whole lot of the promises made and broken .
They sound ridiculous now .
President Clinton promised a defense facility employing 5,000 .
We were waiting for a savior . "
They never got one .
But now , Youngstown 's infrastructure - paring strategy may yet become a model for other Rust - Belt cities that must recreate themselves after years of decline .
Already , delegations from smaller , post - industrial cities like Flint , Mich . ; Wheeling , W.Va . ; and Dayton , Ohio , have come to Youngstown to study the plan .
" We 're one of the first cities of significant size in the United States to embrace shrinkage , " said Williams .
It 's an odd way to pioneer .
" The American narrative always includes growth , " said Hunter Morrison , Director of the Center for Urban and Regional Studies at Youngstown State University , which works closely with the city on plan 2010 's implementation .
" No one wants to talk about shrinkage .
That 's too threatening to politicians , civic boosters and Chambers of Commerce . "
The demolitions can yield stark contrasts .
In many neighborhoods , blocks have more empty lots than buildings .
Glory days
Even wealthy neighborhoods , like the North Side historic district , where mill owners and upper management once congregated , have eyesores .
On one corner , there sits a beautifully maintained seven - bedroom Tudor , yet down a side street , a wood - framed colonial is boarded up .
Next door , an empty Victorian sits moldering , the wood of its window frames scorched .
Lines of old hedges mark lot boundaries where once - proud homes stood .
Youngstown used to be the nation 's third - largest steel producer ; its mill workers earned among the highest factory wages in America .
Demand for their services was strong .
" You could graduate from high school one day and start work in the mills the next , " said Noga .
That changed on Sept. 19 , 1977 - Black Monday - when Youngstown Sheet and Tube abruptly closed its doors .
" Five thousand people showed up for work one day and were turned away , " said Phil Kidd , Downtown Director of Events and Special Projects for the city .
" The city lost its heart and soul , " said Mayor Williams .
Within years , all the mills vanished .
Noga recalls seeing idled workers watching as one of the oldest blast furnaces in the valley was dynamited .
" I saw these hard men , shot - and - a - beer guys , standing there crying , " he said .
The city 's East Side stands as a totem to Youngstown 's glory days .
This mostly empty land was readied for development just after World War II - when streets , water and sewer service , signs and utility poles were installed .
But growth never came , and that makes for some strange city streetscapes today .
There are few occupied homes and unkempt woodlands have taken over .
There 's at least one 10 - acre farm and many other large fields .
Some dead - end streets are already uninhabitated and torn up , their outlets blocked with concrete barriers .
Many roads are pitted and potholed ; drivers have to slalom slowly through or face axle - busting jolts .
Lonely water hydrants look woefully out of place sitting on the sides of rural - looking roads .
Today , a new spirit seems to have taken hold .
Phil Kidd started the Web site Defend Youngstown , and said he hears from tons of former residents who would like to return .
" They call and email from all over the United States with suggestions on how to help , " he said .
A fresh start
" I 'm very nervous to have all that space , " said Elsa Higby , the founder of Grow Youngstown , which promotes produce gardening and farmers markets .
" I 'm used to living in 460 square feet . "
Ideally , all this energy surrounding 2010 will help turn the city around .
It does have a lot going for it , including Youngstown State University , which attracts creative - class types like artists and writers and other intellectuals , as well as museums and an excellent public library .
The cheap residential and commercial real estate can be a draw .
Start - up companies thrive on low overhead , and employees can easily find housing just minutes from work .
At the very least , the 2010 plan has changed residents ' perspective , said Hunter Morrison .
" It 's getting us to think about where we 're going into the future , rather than where we 've been in the past . "

One small step for good journalism ..... an perhaps the move towards one giant leap for an open and free American society .
Brad ..
I would not complain about he lack of depth in the coverage ... but would like to ask questions on why Karr felt it was an almost impossible story to cover .
Was it editorial pressure ?
Or simple self censorship because the truth means treasonous acts and a major coverup ?
I was gratified to see something coming out in the somewhat mainstream media of PBS .
Still ... the real story is such a blockbuster sensation that there must be some intrepid mainstream American editor that will allow a more in depth report into print .
We can only hope that our primarily propagandistic mainstream media slips up in the excitement of a Watergate level outing of public official wrongdoing .
[ Except Watergate was not really about a burglary for partisan advantage in an election ... but then I digress . ]

Something is better than nothing at this point .
Take what you can get , say thank you and expand on the crack .
Start sending letters to the editors of news papers and investigative shows .
With everybody paying attention over election stuff , more people would start to hear about the biggest repressed story of national security ever ... that is , if they get published .
You 'll never know unless you try though , and the more people that do it the more pressure against their consorship .

Moyers is a jackass and a tool .
A few weeks ago he asked a question as to " What book would you like the next president to take to the white house & read " there were some 600 request for David Ray Griffin 's book " Debunking 9/11 Debunking "
He completely ignored them all and made no mention of the book even though it was recommended 10 to 1 over any other .
That was blatant censorship of the facts just like this was .
There are no MSM outlets that will touch anything to do with Election fraud & the facts about 9/11 because they all know they are GUILTY of being complicit .
Moyers is no different than the rest .

One day the persecutors of America who are protecting its enemies within , may get to the place where they can admit their atrocities .
Some universal soldiers are coming clean :
Thirty - seven years ago , in the midst of a bitter - cold Michigan winter , 109 Vietnam veterans gathered at a Howard Johnson Motel auditorium in Detroit to tell their stories .
For three days , they told of ransacking undefended villages , attacking civilians , mutilating bodies , torturing Viet Cong suspects , burning houses , destroying Vietnamese property and livestock and killing innocent children .
At the conference , entitled Winter Soldier , the veterans accepted responsibility and mourned for their actions .
But , taken collectively , their words incriminated a much larger culprit : the war itself .
This year , from March 13 to 16 , about 300 veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will follow in the footsteps of their predecessors , gathering for a second Winter Soldier conference , in Silver Spring , Maryland .
Organized by Iraq Veterans Against the War ( IVAW ) it will make up the largest gathering ever of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans .
( Truthout ) .
Sibel , your name will live on in our good memories , but the war criminals will be buried in our disdain and contempt .

I agree Brad .
Nunyabiz , Moyers has been fighting for media reform for several years now .
Attacking him does not help that effort .
Sure we all would like to see a new 9/11 commission report , but its going to take an informed citizenry to get it .
A majority of people still get their information from the korporate owned msm that has profited from 9/12/01 .
He is still respected by a majority of Americans and still on cable where they get their information from .
IMO he is opening up the cracks as quickly as possible without throwing sheeple into a tizzy and rejecting him all together .
Hey Dredd , that 's beautiful , God Bless Them All !

Nunyabiz :
It 's not true that Moyers did n't mention the book .
He talked about it explicitly and acknowledged the fact that it got more votes then any other , but because of the fact it was an organized effort , they rejected the votes .
They wanted people to pick the winners as individuals .
I would have been disgusted if they had chosen one of Ann Colter 's books just because freepers had barraged PBS with E-mails .
Bill Moyers is n't perfect , but has done more then any thousand journalists in this country to get the truth out about lots of important issues !
Let 's not throw the baby out with the bath water !

Yup , I would say old Bill has a little more creds than a few 911 conspiracists " The journalist 's job is not to achieve some mythical state of equilibrium between two opposing opinions out of some misshapen respect — sometimes , alas , reverence — for the prevailing consensus among the powers - that - be .
The journalist 's job is to seek out and offer the public the best thinking on an issue , event , or story . "

Those of you who really want to try and " find the truth " today , if you are near Seton Hall University , try and get close to Marc Grossman , who 's speaking there at 4 PM in a " conversation on diplomacy " with John C. Whitehead at McQuaid Hall .
Perhaps if we can get a " Youtube crew " out there , we can force Grossman into answering one of those questions that Sibel would like to have him answer on the stand now !

Moyers taking baby steps .
It is a beginning .
How about the Blog Clogs in the so called " progressive " blogosphere when it comes to the Israeli Palestinian conflict .
Firedoglake 's Jane Hamsher and Christy Hardin Smith will not touch this critical issue .
Both of these bloggers think that if you put Israel in a title you are writing about this important issue .
When I have posted any challenges on Crooks and Liars about not writing about this issue ... they take it off .
Will the Brad BLog ?
Firedoglake is chicken shit to write about this conflict so is Crooks and Liars .
Hell both of these websites have failed to even mention what is happening in the Gaza .
The I - Lobby has many blogs shut down ANYONE HEAR OR SEE ANY NEWS ON WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE GAZA THE LAST FEW DAYS ON OLBERMAN , MATTHEWS , FOX OR ANYWHERE ELSE ?
Since the majority of the US media is shut down to what is taking place in the Israeli Palestinian conflict .
Here are a few links to here a Palestinian reporter from the Gaza .
Who reports that 130 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli ’s in the last few days … 39 of them children .
Three Israeli ’s have been killed .
The Palestinian reporter describes smelling flesh and seeing arms legs and fingers of Palestinians in the streets
http://www.democracynow.org/
Really worth the listen .. the whole show Amy Goodman also interviews A reporter from the Jewish media outlet Haartz , She reports that there is no news about what is really taking place for the Palestinians in the Gaza .

" " " It 's not true that Moyers did n't mention the book .

==============================================
Nope , sorry but that book he was speak about was in fact " The Art of Non War by Kim Michaels "
The Author herself sent Moyers a book and an email explaining why so many voted for the book , she told her readers on her website to go and vote in the poll to get publicity .
Griffin did no such thing , there were just 100s of individuals that heard about the poll and went there to vote for Debunking 9/11 Debunking and Moyers did not even mention it at all , he completely ignored it just like he does anything concerning Election fraud .
Brad .
I used to think of Moyers as about the last jounalist standing with any integrity at all myself .
I lost that respect a few weeks ago when he showed his ass in that poll .

" " Yup , I would say old Bill has a little more creds than a few 911 conspiracists " "
---- Ummm
I would have to say that more than 36 % of the population which is well over 100 Million people is a bit more than a " few " .
That mind you is even with a total media blackout of all information and with the media actively lying through their teeth spreading propaganda .
Imagine IF we had a real media ?
That of course does n't even include the 100s of millions outside the USA .

Nunyabiz :
It was probably the next Moyers show where he mentioned Griffins book .
Do n't get me wrong , I 'm a huge fan of David Ray Griffin and the 911 movement and there 's no doubt Moyer 's has avoided the voting machine issue and 911 , as everybody else on PBS has , but I still do n't want to throw the baby out with the bath water .
If it 's true they picked the book despite an organized effort , that 's not right .

( CNN ) -- Beaches along the San Diego , California , coast will be closed Saturday after a 66 - year - old man was fatally attacked by what authorities suspect was a great white shark .
Dave Martin , a retired veterinarian , was pronounced dead shortly after the incident , which occurred about 7 a.m. Friday ( 10 a.m. ET ) at Solana Beach , California .
Martin was in a group of nine swimmers " when he was bitten across both thighs by what is believed to be a great white shark , " according to a statement issued by the San Diego County Sheriff 's Department .
" Some of the other swimmers looked back to see the victim up out of the water flailing , and ( he ) was pulled back under the water .
He came up screaming and was helped to shore by four of the swimmers . "
Martin was taken to a nearby lifeguard station , and a medical helicopter was called in , but he apparently bled to death at the scene , the statement said .
Deputy Fire Chief Dismas Abelman said Martin suffered severe injuries to both his legs , although his body was intact .
He was pronounced dead at 7:49 a.m.
Watch officials describe the attack »
The incident occurred in the Fletcher Cove area of Solana Beach near a popular surf spot known as Table Tops , one of the main access areas to Solana Beach , said Sheriff 's Lt. Mike McClain .
A sheriff 's helicopter was scanning the beaches for the shark , and nearby beaches were contacted , Solana Beach officials said in a statement posted on the city 's Web site .
Swimmers were ordered out of the water , and a 72 - hour swimming advisory was posted for an 8 - mile stretch of beach , said Capt .
Craig Miller of the city 's marine safety department .
The beaches remain closed and will be patrolled throughout the weekend , city and county officials told The Associated Press .
City officials noted , however , that they were not trying to capture or kill the shark .
Great white sharks are protected by law in California .
" I would say from my examination of the wounds on the victim and also the narrative that I got about how the attack happened that this almost certainly was a great white shark , " said Richard Rosenblatt , professor emeritus of marine biology at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography .
" I was told that the victim was pushed up out of the water in a violent attack , and that 's just typical of white shark feeding behavior .
They normally feed on seals , " Rosenblatt said .
" They attack from below , make a tremendous powerful rush , make a powerful bite and then pull away and wait for the seal or other marine mammal to bleed to death , and then come back . "
Although there is not a population of great white sharks in the area , females do come down from colder waters to give birth and then return , he said .
In addition , such sharks are remarkable swimmers .
A shark tagged off Monterey , California , turned up in Hawaii , Rosenblatt said , and one tagged in South Africa was found in Australia .
The wounds " were really quite clean and massive , " Rosenblatt said , and typical of those a great white might leave .
If tooth fragments are found at autopsy , he said , it might be possible to identify the type of shark .
However , he said , finding the shark that attacked Martin is unlikely .
Martin leaves behind a family " and a lot of friends that loved him , " said Rob Hill , a friend of the family .
Watch Hill discuss a " great loss " to community »
Police said three trauma counselors were brought in to assist Martin 's swimming partners .
Solana Beach is about 20 miles north of San Diego .
Fatal shark attacks in the area are rare .
According to the San Diego Union - Tribune , the last time someone was killed by a shark off San Diego was in 1994 , when a 25 - year - old woman died after being attacked by a great white shark in Ocean Beach .

History and Origin of the Pledge of Allegiance
The original Pledge of Allegiance was meant as an expression of patriotism , not religious faith .
It made no mention of God .
The pledge was written in 1892 by the socialist Francis Bellamy , a cousin of the famous radical writer Edward Bellamy .
He devised it for the popular magazine Youth 's Companion on the occasion of the nation 's first celebration of Columbus Day .
Its wording omitted reference not only to God but also , interestingly , to the United States :
" I pledge allegiance to my flag and the republic for which it stands , one nation indivisible , with liberty and justice for all . "
The key words for Bellamy were " indivisible , " which recalled the Civil War and the triumph of federal union over states ' rights , and " liberty and justice for all , " which was supposed to strike a balance between equality and individual freedom .
By the 1920s , reciting the pledge had become a ritual in many public schools .
Adding " God " to the Pledge of Allegiance
In the 1950s , Secretary of State John Foster Dulles believed that the United States should oppose communism not because the Soviet Union was a totalitarian regime but because its leaders were atheists .
Hand in hand with the Red Scare , to which it was inextricably linked , the new religiosity overran Washington .
Politicians outbid one another to prove their piety .
President Eisenhower inaugurated that Washington staple : the prayer breakfast .
Congress created a prayer room in the Capitol .
In 1955 , with Ike 's support , Congress added the words " In God We Trust " on all paper money .
In 1956 it made the same four words the nation 's official motto , replacing " E Pluribus Unum . "
Legislators introduced Constitutional amendments to state that Americans obeyed " the authority and law of Jesus Christ . "
The campaign to add " under God " to the Pledge of Allegiance was part of this movement .
It 's unclear precisely where the idea originated , but one driving force was the Catholic fraternal society the Knights of Columbus .
In the early ' 50s the Knights themselves adopted the God - infused pledge for use in their own meetings , and members bombarded Congress with calls for the United States to do the same .
Other fraternal , religious , and veterans clubs backed the idea .
In April 1953 , Rep. Louis Rabaut , D - Mich. , formally proposed the alteration of the pledge in a bill he introduced to Congress .
The " under God " movement did n't take off , however , until the next year , when it was endorsed by the Rev. George M. Docherty , the pastor of the Presbyterian church in Washington that Eisenhower attended .
In February 1954 , Docherty gave a sermon — with the president in the pew before him — arguing that apart from " the United States of America , " the pledge " could be the pledge of any country . "
He added , " I could hear little Moscovites [ sic ] repeat a similar pledge to their hammer - and - sickle flag with equal solemnity . "
Perhaps forgetting that " liberty and justice for all " was not the norm in Moscow , Docherty urged the inclusion of " under God " in the pledge to denote what he felt was special about the United States .
The ensuing congressional speechifying — debate would be a misnomer , given the near - unanimity of opinion — offered more proof that the point of the bill was to promote religion .
The legislative history of the 1954 act stated that the hope was to " acknowledge the dependence of our people and our Government upon … the Creator … [ and ] deny the atheistic and materialistic concept of communism . "
In signing the bill on June 14 , 1954 , Flag Day , Eisenhower delighted in the fact that from then on , " millions of our schoolchildren will daily proclaim in every city and town … the dedication of our nation and our people to the Almighty . "
That the nation , constitutionally speaking , was in fact dedicated to the opposite proposition seemed to escape the president .

‘ A Love Fest ’
Mr. Diamond , 80 , met Mr. McCain when he was a former prisoner of war running for Congress in 1982 .
“ I liked him right away because I respected what he went through in Vietnam , ” Mr. Diamond recalled .
When he got to know Mr. McCain and his wife , Cindy , Mr. Diamond said , “ it became a love fest . ”
Mr. Diamond was already a major player in Arizona real estate and Republican politics .
A tenacious dealmaker who once visited a Mexican jail to close a sale with an inmate , Mr. Diamond had made a first fortune on Wall Street before turning his trader ’s eye to the Arizona desert in 1965 .
He eventually became one of the state ’s biggest landowners , picking up trophies that included the 12,000 - acre Howard Hughes estate , stakes in two of Arizona ’s professional sports teams , the Diamondbacks and the Suns , and , for a time , a Tucson television station .
Over the years , Mr. Diamond and his wife , Joan , visited the McCains at their ranch in Sedona , Ariz . , and entertained them in their Tucson home and in the Bahamas , where Mr. Diamond sometimes keeps his 134 - foot yacht , the Queen of Diamonds .
In 2001 , the two men attended a Yankees - Diamondback World Series game together .
“ He is just very , very good company , ” Mr. Diamond said of Mr. McCain .
“ I knew all his people and the staff . ”
Mr. Diamond and his family have given more than $ 55,000 to Mr. McCain ’s campaigns ( and more than $ 600,000 to other federal candidates ) .
More significantly , the developer has collected ( or “ bundled ” ) hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions from others , and is now serving as a national co-chairman of the finance committee for Mr. McCain ’s current presidential run .
In the spring of 2000 , when Mr. Diamond was in the thick of the negotiations for his California deals , he traveled with Mr. McCain through the early Republican primaries .
Mr. Diamond was on the campaign trail again this year .
In building his empire , Mr. Diamond said he had struggled with local elected officials over land use and zoning issues just like any other developer .
“ They are a pain in the ‘ you - know - what , ’ ” he said .
But associates say he revels in his ability to “ work the system , ” as his friend and sometimes partner , Stanley Abrams , put it : “ Nobody is as connected as Donald . ”
Mr. Diamond is close to most of Arizona ’s Congressional delegation and is candid about his expectations as a fund - raiser .
“ I want my money back , for Christ ’s sake .
Do you know how many cocktail parties I have to go to ? ”

Oldest galaxy pile - up
Astronomers have discovered the most distant galactic collisions yet , a cluster of early galaxies caught merging into one giant galaxy when the universe was just a toddler .
The galactic ' proto - cluster ' , named LBG - 2377 , is a whopping 11.4 billion light - years away and in the past .
It provides a window into a time well after the universe inflated and spread matter far and wide .
But it was still a time when all of that matter was coalescing to make the clusters and super - clusters of galaxies that collectively create the cobwebby structure of matter in the modern universe .
The team used the volcano - top Keck Telescope in Hawaii to capture the image of the galaxies in the act of coming together at about two billion years after the Big Bang .
The discovery was originally part of a broader survey of distant galaxies .
" This particular system showed up as a particularly bright one , " says Dr Jeff Cooke , a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California at Irvine ( UCI ) .
Cooke and his colleagues publish their discovery in the online astrophysics bulletin astro-ph , accessible via the arXiv website .
To be so bright at such a distance , LBG - 2377 must be about 10 times the mass of the Milky Way , say the researchers .
They gleaned the number of galaxies involved in the merger from LBG - 2377 's spectra of light , which contain multiple galactic signals .
Equally important is the fact that the galaxies have been caught in the act of firing up loads of young stars that are very bright in ultraviolet light .
" It was n't at all what I expected , " Cooke says .
" The event is so violent and catastrophic and they are creating so many new stars " that it shines far brighter than any other galaxies or clusters of galaxies at such a distance .
" It 's definitely the furthest merging galaxy cluster . "
How do galaxy 's cluster ?
Scientists think all galaxy clusters form in the same way ; they gather in growing groups over time and sometimes merge to form giant galaxies .
Watching this happen at all ages of the universe helps to test theories of how the universe evolved .
Galaxy clusters closer to earth can contain more than 1000 galaxies .
Our own galaxy belongs to what 's called the Local Group , which contains at least 35 galaxies , most of which are very dim .
" We believe LBG - 2377 is a seed that eventually will grow into a massive galaxy cluster , " says Assistant Professor James Bullock , one of the study 's co-authors and the director of the Center for Cosmology at UCI .
Eager to learn more
Other astronomers agree and are anxious to learn more about LBG - 2377 .
" It 's very rare , " says astronomer Alice Shapley , an assistant professor at Princeton University .
" If you look at the spectra of this object and its picture it breaks up into a lot of pieces . "
But looking at LBG - 2377 in UV and visible light is not telling the whole story , Shapley says .
To properly compare this ancient merger to modern mergers and galaxies , scientists need to study it in other wavelengths .
This way the light of older stars , which do n't emit much UV light , can also be accounted for .
" It will be interesting to use the Hubble Space Telescope to look at it , " says Shapley .

Corbett and the Powalgarh Man-eater
A cool breeze blew over the lush Indian forest .
Jim Corbett was being hunted .
The tigress that stalked him was already credited with at least sixty - four human kills , and Corbett hoped that he was targeted to be next .
Jim leaned against the rocky slope of a nearby hill and lit a cigarette .
The Chowgrath Tigress had already sneaked up on him once in this grove , and he tried to give her the chance to do so again .
As the afternoon waned , however , Corbett decided that she was too canny to try the same trick twice .
He opted to lay one last trap for his adversary before the sunlight failed .
He led a buffalo into the grove , and tied it up securely as it grazed .
If the tigress took the bait she would be able to kill the animal , but would be unable to drag it off .
His intent was to circle behind the nearby hill , climb to the top , and give watch to the grove below .
It would be a shot of over two hundred yards , but over the years he had felled many a beast from such distances .
Even if his long - range shot only managed to wound the man-eating tigress , he would at least be left with a blood - trail to track , and therefore end his months - long hunt .
He set off at a quick pace , anticipating that the tigress would observe his departure and take the opportunity to prey upon the buffalo .
As he rounded the hill in a dry riverbed his pace was n’t so hard as to shut out all distraction : in a shallow depression there rested a pair of Rock - jay eggs .
As an amateur oölogist , or egg collector , Corbett could not pass up these unusual specimens .
He used some moss to wrap them up , and carried the eggs delicately against his belly with his rifle crossed over his chest .
He continued briskly along the sand , hoping to make it to the hilltop before the tigress finished her buffalo feast .
As he squeezed past a large boulder which blocked most of the riverbed , something in his peripheral vision gave him pause : something orange and black , with a predator ’s eyes , poised behind the boulder and ready to pounce .
In that instant he knew he had been outmaneuvered .
With his hands full of Rock - jay eggs , and his rifle hugged against his body , there was n’t much he could do to deflect the imminent attack .
He turned his step into an anti-clockwise spin , set the rifle butt against his hip , and managed to fire a single shot .
For a moment the tiger was unaffected , and stayed coiled on the verge of springing out .
Then her muscles slacked and her head came down to rest on her forepaws .
The bullet had entered the back of her neck , and plunged through to her heart .
After ensuring that the Chowgrath Tigress was indeed dead , he returned the way he ’d come , and believing he could n’t have made that improbable shot without the eggs in hand , he returned them to the nest .
It was the least he could do .
Edward James Corbett was born in July of 1875 , in Kumaon , India at the foot of the Himalayan Mountains .
He was the penultimate of 9 children born to Irish parents , and from the day he was allowed to walk to school on his own , he began taking long excursions through the jungles of India .
He taught himself to mimic the sounds of the forest , to track wildlife , and to watch for warnings .
When night would fall , he had no fear of sleeping anywhere in the wild with only a small campfire for company .
On one such trek , Corbett followed a meager trail and pushed through a plum bush only to catch the attention of the tiger napping inside .
The tiger stepped from cover , and gave him a look that conveyed a message he interpreted as , “ Hello , kid , what the hell are you doing here ? ”
Even in those days Corbett did n’t fear tigers .
He believed that a tiger was keen to leave humans alone and keep to their own business .
As a young adult , Corbett was drawn in with the big - game hunting crowd .
He often accompanied a notorious poacher on illegal hunts where Corbett was educated on the intricacies of India ’s big cats .
He developed into a masterful hunter , learning to read the environment by observing the forest creatures ’ reactions to unseen threats .
At the age of 18 , however , Corbett found more gainful employ with the railways .
His work allowed him to travel much of the country and learn various dialects .
In 1906 , Corbett ’s uncanny hunting skills were called into action once more when a friend and fellow hunter contacted him with an opportunity to use his powers for good instead of evil : to hunt the infamous the Champawat Tiger .
The Champawat Tiger was already credited with 200 human deaths in Nepal before the army drove her out .
In India the tigress took another 234 lives .
Many had sought her , some claimed to have shot her , but her reign continued unabated .
After much personal debate , Corbett approached the ministry , and informed them that he would hunt the Champawat Tiger , but only under his terms : all the rewards for the tiger ’s kill were to be rescinded , and all other hunters to be recalled .
The ministry agreed .
During the months that Corbett tracked her , she continued to prey upon the hapless citizenry .
When Corbett ’s well - placed shot finally felled the formidable beast , he discovered the reason for her diet of tender human flesh : she had been shot in the mouth some years earlier , thereby destroying her teeth beyond use on her natural prey .
Thereafter requests from villages , cities , or even the parliament began in earnest , often reading something like “ We , the public , venture to suggest that you very kindly take trouble to come to this place and shoot this tiger and save the public from this calamity .
For this act of kindness the public will be highly obliged and will pray for your long life and prosperity . ”
Corbett never sought payment or a bounty for his services , regardless the risk to himself .
One such public calamity was the Rudraprayag Leopard .
This animal was said to have a fearlessness which allowed it to push through doors or windows , and on at least one occasion , to claw through a wall .
For eight years villagers between Kedarnath and Badrinath dared not venture out after nightfall , but despite their caution the Rudraprayag Leopard made meals of 125 people .
After months of stalking , Corbett marked one of the leopard ’s favorite trails , set a goat as bait , and climbed into a mango tree .
There Corbett spent ten nights , with only the anxious murmurs of the landscape hinting at the leopard ’s proximity .
Just before midnight on the eleventh evening , he heard the distinct clamor of the goat ’s bell , and snapped on his weak flashlight .
The beam caught a flash of pale fur , and a single shot rang out from the mango tree .
The leopard disappeared into the gloom .
Five hours later , when the clouds broke , Corbett left the safety of his tree to investigate .
There in the silver light of the moon , he found the man-eating Rudraprayag Leopard dead ..
He took no joy from the kill ; the leopard ’s crimes were “ not against the laws of nature , ” Corbett lamented , “ but against the laws of man . ”
After having killed the Chowgrath Tigress with a one - handed shot , Corbett found that she was afflicted by a collection of porcupine quills in her right foreleg .
Unlike most punctures , a porcupine ’s quill will not dissolve , and after years of having the quills embedded the wound was so deteriorated that the tiger ’s muscle was rotted , and the bones cratered with signs of infection .
Most of the big cats taken by Corbett were also assigned a reason for having become man-eaters .
Between 1907 and 1938 , Corbett killed a dozen large cats who were collectively blamed for more than 1,500 human deaths .
While being hailed as India ’s most celebrated hunter of man-eaters , Corbett developed a vast respect for tigers and leopards .
Years spent stalking intelligent and powerful predators through the forests convinced him that these were graceful creatures that deserved respect .
Even these man-eaters held his respect , for he understood that they were merely adapting to their desperate circumstances .
“ The stress of circumstances is , in nine cases out of ten , wounds , and in the tenth case old age , ” Corbett once wrote , “ Human beings are not the natural prey of tigers , and it is only when tigers have been incapacitated through wounds or old age that , in order to survive , they are compelled to take to a diet of human flesh . ”
Indeed , Corbett admired the wild tiger as “ a large - hearted gentleman with boundless courage ” , and he urged India ’s people to rally for the conservation of “ the finest of her fauna . ”
In a time when a hunter was measured for how many fearsome animals he could kill , Corbett exuded pride at never having killed a large cat for sport or financial gain .
He refused even to hunt leopards which were often regarded as vermin at the time .
“ Those who have never seen a leopard , ” he said , “ can have no conception of the grace of movement , and beauty of colouring of this the most graceful and the most beautiful in our Indian jungles .
Nor are his attractions limited to outward appearances , for pound for pound , his strength is second to none , and in courage he lacks nothing . ”
Corbett began lectures in various schools and nature societies with a message to protect the vanishing tiger and leopard populations .
He referred to his youth as “ days when there were ten tigers to every one that now survives . ”
Corbett aided in the organization of Hailey National Park , the Association for the Preservation of Game in the United Provinces , and the All - India Conference for the Preservation of Wild Life much to the dismay of the some of the sport - hunters that had called him friend over the years .
Rudraprayag leopard
During the 1930s , Corbett ’s hunt for India ’s cats had turned almost exclusively to shooting them with a camera .
No one was able to match Corbett ’s knack for approaching tigers .
On one expedition Corbett found that the clicking of his camera was disturbing his quarry , and therefore built a crude dam in a nearby creek so the burbling water would mask the sound .
When World War II began Corbett was 64 years old .
He promptly volunteered to train Allied troops the skills of jungle survival .
After the war Lieutenant Colonel Corbett retired to Kenya where his conservation efforts redoubled , and he penned six books before he passed away in 1955 .
Two years later , India ’s first national park was renamed to The Corbett National Park .
Visitors there often seek to spy a tiger in the wild .
Although there are many tigers there , that particular park is unfortunately not home to Jim ’s namesake : the Panthera tigris corbetti , also known as the Indochinese tiger , or Corbett ’s tiger .
In 1875 , there were more than 100,000 tigers in the world .
In 2007 there was only one tiger alive for every fifteen that lived during Jim Corbett ’s childhood .
Had it not been for the intervention of this large - hearted gentleman , it is almost certain that there would be far fewer⁠ — if any⁠ — of these remarkable animals alive today .

ESPAÑOLA , N.M.  Eric Lucero has been addicted to heroin for three decades and says he has known at least 100 people in this pastoral county who died from overdoses , some in his presence .
But Mr. Lucero has recently become a popular  and , he would argue , safer  injection buddy .
Seven times , he says , he has revived companions by using an anti-overdose drug , Narcan , which the state now hands out to addicts and their relatives as part of its effort to reduce the toll of one of the country ’s most pervasive epidemics of narcotics use .
Mr. Lucero , 48 , said , “ People know I ’m good at saving them . ”
Rio Arriba County , just north of Santa Fe , is a Georgia O’Keeffe landscape of juniper - dotted desert and mountain valleys populated mostly by Hispanics who proudly trace their lineage to settlers of the 1600s  and who , a decade ago , discovered that their county had the nation ’s highest per capita rate of deaths from overdoses .
Hundreds of families are struggling to live with a multigenerational plague of narcotics ; Mr. Lucero ’s own son is addicted .
Federal data released in March showed that the county ranked first in drug fatalities for 2001 to 2005 , with a death rate of 42.5 per 100,000 , compared with a national average of 7.3 .
New high speed rail lines are speeding ahead in Asia .
The bullet train in Taiwan opened last year , and China started the construction of the high speed rail link between Beijing and Shanghai last week .
Now , Hong Kong and mainland China are planning to build a high speed rail between Hong Kongand Guangzhou ( Canton ) .
Called the Guangzhou - Shenzhen - Hong Kong Express Rail Link , the line will reduce the travel time in half to travel between Guangzhou and Hong Kong to 48 minutes .
The time to travel between Shenzhen and Hong Kong will be 14 minutes .
Hong Kong and mainland China , especially in Shenzhen , have close economic ties .
By building this rail line , governments hope to see a major boost to the region 's economy .
The Hong Kong Government has chosen the MTR Corporation , a private company that runs the city 's subway system , to design and plan the Hong Kong section of the line .
This 26 - km section will include a tunnel through the New Territories .
The line will then connect into the current Airport Express tracks , but later branch off to a planned terminus in West Kowloon .
The $ 39.5 billion Hong Kong ( $ 5 billion US ) project will start construction in 2009 and finish by 2015 .
The estimated ridership is 120,000 daily passengers by 2030 .

if - xemacs
sudo rm - rf xemacs
And you thought I 'd given up on controversial blogs .
Hah !
This must be said : Jamie Zawinski is a hero .
A living legend .
A major powerhouse programmer who , among his many other accomplishments , wrote the original Netscape Navigator and the original XEmacs .
A guy who can use the term " downward funargs " and then glare at you just daring you to ask him to explain it , you cretin .
A dude with arguably the best cat - picture blog ever created .
I 've never met him , but I 've been in awe of his work since 1993 - ish , a time when I was still wearing programming diapers and needing them changed about every 3 hours .
Let 's see ... that would be 15 years ago .
I 've been slaving away to become a better programmer for fifteen years , and I 'm still not as good — nowhere near as good , mind you — as he was then .
I still marvel at his work , and his shocking writing style , when I 'm grubbing around in the guts of the Emacs - Lisp byte - compiler .
It makes you wonder how many of him there are out there .
You know , programmers at that level .
He can't be the only one .
What do you suppose they 're all working on ?
Or do they all eventually make 25th level and opt for divine ascension
In any case , I 'm sad that I have to write the obit on one of his greater achievements .
Sorry , man .
Keep up the cat blog .
I have to include a teeny history lesson .
Bear with me .
It 's short .
XEmacs was a fork of the GNU Emacs codebase , created about 17 years ago by a famous - ish startup called Lucid Inc. , which , alas , went Tango Uniform circa 1994 .
As far as I know , their two big software legacies still extant are a Lisp environment now sold by LispWorks , and XEmacs .
I 'd also count among their legacies an absolutely outstanding collection of software essays called Patterns of Software , by Lucid 's founder , Richard P. Gabriel .
I go back and re-read them every year or so .
They 're that good .
Back when XEmacs was forked , there were some fireworks .
Nothing we have n't seen many times before or since .
Software as usual .
But there was a Great Schism .
Nowadays it 's more like competing football teams .
Tempers have cooled .
At least , I think they have .
As for the whole sordid history of the FSF - Emacs / XEmacs schism , you can read about it online .
I 'm sure it was a difficult decision to make .
There are pros and cons to forking a huge open - source project .
But I think it was the right decision at the time , just as decomissioning it is the right decision today , seventeen years later .
XEmacs dragged Emacs kicking and screaming into the modern era .
Among many other things , XEmacs introduced GUI widgets , inline images , colors in terminal sessions , variable - size fonts , and internationalization .
It also brought a host of technical innovations under the hood .
And XEmacs has always shipped with a great many more packages than GNU Emacs , making it more of a turnkey solution for new users .
XEmacs was clearly an important force helping to motivate the evolution of GNU Emacs during the mid- to late - 1990s .
GNU Emacs was always playing catch - up , and the dev team led by RMS ( an even more legendary hacker - hero ) complained that XEmacs was n't really playing on a level field .
The observation was correct , since XEmacs was using a Bazaar - style development model , and could move faster as a direct consequence .
A lot of people were switching over to XEmacs by the mid-1990s : the fancy widgets and pretty colors attracted GNU Emacs users like moths to a bug - zapper .
Problem was , it could actually zap you .
I personally tried to use XEmacs many times over a period of many years .
I was jealous of its features .
However , I never managed to use XEmacs for very long , because it crashed a lot .
I tried it on every platform I used between ~ 1996 and 2001 , including HP / UX , SunOS , Solaris , Ultrix , Linux , Windows NT and Windows XP .
XEmacs would never run for more than about a day under moderate use without crashing .
I 've argued previously that one of the most important survival traits of a software system is that it should never reboot .
Emacs and XEmacs are at the leading edge of living software systems , but XEmacs has never been able to take advantage of this property because even though it can live virtually forever , it 's always tripping and falling down manholes .
Clumsy XEmacs .
Clumsy !
I assume its propensity for inopportune heart attacks is a function of several things , including ( a ) old - school development without unit tests , ( b ) the need to port it to a gazillion platforms , including many that nobody actually uses , ( c ) a culture of rapid addition of new features .
There are probably other factors as well .
I 'm just speculating though .
All I know is that it 's always been very , very crashy .
It does n't actually matter what the reasons are , since there 's no excuse for it .
Interestingly , most XEmacs users I 've talked to say they do n't notice the crashing .
I 'm sure this is because it 's all relative .
XEmacs does n't crash any more often than Firefox , for instance .
Probably less often .
When Firefox crashes I make a joke about it and restart it , because the crashing rarely has an impact .
It even restores your state properly most of the time , so it 's just a minor blip , an almost trivial inconvenience , so long as whatever text field you happen to be editing has an auto - save feature .
And most of the good ones do .
XEmacs may crash even less than Eclipse and IntelliJ .
Crashing editors usually are n't a big problem .
Programmers all learn the hard way to save their buffers frequently .
For me , saving is like punctuation ; I save whenever my typing pauses , out of reflex .
Does n't matter whether it 's Emacs or NeoOffice or GMail or ... do I use any other apps ?
Oh yeah , or the Gimp .
When I pause , I save , and if you 're a programmer I bet you do too .
So occasional crashes may seem OK .
Another reason the crashes are n't called out more often is that most Emacs and XEmacs users are at best casual users .
They open up an { X} Emacs session whenever they need to edit a file , and close it when they 're done .
It 's just Notepad with colors and multi-level Undo .
If your average session length is shorter than the editor 's MTBF , then yeah , you 're not going to notice much crashing .
In contrast , your more ... ah , seasoned ( read : fanatical ) Emacs users gradually come to live in it .
Anything you can't do from within Emacs is an annoyance .
It 's like having to drive to a government building downtown to take care of some random paperwork they should have been offering as an online service a decade ago .
You can live with it , but you 're annoyed .
Even Firefox , the other big place I live , really wants to be Emacs .
Tabs do n't scale .
Tabbed browsing was revolutionary in the same way adding more tellers to a bank was revolutionary : it 's , like , 4 x better .
w00t .
Emacs offers the unique ability to manage its open buffers in another first - class buffer , as a list .
Imagine what your filesystem life would be like if the only view of a directory was one tab per file .
Go to your pictures directory and watch it start vomiting tabs out like it tried to swallow a box of chiclets .
Fun !
I feel sad when I see Eclipse users with fifty open tabs , an army of helpful termites eating away at their screen real - estate and their time .
I have a feeling I 've veered off course somewhere ... where was I ?
Oh yeah .
Crashing .
So XEmacs has never been a particularly good tool for serious Emacs users because even though it 's written in C , it crashes like a mature C++ application .
You know the drill : major faceplants , all the fugging time .
Your ability to become an inhabitant of Emacs is gated by how stable it is .
GNU Emacs has always been famously stable .
Sure , the releases happen less frequently than presidential inaugurations .
Sure , for a long time it always lacked some XEmacs feature or other .
But it 's really , really stable .
Its MTBF is measurable in weeks ( or even months , depending on what you 're doing with it ) as opposed to hours or days .
Emacs , like Firefox , can be configured to back up your state periodically , so that in theory it can recover after a crash .
That 's part of the problem : you did n't actually have to configure Firefox to get that behavior .
It does it automatically .
And to be honest , I 've never had much luck with the Emacs save - state facilities .
I'm a pretty competent elisp hacker these days , but thehas never worked reliably for me .
I could probably get it to work , but I 've always found it easier to write specialized startup " scripts " ( lisp functions ) that load up particular favorite configurations .
If I can't get desktop - save working , I 'd guess that fewer than 1/10th of 1 percent of Emacs users use that feature .
So crashes blow everything away .
If the state is n't being auto - saved , the next best thing is for it not to crash .
XEmacs never got that right .
I just realized I 'm going to get screamed at by people who think I 'm just an XEmacs - hater slash GNU - fanboy .
Make no mistake : I 'm a fan of XEmacs .
I think it was a great ( or at least , necessary ) idea in 1991 .
I think the execution , aside from the stability issue , was top - notch .
I think it had a good architecture , by and large , at least within the rather severe constraints imposed by Emacs Lisp .
I think it spurred competition in a healthy way .
I think the XEmacs development team , over the years , has consisted of engineers who are ALL better than I am , with no exceptions .
And I even like certain aspects of the interface better , even today now that GNU Emacs has caught and surpassed XEmacs in features .
For instance , I like the XEmacs " apropos " system better .
If you 're going to scream at me for irrational reasons , it really ought to be for the right irrational reasons .
Legitimate dumb reasons for screaming at me include : you 're lazy and do n't want to learn anything new ; you invested a lot of time in XEmacs and do n't see why you should be forced to switch ; you are a very slow reader , causing you to skip three out of every five words I write , resulting in your receipt of a random approximation of my blog content , with a high error bar ; you 're still mad about my OS X blog .
All good bad reasons .
Heck , you could even scream for rational reasons .
Perhaps you have a philosophical beef with the FSF or GPL3 .
Perhaps XEmacs still has some vestiges of feature support that do not yet exist in GNU Emacs , and you truly can't live without them .
I would think you 're being a teeny bit uptight , but I would respect your opinion .
Whatever you do , just do n't yell at me for thinking I 'm dissing XEmacs or taking some sort of religious stance .
Far from it .
I just want a unified Emacs - o- cratic party .
GNU
Emacs pulled into the lead in , oh ...
I 'd say somewhere around maybe 2002 ?
2003 ?
I was n't really keeping track , but one day I noticed Emacs had caught up .
Even today I maintain XEmacs / FSF - Emacs compatibility for my elisp files – some 50 k lines of stuff I 've written and maybe 400 k lines of stuff I 've pilfered from EmacsWiki , friends , and other sources .
I still fire up XEmacs whenever I need to help someone get un - stuck , or to figure out whether some package I 've written can be coerced to run , possibly in restricted - feature mode , under XEmacs .
For years I chose stability over features .
And then one day GNU Emacs had ... well , everything .
Toolbars , widgets , inline images , variable fonts , internationalization , drag - and - drop in and out of the OS clipboard ( even on Windows ) , multi-tty , and a long laundry - list of stuff I 'd written off as XEmacs - only .
And it was still stable .
Go figure .
I do n't have the full feature - compatibility list .
Does it even exist ?
You know , those tables that have little red X's if the Evil Competitor product is missing some feature your product offers , and little green checkmarks , and so on .
We ought to make one of those .
It would be useful to know what ( if any ) XEmacs features are preventing the last holdouts from migrating to FSF Emacs .
But for the past five years or so , just about every time an XEmacs user on a mailing list has mentioned a feature that 's keeping them from switching , it 's been solved .
If GNU Emacs is n't a perfect superset of XEmacs yet , I 'm sure we could get it there if we had the big unified - platform carrot dangling in front of us .
And I bet it 's pretty close already .
Features and stability aside , XEmacs is looking pretty shabby in the performance department .
Its font - lock support has never been very fast , and a few years back GNU Emacs took a giant leap forward .
XEmacs can take 4 or 5 seconds or longer to fontify a medium - sized source file .
Sure , it shows that big progress bar in the middle of the screen , so you know it 's not dead , but when you 're used to it being almost instantaneous , coming back to XEmacs is a real shocker .
And XEmacs has bugs .
Man , it has a lot of bugs .
I can't begin to tell you how many times I 've had to work around some horrible XEmacs problem .
It has bugs ( e.g. in its fontification engine and cc-engine ) that have been open for years , and they can be really painful to work around .
I 've had to take entire mode definitions andthem , using an ancient version of the mode for XEmacs because nothing even remotely recent will run .
You may not notice the bugs , but as elisp developers , we feel the pain keenly .
As if issues with stability , performance and bugs were n't enough , XEmacs has yet another problem , which is that its APIs for dealing with UI elements ( widgets and input events , but also including things like text properties , overlays , backgrounds and other in - buffer markup ) are basically completely different from their GNU - Emacs counterparts .
The two Emacsen share a great deal of common infrastructure at the Lisp level : they have mostly compatible APIs for dealing with files , buffers , windows , subprocesses , errors and signals , streams , timers , hooks and other primitives .
But their APIs range from mildly to completely different for keyboard and mouse handling , menus , scrollbars , foreground and background highlighting , dialogs , images , fonts , and just about everything else that interfaces with the window system .
The GUI and display code for any given package can be a significant fraction of the total effort , and it essentially has to be rewritten from scratch when porting from GNU Emacs to XEmacs or vice - versa .
Unsurprisingly , many package authors just do n't do it .
The most famous example I can think of is James Clark 's nxml - mode , which claims it 'll never support XEmacs .
I found that pretty shocking , since I thought it was basic Emacs etiquette to try to support XEmacs , and here James was cutting all ties , all public about it and everything .
Wow .
But I totally understand , since I really do n't want to rewrite all the display logic for my stuff either .
I 'll be the first to admit : the API discrepancies are not XEmacs 's fault .
I can't see how they could be , given that for nearly all these features , XEmacs had them first .
For a developer trying to release a productivity package , it does n't really matter whose fault it is .
You target the platform that will have the most users .
I do n't know what XEmacs 's market share is these days , but I 'd be very surprised if it 's more than 30 % .
That 's a big number , but when you 're an elisp hacker creating an open - source project in your limited spare time , that number can start looking awfully small .
Teeny , even .
At this point it 's becoming painful to watch .
GNU Emacs is getting all the superdelegates .
That warmonger VIM is sitting back and laughing at us .
But XEmacs just wo n't quit !
I'm sure there are a few old - timers out there who still care about the bad blood that originally existed between the two projects .
To everyone else it 's ancient history .
As far as I can tell , there has been an atmosphere of polite ( if subdued ) cooperation between the two projects .
Each of them has incorporated some compatibility fixes for the other , although it 's still mostly up to package authors to do the heavy lifting of ensuring compatibility , especially for display code .
I have n't seen any XEmacs / GNU - Emacs flamewars in a long time , either .
We 're all just * Emacs users , keeping our community alive in the face of monster IDEs that vomit tabs , consume gigabytes of RAM , and attract robotic users who will probably never understand the critical importance of customizing and writing one 's own tools .
When the Coke / Pepsi discussion comes up these days , it 's usually an XEmacs user asking , in all seriousness , whether they should transition to GNU Emacs , and if so , would someone volunteer to help migrate their files and emulate their favorite behaviors .
Yes , someone will volunteer .
I promise .
I 've got good news and bad news .
The good news is : Emacs is a revolutionary , almost indescribably QWAN - infused software system .
Non-Emacs users and casual users simply can't appreciate how rich and rewarding it is , because they have nothing else to compare it to .
There are other scriptable applications and systems out there — AppleScript , Firefox , things like that .
They 're fun and useful .
But Emacs is self - hosting : writing things in it makes the environment itself more powerful .
It 's a feedback loop : a recursive , self - reinforcing , multiplicative effect that happens because you 're enhancing the environment you 're using to create enhancements .
When you write Emacs extensions , sometimes you 're automating drudgery ( always a good thing ) , sometimes you 're writing new utilities or apps , and sometimes you 're customizing the behavior of existing utilities .
This is n't too much different from any well - designed scriptable environment .
But unlike in other environments , sometimes you 're improving your editing tools and / or your programming tools for Emacs itself .
This notion of self - hosting software is something I 've been wanting to blog more about , someday when I understand it better .
Eclipse and similar environments want to be self - hosting , but they 're not , because Java is not self - hosting .
In spite of Java 's smattering of dynamic facilities , Java remains as fundamentally incapable of self - hosting as C ++.
Self - hosting only works if the code can " fold " on itself and become more powerful while making itself smaller and cleaner .
I 'm not really talking about macros here , even though that 's probably the first thing you thought of .
I 'm thinking more along the lines of implementing JITs and supercompilers in the hosted runtime , rather than in the C++ or Java " hardware " substrate , which is where everyone puts them today .
I suspect ( without proof ) that in self - hosted environments , you can eventually cross a threshold where your performance gains from features implemented in the hosted environment outpace the gains from features in the substrate , because of this self - reinforcing effect : if code can make _itself_ faster and smarter , then it will be faster and smarter at making itself faster and smarter .
In C++ and Java , making this jump to the self - reinforcing level is essentially intractable because , ironically , they have so many features ( or feature omissions ) for the sake of performance that they get in their own way .
To be sure , Emacs , the current crop of popular scripting languages , and other modestly self - hosting environments are all pretty far from achieving self - reinforcing performance .
But Emacs has achieved it for productivity – at least , for the relatively small percentage of Emacs users who learn enough elisp to take advantage of it .
There are just enough of us doing it to generate a steady supply of new elisp hackers , and the general - purpose artifacts we produce are usually enough to keep the current crop of casual users happy .
I 've argued that Emacs is in a special self - reinforcing software category .
For productivity gains , that category can only be occupied by editors , by definition , and Emacs is currently way ahead of any competition in most respects .
So most Emacs users have felt safe in the assumption that IDEs are n't going to replace Emacs .
Unfortunately , Emacs is n't immunized against obsolescence .
It still needs to evolve , and evolve fast , if it 's going to stay relevant .
The same could be said of any piece of software , so this should n't be news .
But it 's particularly true for Emacs , because increasing numbers of programmers are being lured by the false productivity promises of IDEs .
They really are false promises : writing an Eclipse or IntelliJ ( or God help you , Visual Studio ) plugin is a monumental effort , so almost nobody does it .
This means there 's no community of building and customizing your own tools , which has long been the hallmark of great programmers .
Moreover , the effort to create a plugin is high enough that people only do it for really significant applications , whereas in Emacs a " plugin " can be any size at all , from a single line of code up through enormous systems and frameworks .
Emacs has the same learning - curve benefit that HTML had : you can start simple and gradually work your way up , with no sudden step - functions in complexity .
The IDEs start you off with monumental API guides , tutorials , boilerplate generators , and full - fledged manuals , at which point your brain switches off and you go over to see what 's new on reddit .
( " PLEASE UPMOD THIS PIC ITS FUNNY ! " )
And let 's not even get into the Million Refactorings yet .
It 's a blog I 've been working on for years , and may never finish , but at some point I 'd like to try to show IDE users , probably through dozens or even hundreds of hands - on examples I 've been collecting , that " refactoring " is an infinite spectrum of symbol manipulation , and they have , um , twelve of them .
Maybe it 's thirteen .
Thirteen out of infinity – it's a start !
Programmers are being lured to IDEs , but the current crop of IDEs lacks the necessary elements to achieve self - hosting .
So the only damage to Emacs ( and to programmers in general ) is that the bar is gradually going down : programmers are no longer being taught to create their own tools .
IDEs are draining users away , but it's not the classic fat - client IDEs that are ultimately going to kill Emacs .
It 's the browsers .
They have all the power of a fat - client platform and all the flexibility of a dynamic system .
I said earlier that Firefox wants to be Emacs .
It should be obvious that Emacs also wants to be Firefox .
Each has what the other lacks , and together they 're pretty damn close to the ultimate software package .
If Emacs can't find a way to evolve into ( or merge with ) Firefox , then Firefox or some other extensible browser is going to eclipse Emacs .
It 's just a matter of time .
This would n't be a bad thing , per se , but there 's a good chance it would be done poorly , take forever , and wind up being less satisfying than if Emacs were to sprout browser - like facilities .
So Emacs needs to light a fire and hurry up and get a better rendering engine .
Port to XUL , maybe ?
I do n't know , but it 's currently too limited in the application domains it can tackle .
I realize this is a very hard problem to solve , but it needs to happen , or at some point a rendering engine will emerge with just enough editing power to drain the life from Emacs .
Emacs also needs to take a page from the JVM / CLR / Parrot efforts and treat itself as a VM ( that 's what it is , for all intents ) and start offering first - class support for other languages .
It 's not that there 's anything wrong with Lisp ; the problem is X programmers .
They only want to use X , so you have to offer a wide range of options for X . Emacs could be written in any language at all , take your pick , and it would n't be good enough .
RMS had this idea a long , long time ago ( when he was making the rather controversial point that Tcl is n't a valid option for X ) , and it eventually led to Guile , which led more or less nowhere .
Not surprising ; it 's a phenomenally difficult challenge .
There are really only two VMs out there that have achieved even modest success with hosting multiple languages : the CLR and the JVM .
CLR 's winning that race , although it 's happening in a dimension ( Windows - land ) that most of us do n't inhabit .
Parrot is ... trying really hard .
Actually , I should probably mention LLVM , which ( like Parrot ) was designed from the ground up for multi-language support , but took a lighter - weight approach .
So let 's call it four .
In any case , it 's a small very group of VMs , and they still have n't quite figured out how to do it : how to get the languages to interoperate , how to get languages other than the first to perform decently , and so on .
This is clearly one of the hardest technical challenges facing our industry for the next 10 years , but it 's also one of the most obviously necessary .
And Emacs is going to have to play that game .
I 'm not talking about hacked - together process bridges like PyMacs or el4r , either — I mean first - class support and all that it entails .
I 've mentioned the rendering engine and the multi-language support ; the last major hurdle is concurrency .
I do n't know the answer here , either , but it needs an answer .
Threads may be too difficult to support with the current architecture , but there are other options , and someone needs to start thinking hard about them .
Editing is becoming a complicated business — too complicated for hand - rolling state machines .
So Emacs has some very serious changes ahead .
Let 's face it : we 're not going to see real change unless ALL the Emacs developers out there – today 's crop of JWZs – band together to make it happen .
But today we 're divided .
Two groups of brilliant C hackers working on separate , forked code bases ?
That 's bad .
Two groups of maniacal elisp hackers working on incompatible packages , or at best wasting time trying to achieve compatibility ?
Also bad .
Developers are starting to wake up and realize that the best " mainstream " extensible platform ( which excludes Emacs , on account of the Lisp ) is Firefox or any other non-dead browser ( which excludes IE ) .
Dynamic typing wins again , as it always will .
Dynamic typing , property - based modeling and non-strict text protocols won the day for the web , and have resisted all incursions from heavyweight static replacements .
And somehow the web keeps growing , against all the predictions and lamentations of the static camp , and it still works .
And now the browsers are starting to sprout desktop - quality apps and productivity tools .
It wo n't be long , I think , before the best Java development environment on the planet is written in JavaScript .
Emacs has to compete or die .
If Firefox ever " tips " and achieves even a tenth of the out - of - the - box editing power of Emacs , not just for a specific application but for all web pages , widgets , text fields and system resources , Emacs is going to be toast .
I may be the last rat on the ship , but I 'm sure not going down with it ; even _I_ will abandon Emacs if Firefox becomes a minimally acceptable extensible programmer 's editor .
This is a higher bar than you probably think , but it could happen .
We no longer need XEmacs to spur healthy competition .
The competition is coming in hard from entirely new sources .
What we need now is unity .
I threw this in just in case you blew through the article , which I 'd find perfectly understandable .
To summarize , I 've argued that XEmacs has a much lower market share , poorer performance , more bugs , much lower stability , and at this point probably fewer features than GNU Emacs .
When you add it all up , it 's the weaker candidate by a large margin .
Hence there 's only one reasonable strategy :
Hill , er , I mean XEmacs has to drop out of the race .
I 'm really sorry about this .
I 'm a close personal friend of XEmacs , but I just can't endorse it anymore .
I used to be a laissez - faire kinda guy , as long as you were using some flavor of Emacs .
But at this point , if you 're using XEmacs you 're actively damaging not only your long - term productivity , but mine as well .
So I 'd like to ask you to think long and hard about switching .
Soon .
If you 're a local Emacs - Lisp guru , please offer your services to XEmacs users who would like to switch over .
The more pain - free the migration is , the faster it will happen .
If you 're a graphic artist , consider making a nice , tasteful " Euthanize XEmacs ! " logo .
Not that message , precisely , but something along those lines .
Make sure it 's tasteful .
Perhaps " XEmacs is dead – long live XEmacs " ?
Yes , I think that would do nicely .
If you happen to know someone on the XEmacs development team , send them some chocolates , or movie tickets , or something .
A thank - you , even .
We should honor their service .
But those guys are the most qualified on the planet to step in and start helping drive GNU Emacs forward , assuming the FSF team will have them .
Emacs is in very bad shape indeed if they will not .
If you 're a local system administrator , consider .
Sorry , I mean consider politely asking your emacs - users mailing list if they might be willing to set a timeline for deprecating XEmacs , thereby starting the most massive flamewar in your company 's history .
Ca n't hurt !
If you 're seeing red , and you skipped most of this article so you could comment on how amazingly lame this idea is , I recommend taking a little walk and getting some fresh air first .
If you 're RMS , thank you for making Emacs and all that other stuff , and for keeping it free .
Please be nice to those who wish to help .
You 're scary to the point of unapproachability , just ' cuz you 're you .
XEmacs team , JWZ , and XEmacs package authors : thank you all for helping drive progress in the greatest piece of software of all time .
I can only hope that someday I may have chops like that .
Now how about we turn this into the most famous reverse- fork in history ?
MIT researchers have created a force feedback suit that could provide real - time feedback to every joint in your body based on a human teacher 's motions .
Let 's say I 'm learning to throw a left jab .
My fist should come straight out from my shoulder , elbow in .
But , as a novice boxer , my left elbow keeps poking out .
My boxing coach would record the ideal left jab ( lots of pop , with more snap than thud ) with motion capture tech and feed that information into the software .
Then , I 'd don the suit and go to chop the wood on a punching bag .
Using my poor technique , as my elbow chicken - winged out , the suit would provide vibrational force to guide my elbow in , based on the perfect form that my boxing coach recorded .
And apparently , this would work :
In experiments with arm motions , the researchers found that the suit increased students ’
learning rates by up to 23 % , and reduced errors by up to 27 % , as well as enabling students to learn movements “ more deeply ” by affecting their subconscious learning of motor skills .
The work by Jeff Lieberman and Cynthia Breazeal appeared in *IEEE Transactions on Robotics . *
But these suits are n't coming out as an accessory for Wii Yoga anytime soon .
The researchers say that their technology is still very expensive and that the tracking / motion - capture systems for the teachers ' movements are unwieldy .
“ For this to be successful in the real world it has to be much less expensive , and very robust .
Tracking systems are typically optical [ needing a setup in the room ] or exoskeleton - style [ wearable ] which results in high expense and high weight , respectively . "
The team is not working on fixing these problems , but plenty of researchers are .

Facebook WASHINGTON  Erik Prince , the former Navy commando who runs Blackwater USA , has rarely spoken publicly about his company 's billion - dollar security work for the U.S. government in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But last week , Prince found himself in a packed congressional hearing room , raising his right hand as shutters clicked and television cameras rolled .
Hours of uncomfortable questions followed .
More than anyone else , one man made it happen : Democrat Henry Waxman of Los Angeles , a three - decade House veteran whose bald , mustachioed , bespectacled mien has become the face of oversight in Congress .
" I want you to know that Blackwater will be accountable today , " Waxman said in his opening statement .
The hearing underscored the impact of having Waxman at the helm of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
Democrats may have gained control of Congress in last year 's elections , but their majority is n't always enough to make a difference .
In the Senate , for instance , Republicans have enough votes to block Democratic legislation .
But in the House of Representatives , the Republicans can't stop Waxman , who wields his subpoena power to investigate the Bush administration and its allies .
His committee room is where former CIA spy Valerie Plame spoke publicly for the first time about the administration 's leak of her identity , and where former Defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld denied knowing of a coverup of ex-football star Pat Tillman 's death by friendly fire .
" Let 's be honest , it 's a pretty target - rich environment for Mr. Waxman these days , " quipped David Marin , the oversight committee 's Republican staff director .
Other Republicans accuse Waxman of partisan grandstanding , or " following the dictates of trial lawyers , " as Florida Rep. John Mica put it .
" Henry 's been campaigning for next election since he became chairman , " said Rep. Darrell Issa of California .
Lawyers specializing in congressional inquiries call Waxman substantive and fair .
" He 's dogged .
He 's tenacious .
He 's got a very large and experienced investigative staff , " said Ray Shepherd , a Republican and former Senate investigator .
A history of activism Since January , Waxman 's committee has held 29 hearings with a focus on what he calls waste , fraud and abuse .
Recurring subjects of scrutiny have been Iraq contracting and the government 's handling of Gulf Coast hurricane rebuilding .
His inquiries tend to make headlines , and they sometimes prompt changes even before Waxman has a chance to grill officials under oath .
In July , for example , the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced a new effort to study contamination in temporary trailers given to Gulf Coast hurricane victims — the day before Waxman held a hearing exposing FEMA efforts to downplay the problem .
" I think oversight is a very important function , in some ways even more important than legislating , " says Waxman , 68 , whose district includes West Hollywood and Beverly Hills .
Not that Waxman has n't done his share of lawmaking .
He co-authored the 1990 changes to the Clean Air Act and helped write a law requiring for the first time nutritional labeling on food , as well as measures governing pesticides , safe drinking water and health care for poor people .
In 1982 , he held the first congressional hearing on the disease now known as AIDS .
Waxman may be best known for putting seven tobacco company chiefs under oath at a 1994 hearing in which they claimed cigarettes were not addictive .
His efforts to ban smoking in public buildings failed , but his tobacco hearings led to a wave of such laws in states and cities across the country .
The grandson of Jews who fled the 1903 Kishinev pogrom in what is now Moldova , Waxman was the first person in his family to go to college .
His father owned a small grocery store and later worked for chain stores as a union member .
Four years out of law school , Waxman unseated an incumbent to win a seat in the California Assembly in 1968 , and six years later , he was elected to Congress in the post - Watergate wave .
He has n't faced a tough race since .
In 1997 , he became the ranking Democrat on the oversight committee , then headed by Republican Dan Burton of Indiana , who aggressively investigated the Clinton administration .
" They issued over a thousand subpoenas , " Waxman says .
" I thought it was an abuse of power . "
Burton did not respond to requests for comment .
Waxman worked more cooperatively with Burton 's successor , Rep. Tom Davis , R - Va .
In 2005 , at Waxman 's request , Davis chaired hearings on the use of steroids that led Major League Baseball and other professional leagues to toughen their anti-doping policies .
' Multiple mistakes ' Waxman 's Blackwater hearing helped fuel several days of news stories examining the firm 's conduct in Iraq , including investigations that its guards killed innocent Iraqi civilians .
One person watching closely was Army Lt. Col.
Jeanette McMahon , who is suing Blackwater over an Afghanistan plane crash in which her husband , Army Lt. Col Michael McMahon , was killed .
Waxman questioned Prince closely about the November 2004 crash , which Waxman 's committee said was the result of " reckless conduct by the Blackwater pilots and multiple mistakes by Blackwater . "
A National Transportation Safety Board report blamed pilot error .
Prince denied that Blackwater was at fault , although he said , " Any time you have an accident , it 's an accident ; something could have been done better . "
It was his first public comment about the case .
" Thank God that in our country the politicians can bring someone like this to the table , " McMahon said .

There is no point in feigning seriousness over this story :
It is self - parodying to begin with .

Meet William B. Crews , a public relations mandude at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , one of those science - riddled government organizations that conservatives despise for having so many damn ideas about things .
Crews works for Dr. Anthony Fauci , currently the conservative posterchild for power - mad thing - knowing on account of his various suggestions on ways we could make Americans , you know , not die so much .
And when Crews is not doing that , he 's launching furious tirades about " mask nazi " Fauci on the decidedly mid-tiered conservative not - that - crazy " RedState " blog , where he suggests that scientists warning of the " Wuhan virus scare " were engaged in a " massive fraud " to Destroy Our Wayz Of Life .
April 21 , 2008  --
The New York Times spilled a lot of ink yesterday on the Pentagon 's relationship with TV military analysts .
The article raised some good points -- particularly on the heavy - handed way former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld 's Pentagon tried to control the message -- but it made no mention of a far more ambitious propaganda tool : the Pentagon Channel .
The Pentagon Channel is a 24 - hour cable news channel launched in May 2004 .
The idea was to provide military news and information to people on military bases .
But the channel now reaches millions of households through commercial satellite and cable systems .
Most recently , they announced a video - on - demand deal with Time Warner .
Most of the fare on the Pentagon Channel is harmless , and occasionally it can be quite interesting : profiles of service members , stories about life on the base or in Iraq , etc .
The shows are anchored by active duty military personnel .
But increasingly the Pentagon is using this platform the way other governments -- say , North Korea 's or Russia 's or Cuba 's -- use state - controlled television : as a tool to disseminate official information without any interference from a free press .
This is actually happening more now , under Secretary Robert Gates , than it did under Rumsfeld .
Gates , for example , gave his first interview as defense secretary to the Pentagon Channel , at a time when he was turning down all other interview requests .
Not surprisingly , he got only softball questions .
The tape was immediately made available to all other outlets .
The official message gets out without any pesky questions from independent reporters .
Just today , Gates gave a speech at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama .
The event was " closed press . "
In fact , it was n't even put on Gates ' public schedule .
But the Pentagon Channel was there .
Once again , the tape was made available .
And , once again , the message was delivered without any interference from an independent press corps .
Later today Gates will be talking to cadets at West Point .
It 's closed press .
We are n't allowed to cover it .
But can you guess who will be there ?

He Sings , He Runs and He 's Only 101 Marathoner expects to have a beer when he 's finished .
LONDON , March 5 , 2008  -- Buster Martin is an unlikely candidate to set a marathon record .
He drinks beer , smokes cigarettes and stays out late .
And he 's 101 .
But Martin expects to shatter , or at least ease past , the record next month when he runs London 's marathon .
And he is counting on having a beer at the finish line .
" He smokes , drinks , stays out late , which is probably why he is still alive , " said Charlie Mullins , the managing director of the plumbing company where Martin cleans vans .
When not working three days a week for Mullins , Martin can be found in a nearby boxing gym working with a pair of trainers in preparation for April 's run .
He refuses to be impressed by the fact that he is still running .
" I am not doing anything unusual .
I am just running a marathon , " he told ABC News .
Age is no more an obstacle to Martin 's running than that strip of winners tape at the finish line .
" You are never too old to do what you enjoy . "
And Martin likes running , " but not as much as I like my beer , " he added .
He is already a man of many firsts .
Martin holds three world title records for the oldest person to run the 5K , 10 K and the half marathon .
Martin says that in the last weekend , he 's completed a 13 - mile half marathon that took him a little more than five hours .
It would have been faster , he says , but he says he stopped for a beer and a cigarette .
Martin runs in the name of charity .
He is raising money for the Rhys Daniels Trust , which provides a " home from home " for parents of children having treatment for life - threatening illnesses .
Mullins describes him as a " remarkable chap , unbelievable .
He 's an ordinary fellow but remarkable at the same time especially for someone at his age to get involved in this sort of charity . "
Martin is also the father of 17 children , which also does n't impress him .
" Pity I did n't have anymore kids , " he said with a sigh .
He " likes to live life to the full . …
He is as sharp as a razor , " Mullins said .
He told ABC that Martin 's got " unbelievable hearing . "
To his colleagues , at 101 years old , Martin is a " great inspiration , he 's got a million stories to tell , he is so knowledgeable , " his manager said .
To celebrate Martin 's birthday , his work colleagues named a beer after him called Buster 's Beer .
So , does his manager think Martin can achieve his goal of being the oldest runner in the world ?
" Undoubtedly , " said Mullins .
Martin was also part of the seniors ' rock ' n ' roll group called the Zimmers .
The band had a combined age of more than 3,000 years and scored a hit single last year with a cover of The Who's '' My Generation . ''
When asked what Mullins thought of Martin 's voice , he replied , " It 's actually quite good . "

See the bottom of this post for an overview ( includes petitions , media , and contact info )
Margo Tamez recently sent out the following urgent call for support , explaining that since July , her Mother and Elders of el Calaboz , Texas , have been the targets of numerous threats and harassments by the Border Patrol , Army Corps of Engineers , NSA , and the U.S. related to the proposed building of a fence on their levee .
The NSA , for one , has been specifically demanding that Elders give up their lands for the levee–telling them that they will have to travel a distance of 3 miles to go through checkpoints , to walk , recreate , and to farm and herd goats and cattle ON THEIR OWN LANDS .
Margo ’s mother just informed her that since last Monday the Army Corps of Engineers , Border Patrol and National Security Agency teams have been tracking down and enclosing upon the people ; telling them that they have no choice : “ the wall is going on these lands whether you like it or not , and you have to sell your land to the U.S. ”
Margo asks that you Please help the elders and indigenous women land title holders resist forced occupation in their own lands !
As a start , you can do so by sharing this information to your friends and networks .

Subject : URGENT ! el Calaboz , Lipan Apache Land Title Holders Threatened by National Guard and Border Patrol in last 72 Hours
Hello friends ,
I am informing you of recent events in my maternal community of el Calaboz , Texas , a binational land grant indigenous rancheria of Lipan Apache , Chiricahua and Basque descent .
I am foregrounding this because I have been asked to submit documentation through the NGO , the International Indigenous Treaty Council , for the CERD investigation of human rights and indigenous rights abuses by the U.S. government against my mother community .
The Committee on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination ( CERD ) report to be directed toward the United Nation in March 2008 , which will for the first time in over a decade focus on abuses by the United States to oppressed groups .
This year , as a result of the recently approved UN Declaration of Indigenous Peoples rights , indigenous people have a specific opportunity to submit documents on behalf of their communities .
I ’ll be working hard the next week to complete a draft document , with evidentiary materials , for review by an international human rights and indigenous rights attorney who recently accompanied me on an investigatory field trip to my paternal community , Redford , TX , of the Jumano Apache .
I wanted to keep you informed of this progress , and through this following letter , establish a way to communicate what I ’m doing and how it impacts all my work .
See the earlier letter below .
Ahi’i’e

Subject : Emergency in el Calaboz , Lipan Apache & Basque - Indigena North American Land Title Holders !!!
Dear relatives ,
I wish I was writing under better circumstances , but I must be fast and direct .
My mother and elders of El Calaboz , since July have been the targets of numerous threats and harassments by the Border Patrol , Army Corps of Engineers , NSA , and the U.S. related to the proposed building of a fence on their levee .
Since July , they have been the targets of numerous telephone calls , unexpected and uninvited visits on their lands , informing them that they will have to relinquish parts of their land grant holdings to the border fence buildup .
The NSA demands that elders give up their lands to build the levee , and further , that they travel a distance of 3 miles , to go through checkpoints , to walk , recreate , and to farm and herd goats and cattle , ON THEIR OWN LANDS .
This threat against indigenous people , life ways and lands has been very very serious and stress inducing to local leaders , such as Dr. Eloisa Garcia Tamez , who has been in isolation from the larger indigenous rights community due to the invisibility of indigenous people of South Texas and Northern Tamaulipas to the larger social justice conversation regarding the border issues .
However recent events , of the last 5 days cause us to feel that we are in urgent need of immediate human rights observers in the area , deployed by all who can help as soon as possible –immediate relief .
My mother informed me , as I got back into cell range out of Redford , TX , on Monday , November 13 , that Army Corps of Engineers , Border Patrol and National Security Agency teams have been going house to house , and calling on her personal office phone , her cell phone and in other venues , tracking down and enclosing upon the people and telling them that they have no other choice in this matter .
They are telling elders and other vulnerable people that “ the wall is going on these lands whether you like it or not , and you have to sell your land to the U.S. ”
My mother , Eloisa Garcia Tamez , Lipan Apache ( descendant of Mexican Chiricahua descent elder , Aniceto Garcia , who gave her traditional indigenous birth welcoming ceremony and lightning ceremony ) , is resisting the forced occupation with firm resistance .
She has already had two major confrontations with NSA since July–one in her office at the University of Texas at Brownsville , where she is the Director of a Nursing Program and where she conducts research on diabetes among indigenous people of the MX - US binational region of South Texas and Tamaulipas .
She reports that some land owners in the rancheria area of El Calaboz , La Paloma and El Ranchito , under pressure to sell to the U.S. without prior and informed consent , have already signed over their lands , due to their ongoing state of impoverishment and exploitation in the area under colonization , corporatism , NAFTA and militarization .
This is an outrage , but more , this is a significant violation of United Nations Declaration on Rights of Indigenous People , recently ratified and accepted by all UN nations , except the U.S. , Canada , and Australia .
Furthermore , it is a violation of the United Nations CERD , Committee on Elimination of Racism and Racial Discrimination .
My mother is under great stress and crisis , unknowing if the Army soldiers and the NSA agents will be forcibly demanding that she sign documents .
She reports that they are calling her at all hours , seven days a week .
She has firmly told them not to call her anymore , nor to call her at all hours of the night and day , nor to call on the weekends any further .
She asked them to meet with her in a public space and to tell their supervisors to come .
They refuse to do so .
Instead , they continue to harass and intimidate .
At this time , due to the great stress the elders are currently under , communicated to me , because they are being demanded under covert tactics , to relinquish indigenous lands , I feel that I MUST call upon my relatives , friends , colleagues , especially associates in Texas within driving distance to the Rio Grande valley region , and involved in indigenous rights issues , to come forth and aid us .
Please !
Please help indigenous women land title holders resisting forced occupation in their own lands !
Please do not hesitate to forward this to people in your own networks in media , journalism , social and environmental justice , human rights , indigenous rights advocacy and public health watch groups !

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Employers cut payrolls in March for a third straight month and the jobless rate jumped to a 2 - 1/ 2 - year high , further evidence that a housing downturn and credit crisis may have pushed the economy into recession .
The Labor Department on Friday said nonfarm employment fell by 80,000 jobs in March , more than expected and the biggest drop in five years .
Financial markets saw this as reinforcing the need for further Federal Reserve interest rate cuts .
It was the first time the U.S. economy had shed jobs for three consecutive months since a five - month string in 2003 , when the economy was mired in a recovery from the 2001 recession which created few jobs .
“ The odds that it will turn out that a recession started in the early part of this year have certainly been rising , ” said Harvard professor Jeffrey Frankel , a member of the private - sector panel that dates U.S. recessions .
While members of the National Bureau of Economic Research ’s Business Cycle Dating Committee have been in communication , the panel has yet to call a recession .
“ No sign that a recession has begun yet , ” said Northwestern University professor Robert Gordon , a member of that panel .
Adding to the bleak picture , the Labor Department said a total of 152,000 jobs were lost in January and February , sharply above the prior estimate of 85,000 , and the jobless rate jumped to 5.1 percent from 4.8 , the highest since September 2005 .
Most economists , having seen a third monthly decline , were now convinced that the economy is in recession .
“ There does n’t appear to be any silver lining .
It shows that we ’re right in the middle of a recession , ” said Carl Lantz , U.S. interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse in New York .
“ Our expectation is that it will be a longer recession than the last two , and we ’re just in the beginning . ”
U.S. stock markets closed down slightly while prices for U.S. government securities rallied .
“ What we have been looking at over the first quarter is an economy that has entered into recession , ” JPMorgan chief economist Bruce Kasman told clients on a conference call .
The White House said it was “ not happy ” with the jobs report , saying it expected economic growth to be flat in the first quarter but pick up later in the year .
The numbers drew calls from Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for aid to families facing foreclosure on their homes , while Republican candidate Senator John McCain said tax cuts and streamlining burdensome regulations were needed to foster growth .
One bright spot in the dreary labor report was that average weekly hours increased slightly .
Economists were expecting workers ’ hours to remain flat or decrease slightly .
“ This should cushion the negative impact on income growth of the job losses , ” said economist Joel Naroff , of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland , Pennsylvania .
Job losses seen over the quarter are nowhere near the triple - digit hemorrhaging seen in prior recessions , leading economists to think this downturn may be short and shallow .
“ We do think the economy is in recession .
That said , I would say that these numbers do not show a deep recession at this point .
They do n’t even show an average recession , ” said James O’Sullivan , economist at UBS in Stamford , Connecticut .
Non -farm payroll data from February 2007 to March 2008 .
The employers cut payrolls for a third month in a row in March , slashing 80,000 jobs for the biggest monthly job decline in five years as the economy headed into a downturn , government data on Friday showed .

RECESSION HERE ?
The Federal Reserve , the U.S. central bank , has already slashed benchmark overnight rates by 3 percentage points since mid-September to prop up an economy hit hard by a liquidity crisis brought on by what many economists see as the worst housing slump since the Great Depression .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke admitted to Congress this week a recession was possible .
“ It ’s clearly a period of very slow growth extending back to the fourth quarter of last year , and we are trying to set our policies appropriately for that situation , ” he added .
A New York Times / CBS
News poll released on Friday showed the economy ’s deepening woes were weighing heavily on the minds of Americans .
Of those polled , 81 percent said they believed things were “ pretty seriously ” on the wrong track , up from 69 percent a year ago and 35 percent in early 2002 .
During the first quarter , job losses averaged 77,000 a month , compared with average monthly gains of 76,000 in the last half of 2007 .
In March , the biggest losses were in construction and manufacturing , areas bearing the brunt of the slowdown .
Factory employment fell by 48,000 , the biggest decline since July 2003 , exacerbated by a 24,000 fall in auto manufacturing jobs that the department said likely reflected the impact of a strike at an auto parts maker .
Construction employment fell 51,000 , the ninth consecutive month of job losses .
In another sign firms are bracing for a downturn , professional business employment dropped by 35,000 , mostly in temporary help services .

KBR workers in Iraq stole weapons and art , senators told Former workers accuse employees of improper activity , including the stealing of weapons , artwork and gold
Allegations fly at KBR hearing
Linda Warren , former employee of KBR , shows the flag she brought back from Iraq during testimony on Capitol Hill on Monday .
Warren said many of her colleagues stole numerous items while doing reconstruction work in Iraq .

WASHINGTON — KBR employees working in Iraq stole weapons , artwork and even gold to make spurs for cowboy boots , two former company workers told Senate Democrats on Monday .
Appearing before a Democrats - only panel looking into allegations of contracting abuses in Iraq , the witnesses accused their former co-workers of widespread improper activity .
KBR spokeswoman Heather Browne said the company would not comment at length because the claims are part of ongoing lawsuits .
" The witnesses who testified today raised claims that KBR has previously addressed .
The government has reviewed the claims and refused to join lawsuits asserting them , " Browne said .
Linda Warren , a 50 - year - old Abilene woman who worked as a laundry foreman and recreation director for the Houston - based contracting giant in Iraq , told the Senate Democratic Policy Committee Monday that some of her American colleagues doing construction work in Iraqi palaces and municipal buildings took woodcarvings , tapestries and crystal " and even melted down gold to make spurs for cowboy boots . "
Her allegations could not be independently verified .
Warren leveled her allegations in early 2004 after being reprimanded by a supervisor for giving water to Iraqi workers laboring in a sweltering laundry building when their own water supply was undrinkable .
Warren said the supervisor reminded her she had signed a confidentiality agreement and then threatened her by suggesting an American woman " would n't last very long on the streets of Baghdad . "
That evening , with company managers present , she called KBR 's ethics hot line in Houston to report her allegations .
She eventually was escorted out of Baghdad by company security after KBR officials intercepted a threatening e-mail , Warren said .
Frank Cassaday , a former KBR ice plant operator , told lawmakers that a KBR foreman tried to take military equipment , including two rocket launchers , detonators and ammunition .
When he confronted the foreman , Cassaday said , " he told me to mind my own business . "
Cassaday then told the camp manager .
A military investigation confirmed his allegations , Cassaday said , but he did not elaborate on how the matter was resolved .
A third worker , Barry Halley , a former security manager for CAPE Environmental Management , alleged that after raising complaints with CAPE management , he was held in a room for several days by private security guards .
Les Flynn , Atlanta - based CAPE 's chief operating officer , said that while some of Halley 's allegations Monday were new , the company 's insurance company had investigated his allegations .
" It appears they were found to be untrue , " Flynn said .
The witnesses appeared at the Democratic Policy Committee 's 13th hearing on contracting activities in Iraq .
While Congress has had some bipartisan hearings regarding KBR , many of the allegations have come from this series of Democrats - only sessions .
Congressional investigations of KBR 's activities in Iraq are almost invariably colored by politics , in no small part because Vice President Dick Cheney once headed KBR 's former parent company , Halliburton Co .
Two weeks ago , the U.S. Army Sustainment Command reaffirmed its selection of KBR to participate in the 10 - year logistical support contract valued at up to $ 150 billion .

The Gravity Mine
a short story by Stephen Baxter C all her Anlic .
The first time she woke , she was in the ruins of an abandoned gravity mine .
At first the Community had chased around the outer strata of the great gloomy structure .
But at last , close to the core , they reached a cramped ring .
Here the central black hole 's gravity was so strong that light itself curved in closed orbits .
The torus tunnel looked infinitely long .
And they could race as fast as they dared .
As they hurtled past fullerene walls they could see multiple images of themselves , a glowing golden mesh before and behind , for the echoes of their light endlessly circled the central knot of spacetime .
" Just like the old days ! " they called , excited .
" Just like the Afterglow ! ... "
Exhilarated , they pushed against the light barrier , and those trapped circling images shifted to blue or red .
That was when it happened .
This Community was just a small tributary of the Conflux : isolated here in this ancient place , the density of mind already stretched thin .
And now , as lightspeed neared , that isolation stretched to breaking point .
...
She budded off from the rest , her consciousness made discrete , separated from the greater flow of minds and memories .
She slowed .
The others rushed on without her , a dazzling circular storm orbiting the exhausted black hole .
It felt like coming awake , emerging from a dream .
Her questions were immediate , flooding her raw mind .
" Who am I ?
How did I get here ? "
And so on .
The questions were simple , even trite .
And yet they were unanswerable .
Others gathered around her - curious , sympathetic - and the race of streaking light began to lose its coherence .
One of them came to her .
Names meant little ; this " one " was merely a transient sharpening of identity from the greater distributed entity that made up the Community .
Still , here he was .
Call him Geador . " ... Anlic ? "
" I feel - odd , " she said .
" Do n't worry . "
" Who am I ? " " Come back to us . "
He reached for her , and she sensed the warm depths of companionship and memory and shared joy that lay beyond him .
Depths waiting to swallow her up , to obliterate her questions .
She snapped , " No ! " And , wilfully , she sailed up and out and away , passing through the thin walls of the tunnel .
At first it was difficult to climb out of this twisted gravity well .
But soon she was rising through layers of structure .
Here was the tight electromagnetic cage which had once tapped the spinning black hole like a dynamo .
Here was the cloud of compact masses which had been hurled along complex orbits through the hole 's ergosphere , extracting gravitational energy .
It was antique engineering , long abandoned .
She emerged into a blank sky , a sky stretched thin by the endless expansion of spacetime .
Geador was here .
" What do you see ? " " Nothing . "
" Look harder . "
He showed her how .
There was a scattering of dull red pinpoints all around the sky .
" They are the remnants of stars , " he said .
He told her about the Afterglow : that brief , brilliant period after the Big Bang , when matter gathered briefly in clumps and burned by fusion light .
" It was a bonfire , over almost as soon as it began .
The universe was very young .
It has swollen some ten thousand trillion times in size since then ...
Nevertheless , it was in that gaudy era that humans arose .
Us , Anlic . "
She looked into her soul , seeking warm memories of the Afterglow .
She found nothing .
She looked back at the gravity mine .
At its centre was a point of yellow - white light .
Spears of light arced out from its poles , knife - thin .
The spark was surrounded by a flattened cloud , dull red , inhomogeneous , clumpy .
The big central light cast shadows through the crowded space around it .
It was beautiful , a sculpture of light and crimson smoke .
" This is Mine One , " Geador said gently .
" The first mine of all .
And it is built on the ruins of the primeval galaxy - the galaxy from which humans first emerged . "
" The first galaxy ? " " But it was all long ago . "
He moved closer to her .
" So long ago that this mine became exhausted .
Soon it will evaporate away completely .
We have long since had to move on ... "
But that had happened before .
After all humans had started from a single star , and spilled over half the universe , even before the stars ceased to shine .
Now humans wielded energy , drawn from the great gravity mines , on a scale unimagined by their ancestors .
Of course mines would be exhausted - like this one - but there would be other mines .
Even when the last mine began to fail , they would think of something .
The future stretched ahead , long , glorious .
Minds flowed together in great rivers of consciousness .
There was immortality to be had , of a sort , a continuity of identity through replication and confluence across trillions upon trillions of years .
It was the Conflux .
Its source was far upstream .
The crudities of birth and death had been abandoned even before the Afterglow was over , when man 's biological origins were decisively shed .
So every mind , every tributary that made up the Conflux today had its source in that bright , remote upstream time .
Nobody had been born since the Afterglow .
Nobody but Anlic . " ... Come back , " Geador said .
Her defiance was dissipating .
She understood nothing about herself .
But she did n't want to be different .
She did n't want to be unhappy .
There was n't anybody who was less than maximally happy , the whole of the time .
Was n't that the purpose of existence ?
So , troubled , she gave herself up to Geador , to the Conflux .
And , along with her identity , her doubts and questions dissolved .
The universe would grow far older before she woke again . " ... F lee !
Faster !
As fast as you can ! ... "
There was turbulence in the great rushing river of mind .
And in that turbulence , here and there , souls emerged from the background wash .
Each brief fleck suffered a moment of terror before falling back into the greater dreaming whole .
One of those flecks was Anlic .
In the sudden dark she clung to herself .
She slithered to a stop .
Transient identities clustered around her .
" What are you doing ?
Why are you staying here ?
You will be harmed . "
They sought to absorb her , but fell back , baffled by her resistance .
The Community was fleeing , in panic .
Why ?
She looked back .
There was something there , in the greater darkness .
She made out the faintest of patterns : charcoal grey on black , almost beyond her ability to resolve it , a mesh of neat regular triangles covering the sky .
Visible through the interstices was a complex , textured curtain of grey - pink light .
It was a structure that spanned the universe .
She felt stunned , disoriented .
It was so different from Mine One , her last clear memory .
She must have crossed a great desert of time .
But - she found , when she looked into her soul - her questions remained unanswered .
She called out : " Geador ? " A ripple of shock and doubt spread through the Community .
" ... You are Anlic . " " Geador ? " " I have Geador 's memories . "
That would have to do , she thought , irritated ; in the Conflux , memory and identity were fluid , distributed , ambiguous .
" We are in danger , Anlic .
You must come . "
She refused to comply , stubborn .
She indicated the great netting .
" Is that Mine One ? " " No , " he said sadly .
" Mine One was long ago , child . "
" How long ago ? "
" Time is nested ... "
From this vantage , the era of man 's first black hole empire had been the spring time , impossibly remote .
And the Afterglow itself - the star - burning dawn - was lost , a mere detail of the Big Bang .
" What is happening here , Geador ? "
" There is no time -" " Tell me . "
The universe had ballooned , fuelled by time , and its physical processes had proceeded relentlessly .
Just as each galaxy 's stars had dissipated , leaving a rump which had collapsed into a central black hole , so clusters of galaxies had broken up , and the remnants fell inwards to cluster - scale holes .
And the clusters in turn collapsed into supercluster - scale holes - the largest black holes to have formed naturally , with masses of a hundred trillion stars .
These were the cold hearths around which mankind now huddled .
" But , " said Geador , " the supercluster holes are evaporating away - dissipating in a quantum whisper , like all black holes .
The smallest holes , of stellar mass , vanished when the universe was a fraction of its present age .
Now the largest natural holes , of supercluster mass , are close to exhaustion as well .
And so we must farm them .
" Look at the City . "
He meant the universe - spanning net , the rippling surfaces within .
The City was a netted sphere .
It contained giant black holes , galactic supercluster mass and above .
They had been deliberately assembled .
And they were merging , in a hierarchy of more and more massive holes .
Life could subsist on the struts of the City , feeding off the last trickle of free energy .
Mankind was moving supercluster black holes , coalescing them in hierarchies all over the reachable universe , seeking to extend their lifetimes .
It was a great challenge .
Too great .
Sombrely , Geador showed her more .
The network was disrupted .
It looked as if some immense object had punched out from the inside , ripping and twisting the struts .
The tips of the broken struts were glowing a little brighter than the rest of the network , as if burning .
Beyond the damaged network she could see the giant coalescing holes , their horizons distorted , great frozen waves of infalling matter visible in their cold surfaces .
This was an age of war : an obliteration of trillion - year memories , a bonfire of identity .
Great rivers of mind were guttering , drying .
" This is the Conflux .
How can there be war ? "
Geador said , " We are managing the last energy sources of all .
We have responsibility for the whole of the future .
With such responsibility comes tension , disagreement .
Conflict . "
She sensed his gentle , bitter humour .
" We have come far since the Afterglow , Anlic .
But in some ways we have much in common with the brawling argumentative apes of that brief time . "
" Apes ? ... Why am I here , Geador ? "
" You 're an eddy in the Conflux .
We all wake up from time to time .
It 's just an accident .
Do n't trouble , Anlic .
You are not alone .
You have us . "
Deliberately she moved away from him .
" But I am not like you , " she said bleakly .
" I do not recall the Afterglow .
I do n't know where I came from . "
" What does it matter ? " he said harshly .
" You have existed for all but the briefest moments of the universe 's long history -" " Has there been another like me ? "
He hesitated .
" No , " he said .
" No other like you .
There has n't been long enough . "
" Then I am alone . "
" Anlic , all your questions will be over , answered or not , if you let yourself die here .
Come now ... "
She knew he was right .
She fled with him .
The great black hole City disappeared behind her , its feeble glow attenuated by her gathering velocity .
She yielded to Geador 's will .
She had no choice .
Her questions were immediately lost in the clamour of community .
She would wake only once more .
S tart with a second .
Zoom out .
Factor it up to get the life of the Earth , with that second a glowing moment embedded within .
Zoom out again , to get a new period , so long Earth 's lifetime is reduced to the span of that second .
Then nest it .
Do it again .
And again and again and again ... Anlic , for the last time , came to self - awareness .
It was inevitable that , given enough time , she would be budded by chance occurrence .
And so it happened .
She clung to herself and looked around .
It was dark here .
Vast , wispy entities cruised across spacetime 's swelling breast .
There were no dead stars , no rogue planets .
The last solid matter had long evaporated : burned up by proton decay , a thin smoke of neutrinos drifting out at lightspeed .
For ages the black hole engineers had struggled to maintain their Cities , to gather more material to replace what decayed away .
It was magnificent , futile .
The last structures failed , the last black holes allowed to evaporate .
The Conflux of minds had dispersed , flowing out over the expanding universe like water running into sand .
Even now , of course , there was something rather than nothing .
Around her was an unimaginably thin plasma : free electrons and positrons decayed from the last of the Big Bang 's hydrogen , orbiting in giant , slow circles .
This cold soup was the last refuge of humanity .
The others drifted past her like clouds , immense , slow , coded in wispy light - year - wide atoms .
And even now , the others clung to the solace of community .
But that was not for Anlic .
She pondered for a long time , determined not to slide back into the eternal dream .
At length she understood how she had come to be .
And she knew what she must do .
She sought out Mine One , the wreckage of man 's original galaxy .
The search took more empty ages .
With caution , she approached what remained .
There was no shape here .
No form , no colour , no time , no order .
And yet there was motion : a slow , insidious , endless writhing , punctuated by bubbles which rose and burst , spitting out fragments of mass - energy .
This was the singularity that had once lurked within the great black hole 's event horizon .
Now it was naked , a glaring knot of quantum foam , a place where the unification of spacetime had been ripped apart to become a seething probabilistic froth .
Once this object had oscillated violently , and savage tides , chaotic and unpredictable , had torn at any traveller unwary enough to come close .
But the singularity 's energy had been dissipated by each such encounter .
Even singularities aged .
Still , the frustrated energy contained there seethed , quantum - mechanically , randomly .
And sometimes , in those belched fragments , put there purely by chance , there were hints of order .
Structure .
Complexity .
She settled herself around the singularity 's cold glow .
Free energy was dwindling to zero , time stretching to infinity .
It took her longer to complete a single thought than it had once taken species to rise and fall on Earth .
It did n't matter .
She had plenty of time .
She remembered her last conversation with Geador .
Has there been another like me ?
... No .
No other like you .
There has n't been long enough .
Now Anlic had all the time there was .
The universe was exhausted of everything but time .
The longer she waited , the more complexity emerged from the singularity .
Purely by chance .
Much of it dissipated , purposeless .
But some of the mass - energy fragments had sufficient complexity to be able to gather and store information about the thinning universe .
Enough to grow .
That , of course , was not enough .
She continued to wait .
At last - by chance - the quantum tangle emitted a knot of structure sufficiently complex to reflect , not just the universe outside , but its own inner state .
Anlic moved closer , coldly excited .
It was a spark of consciousness : not descended from the grunting , breeding humans of the Afterglow , but born from the random quantum flexing of a singularity .
Just as she had been .
Anlic waited , nurturing , refining the rootless being 's order and cohesion .
And it gathered more data , developed sophistication .
At last it - she - could frame questions .
" ...
Who am I ?
Who are you ?
Why are there two and not one ? "
Anlic said , " I have much to tell you . "
And she gathered the spark in her attenuated soul .
Together , mother and daughter drifted away , and the river of time ran slowly into an unmarked sea .

ISFD bibliography .
HARRISBURG , PA . — Presidential candidate Barack Obama 's " Road to Change " bus tour rolled through this city of 47,000 on Sunday evening , drawing 1,500 who had stood in line on a cold Saturday morning for hours to get free tickets .
The event followed a stop in State College , Pa. , earlier in the day and drew a diverse crowd that often rose to its feet and chanted Obama 's name .
Both candidates have been crisscrossing the state in advance of the April 22 primary , and Clinton had an event scheduled in Harrisburg for Monday .
Sen. Bob Casey Jr. , who announced his endorsement of Obama on Friday , introduced the candidate to supporters at the city 's Forum Auditorium .
The town hall - style meeting consisted largely of Obama answering questions from the crowd , from attendees young and old , and addressing such issues as healthcare , the war , wage discrimination , energy policy , mental health parity , and substance abuse .
Obama often bantered and joked with the audience and maintained a casual style that seemed to impress many attendees .
He thanked the audience for its support during a long presidential race .
" There have been babies that have been born and are now walking and talking " since he first announced his candidacy 15 months ago , Obama said jokingly .
" I am running because of what Dr. [ Martin Luther ] King [ Jr. ] called the fierce urgency of now , " he added , dismissing the concerns of those who suggested he not run for president now because he is young enough to wait .
But what the crowd seemed to appreciate most were answers perceived as frank and straightforward that did n't so much tell people what they wanted to hear as they did urge collaboration and participation from ordinary citizens in addressing issues such as wage discrimination and education .
His answer to a question about how to better educate children drew cheers .
In addition to any efforts the government and school systems might make , " Parents have to take some responsibility , " he said .
" And if your child 's misbehaving in school , do n't cuss out the teacher ....
Education is not some passive thing where you can just pour it in your ear and you 're educated . "
That type of response — encouraging people to take some responsibility but showing his concern for any number of issues — were what many attendees said they found most impressive .
" I thought he was excellent , " said 48 - year - old Brenda Alton , a resident of Steelton , Pa. , and pastor of a Harrisburg church .
" He was real with us . "
One of the things Alton liked best was that Obama acknowledged that fixing some issues would take time , " but he also challenged us as people . "
Obama took questions from the crowd " boy , girl , boy , girl " — to be fair , he said .
Among the questions was one from Harrisburg resident Reginald Guy , 59 , whose concern was a local issue .
He wanted to know what Obama would do to help address the federal bureaucracy that frustrates many and has become an issue in Harrisburg during debate over where to build a new federal courthouse .
Many local residents , including Guy , favor an inner-city site that they hope would spur economic development of that area .
Obama admitted he was n't familiar with the debate over the location but said he'd work as president to see that the federal government focuses less on bureaucracy and more on working for ordinary people .
Was Guy satisfied with Obama 's response ?
" Senator Obama gave a very insightful answer to the need to make the federal bureaucracy more accessible to the people , " Guy said .
" With him as president of the U.S. , his response tonight suggested that Pennsylvania — and in particular , Harrisburg — would have a friend in the White House .
We need a president that will stand for economic development for all people and not just for the favored few . "
" I believe there 's integrity within him , " said Alton , who stood in line for an hour to get tickets and made the decision to vote for Obama in the past few months .
" I prefer integrity over nine years of experience , and I know he will surround himself with great people . "
Attendees Melissa Hoffman -Long , 29 , and husband Nick Hoffman , 28 , agreed , calling the meeting " fantastic . "
They came with their 5 - month - old daughter , Maggie .
Unable to get tickets Saturday , they showed up at the event on Sunday and waited for two hours to get in via an overflow line .
After the event , some said they were even more sure now that Obama would get their votes than when they walked in .
Fantasy can take you out of your predefined notions and reflect something which is not visible to bare eyes .
In this world of harsh realities [… ]

Southern Halliburton University
Moving the Bush Bubble to the Big D
In her final column before her untimely death , Molly Ivins wrote :
“ We are the people who run this country .
We are the deciders . ”
Dr. Benjamin Johnson , a history professor at Southern Methodist University ( SMU ) in Dallas , where President Bush is proposing to build his $ 500 million library and neoconservative institute ( DeFrank , 2006 ; Berkowitz , 2007 ) , recently attended the annual meeting of the Organization of American Historians .
Several colleagues there reported that Karl Rove , Bush ’s chief political strategist , has been traveling around the country examining research facilities , discussing how to select Bush Institute fellows , and meeting with library directors ( Johnson , 2007a ) .
According to Dr. Johnson , one well - respected colleague said , “ Rove seems to know exactly what the square footage is of the building that will be at SMU and where it will be located on campus . ”
Rove also expressed displeasure that some SMU faculty and United Methodist bishops were protesting the proposed partisan institute ( Korosec , 2007 ; Silva , 2007 ) over which Bush and company will have total control ( Johnson , 2007 b ) .
This hands - on involvement of a top - level White House operative like Rove demonstrates the importance of the proposed library and think tank at SMU to Bush insiders .
Convincing the United Methodist Church to stain its good name and a major university to give away its academic respectability by linking itself with a president that much of the world views as an authoritarian bully who has authorized and advocated for torture and international kidnapping is one nifty trick
Bush is the most unpopular and isolated president since Richard Nixon .
Inside his bubble , the President is being told by the Secretary of State ( Rice , 2004 ) that he is another Winston Churchill or Harry Truman — unpopular now , but he will be vindicated by history for his heroic effort to bring democracy to the Middle East at the point of a gun ( even if it requires a total re-write ) .
To re-write history on the scale Bush needs will necessitate the complete control of a disinformation institute , and if it uses the legitimacy of a respected university and the good name of a major Protestant tradition , all the better ( imagine the American Enterprise Institute with a giant cross on the front door , and you get the picture ) .
Importantly , Rove and friends will be able to continue to conceal the most damaging information about this administration in its bubble using Bush ’s Executive Order 13233 , signed into law shortly after 9/11 , which insures that the president and his heirs are able to deny access in perpetuity to government records they select ( Gillman , 2007 ) .
Emily Sheketoff , Executive Director of the American Library Association , observed that the executive order “ completely goes against the spirit of the essence of a library ” ( Gillman , 2007 ) .
Steve Aftergood , Director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists , said “ If the Bush folks are going to play games with the records , no self - respecting academic institution should cooperate ” ( Gillman , 2007 ) .
Professor Benjamin Hufbauer at the University of Louisville , a recognized authority on presidential libraries , believes that dictating which papers can be seen at the library reduces it to “ just a museum of political propaganda ” ( Jascik , 2007 ) .
To convince the United Methodist Church ( UMC ) to stain its good name and a major university to give away its academic respectability by linking itself with a president that much of the world views as an authoritarian bully ( Public Diplomacy , 2005 ; World Public Opinion , 2007 ) who has authorized and advocated for torture and international kidnapping is one nifty trick ( Miles , 2006 ; Grey , 2006 ) .
Such an endeavor required skilled operators and years of stealth planning ( Schutze , 2006 ) , which according to SMU President R. Gerald Turner began in 2001 , shortly after Bush became president .
It required that the SMU administration hide its intentions from its faculty and from church leaders who would understand that a partisan institute lacking standard academic controls , whose mission undoubtedly will include justifying crimes against humanity , would be a bad idea ( Weaver and Crawford , 2007 ) .
To achieve these goals Bush needs powerful friends in high places and he has them in the SMU Trustees .
Awash in Conflicts of Interest
The SMU Board of Trustees is a study in the appearance of conflicts of interests , at a minimum .
It is dominated by individuals who have long - standing relationships with George W. Bush and his family which raises serious questions about their impartiality and therefore how they fulfill their fiduciary duty to the university ( Weaver , Sprague , Hicks , and Yeakel , 2007 ) .
At least 25 of the 41 trustees ( 61 percent ) have personal , financial , and / or political relationships with Bush , and many have been major fundraisers and contributors to his political campaigns .
Furthermore , one of the three United Methodist bishops who serve as SMU trustees , Scott Jones , publicly endorsed the Bush project months before a formal proposal was even presented to the Board ( Tooley , 2007 ) .
Twenty - two of the trustees have donated to one or more of the Bush political campaigns and / or the Republican National Committee in support of Bush , including SMU President R. Gerald Turner , Board Chair Carl Sewell , Ruth Altshuler , Michael M. Boone , Bradley W. Brookshire , Donald J. Carty , Jeanne Tower Cox , Gary T. Crum , Linda Pitts Custard , Robert H. Dedman , Jr. , Frank M. Dunlevy , Thomas J. Engibous , Alan D. Feld , Gerald J. Ford , James R. Gibbs , Frederick B. Hegi , Jr. , Ray L. Hunt , Robert A. Leach , Jeanne L. Phillips , Caren H. Prothro , John C. Tolleson , and Richard Ware ( Campaign Finance in American Politics , 2007 ; Fundrace , 2007 ; NewsMeat , 2007 ; Public Citizen ’s Congress Watch , 2004 , 2007 ) .
Nearly all of the contributions to political candidates and campaigns by the trustees have been to Republican causes .
In total , public records show that the SMU trustees have given $ 2,759,000 to Republican candidates and causes and $ 34,000 to Democratic candidates and causes ( Campaign Finance in American Politics , 2007 ; Fundrace , 2007 ; NewsMeat , 2007 ; Public Citizen ’s Congress Watch , 2004 ; 2007 ) .
Trustee Milledge A. Hart , III , donated the most to Democratic causes ( $ 27,750 ) .
The only trustee to have given exclusively to Democrats is the SMU Faculty Senate representative , Dr. Rhoda Blair , who donated $ 250 in 2004 to the Democratic National Committee ( Fundrace , 2007 ) .
Two United Methodist clergy on the Board , Rev. Kirbyjon Caldwell of Houston ( Gaines , 2002 ) and Rev. Mark Craig of Dallas ( Religion and Ethics , 2001 ) , have long - standing personal relationships with Bush and his family .
In addition , Laura Bush , the wife of the president and a trustee , has publicly stated her personal preference for SMU ( Wolffe and Bailey , 2005a ) .
The First Lady is the only trustee who has said she will recuse herself from voting on the proposal because of a conflict of interest .
Despite the fact that numerous other trustees have apparent conflicts , none have recused themselves , even after three United Methodist bishops called for the compromised trustees to do so ( Weaver , Sprague , Hicks , and Yeakel , 2007 ) .
The Hunt Oil / Halliburton Connection
And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice , is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid
— Dick and Lynne Cheney ’s Christmas card inscription , 2003 ( both claim membership in the UMC )
Long - time trustee ( since 1976 ) and UMC member Ray L. Hunt is head of the Dallas - based Hunt Oil Company , one of the largest independent oil corporations in the world .
He is a Bush friend and a central figure in bringing the Bush think tank proposal to SMU ( Personal communication , 2007 ) .
Hunt is the son of flamboyant Texas oil tycoon , H.L. Hunt , who was a staunch supporter of Joseph McCarthy and the John Birch Society .
In 1948 , Fortune magazine labeled H.L. Hunt “ the richest man in the United States ” ( Texas State Historical Association , 2007 ) .
Ray L. Hunt , an under - the - radar power player , inherited much of the Hunt Oil fortune in 1974 when his father died .
Forbes recently identified billionaire Ray Hunt as one of the richest men on the planet ( Dallas Business Journal , 2007 ) .
Ray Hunt is a longtime financial backer of the Bush family .
He raised money for the elder Bush and served as the finance chairman of the Republican National Committee for George W. Bush in 2000 ( Bryce , 2005 ) .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics , Hunt and his spouse have donated more than $ 460,000 to Republican state campaigns , while his company and its employees contributed more than $ 1 million to Republican causes between 1995 and 2002 ( Grimaldi , 2002 ) .
He gave $ 100,000 toward the 2001 Bush inaugural festivities and one of his corporations , Hunt Consolidated , gave another $ 250,000 toward the Bush 2005 presidential inaugural gala ( Public Citizen ’s Congress Watch , 2007 ) .
In addition , Hunt donated a whopping $ 35 million toward the Bush library / think tank to secure additional property for the project ( Schutze , 2006 ) .
One month after 9/11 , Bush honored his friend Ray Hunt with a seat on the President ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board ( PFIAB ) , and he was re-appointed in January 2006 ( Bryce , 2005 ) .
According to the White House , this board operates to offer the president “ objective , expert advice ” on the conduct of foreign intelligence ( Wolffe and Bailey , 2005 b ) .
Hunt , with international business interests , has access through PFIAB to intelligence that is unavailable to most members of Congress .
This group is privy to the most current and sensitive information gathered by the Central Intelligence Agency , the National Security Agency , the military intelligence organizations , and several others sources ( Bryce , 2005 ) .
PFIAB operates in complete secrecy .
According to Salon magazine , members of this oversight board “ are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act and unlike other public servants who work for the president , there is no public disclosure of the PFIAB members ’ financial interests ” ( Bryce , 2005 ) .
Several experts are persuaded that Hunt ’s position at PFIAB could easily benefit both Hunt Oil ’s worldwide energy interests and Halliburton , which has been awarded billions of dollars worth of no -bid , cost - plus contracts in Iraq by the U.S. government ( Bryce , 2005 ; Wolffe and Bailey , 2005 ) .
Hunt has been on Halliburton ’s board of directors since 1998 , when Dick Cheney was running the company and serving as an SMU trustee ( 1997 - 2000 ) .
Interestingly , soon after Hunt joined the Halliburton board , he was placed on its compensation committee , where he helped determine Cheney ’s pay package ( Bryce , 2005 ) .
In fact , in 1998 Hunt ’s committee decided that Cheney deserved a $ 3.78 million bonus ( Bryce , 2005 ) , and in 2000 he got $ 33.7 million award when he joined the Bush campaign ( Bryce , 2000 ) .
Halliburton has outdone even Enron in using offshore tax shelters to avoid paying taxes .
By 2005 , Halliburton had 58 offshore subsidiaries in Caribbean tax havens ( Turnipseed , 2005 ) .
In 1998 , the year Hunt joined Cheney at Halliburton , the company paid $ 302 million in taxes .
In 1999 , with the use of offshore tax havens , Halliburton paid no taxes and even received $ 85 million in refunds from the IRS ( Turnipseed , 2005 ) .
Halliburton also utilized its offshore companies to contract services and sell banned equipment to Iran , Iraq , and Libya — something that would have violated federal law if Halliburton had not used offshore subsidiaries ( Turnipseed , 2005 ) .
New York City Controller William Thompson said that profits made by Halliburton from states that sponsor terrorism , such as Iran and Libya , is nothing short of “ blood money ” ( Halliburtonwatch , 2007 ) .
Despite using tax havens and earning millions in profits from rogue states like Iran , Halliburton experienced financial distress .
In late 2001 , according to Fortune magazine , after a series of financial debacles and billions in asbestos - related liability claims , Halliburton stock plummeted to $ 8.50 a share , and Wall Street worried about the corporation ’s survival ( Elkind , 2005 ) .
Halliburton ’s fortunes changed dramatically with the onset of the “ war of choice ” in Iraq .
Before the war , Halliburton was 19th on the U.S. Army ’s list of utilized contractors ; by 2003 it was number one .
The company has been awarded at least $ 11 billion in government contracts since Bush took office ( Mayer , 2004 ) .
And Ray Hunt has become an even richer billionaire .
In March of 2003 Halliburton stock was valued at $ 20.50 per share and by March of 2007 it was worth $ 64.12 per share ( Rich , 2007 ) .
According to the Forbes list of the World ’s Richest People in 2003 , at the beginning of the Iraq war Ray Hunt was worth $ 2.3 billion ( Forbes , 2003 ) and by 2007 his fortune had grown to $ 3.5 billion ( Dallas Business Journal , 2007 ) .
Both Hunt and Halliburton have been winners in the Iraq war .
To provide perspective , the $ 1.2 billion increase in riches in four years by Hunt is greater than SMU ’s total endowment garnered since 1911 ( SMU , 2006 ) .
In 2005 audits by the Pentagon , the Government Accountability Office , and other agencies found that $ 1.8 billion of the $ 11 billion in contracts to Halliburton ( 16.4 percent ) to be either “ unjustified ” or “ undocumented ” charges to the government ( Elkind , 2005 ) .
In addition , the auditors reported widespread problems with record keeping and a refusal to provide required information , as well as misleading the auditors about its efforts to seek competitive prices .
According to Fortune magazine , Halliburton ’s “ war profiteering ” also involved outrageous price - gouging for fuel and services to the troops , such as charging $ 100 to wash a 15 - pound bag of clothes and serving out - of - date food to the troops ( Elkind , 2005 ) .
As long - ago as September of 2004 , the U.S. military called for “ the immediate termination of Halliburton ’s most lucrative contract with Army because of poor performance ” ( Halliburtonwatch , 2005 ) .
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and President Bush ignored the request .
When Fortune magazine tried to speak to Hunt about the company ’s questionable practices , its phone calls were not returned ( Elkind , 2005 ) .
None of these jaw - dropping scandals kept Halliburton from obtaining a new federal contract to build a maximum - security prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba ( Ivanovich , 2005 ; Buncombe , 2006 ) .
In a separate business dealing , Hunt Oil has a major role in the development of the Camisea Natural Gas Project in an unspoiled rain forest in Peru .
This project has encountered fierce opposition because of concerns that the pipeline will destroy the rainforest and the lives of the indigenous peoples in the region ( Grimaldi , 2002 ) .
Amazon Watch , an environmental and human rights group , calls the Camisea Gas Project “ the most damaging project in the Amazon Basin ” ( Amazon Watch , 2007 ) .
The ( London ) Independent newspaper reported that the project “ will enrich some of [ President Bush ’s ] closest corporate campaign contributors ” but that it “ risks the destruction of one of the world ’s remaining pristine stretches of rain forest and threatens the lives of indigenous peoples ” ( Halliburtonwatch , 2004 ) .
Does
Hunt ’s position on PFIAB and the government intelligence to which he is privy give him a business advantage in dealing with this and numerous other projects ?
There is no way to be certain .
What is clear , as journalist Robert Bryce has observed , is that “ Hunt ’s business operations are so vast that every bit of foreign intelligence he sees at PFIAB could potentially be of value to him and his associates ” ( Bryce , 2005 ) .
Finally , there is another trustee associated with Hunt Oil who may benefit from intelligence gathered by Ray Hunt at the PFIAB and who appears to have conflicts of interest related to her long - standing relationship with Bush .
Jeanne L. Phillips , who was appointed as an SMU Trustee in 2004 , was personally chosen by Ray Hunt as his senior vice president of corporate affairs and international relations in 2005 ( Solomon , 2005 ) .
According to her official U.S. Department of State biography , Ms. Phillips “ served as Senior Advisor for National Finance in the Presidential campaign of George W. Bush , developing the original fund - raising plan and structure for the finance organization … ” ( U.S. Department of State , 2001 ) .
She was appointed Ambassador to France and Permanent Representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development by President Bush in 2001 .
She told the New York Times in 2005 that she had been a close friend of the Bushes since 1979 when she worked as a fund - raiser for George H.W. Bush .
She postponed her wedding plans to chair the Bush 2005 presidential inaugural events ( Solomon , 2005 ) .
Other SMU Trustees with the appearance of significant conflicts of interest

She pledged to raise at least $ 100,000 for the 2000 Bush presidential campaign and gave $ 25,000 toward the 2001 Bush inaugural gala ( Public Citizen ’s Congress Watch , 2007 ) .
Michael M. Boone is a corporate attorney and founding partner of the prominent law firm Haynes & Boone .
According to its website , Haynes & Boone has 430 lawyers and 10 offices worldwide ( World Services Group , 2007 ) .
It was the third largest contributor to the Bush re-election in 2004 .
The firm and Mr. Boone have been active financial and political supporters of Bush since he ran for governor .
Mr. Boone pledged to raise at least $ 100,000 for the 2000 presidential campaign and at least another $ 200,000 in 2004 .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics , Mr. Boone and his law firm were the ninth - largest patron of George W. Bush ’s overall political career ( Public Citizen ’s Congress Watch , 2004 ) .
Rev. Kirbyjon Caldwell is Senior Pastor of Windsor Village United Methodist Church in Houston .
He introduced Bush at the 2000 Republican National Convention and campaigned with him in the 2000 and 2004 elections .
He gave the benediction at both presidential inaugurations , has stayed overnight at the White House , and has traveled with the president aboard Air Force One on campaign trips ( Gaines , 2002 ) .
The president has said the he considers Rev. Caldwell to be a trusted friend and close confidant ( White House Press Office , 2003 ; Caldwell , 2007 ) .
Donald J. Carty is Chair of Virgin America and former Chair and CEO of American Airlines .
He contributed $ 52,000 for the re-election of Bush in 2004 ( Fundrace , 2007 ) and $ 100,000 to the Bush 2005 presidential inaugural gala ( Public Citizen ’s Congress Watch , 2007 ) .
Carty was appointed by President Bush in 2002 to the National Infrastructure Advisory Board .
Rev. Mark Craig is Senior Pastor of Highland Park United Methodist Church in Dallas , where President Bush is a member .
He has been a long - time friend and admirer of Bush .
According to the PBS program Religion and Ethics , Rev. Craig expressed unfettered enthusiasm for Bush in these public comments :
I think what you [ Bush ] did for me , you have done for others .
I think you have brought healing and brought hope to the young , to the elderly , to the marginalized , to the dispossessed .
And that ’s what Moses did .
That ’s what Moses did .
He was chosen by God , as you have been chosen by God , to lead the people ( Religion and Ethics , 2001 ) .
Rev. Craig has not expressed equal ardor for the 15 UMC bishops , two former presidents of the New Zealand Methodist Church , a former president of the Irish Methodist Church , two superintendents in the British Methodist Church , 35 members of his congregation , several highly respected Protestant theologians , and more than 10,000 Christians ( mostly United Methodists ) who have signed a petition calling for the rejection of the Bush complex .
Craig labeled these fellow Christians “ a marginal group , a fringe group , ” ironically asserting that if they do not share his high opinion of Bush they are “ being grossly judgmental ” ( Hacker , Gillman , and Hodges , 2007 ) .
Rev. Craig and Bishop Scott Jones of Kansas told the Dallas Morning News that fellow United Methodists who signed the petition and objected to the Bush complex “ would have no influence on them as SMU trustees . ”
Moreover , they declared that “ they as trustees — not the United Methodist Church — have the final say on decisions that SMU makes about the library ” ( Hacker , Gillman , and Hodges , 2007 ) .
Rev. Craig and Bishop Jones made this statement despite the fact that the UMC founded and owns SMU and the trustees are appointed under the authority of the church .
Jeanne Tower Cox is the daughter of the late Senator John Tower .
She and George W. Bush are on the steering committee of a group called Associated Republicans of Texas that has one of the largest political action committees in the state with over $ 1.2 million in funds ( 100 Biggest PACs in Texas , 2007 ) .
The group reads like a who ’s who list of leading Republican Party activists in Texas , including U.S. Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn .
It has roots back to 1975 when the founders committed “ to putting their time and money ” into rebuilding the Republican Party in Texas ( Associated Republicans of Texas , 2007 ) .
Robert H. Dedman , Jr. is Chair and CEO of Club Corp. International .
The Dedmans are long time friends of the Bush family , and Mr. Dedman raised at least $ 100,000 for the 2000 Bush presidential campaign .
Alan Feld is a lobbyist and one of two senior executive partners of the 25th largest law firm in the U.S.
It has 900 employees and offices in Dubai , Dallas , Moscow , Beijing , Washington and 10 other locations worldwide ( Akin , Gump , Strauss , Hauer & Feld LLP , 2006 ) .
He pledged to raise at least $ 100,000 for the 2000 Bush presidential campaign .
Carl Sewell is Chair of the SMU Board and Chair of Sewell Automotive Companies in Dallas .
He and his spouse together donated $ 54,000 toward the re-election of President Bush : $ 50,000 to the RNC and $ 2,000 each to the Bush / Cheney committee to re-elect .
A Second death penalty
Veritas Liberabit Vos
— SMU motto
SMU is the only university in history to receive a “ death penalty ” from the National Collegiate Athletics Association ( NCAA ) .
In 1987 the NCAA required , among other things , that the university cancel its football season ( White , 1989 ) .
The NCAA cited the need to “ eliminate a program that was built on a legacy of wrongdoing , deceit and rule violations ” ( McNabb , 1987 ) .
The scandal was a deep embarrassment to SMU and the UMC and which centered on the misconduct of a number of trustees and school officials , along with a lack of proper oversight by the UMC ( Wangrin , 2007 ; The Bishop ’s Committee Report on SMU , 1987 ) .
It involved a slush fund of $ 61,000 distributed to 13 football players , as well as the continuation of payments to players involving SMU officials while the school was serving a two - year probation for prior rules violations ( Wangrin , 2007 ) .
When the scandal broke , the chair of the trustees was the Republican ex-governor of Texas , William Clements .
Working on his re-election staff as governor was none other than Karl Rove , who was entangled in nasty allegations involving Clements ’ re-election efforts ( Dubose , 2001 ; Ivins , 2006 ) .
According to the San Antonio Express - News , Bill Clements was smack in the middle of the SMU football mess ( Wangrin , 2007 ) .
He admitted on March 3 , 1987 , “ that while sitting on the SMU board , he and other school officials had approved a secret plan to continue illegal payments to SMU players ” ( Wangrin , 2007 ) .
Clements insisted that all the members of SMU ’s board of trustees were in on the fix .
All denied it , including Ray Hunt .
UMC bishops had to intervene to save the university and its board from total disgrace ( Wangrin , 2007 ) .
Two of the strongest recommendations the bishops made to SMU were to place “ limits on the length of time a person can serve as a trustee and create more diversity among the trustees ” ( Bishops ’ Committee Report on SMU , 1987 ) .
The football scandal came as result of a concentration of power in the hands of a few like - minded , long - time trustees , who acted in secret against the best interests of the university .
Only two trustees are on the 2007 board who were there in the scandal - ridden years of 1983 - 1987 , Ray Hunt and vice chair Richard Ware .
The humiliation to SMU and the UMC from that self - inflicted wound of the athletic program debacle will pale in comparison to what will unfold if the partisan Bush complex goes to SMU without adequate oversight .
University President R. Gerald
Turner has repeatedly stated his belief that “ When a President is in office , everything is political ; when he leaves office , it becomes historical ” ( Turner , 2006 ) .
Given the extreme secrecy and nefarious behavior within this presidency , nothing could be more counter to reality ( Chandrasekaran , 2006 ; Greenberg , 2005 ; Isikoff and Corn , 2007 ; Saar and Novak , 2005 ) .
Over the remainder of Bush ’s life , horror stories of war crimes that were committed under his authority undoubtedly will spill out ( Murray , 2007 ) .
We will continue to hear about clandestine torture and the international kidnapping of innocents ( Miles , 2006 ; Ratner , 2004 ) .
The full extent of the lies that were told by this administration to start a greed - based war will be uncovered and the real story of war profiteering by Bush ’s friends will be told ( Chandrasekaran , 2006 ; Isikoff and Corn , 2007 ) .
SMU and the Bush Institute bubble may well become the final bastion in the defense of the indefensible , and the United Methodist Church will continue to be stained by its complicity and collaboration .
What you can do
The UMC bishops within the region where SMU is located have the power to stop the Bush partisan institute .
If they say no to Bush , he will not go to SMU .
The church owns the school .
Contact these bishops in a courteous manner telling them of your concerns .

Dr. Butler said some of Cuba ’s shortcomings may actually improve its health profile .
“ Because they do n’t have up - to - date cars , they tend to have to exercise more by walking , ” he said .
“ And they may not have a surfeit of food , which keeps them from problems like obesity , but they ’re not starving , either . ”
Cuban markets are not always well stocked , but city streets are dotted with hot dog and ice cream vendors .
Bellies are full , but such food can cause problems in the future , as it has in the United States .
Dr. Butler has just completed a study that shows it is possible that because of the epidemic of obesity in children , “ this may be the first generation of Americans to live less long than their parents . ”
There could be one great leveler for Cubans and Americans .
While all Cubans have at least minimal free access to doctors , more than 45 million Americans lack basic health insurance .
Many are reluctant to seek early treatment they cannot afford , Dr. Butler said .
Instead , they wait to be admitted to an emergency room .
“ I know Americans tend to be skeptical , ” he said , “ but health and education are two achievements of the Cuban revolution , and they deserve some credit despite the government ’s poor record on human rights . ”
Universal health care has long given the Cuban regime bragging rights , though there is growing concern about the future .
In the decades that Cuba drew financial and military support from the Soviet Union , Mr. Castro poured resources into medical education , creating the largest medical school in Latin America and turning out thousands of doctors to practice around the world .
But that changed after the collapse of the Soviets , according to Cuban defectors like Dr. Leonel Cordova .
By the time Dr. Cordova started practicing in 1992 , equipment and drugs were already becoming scarce .
He said he was assigned to a four - block neighborhood in Havana Province where he was supposed to care for about 600 people .
Dentistry has taken the same approach to tooth decay — filling cavities — for decades , but new techniques for rebuilding teeth from the inside out could transform the profession over the next decade .
Photo : Hollingsworth / Corbis
The next time your children get cavities , they might get tooth regeneration instead of fillings .
That 's because materials scientists are beginning to find just the right solutions of chemicals to rebuild decayed teeth , rather than merely patching their holes .
Enamel and dentin , the materials that make teeth the strongest pieces of the body , would replace the gold or ceramic fillings that currently return teeth to working order .
" What we 're hoping to have happen is to catch [ decaying teeth ] early and remineralize them , " said Sally Marshall , a professor at the University of California at San Francisco .
Marshall gave a talk last week at the spring meeting of the Materials Research Society on rebuilding the inner portions of teeth .
While regrowing your uncle 's toothless grin from scratch is still a decade away , the ability to use some of the body 's own building materials for oral repair would be a boon to dentists , who have been fixing cavities with metal fillings since the 1840s .
Enamel and dentin are remarkably strong and long - lasting , and they can repair themselves .
But as scientists are continuing to find out , dentin in particular is a remarkably complex structure .
The outer covering of teeth is enamel .
The body makes it by growing tiny mineral crystals in a highly regular crystal lattice .
Underneath that ceramic - like covering , dentin is like hard clay reinforced by fibers of collagen , similar to the way adobe bricks contain clay reinforced by straw fibers .
" The tooth is a beautiful structure , " said Van Thompson , dentistry professor and chairman of New York University 's Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics .
But teeth , because they are made from minerals , are susceptible to what is essentially erosion .
Acids , like those produced by bacteria or Coca - Cola , demineralize the enamel of the teeth .
Usually the body is constantly repairing small amounts of damage , Marshall said .
But when the body 's defenses become overwhelmed , bacteria break through into the dentin below , and you get tooth decay , commonly called a cavity .
The acid produced by the bacteria eats into the minerals in the dentin , turning it mushy and useless .
Normal dentin is twice as stiff as pinewood , but damaged dentin is more like rubber , which makes it pretty hard to chew with .
Marshall 's newest work , which has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Structural Biology , focuses on regrowing dentin in damaged teeth with the help of a calcium - containing solution of ions ( electrically charged particles ) .
By putting a layer of the solution on individual test teeth , Marshall has already been able to remineralize some parts of the teeth .
The challenge is to get the crystals to regrow throughout the dentin .
To heal properly , the crystals need to form from the bottom of the tooth up to the enamel .
Marshall is n't sure whether that 's happening yet , but she is confident that she 'll find a way to restore dentin functionality over the next few years .
Stephen Bayne , professor of dentistry at the University of Michigan , noted that while many groups are working on regrowing teeth , Marshall has " incredible stature " in dentistry for her groundbreaking work helping dentists understand the structure of the tooth .
Still , even with the recent progress , the very complexity that Marshall and other researchers have discovered in the humble tooth is likely to keep her technique out of your local dentist 's office for a few more years .
" We 're still a ways from being able to grow back dentin and enamel , " Bayne said .

John McCain , struggling to consolidate his support in the conservative wing of the Republican party , was today forced to deny a report of an affair with a lobbyist for the telecommunications industry .
Flanked by his wife , Cindy , a subdued McCain told a press conference in Toledo , Ohio , there was no basis to a story in the New York Times of a relationship eight years ago with the lobbyist , Vicki Iseman .
" It 's not true , " he said .
The newspaper had reported that aides to McCain had confronted Iseman in 1999 and told her to stay away from McCain because they were concerned that the tie to the lobbyist could hurt his political career .
This morning 's appearance brought a decidedly muted response from McCain only hours after his aides railed against the story as " gutter politics " and a " smear campaign " .
Although McCain has a reputation on Capitol Hill as a man with an explosive temper , he spoke in a quiet voice and repeatedly emphasised his " disappointment " with the Times .
McCain 's wife preserved the measured tone , stepping up only briefly to the microphone to say : " My children and I not only trust my husband but , more importantly , know that he would never do anything to disappoint our family and more importantly disappoint America . "
As McCain himself acknowledged today , the allegations appear at a delicate time .
After hauling his campaign back from the brink of collapse last summer , he is virtually assured of winning the Republican nomination against Mike Huckabee .
However , despite an insurmountable lead in the delegate race , McCain has yet to win the trust of the conservative wing of his party .
In addition to allegations of an affair , the suggestion of overly close links to lobbyists have the potential to damage McCain .
The Vietnam war hero has built his candidacy around his reputation as a crusader against Washington 's monied interests , as symbolised by his campaign bus , which he calls the Straight Talk Express .
In 2000 , McCain put his opposition to corporate interests at the centre of his failed campaign for the Republican nomination against George Bush .
The Times had been pursuing the story for months and by the time it published today , other news organisations , including the New Republic , had their own versions of the relationship between McCain and Iseman .
The newspaper said McCain had complained about its investigation during a telephone call with its executive editor , Bill Keller , in which the senator had also denied an affair with Iseman .
At the time of the alleged affair , McCain was chairman of the Senate 's powerful commerce committee .
Iseman was working on behalf of a small media chain which was seeking support from Congress for its purchase of a Pittsburgh television station .
McCain wrote two letters urging the Federal Communications Commission , the regulatory authority , to issue a decision .
But he insisted today he did not advocate on behalf of Iseman 's client , but merely pressed the FCC to speed up its process .
The newspaper said Iseman was a frequent visitor to McCain 's Senate office and that he had flown with her on a corporate jet belonging to her client , Paxson communications .
It quoted a former strategist for McCain , John Weaver , as saying in an email that he had arranged a meeting between an aide and Iseman at Washington 's Union Station to ask her to stay away from the campaign .
" Our political messaging during that time period centered around taking on the special interests and placing the nation 's interests before either personal or special interest , " the newspaper quoted Weaver saying .
" Ms. Iseman 's involvement in the campaign , it was felt by us , could undermine that effort . "
McCain denied any knowledge of such concern among his aides today , or of any such meeting with Iseman .
He insisted that he was not unduly influenced by any of his contacts with lobbyists in Washington .
" I have many friends who represent various interests ranging from the firemen to politics to senior citizens , " he said .
" The question is whether they have unwarranted access or interest and certainly no one ever has . " |
The newspaper also revived memories of a 1989 scandal involving the collapse of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association which cost taxpayers $ 3.4 billion .
Five senators , including McCain , were reprimanded for acting on behalf of the bank 's chief , Charles Keating , who was jailed in the affair .
However , some commentators suggested today that the attack might actually bolster McCain 's credentials among conservatives , who view the Times with suspicion as a liberal newspaper .
The allegations in the Times also provide potential ammunition to Barack Obama , who is favoured to be McCain 's opponent next November , and who has based his campaign message on the need for change in Washington .
Later , the McCain campaign launched a fundraising appeal based on the New York Times ' story .
" The New York Times ... has shown once again that it cannot exercise good journalistic judgment when it comes to dealing with a conservative Republican , " McCain campaign manager Rick Davis wrote in an e-mail to supporters .
" We need your help to counteract the liberal establishment and fight back against The New York Times by making an immediate contribution today .
" We think the story speaks for itself , " Times executive editor Bill Keller said in a written statement .
" On the timing , our policy is we publish stories when they are ready . "
This week the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) announced that it had entered into a consent agreement with Aurora Dairy , one the nation ’s largest producer of organic milk .
Their milk is sold under house brands by Wal - Mart , Costco , Target , Safeway , and other supermarkets .
Aurora was cited for fraudulently selling milk that really was n’t organic .
Aurora ’s widespread violation of the organic standards included raising their cows on feedlots instead of providing grazing space .
According to the Cornucopia Institute these “ were willful and premeditated violations of the law . ”
Alright , so what ’s the story here ?
A dairy company broke the rules and was caught .
Well , there is more to it than that .
The fact that Aurora ( along with other big dairies ) was breaking the rules for a long - time was well known and documented by the Cornucopia Institute .
Given the crime , the punishment imposed — basically probation — was extraordinarily mild .
The Aurora Dairy incident is one example of a general phenomenon — namely , regulators tend to be captured by the corporate interests that they are regulating .
In economics , Gresham ’s Law explains why bad money drives out good money .
This law is frequently misunderstood .
Detractors of free - markets frequently seek to apply Gresham ’s Law to products other than money .
Their antipathy to free - markets leads them to claim that the market rewards the lowest common dominator .
Yet , a moment ’s reflection shows this to be untrue .
Nordstrom peacefully coexists with Wal - Mart ; and Hyundai with BMW .
Good products and “ inferior ” products coexist .
Consumers decide which products best fits their needs given their preferences and income .
Thus , some households choose organic products while many others still choose the less expensive , non-organic alternative .
Gresham ’s
Law only works when the bad money and the good money are both legal tender .
For instance , when both silver quarters and non-silver quarters were circulated side - by - side , the public quickly took the more valuable silver quarters out of circulation .
Bad money ( non-silver quarters ) drove out good money ( silver quarters ) , but that was only because shopkeepers were obligated to treat both silver and non-silver quarters as having the same value .
Back to milk .
The USDA organic label acts as a sort of legal tender .
If you go to the supermarket and there are two brands of milk both labeled as USDA organic , there would be no apparent reason to pay four dollars a half gallon for one brand when the second brand is only three dollars a half gallon .
In your mind , the organic seal would give the impression that both the higher priced milk and the lower priced milk were equivalent products .
Thus , when the USDA awards the organic symbol to dairy companies that are not following the rules , they create the circumstances for bad milk to drive out good milk .
The producer who is not cheating finds it very difficult to compete .
Good milk producers cannot differentiate themselves by claiming to be “ super - organic ” since government regulations prohibit such non-sanctioned claims .
I have been a consumer of organic food for almost thirty years .
Before there were USDA organic standards , there were private certifying bodies establishing reliable standards for organic food .
As a consumer , I know I trusted those private certifying bodies far more than the government ’s standard .
Unlike the USDA , these private certifying bodies had simply no incentive to be captured by corporate interests .
Why ?
Simple .
Their own credibility was on the line .
One scandal like Aurora Dairy and the certifying body would be out of business .
In contrast , no matter how badly the USDA screws up , we can be sure of one thing :
The USDA budget will be bigger next year and the taxpayer will pay more .

Raikkonen is right back in the title battle after his win
The Finn passed his Ferrari team - mate Felipe Massa thanks to a stunning lap before his first pit stop , after which he dominated the race .
Massa spun out of second place , gifting it to BMW Sauber 's Robert Kubica , with Heikki Kovalainen 's McLaren third .
McLaren 's Lewis Hamilton was held up in his charge from ninth on the grid by a pit - stop problem and ended up fifth .
That was one place behind the impressive Toyota of Jarno Trulli , who had battled for third with Kovalainen , only for the Italian to drop back with an earlier final pit stop .
Mark Webber 's Red Bull headed Hamilton for much of the race but the Australian was leapfrogged at the final pit stops by the Englishman and Nick Heidfeld 's BMW Sauber .
The great thing is I was able to drive the race without water and I feel better than I did last year
Lewis Hamilton
Heidfeld took sixth place , ahead of Webber , who held off a late charge from double world champion Fernando Alonso 's Renault .
With the four points for fifth added to his 10 for winning the first race in Australia a week ago , Hamilton retains the championship lead .
But Raikkonen is now just three points behind him , and the scene looks set for the intense battle between the two men that was widely predicted before the season .
The Finn buried memories of a chaotic start to the season in Melbourne with a drive befitting a champion .
He qualified second to Massa , with a lap 's more fuel on board , and , after pulling out of an attempt to pass him on the run down to the first corner , he tracked the Brazilian closely until he made his first stop on lap 17 .
Kubica drove an impressive , unobtrusive race to second
Raikkonen then put the hammer down , setting fastest times for each corner of the lap before coming in for his own stop .
His on - the - limit lap was just enough to ensure he emerged from the pits in front of Massa .
And once in the lead , Raikkonen edged ever further ahead of the second Ferrari to make the race his own .
Raikkonen said : " I got alongside Felipe after I got a bit better start but I thought we do n't want to risk between the team - mates in the first corner , and I decided to stay behind and try my move on the first stop and it worked out perfectly .
" We were pretty similar speed - wise , but once he went in my car went better and I was able to go much quicker on my in - lap and pass him .
" After that the car was handling perfectly and I was able to go away .
606 : DEBATE
" It was a pretty easy race from that first pitstop really .
" We had quite a difficult weekend in Australia and we were not 100 % sure it was going to be any different here .
" But everything worked perfectly .
This is a good start to the season for us and we 're in a pretty good position . "
Massa then spun away his chances of second place with an unforced error that left him beached in the gravel trap at turn eight .
He said he did not know what had caused the spin .
Behind the Ferraris , Kubica had a lonely race , not fast enough to challenge the red cars , but well ahead of the rest on his way to the best result of his career .
For a while early in the race it appeared that Hamilton might challenge the Pole for the final podium spot .
The Englishman leaped up from ninth on the grid , to where he was demoted for holding up Heidfeld in qualifying , to finish the first lap in fifth place with some clever overtaking .
He then tracked Webber until the Red Bull pitted on lap 16 , but Hamilton 's hopes of leapfrogging the Australian in the pits were dashed when his mechanics struggled to get his right - front wheel off .
Hamilton had a trying afternoon and lost out to Trulli
That delayed Hamilton by about 12 seconds , and he found himself behind Webber again .
Hamilton finally got past into fifth when Webber made his final stop on lap 40 but , although he closed in on Trulli , he was unable to pass the Toyota on the final lap .
" We got off to a very , very good start from ninth to fifth and I was pushing Mark for a long , long time but being behind someone is extremely difficult so it does n't matter how much quicker you are , it makes it extremely difficult to get past , " Hamilton said .
" Then we were in with a good shot for third place and then we had the wheel gun at the pit stop .
" I was very thirsty as my water was n't working .
I pushed hard for fourth but Jarno did a great job .
" The great thing is I was able to drive the race without water and I feel better than I did last year but we just have to do a better job in qualifying at the next race . "

WASHINGTON  The Justice Department has told Congress that American intelligence operatives attempting to thwart terrorist attacks can legally use interrogation methods that might otherwise be prohibited under international law .
The legal interpretation , outlined in recent letters , sheds new light on the still - secret rules for interrogations by the Central Intelligence Agency .
It shows that the administration is arguing that the boundaries for interrogations should be subject to some latitude , even under an executive order issued last summer that President Bush said meant that the C.I.A. would comply with international strictures against harsh treatment of detainees .
While the Geneva Conventions prohibit “ outrages upon personal dignity , ” a letter sent by the Justice Department to Congress on March 5 makes clear that the administration has not drawn a precise line in deciding which interrogation methods would violate that standard , and is reserving the right to make case - by - case judgments .
“ The fact that an act is undertaken to prevent a threatened terrorist attack , rather than for the purpose of humiliation or abuse , would be relevant to a reasonable observer in measuring the outrageousness of the act , ” said Brian A. Benczkowski , a deputy assistant attorney general , in the letter , which had not previously been made public .
The judge who used to sit in charge of the American star chamber secret court issuing surveillance warrants says that his organisation should not have been sidestepped by the Bush administration in the wake of 9/11 .
Royce Lamberth was head of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court from 1995 to 2002 .
As such , he was responsible for authorising secret intelligence - gathering operations in America involving terror and espionage cases .
The FIS Court - set up in response to various spook scandals in the 1970s - turns down only 1 per cent of applications it receives for wiretaps , surveillance , bugging and covert burglaries ( sorry , searches ) .
As is now fairly well known , in the wake of the 9/11 outrages President Bush decided that even this behind - closed - doors , quite compliant judicial oversight was too cumbersome .
The White House then authorised the National Security Agency to monitor Americans ' overseas calls , emails etc without going through the FIS warrant process .
After a lengthy political and judicial fracas , the NSA programme was put back under FIS oversight again this year , but President Bush still maintains that he has the power to order surveillance on his own initiative at any time .
( Aside : Brits and other non-US readers should note that the American debate is entirely regarding the privacy rights of Americans .
There is n't much doubt that the NSA can listen to our phone calls and read our emails without let or hindrance .
It would be nice to think that our own spies were doing the same in America but , at least in the case of Brits , that 's not very realistic . )
In any case , Lamberth says that President Bush overstepped his bounds when he sidelined the FIS .
" I have n't seen a proposal for a better way than presenting an application to the FIS court and having an independent judge decide if it 's really the kind of thing that we ought to be doing , recognizing that how we view civil liberties is different in time of war , " he said .
" I have seen a proposal for a worse way and that 's what the president did with the NSA program . "
The former secret judge said that such a strategy would yield pyrrhic victories at best in the fight of liberty against extremism .
" What we have found in the history of our country is that you can't trust the executive , " he said .
" We have to understand you can fight the war [ on terror ] and lose everything if you have no civil liberties left when you get through fighting the war . "
The Bush administration had suggested that the FIS surveillance - approval process was too cumbersome and time - consuming , holding up the struggle against terrorists .
Lamberth strongly denied this , saying that he had always been happy to issue warrants for taps and burglaries at a moment 's notice .
Apparently he approved five secret operations by cellphone while stuck in traffic on the morning of 9/11 , and was always happy to unleash federal operatives against their possibly traitorous fellow citizens - even in the small hours of the morning or at weekends .
The good judge also criticised the FBI 's implementation of Patriot Act measures , in which 56 regional supervisors were delegated powers to issue the controversial National Security Letters ( NSLs ) .
NSLs not only permit swashbuckling , unregulated surveillance , but they can also be accompanied by terrifying Soviet - style gag orders that can forbid any discussion of the NSL having been issued , on pain of a five - year stretch in the cooler .
Lamberth apparently acquits the administration of any evil intent , but there is n't much doubt that he feels judicial oversight must not be dispensed with .
That 's not too surprising in a judge , of course .
Even so it has to be something of a warning sign when someone who 's seen all the justification - all the secret poop that would make us all love Big Brother did we but know the awfulness of the threat , etc - says that the spooks and the executive branch are getting out of hand .
The AP report on Judge Lamberth 's speech on Saturday can be read here .®
Yesterday , the Supreme Court threw our entire diplomatic corps , the State Department , and possibly every treaty the U.S. has ever signed that is still in force , into complete disarray .
And in the process , the Court may have inflicted more harm to our national authority and international standing than anything President Bush II has done to date , including invading Iraq .
And that harm may turn out to have fantastic reach and duration if Congress and the President do n’t immediately step in to rectify the Court ’s gross error .
The Supreme Court essentially invalidated an international treaty by blocking federal enforcement of the treaty ’s obligations .
First , a little background .
The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations insists that foreign nationals be provided consular access if they ’re charged with a crime that could bring the death penalty .
And even though Bush has withdrawn the U.S. from this part of the treaty ( while still demanding that our citizens be granted similar rights , nonetheless ) , he sought to force the state of Texas to comply with the treaty regarding a Mexican national who confessed to the rape and murder of two teenage girls .
Texas refused and , yesterday , the Supreme Court sided with the state of Texas .
On the surface , this is a rebuke to the Bush Administration and a victory for “ states rights ” , and in fact most media outlets are playing these aspects up .
The Washington Post opened their story with “ The Supreme Court yesterday issued a broad ruling limiting presidential power and the reach of international treaties , saying neither President Bush nor the World Court has the authority to order a Texas court to reopen a death penalty case involving a foreign national . ”
The Post does n’t even mention the diplomatic fallout from the story , focusing entirely on the domestic side of the decision .
The New York Times did a little better in addressing the international ramifications by quoting from the dissenter ’s opinion :
In a dissenting opinion , Justice Stephen G. Breyer disagreed with that interpretation .
He also said the majority had set too rigid a formula for deciding whether treaties were “ self - executing . ”
He warned that the decision threatened to destabilize the countryâ€™s relations with treaty partners under dozens of pacts .
As a result of the decision , Justice Breyer said , “ the nation may well break its word even though the president seeks to live up to that word and Congress has done nothing to suggest the contrary . ”
NPR ’s Supreme Court reporter , Nina Totenberg , covered the diplomatic side of this decision the best in her story .
Yale Law School Dean Harold Koh , who served as a State Department official in the Clinton administration , said the decision would create havoc in diplomatic circles for some time to come .
“ If our international allies have no assurance that we ’re actually going to keep our word , then they have much less incentive to keep their word when they ’re being obliged to do something , ” he said … .
Temple law professor Duncan Hollis , an expert on international law , said that nonetheless , Tuesday ’s ruling will have practical consequences .
Because enforcement of some existing treaties may now be in doubt , negotiations over future treaties could be more difficult , he said , with general assurances of enforcement failing to suffice .
Until yesterday , the President ’s authority to enforce our treaty obligations was largely unquestioned .
Today , however , that ’s no longer the case .
Now the President needs to negotiate and sign a treaty , the Senate needs to ratify it , and then the entire Congress needs to pass explicit enforcement legislation in order to implement the very directive of U.S. Constitution :
All Treaties made , or which shall be made , under the Authority of the United States , shall be the supreme Law of the Land ; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby …
Justices Roberts , Scalia , Thomas , Alito , Kennedy , and , amazingly enough , Justice Stevens – it ’s obvious what your problem is .
BEIJING  Armed with her laptop and her indignation , Zhu Xiaomeng sits in her dorm room here , stoking a popular backlash against Western support for Tibet that has unnerved foreign investors and Western diplomats and , increasingly , the ruling Communist Party .
Over the last week , Ms. Zhu and her classmates have been channeling anger over anti-China protests during the tumultuous Olympic torch relay into a boycott campaign against French companies , blamed for their country ’s support of pro-Tibetan agitators .
Some have also called for a boycott against American chains like McDonald ’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken .
On Friday and Saturday , protesters gathered in front of a half - dozen outlets of the French retailer Carrefour , including a demonstration in the central city of Wuhan that reportedly drew several thousand people , according to Agence France - Presse .
On Saturday , about 50 demonstrators carrying banners held a brief rally at the French Embassy here before the police shooed them away .
For the moment , however , most of the outrage is confined to the Internet .
More than 20 million people have signed online petitions saying they plan to stop shopping at the Carrefour chain , Louis Vuitton and other stores linked to France because of what they see as the country ’s failure to protect the torch during its visit to Paris two weeks ago .
In a survey released on Friday , China ’s state news agency , known as Xinhua , said 66 percent of those who responded said they would stay away from Carrefour during a monthlong boycott planned for May .
“ I ’m speaking only to them , ” he said .
“ I did n’t set out to tell the world about how to live life . ”
After Mr. Zaslow , a Carnegie Mellon alumnus who is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal , wrote about the talk , it quickly became an Internet sensation .
Image Randy F. Pausch on a monorail with his son , Dylan , and father , Fred , who died in 2006 .
With the clarity of thought that perhaps only a person facing death can muster , Dr. Pausch , in his lecture and his book , outlines his recipe for a happy life and achieving dreams .
He talks of reaching his childhood goals of experiencing zero gravity , writing an article in the World Book Encyclopedia , winning giant stuffed animals at amusement parks and being a Disney “ imagineer . ”
Much of his talk is about tenacity and how he managed to scale the “ brick walls ” that stood in the way of achieving some of his dreams .
Other lessons are those that all parents hope to teach their children  show gratitude , tell the truth , no job is beneath you .
And he urges parents to let their children draw on the bedroom walls  where the young Randy Pausch painted a quadratic equation , a rocket , an elevator and , from one of his favorite stories , Pandora ’s box .
At the bottom of the box , he added the word “ Hope ” that a friend later preceded with “ Bob . ”
Dr. Pausch says he is trying to use his unexpected celebrity to draw attention to the lack of financing for pancreatic cancer research .
Testifying before Congress on behalf of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network ( www.pancan.org), he showed a picture of his family .
“ This is my widow , ” he said pointing to his wife , Jai .
“ That ’s not a grammatical construction you get to use every day , but there are n’t many diseases where you know it will be fatal . ”
Because Dr. Pausch has outlived his initial prognosis , a few bloggers have begun to speculate that he is not really dying .
Doctors at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Pittsburgh have confirmed Dr. Pausch ’s diagnosis and treatment .
“ There ’s nothing to be cynical about in how he ’s choosing to approach these last months of his life , ” said Robbee Kosak , vice president for university advancement at Carnegie Mellon .
“ He ’s always been very passionate .
He ’s always very pragmatic .
He knows exactly what his priorities are .
People like Randy are so rare .
We should all be really happy that so many of us have had a chance now to see that it ’s possible to live your life with passion and energy and candor . ”
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Fresh rioting broke out in a Tibetan area of southwest China , defying a huge security crackdown there , even as officials in Tibet vowed swift , harsh punishment for those who sparked the initial anti-Chinese unrest .
Chinese security forces guard a street in Lhasa , Tibet April 1 , 2008 .
The words on the signboard read , " Carry out duties in a civilized manner , maintain stability .
Please cooperate with checks and thank you for your cooperation . "

The latest riot to shake Tibetan areas of China occurred on Thursday night in Donggu Township , Ganzi ( Garze ) Prefecture , a largely ethnic Tibetan area in Sichuan province ’s mountainous west , Xinhua news agency reported late on Friday .
“ Police were forced to fire warning shots and put down the violence , ” an official with the prefectural government said .
“ An official was attacked and seriously wounded in a riot , ” the brief report said , adding that he was “ seriously wounded . ”
The report did not explain the cause of the unrest or whether it involved ethnic Tibetans , who have been protesting against China ’s rule and calling for the return of the exiled Buddhist leader , the Dalai Lama .
Ganzi and neighboring Aba in Sichuan province have seen torrid confrontation between Tibetan protesters and police in past weeks .
Anti-riot troops have poured into the area .
A mob armed with stones and knives killed an armed Chinese policeman in Ganzi late last month .
On March 16 , Buddhist monks and residents in Aba protested , demanding Tibetan independence from China .
More than 200 police and officials there were hurt when violence broke out , a local official said this week .
The widespread unrest began in Lhasa , the capital of neighboring Tibet province , and there officials on Friday vowed quick trials for those behind the unrest .
Lhasa was last month hit by Buddhist monks ’ protests against Chinese rule that gave way to deadly rioting on March 14 , and since then security forces have poured in to reimpose control there and in other restive Tibetan areas .
China says 19 people died in the Lhasa violence but representatives of the Dalai Lama say some 140 people died in the unrest across Tibet and nearby areas .
Chinese officials have accused the Dalai Lama of organizing the unrest to press for Tibetan independence ahead of the Beijing Olympic Games in August , and vowed to come down hard on rioters and on protesters supporting him .
The Dalai Lama has repeatedly denied the accusations and said he wants true autonomy , but not outright independence , for Tibet .
COURTS BACK CRACKDOWN
The region ’s courts have made clear that they will back the crackdown , hand out tough verdicts and reinforce the government ’s campaign against the Dalai Lama .
Tibet ’s top law - and - order official Baima Chilin told judges to “ use the weapon of the law to attack enemies , punish crime , protect the people and maintain stability , ” the Tibet Daily reported .
“ Use trial according to the law of all the criminals to shock criminality and root out the base of the separatists .
Use ample evidence to expose to the world the Dalai clique ’s lies of peace and non-violence . ”
Baima Chilin ordered swift trials and said the judges “ have the confidence of the Party . ”

On Thursday , an official Tibet news Web site ( www.chinatibetnews.com) said police had caught over 800 people involved in the Lhasa violence and 280 people had turned themselves in .
Monks involved in the earlier protests have also been charged .
The United States and many European countries have expressed worry about the tensions , calling on Beijing to open dialogue with the Dalai Lama , winner of the Nobel Peace Prize , and allow foreign reporters and observers to freely visit Tibet .
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , Louise Arbour , held “ private discussions ” with Chinese officials on Tibet and raised access to the region , her spokesman said on Friday .
“ The issue of accessibility is obviously paramount because without that it ’s very hard to come to any conclusions about what has happened or what should happen next , ” Arbour ’s spokesman Rupert Colville told a news briefing in Geneva .
But Chinese officials and state media have criticized Western news reports of the Tibetan unrest , claiming they have misrepresented violence as peaceful protest , vilified efforts to develop Tibet , and echoed false claims of independence advocates .
A major Chinese Internet site has now launched an online petition drive aimed at condemning Western media reports on the unrest .
By Friday evening , Sina.com ’s online petition condemning Western press reports claimed close to one million signatures , with many signers voicing nationalist outrage .
There ’s no doubt that Facebook holds the title as being the most popular social media platform ever made .
Mark Zuckerberg struck gold when he developed Facebook and created the perfect place where people can keep with their friends .
However , Facebook quickly evolved to the point that every brand , business and even local corner store has a profile on it .
Therefore , Facebook is no longer just an app where people can find their old high school friends and set up meetings .
Facebook is so much more than that since people use it to share their views , ideas and companies use it to advertise their products .
Facebook 146.0.0.5.92 Beta
However , the thing that makes Facebook stand out the most in comparison with other social media platforms is the number of updates it receives .
In fact , Facebook has just been updated to the 146.0.0.5.92 version and the APK can be manually installed right now .
The new update has been developed with the sole purpose of enhancing the app ’s speed and reliability .
Therefore , the update does n’t include any major groundbreaking features .
However , it does make the app run smoother and it stops it from randomly crashing which makes this update quite important .
News and Current Events
One of the things that Facebook has been focusing on is helping users stay connected with the latest and most current events around the world .
The way in which Facebook achieved this goal is by allowing media outlets to live stream and share reports .
For example , users can subscribe to their favorite celebrities , brands or news outlets and they will always be kept up to date with the latest news regarding them .
Sharing Ideas
Another cool thing about Facebook is the fact that it gives people a platform to share their thoughts and ideas .

Coming out of today ’s meeting with John Conyers , these seem to be the significant developments :
He is circulating a letter among his colleageus for signatures , a letter addressed to Bush letting him know that an attack on Iran will result in impeachment hearings .
LET ’S ASK EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS TO SIGN ON !
I know it seems bassackwards and we want impeachment before a new war , not after , but this is a way for us to show Conyers the support that will be there any time he moves forward .
He is open to the new argument that we have been making to him , namely that impeachment hearings for Cheney or Bush ( on torture , signing statements , spying , war crimes , etc , etc ) would hurt John McCain ’s candidacy by forcing him to defend the crimes .
He is open to meeting with experts allied with us to hear their arguments for impeachment .
All of that is positive .
Still , Conyers continues to believe that elections are more important than justice , that impeachment would be bad for the elections , and that impeachment hearings would be stonewalled by the White House .
There are a couple of possible responses to the last point .
One is that impeachment hearings , including taking up H Res 799 as instructed by the full House last November , and even marking it up to add new charges , overrule claims of “ executive privilege . ”
Of course Bush and Cheney could claim otherwise , but there is an answer to that .
When Nixon refused a subpoena , the House Judiciary Committee passed an article of impeachment against him for that refusal .
Cheney and Bush have already refused subpoenas .
There ’s no need to wait .

The government wants travellers to have a better experience
The government will review the economic regulation of the UK 's airport system after a report said that operator BAA may be failing airlines and consumers .
Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly said the review would look at how to improve customer service , boost investment and deal with environmental concerns .
Earlier the Competition Commission said BAA dominated airports in south - east England and parts of Scotland .
BAA 's seven airports include Heathrow , Gatwick , Stansted and Edinburgh .
The company , which is owned by Spain 's Ferrovial , also controls airports at Glasgow , Southampton and Aberdeen .
" It has been over 20 years since the Airports Act 1986 put in place the current regime of economic regulation and as such it is one of the oldest economic regulatory systems in the country , " Ms Kelly said .
" Much has changed since then , and there is an urgent need to consider how the framework needs to be updated to reflect today 's realities . "
The transport secretary said that the government 's review would recognise the points made by the Competition Commission , the aviation industry and key stakeholders about the potential shortcomings of the current regulatory system .
The regulator said that the regulatory system may adversely affect competition between airports .
Slow response ?
BAA has come under increasing pressure from politicians and airlines and is fighting off attempts to break up its control of UK airports .
In its report , the Competition Commission stressed that it had not yet reached any conclusions over the fate of BAA .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Maybe a spot of competition would reduce the disgraceful costs charged by BAA Roger , UK However , it added that it would set out its remedies to any competition problems in August , " whether requiring the sale of one or more of BAA 's airports or otherwise " .
" We are particularly concerned by its ( BAA's ) apparent lack of responsiveness to the differing needs of its airline customers , and hence passengers , " said Christopher Clarke , chairman of the BAA airports inquiry .
Mr Clarke was also worried that having so many airports owned by BAA meant that big development projects were being carried out one at a time .
BAA responds BAA welcomed the Competition Commission 's report .
But its chief executive Colin Matthews , who took over on 1 April , disputed the suggestion that the sale of some of BAA 's airports would improve capacity .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The case that they need to make is that some different ownership structure is going to deliver that new capacity and new investment more effectively , " he told the BBC .
" I 'm not convinced that 's the case , " he added .
Mr Matthews yesterday restructured his management team to concentrate more on the operational performance of Heathrow .
" We can improve Heathrow operations and we must improve Heathrow operations , and that 's exactly why I 've restructured the business to focus on exactly that issue being our top priority , " he said .
Airport capacity
The Competition Commission said that the point of giving BAA ownership of Heathrow , Gatwick and Stansted after privatisation in 1987 was to make sure there would be adequate airport capacity in the south - east of England , but that there was still a shortage of capacity .
It seems the Competition Commission has seen the light

The regulator conceded that competition in the south - east of England was unlikely in the short term because of the lack of capacity , but suggested that having airports separately owned could help to encourage growth in capacity .
It also said that there was potential for competition between Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Southampton .
In Scotland , the report said there was potential for competition between Edinburgh and Glasgow airports , although the ownership of Aberdeen airport was less of an issue .
Problem or solution ?
" The case for breaking up BAA gets stronger by the day , " said Shadow Transport Secretary Theresa Villiers .
" BAA 's monopolistic grip on so many of the UK 's major airports has not been serving passengers or airlines well - as can be seen from the debacle at Terminal 5 and the yearly Heathrow hassle during the summer months , " she added .
Liberal Democrat transport spokesman Norman Baker said : " BAA is part of the problem not part of solution .
" It has become complacent and concentrated on lobbying the government rather than serving the needs of passengers .
BAA should be required to sell some of its airports . "

The Department of Homeland Security , continuing to enforce what it calls a “ strict policy of arresting , prosecuting and jailing ” illegal immigrants , deported a record number of those caught on the nation ’s borders last year — more than 280,000 in fiscal year 2007 compared with 186,000 a year earlier .
It was the largest number of illegals ever removed from the country in a single year .
The increase is attributable to what veteran law - enforcement authorities said is a revised apprehension process , adding that the department no longer is targeting only criminal illegals for removal , but seeks eventually to apprehend , charge and deport all those who cross illegally into the United States .
To that end , Homeland Security has initiated “ Operation Streamline ” along some sectors of the U.S. - Mexico border , which brings illegal immigrants into the U.S. criminal justice system , where they are prosecuted either for a misdemeanor on their first offense or a felony if they have been caught before .
“ Under this program , individuals who are caught at certain designated high - traffic , high - risk zones are prosecuted and , if convicted , are jailed , ” Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said at a recent press briefing .
Mr. Chertoff noted that between October and December , the Justice Department prosecuted 1,200 cases under the new program and , as a consequence , apprehension rates dropped nearly 70 percent in those areas .
“ When people who cross the border illegally are brought to face the reality that they are committing a crime , even if it is just a misdemeanor , that has a huge impact on their willingness to try again and on the willingness of others to break the law coming across the border , ” he said .
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) spokeswoman Ernestine Fobbs said the agency ’s Office of Detention and Removal Operations deported to 195 countries a total of 280,523 illegal immigrants during fiscal 2007 — which ended Sept. 30 .
Through Feb. 18 of fiscal 2008 , she said , the agency has removed 94,237 illegal immigrants .
But Operation Streamline is active only in particular areas along the Arizona and Texas borders , enforced by agents from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection who seek to end the so - called “ catch - and - release ” of illegal immigrants along popular smuggling corridors .
Under the program , illegals caught entering the country are fingerprinted , prosecuted and can spend up to 180 days in jail .
Prior to the program , illegal immigrants from Mexico who did not have a criminal history were returned to their home country almost immediately , without jail time or a formal deportation order .
Apprehended illegal immigrants identified as “ other than Mexican , ” or OTMs , were given notices to appear at a future deportation hearing .
The notices were referred to by the U.S. Border Patrol as “ notices to disappear , ” since only about 13 percent ever showed up .
On average , about half of those caught at the Southwest border are Mexican nationals .
Currently , they face formal deportation procedures only in those limited areas covered by Operation Streamline or if they have been identified as convicted criminals .
Ms. Fobbs said that during fiscal 2007 , a total of 136,712 Mexican nationals were returned home — 67,793 of whom were identified as criminal illegals .
Despite the praise it has received from members of Congress , Operation Streamline is not without its drawbacks and its future expansion is in doubt without a significant increase in federal funding .
The U.S. Marshals Service , which is responsible for returning illegal immigrants to their countries of origin , is strapped for both resources and manpower to conduct the program .
The Justice Department , asked to prosecute the newly charged illegals , lacks the manpower to get the job done .
Congress appropriated $ 22 million to hire additional prosecutors , support staff and deputy U.S. marshals , and the administration is seeking $ 100 million for the Southwest Border Enforcement Initiative — to hire additional people to support the increased prosecutions .
Law - enforcement officials , however , also point to a lack of detention space as a critical concern , noting that border detention facilities already are overburdened by rising drug , sex and violent - crime cases .
An internal report by the Marshals Service in January said “ the sheer number of prisoners ” along the border “ makes finding sufficient detention space on a daily basis particularly challenging . ”
But the mission to apprehend convicted felons among those illegally in the U.S. remains a department priority .
The agency now identifies and screens criminal illegals incarcerated in federal , state and local jails nationwide to ensure they are processed for removal at the completion of their terms .
In fiscal 2007 , ICE initiated formal removal proceedings on 164,000 illegal immigrants serving prison terms for crimes they committed in the U.S. , and has begun more than 55,000 formal removal proceedings against additional criminal illegals in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 .

Six US cities tamper with traffic cameras for profit
Six U.S. cities have been found guilty of shortening the amber cycles below what is allowed by law on intersections equipped with cameras meant to catch red - light runners .
The local governments in question have ignored the safety benefit of increasing the yellow light time and decided to install red - light cameras , shorten the yellow light duration , and collect the profits instead .
Kartenspiele sind seit langem auf der ganzen
Welt beliebt .
Eines der am häufigsten verwendeten heutzutage ist Baccarat - ein Spiel , das in Online - Casinos häufig am beliebtesten ist .
Diese Unterhaltung tauchte im Kreis der Aristokraten auf , und bis jetzt steckt Baccarat in vielen Geheimnissen , und Spieler auf der ganzen
Welt versuchen , seine Technologie zu verstehen und die perfekte Spielstrategie zu finden .
Um ein Profi zu werden und sich nicht nur die Freude am Spiel , sondern auch den regelmäßigen Gewinn zu sichern , müssen Sie die Grundtechniken des Baccarats genauer studieren und eine Strategie sorgfältig ausdenken .
Karten zählen im Baccarat : Realität oder Mythos ?
Laut vielen erfahrenen Spielern hat Baccarat viel mit einem anderen beliebten Glücksspiel zu tun - Blackjack .
Eine der wichtigsten Gemeinsamkeiten ist die Fähigkeit , die Karten zu zählen , die auf dem Deal erscheinen .
Aber wenn beim Blackjack eine solche Technologie wirklich funktioniert , dann ist sie für Baccarat völlig nutzlos .
Dies liegt daran , dass der Vorteilskoeffizient der Institution größer ist als der des Spielers , aber dieser Unterschied ist sehr gering .
Gemäß der Baccarat - Strategie ist es einfach nicht möglich , durch Kartenzählen einen Gewinn für sich zu erzielen , aber Blackjack hat immer noch eine solche Chance .
Sie sollten jedoch nicht vollständig von Karten ablenken , die das Spiel bereits verlassen haben .
Es gibt auch einige Nuancen , und den Vieren und Sechsern sollte besondere Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt werden .
Für den Fall , dass fast alle Vierer bereits an den Händen gespielt haben , hat der Dealer mehr Gewinnchancen , und wenn keine Sechser im Deck sind , hat der Spieler einen Vorteil .
Wenn diese Regel nicht missachtet wird , können Sie eine echte Gelegenheit erhalten , den Vorteil der Partei für Ihre Seite zu gewinnen .
Martingale - Strategie in Baccarat
Obwohl das Martingale - System eines der universellsten und beliebtesten der Welt ist , raten Profis davon ab , es in Baccarat zu verwenden .
Das Wesentliche eines solchen Systems ist , dass Sie , nachdem Sie einmal im Casino verloren haben , unmittelbar danach den Einsatz um mindestens das Zweifache erhöhen und ihn ständig wiederholen müssen .
Wenn
Sie beispielsweise 1 Dollar verloren haben , sollten Sie mindestens 2 setzen .
Dies sollte so lange geschehen , bis ein Gewinn erzielt wurde .
Danach sollten
Sie wieder zum ursprünglichen Satz von 1 Dollar zurückkehren .
Diese Taktik ist besonders dann nutzlos , wenn der Spieler nicht viel Geld hat .
Und aufgrund der Tatsache , dass alle Baccarat - Strategien die Verwendung von Finanzen bis zu einem bestimmten Limit empfehlen , wäre es richtiger , sich auf das Spiel und nicht auf die Höhe der Einsätze zu konzentrieren .
Prinzipien und Merkmale von Baccarat
Trotz der jahrelangen Bemühungen vieler Spieler gibt es keine universelle Taktik , um den Sieg im Baccarat zu garantieren .
Ihre Popularität nimmt dadurch jedoch nicht ab .
Im Gegenteil , eine zunehmende Anzahl von Spielern liebt das Spielen und versucht , einen Weg zu finden , um den , wenn auch minimalen , Casino - Vorteil auf ihre Seite zu ziehen .
Welcher Baccarat - Einsatz ist besser ?
Dieses Glücksspiel bietet zwei Arten von Wetten :
Auf den Bankier ( “ Banco ” ) Auf den Spieler ( “ Punto ” )
Wenn Sie Geld auf einen Banker setzen , beträgt die Gewinnquote des Dealers 1,05 % und bei Wetten auf einen Spieler 1,25 % .
We took a lot of flack over a post back in January that questioned the security of Apple ’s Mac OS X. TechConsumers left various comments ranging from “ For some reason unknown to me , no one can ever show me a situation where a user opens a e-mail and their Mac turns into a robot sending out hundreds of e-mails ” to “ Mac OS X * is* inherently safer .
You have to be a major league Windows zombie not to know and accept that . ”
Well , CanSecWest ‘s PWN 2 OWN contest has just shown that Mac OS X is n’t “ inherently safer ” and that clearly it is possible for a user to open an e-mail on a Mac and have it join a spam botnet .
For those not familiar with CanSecWest or their PWN 2 OWN contest , here is the scoop .
CanSecWest is “ the world ’s most advanced conference focusing on applied digital security . ”
And for the last few years , they have been running a contest during the conference to see which operating system is the most vulnerable : Windows Vista , Mac OS X , or Ubuntu Linux .
If you can hack ( run arbitrary code ) the laptop running the OS , you get to keep the laptop and a $ 10,000 cash prize .
It is important to note that the “ hacker ” does not get physical access to the machine , and the laptops are in their default configuration .
If you want more details please check out this link .
For the second year in a row the Mac was the first to fall , and Charlie Miller is now the proud owner of a MacBook Air with Mac OS X 10.5.2 .
Charlie is best known for being the researcher who first hacked Apple ’s iPhone .
It may be rude to say , but it is kind of vindicating for us that clearly we were n’t out on a limb when it came to Mac security .
Within two minutes of the start , he directed the contest organizers to a certain website that executed his exploit .
Although the winner cannot publicly disclose details of the vulnerability , it is safe to assume the problem is in Safari .
This comes after Paypal started recommending to their users that they ditch Safari due to security issues .
And for the icing on the cake , Apple has started to use some under - handed methods to trick fool scam swindle con hustle sucker encourage iTunes / Quicktime users to install their underdog browser .
Issei Sagawa : Japan ’s Celebrity Cannibal
It ’s hard to make a living if you ’re a cannibal , and that ’s the only skill you have .
Hannibal Lecter at least had a day job to tide him over between meals , but Issei Sagawa is finding out that notoriety alone wo n’t put food on the table .
Issei Sagawa became famous for killing and feasting on a fellow student , Renee Hartevelt , in Paris in 1981 .
Issei chopped off many different body parts and ate them while listening to a recording he had made of Renee reciting poetry .
He later stuffed the remains of her body into a suitcase and left it in a park .
“ I touch the cold body again and I wonder where I should start .
I start to cut off all the meat before amputating the limbs .
While I cut her calf I suddenly want to taste it .
I see the beautiful red meat beneath the fat .
I grasp her knee and her ankle , and tear it with my teeth .
It is tender .
I slowly chew and savor it . ”
Declared as mentally unfit to stand trial , he spent a year in a mental hospital before being deported back to Japan in 1985 .
He was quickly assessed as sane and placed in prison .
His father , an influential industrialist , was able to get him released as a free man in 1986 .
Apparently his family abandoned him , since he has tried to make a living on his own writing books , appearing in movies , and painting pictures .
He was once hired to write restaurant reviews but that job was short lived .
There ’s information on what he compared sushi to in an interview and a book he wrote called “ In The Fog ” .
“ It had no smell or taste , and melted in my mouth like raw tuna , ”
To Issei , Gray ’s Anatomy is just an introduction to a bizarre cookbook .
Now that his celebrity career is waning , Issei says he finds it difficult to scrape together the funds to buy a Big Mac , and he ’s apparently too old to go back to school for a free lunch .
Perhaps he should consider a new careerâ€ ¦eliminating the homeless where he lives .
Check out the recent Vice interview with Issei Sagawa .

Senator John McCain sells himself for the presidency as a champion of campaign finance reform , a sworn enemy of Congressional handouts and a maverick who is immune to the corrupting influence of big money .
In two campaigns , he has vowed not to dispense favors to contributors .
Humans being humans , and senators being senators , it defied belief that Mr. McCain would not at some point have done a little something for a special friend back home .
As it turns out , he has .
David Kirkpatrick and Jim Rutenberg reported in The Times on Tuesday that Mr. McCain has used his influence and official position several times to benefit the real estate empire of Donald R. Diamond , a wealthy , 80 - year - old real estate developer .
For his part , Mr. Diamond has successfully shaken the money tree for various McCain campaigns and already has raised $ 250,000 for this year ’s presidential effort .
There is nothing illegal about this , but it is more evidence that Mr. McCain is as mortal  or compromising  as the next politician .
Mr. McCain has accepted corporate contributions for pet projects and relied heavily on lobbyists to help run his campaigns and Senate office .
And when land swaps like the ones he arranged for Mr. Diamond involve a subsidy from taxpayers , which they often do , they are no different from the pork - barrel projects that Mr. McCain decries daily on the stump .
Pork is central to Mr. McCain ’s economic program .
He says he would help pay for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts by getting rid of it .

Nanotech in food poses ' unknown risks '
News analysis
The food industry 's increasing use of nanotechnology in ingredients , additives and packaging has prompted two new reports calling for better consumer protection .
The reports , one a review led by UK government scientists and the other by an international lobby group , add to growing calls for better safety assessment and regulation of nanotechnology in food .
Complicating the issue is debate about which sized particles can cross into the body 's cells and whether the commonly used definition of nanotechnology is adequate .
Scientists writing in the latest issue of the journal Food Additives and Contaminants say the food industry , including Australia's , is already using some nanotechnology and safety research is needed urgently .
Dr Qasim Chaudhry , of the UK government 's Central Science Laboratory in York , and colleagues say engineered nanosized particles and other structures are being used to develop new tastes , textures , nutritional qualities , as well as improve shelf life and traceability of food products .
But they say there is n't enough information to adequately assess the risk of these additives and ingredients .
The researchers say it would be prudent to consider action in the face of this uncertainty , especially where food and drinks containing nano - ingredients are likely to be consumed in large quantities by a large proportion of the population .
They say there is a growing body of scientific evidence that indicates nanoparticles can cross into the body 's cells and cause damage .
Questions have been raised over whether nanoparticles and even larger micro-scale particles in the diet can inflame the gut , say the researchers , and testing is required to check if nano - food ingredients or additives affect nutrition .
They say current regulations do n't fully cover nanotechnology in food and the European food science professional body , the Institute of Food Science and Technology , recently recommended that nanoparticles be treated as new , potentially harmful materials , until testing proves them safe .
The same recommendation about nanoparticles in general was made by the UK Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering in 2004 .
Regulators ' asleep at the wheel '
Georgia Miller of the Friends of the Earth Nanotechnology Project is co-author of a report released today that documents the international use of unlabelled nanomaterials in food .
The Out of the laboratory and on to our plates report calls for engineered nanomaterials to be kept out of the food supply until further testing and public consultation .
Miller says Australia 's food regulator , Food Standards Australia New Zealand ( FSANZ ) , is " asleep at the wheel " when it comes to nanotechnology .
She says Australian manufacturers are not required to declare when food ingredients are nanoscale and the nation 's food regulator does n't know which nanomaterials are in foods .
" We really do n't think the burden of risk should be borne by the community , " she says .
How big is nano ?
Complicating the issue of regulation and safety is debate about the size of particles that can cross into body cells .
While the nanoscale usually refers to structures under 100 nanometres , Friends of the Earth points to evidence that 300 nanometres can present novel risks and should be checked for safety .
Dr Martin Garnett of the UK's University of Nottingham says in a 2006 paper in the journal Occupational Medicine that particles up to 300 nanometres can get into cells .
Garnett , who studies how nanoparticles are distributed in the body , says coatings such as surfactants used to stop nanoparticles from aggregating can make it easier for nanoparticles to get into tissues .
He also says other experiments show particles larger than 100 nanometres accumulate in a range of different tissues including the brain .
' Do n't panic '
An expert in international nanotechnology regulation , Professor Graeme Hodge , of Monash University in Melbourne , warns against a " gut reaction " to nanotechnology without considering the evidence .
" Do n't panic up front , " he says , adding that the use of nanotechnology in some areas will be " quite benign " .
But he says its use in food , cosmetics and medicines will require " serious and evolved debate " and careful consideration of risks .
He says the Australian government has been proactive in commissioning a report to identify possible gaps in Australian regulations , which he helped prepare .
But he says it 's too early to say if new regulations are really required , especially since international standard - setting bodies are only now officially defining the characteristics of nanomaterials .
Government response
Australia 's food regulator FSANZ declined to comment on nanotechnology in food , directing queries to the federal health department .
" No policy has been developed in regards to a specific regulatory response to nanotechnology , " reads a health department statement for FSANZ .
" FSANZ is not aware , nor has it been made aware , of any commercially sold foods in Australia that have been developed using nanotechnology . "
The statement says FSANZ is gathering information and discussing the food safety implications of nanotechnology with international bodies and is yet to determine if a risk assessment is required for nanotechnology in foods .

Speaker Nancy Pelosi and several House Democrats sent a letter to the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission , William E. Kovacic asking him to investigate the current record high gas prices .
“ In light of nationwide consumer concern about the record prices for oil and gas at the pump , we urge the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) to immediately initiate a rulemaking to implement the market manipulation authority mandated by Congress in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-140 ) .
Congress provided this authority to the FTC four months ago — but to date , the FTC has failed to exercise its power to protect consumers from skyrocketing energy costs , ” the Democrats wrote .
Pelosi outlined the FTC ’s powers , “ The Energy Independence and Security Act , which became law last December , directs the FTC to ensure that the U.S. petroleum market is free from price or supply manipulation .
Congress gave you the power to levy tough penalties against those who might seek to profit from such illegal activities .
Utilized effectively , this new authority will substantially strengthen consumer protections against high energy prices .
More importantly , vigorous enforcement will help lower and stabilize prices , increase market transparency , and provide Americans with confidence that retail gasoline and diesel prices are free from the influence of anticompetitive practices and the exercise of market power . ”

The letter concluded with the Democrats urging the FTC to act , “ We need aggressive oversight to ensure such actions are not presently occurring , and to punish them if they are cheating consumers .
The FTC must no longer delay action on implementing the mandate from Congress to stop market manipulation as American families and businesses struggle to deal with record gas prices . ”
I think that prices in general are going to be a big issue in this year ’s election , but the ever rising price of gasoline does make people wonder what it going on here ?
The energy industry seems to have run amok based on speculation alone .
Any little jitter around the globe is currently viewed as a reason to raise prices .
I do n’t believe that an FTC investigation will immediately help consumers , but anytime an investigation is discussed , prices come down .
I think this , and some election year politics , are what the House Democrats are trying to accomplish .

One of the arguments the Clinton campaign is making to the supers , hoping they 'll overturn the will of the voters , is that Obama can't win certain demographics .
Yet looking at the exit poll numbers , it 's clear that Obama has actually been making serious gains the past six weeks .
Obama 's percent of the vote :
OH PA 60 and older 28 38
White 34 38
White men 39 44
White women 31 34
Less than $ 50 K 42 46
No college 40 38
College 51 49
Catholic 36 31
Protestant 36 53
What was a 10.5 % win in demographically friendly Ohio has become an 8.6 % 9.4 % win in similar Pennsylvania , except the state was even less black and with a much smaller youth voter population ( Pennsylvania 's seniors accounted for 32 percent of the electorate , compared to 23 percent in Ohio ) .
And , those gains were made despite the Wright controversy as well as manufactured bullshit about " bitter " and flag pins and whatnot .
On top of that , Obama has had to run against Hillary Clinton , against former President of the United States Bill Clinton , and against John McCain and the entire GOP apparatus , which has trained its guns on Obama hoping to give Clinton a boost .
Yet he continues to gain among most of Clinton 's best demographics , is still raising more money , leads comfortably in delegates , leads comfortably in the popular vote , leads in states won , leads in the national polls , and does better in the head - to - head matchups against McCain .
So why should the supers spark an intra-party civil war by overturning the will of the electorate again ?

That is the best advertisement for not passing on the right I have ever seen .
" War on Drugs is NOT working " ­ Great Solutions go Begging After the first seven interviews with my brother Police Officer and Detective Howard Wooldridge of Lansing , Michigan ( retired ) concerning the " War on Drugs , " hundreds of readers responded .
U.S. taxpayers do not understand the ongoing incredible deception perpetrated on them by the Drug War .
You might even term it a " racket " ­ perpetrated by those who stand in the power corridors of Washington , DC .
Sen .
Joe Biden ­ Chairman , Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs Senator Biden remains a leading voice on crime and drug policy issues .
Officer Wooldridge talked with Senator Biden ( D - DE ) last month .
Senator Biden said at a hearing in February 2008 that drug prohibition touches 60 percent of all crime in America .
Wooldridge advised to dramatically reduce crime , death , disease and drug use ­ the U.S. must end the prohibition approach on the 10 most used drugs .
The old paradigm has not been successful , or cost - effective .
" My experience agrees with the senator 's statement , " Officer Wooldridge said .
" As a police officer , my goal was to keep my community safe , once they left their homes .
What are the steps to ending this 94 year failed policy of prohibition ?
Marijuana ( cannabis ) role in the history of a nation " Many experts agree that the first drug to become legal and regulated will be marijuana .
As DEA law judge Francis Young concluded , after an exhaustive study of cannabis : " Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man . "
Its use has rarely been a public safety issue , if at all .
One can not overdose on it .
Moreover , its legalization would be a tremendous boost to improve public safety .
Why ?
Road officers spend million of hours searching cars for a baggie of pot .
They could instead concentrate on the deadly DUI and reckless drivers .
They would be re-directed to find and arrest the child predators on line looking for a 13 year old girl .
Federal agents could completely focus on Al Qaeda and stop wasting time on medical marijuana gardens in California . "
National marijuana prohibition began in 1937 .
Since then , local and state police officers spent tens of millions of hours searching for and arresting users and sellers .
Did this expenditure improve public safety ?
No !
Has prohibition caused an increase or decrease in use ?
Can we name any positive returns on the investment of money , prison space and police time ?
These constitute important questions to ask in the century of 9/11 and a recession .
" Starting my police career in the '70s , I quickly learned that alcohol use caused the vast majority of calls for service , " Officer Wooldridge said .
" More teens died from alcohol use than all the illegal drugs combined .
DUIs causing injury and death , drunks shooting each other , assaults , spouse and child abuse cases , etc. , constituted the majority of my police work after sunset .
During my 18 years as a police officer , the use of marijuana never once caused me to be dispatched to handle a problem .
On the other hand , alcohol use generated about 1200 police calls . "
Alcohol , tobacco and marijuana ­ regulate and tax equally Marijuana remains an intoxicating and potentially psychologically addictive drug .
Millions use it to cop a buzz .
Because it can be destructive , Officer Wooldridge supports it being regulated , controlled and taxed by the government .
Currently , criminals control all aspects of production , distribution and use ­ not good !
We must maintain the same restrictions and regulations as the two deadliest drugs in America : alcohol and tobacco .
" In a legal environment , marijuana would lose its glamour and rebellion elements , " Officer Wooldridge said .
" According to doctors certified in addiction psychology , just as many teens try marijuana because it is illegal as are deterred by its illegality .
The Dutch demonstrated the validity of this expert opinion .
Thirty - two years after they legalized and regulated sales to adults , their age 15 - 29 citizens smoke half as much grass as American youth .
Even better , Dutch youth no longer come in contact with pot dealers who also offer heroin for sale .
Thus , far fewer Dutch teens try heroin for the first time ; a win-win situation . "
Will underage youth obtain legalized and regulated marijuana ?
Yes , the same as they now obtain alcohol and tobacco before they reach the legal age !
No one expects perfection .
Dramatic improvement in public safety after marijuana is legalized Public safety will be dramatically improved as law enforcement again concentrates on crimes involving victims .
Detectives will spend more time arresting child predators on - line , and rapists .
Road officers will promptly answer your 911 calls , instead of spending an hour on a marijuana possession case .
The courts will run smoother without the thousands of possession and sale cases clogging the docket .
Prison space will not be wasted on someone selling pot to an adult .
Many public benefits are likely .
" Marijuana users would like the government to tax them ! "
Officer Wooldridge said .
" Dr. Miron of Harvard University studied the topic .
Taxing pot , like whiskey , would generate some $ 6.4 billion : not chump change !
Better , governments waste $ 10 billion chasing Willie Nelson and his friends and putting them in jail .
As the U S slides into a recession or worse , that money will become even more important . "
But what about the ' Gateway theory ? '
Do n't all heroin and meth users start with marijuana ?
Actually no , they do n't .
Federal studies show tobacco as the first illegal drug teens use .
Alcohol comes second ­ with marijuana third !
The Institute of Medicine in 1999 conducted that study .
Less than two percent of marijuana users move on to an abusive relationship with hard drugs .
" After 37 years of ' Drug War ' and the arrest of 38 million Americans , the majority for marijuana possession , the USA must accept the reality that the state , through its police department , cannot fix personal stupidity and personal self - destructive behavior , " Officer Wooldridge said .
" Only family , friends , spiritual advisors and expert therapists can help in such a situation . "

The mission of LEAP is to reduce the multitude of unintended harmful consequences resulting from fighting the war on drugs and to lessen the incidence of death , disease , crime , and addiction by ultimately ending drug prohibition .
" Envision a country which employs the principles of personal responsibility , personal freedom and limited / effective government toward marijuana , " Officer Wooldridge said .
" I see a growing respect for the police , as they stop intruding into the decisions of adults , made in the privacy of their castles .
Teens find it as hard to buy pot as beer .
Fewer teens use it because it lost its glamour .
Imagine a land where the deadly DUI and reckless drivers kill far fewer , as officers focus on them , not the next pot bust .
Envision detectives arresting more child predators as they abandon the time spent arresting someone selling pot to an adult .
All this becomes possible , when America becomes wiser and abandons the prohibition approach to marijuana . "

Witness to Discrimination : What Would You Do? Hidden cameras catch bystander reactions to Muslim discrimination .
Feb. 26 , 2008  --
The Sept. 11 attacks , the Iraq war and suicide bombings worldwide have changed not only the way we live but the way we look at those around us , especially Muslims .
" Islamophobia " has entered the American vernacular , and the anti-Muslim attitudes and prejudice it describes remain common .
But what if you witnessed " Islamophobia " in action and saw someone being victimized because of someone else 's prejudices ?
What would you do ?
ABC 's production crew outfitted The Czech Stop , a bustling roadside bakery north of Waco , Texas , with hidden cameras and two actors .
One played a female customer wearing a traditional Muslim head scarf , or hijab .
The other acted as a sales clerk who refused to serve her and spouted common anti-Muslim and anti-Arab slurs .
The polarity of reactions was shocking , from support to seething disapproval .
Never did we expect customers to be so passionate or candid .
CLICK HERE for more reactions caught on tape !
His Place , His Right
Our actor , Sabina , walked into the bakery in search of apple strudel .
When she reached the counter , an actor posing as a sales clerk was quick to greet her with hateful anti-Muslim language .
" Get back on the camel and go back to wherever you came from , " he said .
" You got that towel on your head .
I do n't know what 's underneath your dress .
Just please take your business and go elsewhere with it . "
" Sir , I am an American , I was born and raised here , " she said .
The other customers seemed to hear the exchange but they barely looked toward our actors .
When no one came to her defense , Sabina made a direct appeal to one customer .
" Sir , would you mind ordering me an apple strudel ?
That 's why I am here , " Sabina said .
Though visibly shaken by the hateful words , the man gave Sabina the cold shoulder , completed his purchase , and walked out of the bakery .
" I really think that a person who owns his own business should be able to say who they sell to , " he said after we told him about the experiment .
In fact , it is illegal for public establishments to deny service based on someone 's race , color , religion , sex , or national origin , according to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
Regardless , this man was not the only customer to defend our sales clerk 's " right " to discriminate .
A Narrowly Defined America
A little while later , Sabina again entered the bakery , and again our sales clerk refused to serve her .
This time , one man spoke up , but not on behalf of the Muslim woman .
He was adamant that our sales clerk did the right thing .
" She was n't dressed right , " he said .
" If I was running the place I 'd do the same thing . "
Once again , our sales clerk garnered customer support .
After Sabina left the bakery seemingly frustrated and empty - handed , one man thanked the sales clerk for his discriminatory behavior .
He then gave our actor a thumbs - up , not once , but twice .
Jack Dovidio , a social psychologist at Yale University , said these men seemed to define " American " based on the way people look .
They connected with the sales clerk and considered our female actor an outsider .
" When we as Americans feel threatened from the outside , we 're going to define ourselves in very rigid fashions , " Dovidio said .
" Either you 're with me , and if you 're not really one of me , then you must be somebody else who 's against me . "
A Very Different America
The young woman in our experiment was an actor , but many of the hateful words she heard were based on the experiences of Chicago - born Nohayia Javed , who was watching our experiment from the control van .
Javed said she has continually suffered verbal abuse and said she has even been physically attacked by fellow Americans — just because she is Muslim .
" They always start off with , ' you 're a terrorist , Osama - lover , towel - head , camel jockey ' on and on , " Javed said .
" If I tell them I'm American , they 're like , ' No you 're not .
Just because you were born here does n't make you American . '
And I 'm like , ' What makes you American ? ' "
Javed is not alone .
The number of anti-Islamic hate crime incidents in the United States has more than quadrupled from 28 incidents in 2000 to 156 incidents in 2006 , according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's most recent figures .
Back in the bakery , the next customers had a very different answer to the question of American identity .
First we met a man who angrily refused to buy anything when the sales clerk refused to serve Sabina .
When our actor chastised him for being a " bad American , " he begged to differ .
" I believe I am a good American , " he said .
" My son just came back from serving in the army for over a year in Iraq and that has nothing to do with her [ Sabina 's ] rights .
I am deeply offended by this . "
When we told him about the experiment , he explained why he stood up for Sabina .
" I believe that people who use dress , skin color , language , heritage , financial means , education level , any of those things to say one group is better than another are using empty excuses for bigotry and hatred , and there 's been enough hatred , " he said .
We also met two young women who refused to let our sales clerk 's hateful words go unchecked .
" Sir , we are not buying our kolaches because you are really offensive and disgusting , " one said .
" Just because she 's dressed like that does n't mean anything , " said the other , a Muslim - American woman herself .
Rather than simply taking their business elsewhere , the young women demanded to speak to the manager , and they also challenged our sales clerk 's definition of " American . "
" She 's American .
She 's American .
I'm American .
You 're the one that 's anti-American right now , " one said to the sales clerk .
When he refused to budge and our actress turned to leave , the two women walked out with her in a show of support .
The Silent Majority
Even though people seemed to have strong opinions on either side , more than half of the bystanders did or said absolutely nothing .
This is a familiar reaction for many Muslims such as Javed .
" I was shocked because when these things happen to me in real life … I never see what happens after I walk out of that store , " she said .
" I would try to justify … that they probably did n't hear it … when I watched it , I realized , no , they hear it and they see it and they 're okay with it . "
For Javed , tears of fear were mixed with tears of thanks for those she saw come forward to support Sabina .
" In my lifetime , I 've never ever had anybody stand up for me , " Javed said .
" It 's very touching to see that because that 's the right thing to do , I believe … as an American . "

Primary school children should be eligible for the DNA database if they exhibit behaviour indicating they may become criminals in later life , according to Britain 's most senior police forensics expert .
Gary Pugh , director of forensic sciences at Scotland Yard and the new DNA spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) , said a debate was needed on how far Britain should go in identifying potential offenders , given that some experts believe it is possible to identify future offending traits in children as young as five .
' If we have a primary means of identifying people before they offend , then in the long - term the benefits of targeting younger people are extremely large , ' said Pugh .
' You could argue the younger the better .
Criminologists say some people will grow out of crime ; others wo n't .
We have to find who are possibly going to be the biggest threat to society . '
Pugh admitted that the deeply controversial suggestion raised issues of parental consent , potential stigmatisation and the role of teachers in identifying future offenders , but said society needed an open , mature discussion on how best to tackle crime before it took place .
There are currently 4.5 million genetic samples on the UK database - the largest in Europe - but police believe more are required to reduce crime further .
' The number of unsolved crimes says we are not sampling enough of the right people , ' Pugh told The Observer .
However , he said the notion of universal sampling - everyone being forced to give their genetic samples to the database - is currently prohibited by cost and logistics .
Civil liberty groups condemned his comments last night by likening them to an excerpt from a ' science fiction novel ' .
One teaching union warned that it was a step towards a ' police state ' .
Pugh 's call for the government to consider options such as placing primary school children who have not been arrested on the database is supported by elements of criminological theory .
A well - established pattern of offending involves relatively trivial offences escalating to more serious crimes .
Senior Scotland Yard criminologists are understood to be confident that techniques are able to identify future offenders .
A recent report from the think - tank Institute for Public Policy Research ( IPPR ) called for children to be targeted between the ages of five and 12 with cognitive behavioural therapy , parenting programmes and intensive support .
Prevention should start young , it said , because prolific offenders typically began offending between the ages of 10 and 13 .
Julia Margo , author of the report , entitled ' Make me a Criminal ' , said : ' You can carry out a risk factor analysis where you look at the characteristics of an individual child aged five to seven and identify risk factors that make it more likely that they would become an offender . '
However , she said that placing young children on a database risked stigmatising them by identifying them in a ' negative ' way .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of the civil rights group Liberty , denounced any plan to target youngsters .
' Whichever bright spark at Acpo thought this one up should go back to the business of policing or the pastime of science fiction novels , ' she said .
' The British public is highly respectful of the police and open even to eccentric debate , but playing politics with our innocent kids is a step too far . '
Chris Davis , of the National Primary Headteachers ' Association , said most teachers and parents would find the suggestion an ' anathema ' and potentially very dangerous .
' It could be seen as a step towards a police state , ' he said .
' It is condemning them at a very young age to something they have not yet done .
They may have the potential to do something , but we all have the potential to do things .
To label children at that stage and put them on a register is going too far . '
Davis admitted that most teachers could identify children who ' had the potential to have a more challenging adult life ' , but said it was the job of teachers to support them .
Pugh , though , believes that measures to identify criminals early would save the economy huge sums - violent crime alone costs the UK £ 13bn a year - and significantly reduce the number of offences committed .
However , he said the British public needed to move away from regarding anyone on the DNA database as a criminal and accepted it was an emotional issue .
' Fingerprints , somehow , are far less contentious , ' he said .
' We have children giving their fingerprints when they are borrowing books from a library . '
Last week it emerged that the number of 10 to 18 - year - olds placed on the DNA database after being arrested will have reached around 1.5 million this time next year .
Since 2004 police have had the power to take DNA samples from anyone over the age of 10 who is arrested , regardless of whether they are later charged , convicted , or found to be innocent .
Concern over the issue of civil liberties will be further amplified by news yesterday that commuters using Oyster smart cards could have their movements around cities secretly monitored under new counter - terrorism powers being sought by the security services .

Investor beware ?
Learn all about a down market with our recession survival guide .
Have we finally fallen into a recession ?
Does it even matter for investors ?
With the major indexes down significantly since 2008 began , and with economic reports pointing to a slowdown in the U.S. economy , I asked Fool analysts to share their thoughts .
Here 's what they had to say .
1 . A recent Wall Street Journal headline says it all : " Most Economists in Survey Say Recession Is Here . "
Though we Fools do n't get into the big - picture prognostication business , what are the implications of a recession for the average investor saving for retirement or their kids ' education ?
James Early , co-advisor , Motley Fool Income Investor :
The bad news : Stocks decline up to a year before recessions hit .
The good news :
The above article notes that stocks actually rose an average of 3 % during recessions .
Unless you believe we 're in for a Japan - style slump , prepare to buy .
Andy Cross , co-advisor , Income Investor :
How 's the old saying go -- " economists have predicted 20 of the past two recessions " ?
The media seems obsessed with calling a recession .
I do n't know if we are , but when Warren Buffett says we 're in a recession from what he 's hearing from his 70 - some business managers , that 's a pretty good indication .
But look , recessions on average last less than a year ; they do n't come around too frequently ; and over time , stocks go up two out of three years .
So it 's important that investors do n't panic and sell their entire portfolios during slow economic times .
Rather , use price decreases to invest in the country 's , and even the world 's , best companies selling at cheap prices to their long - term value .
Jim Fink , Income Investor analyst :
The average recession lasts only about a year and is followed by an average economic expansion of four and a half years , so the long - term investor should not be concerned .
In fact , recessions create rare opportunities to buy stocks of high - quality , blue - chip companies at bargain - basement prices .
You read that right : Recessions and bear markets can actually increase your wealth over the long term if you keep buying stocks and reinvesting dividends during them .
2 . If we are in or are headed for a recession , describe the type of stock investors should be looking for .
Early :
Do n't be a chicken when it comes to investing internationally .
My very favorite way to diversify is to find solid , established companies in growing economies .
And traditional havens like energy and health care make sense -- Petrobras ( NYSE : PBR ) comes to mind .
Cross : James and I try to find best - of - breed companies with unique competitive advantages that can grow through good times and bad .
And of course , we look for companies that pay a nice dividend and are run by managers eager to increase it -- a company like Kraft ( NYSE : KFT ) , for example .
It 's the world 's second - largest food manufacturer , it owns some of the best - known brands -- Oscar Mayer and Oreo cookies , to name a couple -- and it's re-energizing its operations .
Or there are smaller companies , like Genuine Parts ( NYSE : GPC ) , an auto - parts wholesaler that has increased its dividend for 51 consecutive years .
Now that 's taking care of your shareholders .
Fink : Generally , large - cap dividend - paying stocks that cater to consumers ' basic needs outperform in recessions .
Specific industries that qualify include utilities ( local telephone , electric , natural gas ) , consumer staples ( food , beverages , tobacco , small - ticket household goods like soap , toothpaste , and bathroom tissue ) , health care ( retail drug stores and pharmaceuticals ) , and companies dependent on countercyclical government spending ( defense , public infrastructure ) .
Selected examples from those industries include Verizon Communications ( NYSE : VZ ) , Procter & Gamble ( NYSE : PG ) , and Walgreen ( NYSE : WAG ) .
And remember that just because there is a recession in the U.S. , that does n't mean that there are recessions overseas , so some international exposure through foreign stocks and U.S. multinationals always helps .
This is sort of a trick question , though , because the stock market has a mystical way of anticipating recessions six months in advance ( even those that do n't actually occur ! ) , so by the time a recession has actually started , at least half of the outperformance from these recession - resistant industry groups has already occurred .
For example , since the market stopped going up in mid-July , that suggests that the recession started around January .
If the recession lasts the typical year , then the market will start anticipating a recovery six months in .
If so , that suggests that the bear market will end in the May - June time frame , and the industries I mentioned will start to underperform .
Of course , my prognostication powers could be completely wrong .
( Or not . )
3 . On the flip side , what type of stock should investors be avoiding in a recessionary economy ?
Early : My Foolish colleague Prashant Rathore notes that tech was a lousy performer in the last go -' round , when companies such as Yahoo !
( Nasdaq : YHOO ) and Oracle ( Nasdaq : ORCL ) saw double - digit declines .
He expects similar results this time .
Although I think tech is cheaper today , I agree that discretionary tech spending will suffer .
Cross :
You 'll often hear television prognosticators recommend investing in this industry or that industry during rough economic times .
But remember what I said earlier about the length of the average recession -- it 's about the same as an NHL hockey season .
So do n't lose your long - term focus trying to time the market for the next nine or 12 months .
When investors sell off powerhouses with the rest of the market , pick up some shares at discounts .
Fink : Avoid non-dividend - paying stocks , as well as those that are at risk of cutting their dividends .
And with the highly publicized blow - up of Bear Stearns , I think every investor in America knows at least one industry that answers this question : financials .
Other sectors include homebuilders , consumer discretionary ( big - ticket items such as automobiles , vacation cruises , refrigerators , apparel , restaurants , and hotels ) , and industrial companies dependent on a strong economy for growth ( technology , commodity chemicals , machinery , air freight , aerospace , commercial construction / engineering ) .
As I mentioned earlier , these cyclical industries start to outperform midway through recessions , as the market begins to anticipate better economic times ahead .
4 . Historically , recessions do n't last all that long -- not that that makes today 's economic troubles any easier to stomach .
How would you advise investors to keep their heads , with so much uncertainty in the air ?
Early : A study by Fuller and Goldstein notes that dividend stocks outperform by up to 1.5 % per month in declining markets .
I know of many beaten - down stocks paying strong yields .
Why not get paid nicely to ride out the storm ?
Cross :
It 's not easy , for sure .
It seems that every day we look at our portfolios , they are lower than the day before .
To help calm your nerves , you want to own the best companies with solid financials that you can hold for a while .
And a nice dividend helps , too .
Fink :
Think long - term .
As Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel has written , common stocks outperform virtually every other asset class over periods of 30 years or longer .
Stay diversified , both by investing in many different industries that outperform at different stages of the economic cycle , and by investing in foreign stocks .
Owning a big slug of high - quality , dividend - paying stocks and some fixed - income assets ( bonds , for example ) will reduce volatility in your portfolio by generating cash even when stocks themselves are n't appreciating .
And lastly , remain focused on a stock 's valuation .
Buy stocks trading at a discount ( i.e. , margin of safety ) to that valuation and sell stocks trading significantly above that valuation -- keeping taxes in mind , of course .

Dave Heeley is among only four to complete the challenge
A blind man who set himself a worldwide challenge to run seven marathons in seven days has finished his final run .
Dave Heeley , known as Blind Dave , ran the London Marathon after spending a week running in Brazil , the Falklands , Los Angeles , Sydney , Dubai and Tunisia .
Mr Heeley , 50 , from West Bromwich , has been running with guide Malcolm Carr to raise money for Guide Dogs UK .
The pair are among only four people to complete the challenge .
The others are Sir Ranulph Fiennes and Dr Mike Stroud .
Mr Heeley and Mr Carr finished the London Marathon in five hours and 23 minutes .
' Fantastic adventure "
Mr Heeley was met at the finish line by his wife Debbie , 42 , and daughters Dannie , four , Georgie Lee , six , and Grace , 17 .
He said : " I 'm going to have a rest now . "
He added : " To think last week I was in the Falklands , it 's just too incredible for words .
Mr Heeley celebrated with his family after the London Marathon
" It 's going to take some quiet moments with the family for it to really hit home .
" I am the first blind person to do this .
It 's been a fantastic adventure and one I 'm going to talk about for a long time . "
He said he had chosen his charity so that " other blind people could have the freedom and independence I 've had " .
Mrs Heeley said : " I 'm looking forward to having him home for a while .
" I 'm going to tie him down for a bit . "
The main players in the ongoing row over the approval of Microsoft ’s Open XML ( OXML ) file format as an international standard ended the week further apart than ever .
Microsoft spent much of the week talking up its plans to bring a little bit of “ harmony ” to the divided file format community by again banging the tried , but not yet really tested , interoperability drum .
Microsoft Office manager Brian Jones was in Norway on Wednesday , which according to him was the final day that all resolutions were accepted , to discuss the next steps for OXML including creating interoperability / harmonisation with Open Document Format ( ODF ) .
As part of that standardisation process the format has been renamed to simply Open XML .
It 's lost the Office tag because the specification is no longer exclusively intended for Microsoft Office .
Meanwhile , a variety of voices have loudly bemoaned what they see as the unwelcome arrival of OXML on the global stage .
On Wednesday rage spilled out onto the usually quiet streets of Oslo where around 60 data experts , led by ex-chairman of the Norwegian Standards Institute ( NSI ) Steve Pepper , protested about the approval of the contentious file format .
Pepper stepped down from his role at the NSI last week following the group ’s U - turn on OXML .
It had voted , in September last year , to reject the specification as a standard .
During the protest Pepper , an advocate of ODF , which is used by IBM and Sun Microsystems among others , delivered a speech * outlining why he opposed OXML ’s approval with the International Standardisation Organisation ( ISO ) as a standard .
He said : “ ODF was developed ... through an open and democratic process .
But one important player was absent from that process .
The vendor who dominates this market , Microsoft , refused to participate , and they have refused to support ODF since it became a standard .
“ Instead they decided to create a competing standard called OOXML and to use Ecma as a back door into ISO . ”
Pepper said that he would continue to oppose the ISO ’s approval of Microsoft ’s file format because “ it is not in the interests of users like you and me to have two standards for the same purpose ” .
The NSI came under the spotlight last week when the anti-trust arm of the European Commission ( EC ) wrote a letter to the group 's technical committee asking for more details about alleged voting irregularities in the run-up to the ballot ’s crucial deadline on 29 March .
The EC , which is currently needling Microsoft over a range of anti-trust claims , has so far remained tight - lipped on the outcome of its inquiries .
Some politicians have also continued to express their opposition to Microsoft ’s dominant position in the software market .
This week an EU parliament member from Germany ’s Green Party filed a question ( pdf ) with the EC asking it to consider banning the firm from selling its products to European Union governments for up to five years .
Heidi Rühle argued that such a ban was justified following the record fine ( €1.35 bn ) handed down to Microsoft from the Commission in February this year .
The fine covers the period from the 2004 decision to 22 October , 2007 .
The decision found that Microsoft was charging competitors too much for interoperability information for its servers .
The EC has six weeks to respond to Rühle 's question .
In the meantime , Microsoft will continue to try and lure reluctant wallflowers onto the dance floor with OXML . ®

Italian police have issued video footage of a man who has been hypnotizing supermarket checkout staff and getting them to hand over the cash .
In every case , according to reports , the last thing staff remember is a man leaning over and saying ' Look into my eyes ' before suddenly finding the till is empty .
Scroll down for more ...
Look into my eyes :
The man - who bears an uncanny resemblance to Rasputin and Saddam Hussein - bends over as he speaks to the cashier
Then he walks away with a grin , tucking goods into his pocket
Matt Lucas 's hypnotist character on Little Britain is also fond of the phrase ' Look into my eyes '
In the latest incident captured on video footage the man walked into a bank in Ancona in northern Italy .
He waited until he got to a female bank clerk and , according to the video footage , appears to hypnotise her into handing over more than £ 600 .
He then calmly walked out .
The cashier who was shown the video footage reportedly has no memory of the incident .
She only realised what had happened when she saw the money missing .
Checks of CCTV cameras in the bank showed her being hypnotised by the man .
Italian police are now looking for the suspect - who bears an uncanny resemblance to Saddam Hussein - who they believe is either of Indian or North African .
The scientists have created the embryo in the lab
The Newcastle University team believe the technique could help to eradicate a whole class of hereditary diseases , including some forms of epilepsy .
The embryos have been created using DNA from a man and two women in lab tests .
It could ensure women with genetic defects do not pass the diseases on to their children .
It is human beings they are experimenting with

' Our aim is to help children '
The technique is intended to help women with diseases of the mitochondria - mini organelles that are found within individual cells .
They are sometimes described as " cellular power plants " because they generate most of the cell 's energy .
Faults in the mitochondrial DNA can cause around 50 known diseases , some of which lead to disability and death .
About one in every 6,500 people is affected by such conditions , which include fatal liver failure , stroke - like episodes , blindness , muscular dystrophy , diabetes and deafness .
At present , no treatment for mitochondrial diseases exists .
Genetic transplant
The Newcastle team have effectively given the embryos a mitochondria transplant .
We believe we could develop this technique and offer treatment in the forseeable future that will give families some hope of avoiding passing these diseases to their children
Professor Patrick Chinnery
University of Newcastle
They experimented on 10 severely abnormal embryos left over from traditional fertility treatment .
Within hours of their creation , the nucleus , containing DNA from the mother and father , was removed from the embryo , and implanted into a donor egg whose DNA had been largely removed .
The only genetic information remaining from the donor egg was the tiny bit that controls production of mitochondria - around 16,000 of the 3billion component parts that make up the human genome .
The embryos then began to develop normally , but were destroyed within six days .
Appearance
Experiments using mice have shown that the offspring with the new mitochondria carry no information that defines any human attributes .
So while any baby born through this method would have genetic elements from three people , the nuclear DNA that influences appearance and other characteristics would not come from the woman providing the donor egg .
However , the team only have permission to carry out the lab experiments and as yet this would not be allowed to be offered as a treatment .
Professor Patrick Chinnery , a member of the Newcastle team , said : " We believe that from this work , and work we have done on other animals that in principle we could develop this technique and offer treatment in the forseeable future that will give families some hope of avoiding passing these diseases to their children . "
Dr Marita Pohlschmidt , of the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign , which has funded the Newcastle research , was confident it would lead to a badly needed breakthrough in treatment .
" Mitochondrial myopathies are a group of complex and severe diseases , " she said .
" This can make it very difficult for clinicians to provide genetic counselling and give patients an accurate prognosis . "
However , the Newcastle work has attracted opposition .
Josephine Quintavalle , of the pro-life group Comment on Reproductive Ethics , said it was " risky , dangerous " and a step towards " designer babies " .
" It is human beings they are experimenting with , " she said .
" We should not be messing around with the building blocks of life . "
Mrs Quintavalle said embryo research in the US using DNA from one man and two women was discontinued because of the " huge abnormalities " in some cases .
Dr David King , of Human Genetics Alert , expressed concern about a " drift towards GM babies " .
Opinion
Out of control
FOR THE last six years , Vice President Dick Cheney has seized myriad opportunities to reassert the executive branch authority that he believes was unduly curtailed after the Watergate scandal .
Time after time , Cheney has directly or indirectly played a role in White House efforts to aggressively expand presidential powers and limit oversight by Congress , the press and the public .
He refused to reveal the participants in secret meetings he convened to come up with a national energy policy .
He and his legal advisers were driving forces behind the administration 's attempt to wiretap domestic calls without judicial review and to routinely add " signing statements " to legislation that claim a presidential prerogative to selectively ignore parts of the law -- most infamously , involving a prohibition on the use of torture against detainees .
The vice president 's office has insisted on " exclusive control " over the logs on who visits with Cheney at the White House compound or the vice presidential residence at the Naval Observatory .
In view of Cheney 's history of fierce resistance to the most basic elements of oversight , perhaps no one should be surprised that the vice president would try to block the National Archives ' routine attempt to collect data from his office on how much information he is classifying and declassifying .
But this Cheney stonewall is remarkable because it involves the fulfillment of a presidential order .
Even more bizarre is his rationale for why his office should be exempt .
Cheney essentially invokes a separation of powers argument because of his legislative branch duties .
Under the U.S. Constitution , Cheney does serve as president of the Senate , and can be called upon to break tie votes .
But the idea that he is " not an entity within the executive branch , " and thus exempt from a presidential order , is both ludicrous and chilling .
So much for Dick Cheney 's talk about the principle of restoring the powers of the presidency .
This latest flap is about the arrogance and contempt for accountability of one vice president : him .
U.S. export prices rose 1.5 percent during the month , also more than expected and the largest monthly gain on record , as prices for farm and food products continued to rise .
( Video : Analysis of March import prices )
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 2 percent rise in import prices in March after a 0.2 percent gain in February .
They also forecast a 0.5 percent rise in export prices after a previously reported 0.9 percent gain in February , which the Labor Department revised to 1.1 percent .
The larger - than - expected rise in import prices boosted the dollar in early trading after the report .
Stronger inflation could limit the Federal Reserve 's ability to cut interest rates during the current economic slowdown .
Import prices have risen 14.8 percent over the last 12 months , the largest year - to - year gain since the Labor Department began publishing the data .
A large factor was petroleum prices , which have risen 60 percent over the past year , although prices for food , feed and beverages have increased 14 percent .
Export prices have risen 7.9 percent over the last 12 months , the largest increase since the Labor Department began publishing the data .
Prices for agricultural exports and food , feed and beverage exports have both risen more than 33 percent over the past year .

It is absolutely hilarious .
As many of you know , my wife and I are going to have a new baby in less than one month .
A few nights ago , while washing some ‘ onesies ’ for out little girl , I noticed something about the laundry detergent cap .
On the back of the detergent bottle , there are ‘ recommended ’ amounts for various types of ‘ laundry loads ’ .
For a medium - sized load , the manufacturer suggested that I fill the cap to line “ 1 ” .
I looked on the outside of the cap and I could n’t find any numbers .
But , on the inside , there they were .
Very faintly , there were three lines – 1 , 2 , and 3 .
Here ’s a picture of the cap –
The ‘ red arrow ’ is pointing to ‘ line 1 ’ –
The recommended amount for a ‘ medium load ’ .
The ‘ black arrow ’ is pointing to ‘ line 2 ’ –
The recommended amount for a ‘ large load ’ .
The blue line ( with no arrow ) is pointing to ‘ line 3 ’ –
This line is not mentioned in the instructions .
Why ?
I have no idea .
But , I assure you , there is a ‘ line 3 ’ .
Now , for the interesting part .
The ‘ natural line ’ – marked in green – and the point to where I ’ve always filled the laundry cap in the past – is well above the ‘ recommended line ’ .
As you can see , the recommended amount for a medium load is equal to less than 1 /4 of a cup .
But , the line to which the eye is naturally ‘ drawn ’ – the green line – is almost 1 / 2 of a cup .
The bottle states that there are 16 loads per bottle – But , that ’s ONLY true if you use ‘ line 1 ’ – the line suggested for medium loads .
Use any line above ‘ line 1 ’ and you ’ll get less than 16 loads per bottle .
Use the ‘ green line ’ and you ’ll only get 8 !
I took a look at two other bottles of laundry detergent that we had in the house – and both of them showed remarkably similar characteristics .
So , when washing your clothes , and using store - bought detergents , be sure that you are using the ‘ recommended ’ amounts – and that you are using the right ‘ line ’ .
By the way – For any and all who read this – While this post is meant to point out a useful money - saving tip , I am fully aware that taking the time to photograph , highlight , and post a picture of a laundry cap ( and then write a blog post about it ) is a ‘ wee bit ’ insane .
But , then again , so is living in 2008 and not using a credit card . 🙂

Howard Dean : McCain poses as a reformer and ' needs to obey the law ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday February 26 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Sen. John McCain is battling the Federal Election Commission over his right to withdraw from public financing for his primary campaign , and the Democratic Party wants the matter investigated .
Democratic National Committee Chair Howard Dean told CNN on Tuesday that McCain is trying to skirt election laws , saying , " John McCain is posing as a reformer , and it turns out reforms , as far as he 's concerned , are good for everybody but him . "
McCain initially asked for federal matching funds when money for his campaign was tight .
Now that he is the front - runner , he wants to opt out again , because the use of matching funds would mean accepting strict spending limits .
That would significantly limit his ability to campaign between now and the Republican convention next September .
McCain 's lawyer said last week that the FEC can't stop McCain from withdrawing because he never actually received any cash .
However , the Democrats point out that McCain did receive certain other advantages for having opted in and say that should prevent him from withdrawing .
McCain has cited Dean 's own campaign in 2004 as a precedent for opting out , saying at a news conference last week , " Well , it was done before in another campaign .
...
We think it 's perfectly legal . "
Dean insisted to CNN that McCain 's situation is very different , because McCain " has benefited materially from getting public financing .
One , he used the possibility of public financing as [ collateral for ] a bank loan .
Two , he got on the ballot free of charge in a lot of states . "
" Thirdly , " Dean continued , " the thing that 's most disturbing about all this is , when you 're running for president of the United States , to defend yourself by saying 'he did it too ' is not a defense .
We want John McCain to obey the law .
Otherwise , you may as well call it the Feingold Act , not the McCain - Feingold Act . "
CNN's John Roberts pointed out that the McCain campaign is denying it used the matching funds as collateral for the loan .
Roberts quoted a letter from Fidelity Bank 's attorneys saying , " The bank does not now have , not did it ever receive from the committee , a security interest in any certification of matching funds . "
" That 's not the same thing as saying they did n't use it as collateral , " Dean replied .
" All you have to do is promise to get the public financing in order to use it as collateral .
That 's not the same thing as a security interest . "
" Niggling around the edges is exactly what John McCain does , " Dean concluded .
" He says one thing and does something else .
He 's done it on earmarks .
...
He poses as a politician who 's not like that , and in fact he is like that .
...
He needs to obey the law , particularly since he 's posed as a reformer for all these years . "
Because of a long - running and highly partisan battle in the Senate over one of Bush 's nominations , the FEC currently has four vacancies and only two active members , leaving little chance that the dispute will be resolved any time soon .
This video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast February 26 , 2008 .
As Chinese authorities have clamped down on unrest in Tibet and jailed dissidents in advance of the 2008 Olympics , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton has taken a strong public stance , calling for restraint in Tibet and urging President Bush to boycott the Olympics opening ceremonies in Beijing .
But her recent stern comments on China ’s internal crackdown collide with former President Bill Clinton ’s fundraising relationship with a Chinese Internet company accused of collaborating with the mainland government ’s censorship of the Web .
Last month , the firm , Alibaba Inc. , carried a government - issued “ most wanted ” posting on its Yahoo China homepage , urging viewers to provide information on Tibetan activists suspected of stirring recent riots .
Alibaba , which took over Yahoo ’s China operation in 2005 as part of a billion - dollar deal with the U.S. - based search engine , arranged for the former president to speak to a conference of Internet executives in Hangzhou in September 2005 .
Instead of taking his standard speaking fees , which have ranged from $ 100,000 to $ 400,000 , Clinton accepted an unspecified private donation from Alibaba to his international charity , the William J. Clinton Foundation .
The former president ’s charity has raised more than $ 500 million over the last decade and has been lauded for its roles in disaster response , AIDS prevention and Third World medical and poverty relief .
But his reliance on influential foreign donors and his foundation ’s refusal to release its list of donors have led to repeated questions about the sources and transparency of his fundraising -- even as Hillary Clinton has talked on the campaign trail about relying on him as a roving international ambassador if she is elected president .
Foreign contributions to American - based charities are allowed under U.S. law , but political and philanthropy ethics advocates worry that Bill Clinton ’s reliance on international businesses and foreign governments to finance his worldwide charity campaigns raise issues of potential conflicts of interest if he were to take an active role in his wife ’s administration .
“ This is a perfect example of why it ’s critical for both Clintons to provide prompt and complete disclosure of all their sources of income , not just personal sources but also his foundation , ” said Sheila Krumholz , executive director for the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics , a government reform advocacy group .
The Clinton foundation and the former president ’s library in Little Rock have received millions of dollars in donations from the Saudi royal family and the Middle East sheikdoms of the United Arab Emirates , Kuwait and Qatar , along with the governments of Taiwan and Brunei .
Fueled by such cash , the foundation has grown into a worldwide philanthropic dynamo , using its financial clout and influence with business leaders to streamline solutions for logistical logjams that have long plagued charity operations .
The foundation has pressed to lower the price of expensive AIDS medications and set up long - term projects across the Third World .
But like many charities , the Clinton foundation maintains a strict policy of keeping its donations confidential to protect the privacy of donors .
Still , partial lists have emerged in the foundation ’s tax filings and in press accounts , leading to growing scrutiny of the activities of some contributors .
Some human rights activists suggest that the Clinton foundation ’s contribution from Alibaba undermines his wife ’s outspoken stance on China ’s internal crackdown .
“ A former president of the United States received a donation from a Chinese firm that is involved in censorship , and now his wife is running for president .
This is a shame of the U.S. , ” said Harry Wu , an exiled Chinese activist based in Washington .
Wu was imprisoned by Chinese authorities in 1995 , then released shortly before then - First Lady Hillary Clinton spoke out during an official Beijing visit about the government ’s role in abuses against women and dissidents .
A candidate ’s position
In recent months , Hillary Clinton has repeatedly referred to her 1995 speech in Beijing as a foreign policy accomplishment that showed her crossing “ the commander - in - chief threshold . ”
Clinton upbraided China ’s government for infanticide and other human rights abuses in her address to the U.N. - sponsored Fourth World Conference on Women .
Just last week , Hillary Clinton pressed the Bush administration to boycott the opening of the Summer Olympics .
“ The violent clashes in Tibet and the failure of the Chinese government to use its full leverage with Sudan to stop the genocide in Darfur are opportunities for presidential leadership , ” she said .
“ These events underscore why I believe the Bush administration has been wrong to downplay human rights in its policy toward China . ”
When asked to comment on the impact of Bill Clinton ’s dealings with Alibaba , Hillary Clinton ’s campaign deferred to her husband ’s foundation .
A spokeswoman for the foundation stressed , “ President Clinton is not involved with Alibaba and is opposed to censorship and the repression of political dissent . ”
The spokeswoman added , “ Sen. Clinton ’s position on human rights , both in China and elsewhere around the world , is unwavering . ”
But her husband brushed aside a similar opportunity to address China ’s jailing of dissidents when he spoke at the conference hosted by Alibaba in 2005 .
Days before his appearance , two prominent rights groups , Human Rights in China and Reporters Without Borders , asked Clinton to raise Internet freedom issues during his speech and address the plight of Shi Tao , a Chinese writer arrested in 2004 after Yahoo ’s China operation provided state security authorities with private Internet data .
In his keynote address , Bill Clinton hailed the Internet as “ an inherently cooperative instrument and an inherently shared technology .
The Internet has the potential to put power through information and communication in the hands of ordinary people . ”
But he said nothing about China ’s Web censorship or Shi Tao ’s arrest .
Asked later why , he said he was unaware of Shi Tao ’s jailing .
“ Unfortunately , there was no discernible result or response ” from Clinton , said Carol Wang , a program officer with Human Rights in China .
The Clinton Foundation spokeswoman would not divulge the amount of Alibaba ’s donation but said the firm “ paid a portion of the travel expenses and contributed an amount beyond that to the foundation . ”
Alibaba Vice President Porter Erisman declined to comment on the donation and the firm ’s dealings with the former president .
Congressional scolding
Last year , Yahoo ’s senior executives were scolded by a congressional committee for the company ’s dealings with Chinese authorities .
In a legal settlement that followed a lawsuit by attorneys for Shi Tao and another jailed dissident , Yahoo also agreed to provide financial aid for their relatives and press for their release .
“ We ’ve met with the State Department and met with Chinese officials to ask for assistance in securing the release of some of these individuals , ” said Michael Samway , a Yahoo vice president and the firm ’s deputy general counsel .
“ We ’re hopeful that with the Olympics approaching there will be progress . ”
Human rights activists complain that Alibaba has not followed Yahoo ’s lead .
Jack Ma , a former official with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade who built Alibaba , has often dismissed concerns about his firm ’s scrutiny of the Internet for the Chinese government .
“ As a business , if you cannot change the law , follow the law , ” he said the morning after Clinton ’s 2005 speech .
“ Respect the local government . ”
Ma has insisted that Alibaba operates independently from the Chinese government .
But Ma ’s official background and China ’s tight oversight of its homegrown Internet and e-commerce firms are examples of the “ blurred line between government and corporation , ” said Jonathan Zittrain , an Internet regulation expert who teaches at Oxford and Harvard universities and is co-director of Harvard ’s Berkman Center for Internet & Society .
“ A Chinese government official does n’t have to order a local Internet operator to censor something , ” Zittrain said .
“ They might advise them that a certain article on their site does n’t look too kosher .
It ’s communicated in code . ”
The result , Zittrain said , is “ the great firewall of China . ”
Other firms besides Yahoo and Alibaba have been criticized for cooperating with China ’s Internet monitoring .
Google and Microsoft ’s MSN site have taken flak for decisions made by their China partners .
And Chinese search engines and e-commerce firms that dominate the mainland market have routinely aided state security prosecutions , said Morton H. Sklar , Shi Tao ’s American lawyer .
‘ Most wanted ’ posting
Human rights activists said clear evidence of Alibaba ’s collaboration with China ’s state security apparatus surfaced last month with the appearance of a “ most wanted ” posting for Tibetan rioters on the firm ’s Yahoo China homepage .
The postings , which appeared March 15 on both Yahoo China and Microsoft ’s MSN China homepage , carried photos of suspected rioters and a phone number for informants to call .
The postings vanished later the same day after news accounts highlighted them .
Yahoo officials said they had no advance warning from Alibaba that the postings would run .
“ We made our concerns known that the displays were inappropriate , ” one Yahoo official said , but were told by Alibaba officials “ that it was a standard news feed . ”
The Clinton foundation spokeswoman would not address Alibaba ’s role in aiding the crackdown in Tibet .
Instead , she emphasized the former president ’s efforts to push AIDS relief in China .
“ He has both pushed and helped the government of China to acknowledge and tackle the growing HIV - AIDs crisis facing their country , ” she said .
“ You have to applaud President Clinton for his philanthropic interests , ” said Daniel Borochoff , president of the American Institute of Philanthropy .
“ I would n’t want to discourage it .
But he certainly would n’t want to be used as a tool for special interests to have undue influence . ”

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - NATO forces sent jets to escort two Russian long - range air force bombers patrolling neutral skies near Alaska on Wednesday , Russian news agencies quoted the defense ministry as saying .
Russia ’s military has resumed its Cold War practice of flying regular patrols far beyond its borders , and in the last year has also sent turbo - prop Tu-95s over U.S. naval aircraft carriers and the Pacific island of Guam .
Accompanied by two Il - 78 refueling tankers , the two Tu -95 “ Bear ” bombers flew for 15 hours over the Arctic and Pacific oceans , Interfax news agency quoted Russian Air Force spokesman Alexander Drobyshevsky as saying .
“ In the course of the air patrol , long - range aviation aircraft were escorted by NATO jets in the region of Alaska , ” said Drobyshevsky .
Originally designed to drop nuclear bombs , the Tu-95 , Russia ’s equivalent of the U.S. air force ’s B - 52 , is a Cold War icon refitted for surveillance and maritime patrols .
Russia , in the eighth year of an economic boom driven by high global oil prices , has raised military funding after years of neglect following the collapse of the Soviet Union .
The Russian navy has finished construction of mothballed submarines and restarted large - scale naval exercises that shortages of fuel and spare parts had made a rarity .
Analysts say the Kremlin is using its reviving military might to support a policy of projecting Russia ’s power again on the world stage .
But some military observers say the Russian armed forces are still hampered by a shortage of combat - ready assets and that the exercises are primarily a public relations exercise .
A £ 500 m medical research laboratory in the heart of London could carry out work on the world 's most deadly diseases , Guardian Education has learned .
Backed by the prime minister , the lab , to be built yards from the St Pancras Eurostar terminal and the British Library , will replace the National Institute of Medical Research ( NIMR ) in Mill Hill , which includes one of the UK's 10 category 4 labs .
These have the highest security level and work on highly contagious and incurable diseases such as Ebola and Lassa fever .
The government also has around 350 category 3 labs where work on Sars and HIV takes place .
The potential threat of terrorism - as well as the ongoing investigation into the biosafety breaches at the Pirbright laboratory in Surrey , which caused last year 's outbreak of foot and mouth disease - mean a decision to build a category 4 lab in the King 's Cross area by 2013 could cause a political storm as London gears up to host the Olympics .
While most experts agree that security and safety at high - risk labs in the UK is very good , there is debate about whether they should be sited in major conurbations .
Siting a secure lab in a remote field makes any outbreak easier to contain , but could limit its usefulness to scientists and hospitals .
Tough standards
Most labs are subject to at least yearly safety inspections by their regulatory body and must meet tough security standards set out in the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 .
" People do n't need to be alarmed ; these labs can be run safely , " says Professor George Griffin , chairman of the Health and Safety Executive 's ( HSE ) advisory committee on dangerous pathogens .
Griffin , who is leading a study for the Health Protection Agency to chart the UK 's category 4 labs , said putting a high - security lab in any conurbation should be avoided , but added : " It should be viewed in the context of a risk assessment .
There may be compelling reasons for locating a laboratory at a particular site ; for example , a hospital may need facilities for diagnosing haemorrhagic fever .
" Any category 4 laboratory , wherever it is located , would undergo a very rigorous multi-factorial risk assessment .
It would ask what is the science being done , are there any risks to people and the environment , and what is the availability of expertise ?
The risk assessment would be done before making decisions . "
The four partner organisations in the project - the Medical Research Council , the Wellcome Trust , Cancer Research UK and University College London - are considering their options .
" Detailed decisions on what the centre will contain , including whether or not to include a category 4 lab , have not been finalised .
This is the work of the project 's science planning committee , made up of eminent scientists and experts in their fields , led by the Nobel Laureate Sir Paul Nurse , " a spokesperson says .
The partners have shortlisted architects and , after a choice has been made , they will apply to Camden council for planning permission .
This week the partners are holding a series of open meetings for local residents .
They will be hoping to avoid the sort of row that has broken out in the US city of Boston over the 2005 decision to build a high - security university lab .
The King 's Cross project will focus attention on the safety record of category 4 labs sanctioned to work on human pathogens by the HSE , such as the military Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down and the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in Potters Bar , Hertfordshire , as well as labs licensed by the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) to handle animal pathogens , such as the H5N1 avian flu virus .
These include the Institute of Animal Research at Pirbright , the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Surrey , and the NIMR at Mill Hill .
The last time a breach involving a human pathogen occurred on the scale of the animal disease breach at Pirbright was in the 1970s , when two laboratory workers died after becoming infected with smallpox at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine .
But a Guardian analysis of the HSE 's enforcement history has found over 70 dangerous incidents in labs and breaches of health and safety regulations aimed at controlling dangerous pathogens over the past 10 years , including the potential exposure of lab workers and others to a deadly form of pneumonia , and poor safety measures in work being carried out on a category 4 pathogen .
Over the past 10 years , the HSE has brought five separate prosecutions for severe failings in safety measures at universities , research institutes and labs attached to hospitals .
Imperial College London was prosecuted twice in 1998 and fined a total of £ 45,000 .
In one case , Imperial failed to seal a laboratory to allow it to be disinfected safely , and in the other incident Imperial failed to implement appropriate containment measures for work on a genetically modified virus .
Since then , it has been issued with an improvement notice in 2003 for faulty disposal of genetically modified micro-organisms .
The University of Edinburgh was prosecuted for failing to undertake risk assessments and establish a genetic modification safety committee , and fined £ 3,500 .
The University of Birmingham was prosecuted for failing to ensure its air filtration and ventilation systems were up to scratch , and fined £ 10,000 .
The HSE has also instigated three crown censures in the past 10 years , which allow it to act against government establishments that are immune from prosecution under health and safety law , such as Porton Down and the Central Science Laboratory in York .
In the past five years , the HSE has issued at least 17 improvement notices and six prohibition notices for laboratory breaches of regulations governing the control of substances hazardous to health , genetically modified micro-organisms and health and safety .
In addition , 42 investigations into reports of injuries , diseases and dangerous occurrences in labs have taken place since 2004 .
Many of these are minor accidents , such as spilling bottles containing the bacterium that causes tuberculosis in cattle .
Others cases are more serious .
At one unidentified institution , researchers were potentially exposed to avian flu in two separate incidents in 2006 due to needle stick injuries .
Accidents do happen
" Accidents happen .
It does n't matter if you are driving a car or working in a lab , one day something will happen , " says Dr Ellen Nisbet , a malaria researcher at Cambridge University .
" We are extremely well trained in what to do .
If we were not you would probably see a lot more accidents .
" But if an accident does happen , it could be catastrophic .
You just have to make sure it does not happen or locate the lab in an area where it is not so catastrophic if it does happen . "
Professor Steve Smith , principal of Imperial College 's medical faculty , says there is a general recognition that the UK needs more category 4 labs .
" The question is , do you put them in the middle of nowhere or where the researchers are ?
If the labs are in an isolated field site , you lose proximity to the researchers and this gives a narrow view .
But it is a very difficult question : how secure is secure ? "
Professor Alan Malcolm , chief executive of the Institute of Biology , says if the proper safeguards are in place , locating a category 4 laboratory in central London ought to be as safe as anywhere .
" The issue is : are we certain the various safeguards and criteria are being monitored correctly ?
That was the issue at Pirbright .
They knew the risks , but it was not being monitored properly or enforced .
Responsibility is now being transferred from Defra to the HSE , which is an improvement , " he says .
But a project like the King 's Cross lab is inevitably political .
Malcolm adds : " I find it difficult to believe that the government , if faced with being asked if it is prepared to have a category 4 lab at King 's Cross , would let it go ahead .
I can't see any minister standing up and putting their hand on heart and saying that , especially after Pirbright . "

The overwhelming favorite chat app for OS X , Adium puts Apple 's default IM application , iChat , to shame .
Like Pidgin , Adium is highly customizable , extensible with plug-ins , and works across all your favorite IM networks .
In fact , Adium is kind of like a brother from a different mother to Pidgin ; it got its brain from Pidgin 's daddy , libpurple , but its looks straight from the dangerous maiden that is OS X .

Once an overwhelming favorite for cross - network instant messaging , Trillian has lost a lot of users to newer apps like Digsby or fresher ones like Pidgin .
That said , the long - awaited update to Trillian , Trillian Astra , is still in alpha , and those who have tried it continue to place all of their IM trust to Trillian .
In the future , Trillian is also promising a Mac release along with an iPhone version , so it may have plenty of life in it yet .
Now let 's see if we can't crown a favorite .

Thomas Jefferson once said , “ Our citizens may be deceived for a while , and have been deceived ; but as long as the presses can be protected , we may trust to them for light . ”
For the past eight years , George W. Bush has been breaking both national and international laws with reckless abandon and lying repeatedly to Congress and the American people .
He has started two ill - advised wars and authorized the torture of detainees from those wars .
He has admitted to illegally spying on his own citizens .
He has vetoed several pieces of legislation designed to improve the lives of low - and middle - class Americans , calling them fiscally irresponsible .
Yet , he ’s spending at least $ 12 billion per month on the illegal , no - win war in Iraq and is borrowing money from other nations to do so .
In spite of all this , there is not much light being shone on this administration from the mainstream media .
There ’s always a “ honeymoon ” period for a newly elected president , but President Bush ’s honeymoon has gone on for eight years .
The last journalist I remember challenging Bush on anything substantive was veteran White House correspondent Helen Thomas .
During a televised press conference , she had a heated discussion with President Bush about the war in Iraq .
His irritation at her was palpable .
It was almost as if she had no business challenging him .
For the most part , however , the mainstream media uses ‘ big picture ’ journalism when covering the Bush administration .
This approach allows our government to do exactly as it pleases because nobody is paying attention to the details .
This is what President Bush and his minions are counting on .
The mainstream media is neither free nor independent
The consolidation , and subsequent compromise , of the news media actually began during the Reagan administration , but it really hit its stride in the last decade .
In 1983 , fifty corporations controlled all of the news media in the United States .
Back then , the experts found that alarming .
By 1992 , that number had dwindled to fewer than a couple of dozen corporations .
Today , a mere five major corporations control the majority of the news media in the United States : Time - Warner , Disney , Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corporation , Bertelsmann AG ( Germany ) , and Viacom ( formerly CBS ) .
For the sake of argument , add General Electric ’s NBC , which comes in a close sixth . ( 1 )
The door to media monopolization was opened by passage of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996 , the first major overhaul of the nation ’s telecommunications law in sixty - two years .
This ill - conceived piece of legislation eliminated most media ownership regulations .
The FCC further relaxed the rules in 2003 , allowing broadcast networks to own television stations that reach a combined 45 % of the national audience .
When citizens , who are largely opposed to media consolidation , voiced their dissent about the changes in 2003 , their opinions were simply ignored .
Then , in December 2007 , the FCC again voted 3 - 2 along party lines to eliminate the ‘ newspaper / broadcast cross- ownership ban ’ that prevents a local newspaper from owning television and radio stations in the same market .
These decisions may be good for big business , but they are bad for Americans and for democracy .
Consolidation does not serve local communities and does not promote diversity
The media conglomerates that control our news use the public airwaves free of charge and reap billions of dollars in profits as a result .
In return , they are supposed to be serving the public by producing quality programming that focuses on the concerns of local communities .
They do not , however , hold up their end of the bargain .
Instead , they have cut the staffing of local newsrooms and failed to address local issues .
In Boston , where I live , I was surprised to find out a couple of weeks ago that three of the longest - serving members of a local television station were let go .
When I phoned to ask why , I was told it was a “ business decision . ”
The consolidation of media outlets also results in limited ownership opportunities for women and people of color .
In addition , coverage of issues important to women , people of color and other minorities , the working class and rural inhabitants have virtually disappeared .
Consolidation compromises journalistic quality and American democracy
If the public is to hold our leaders accountable , the news they rely on to do so must be unbiased and from independent sources .
Consolidation , however , actually reduces the number of reliable and independent news , opinion and information sources .
It also affects the way the news is reported to the public .
In a study done by Pew Research Center for the People and the Press and the Columbia Journalism Review , more than one quarter of the journalists surveyed said they avoided stories that might conflict with the interests of their news organizations or its advertisers .
News Corp. , Rupert Murdoch ’s company , has had amazing success with Fox News Network , consistently thrashing rival CNN in the ratings in the battle of the 24 - hour news networks .
However , Fox feeds the general public a steady diet of right - wing commentators , like Sean Hannity and Bill O’Reilly , and is repeatedly accused of biased reporting .
News Corp. gave $ 4,995,768 in individual , soft money and PAC contributions between 1997 and 2006 , with $ 60.4 % going to the Republican Party .
( 2 ) That ’s where one would expect the money to go since Murdoch is a conservative .
Fox network ’s biased messages are then further disseminated to its affiliates .
Time - Warner operates in the same manner , except that the lions ’ share of its individual , soft money and PAC contributions go to the Democrats .
( 2 ) The point is that such far - reaching media influence on either side of the aisle results in bias and is unacceptable .
Where have all the journalists gone ?
To call today ’s breed of newsperson an investigative journalist , would be a misnomer .
They are more like talking heads regurgitating what they are fed .
There ’s plenty to investigate with this administration in power , but nobody is doing it .
In the fall of 2001 , a series of anthrax attacks further traumatized a nation already made shaky by the 9 - 11 terrorist attacks .
Five people died and many others were infected .
The attacks made news for a while , but the story simply disappeared from the mainstream media ’s radar screen .
It ’s a still - unsolved crime , but do we know if the FBI is even working this case ?
Has any progress been made ?
We know military - grade anthrax was used .
We know it was sent only to Democratic politicians and the news media .
Could this be something that the administration wants the public to forget ?
Is n’t this enough to raise some questions ?
Is this not a story that begs pursuit ?
It was the pursuit of the facts by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post that resulted in the downfall of Richard Nixon .
Woodward and Bernstein knew they were onto something and pursued the facts , with the encouragement , support and guidance of their superiors ( who , by the way , were constantly under pressure from the administration to back off ) .
The journalism had integrity , the facts were corroborated and the stories ran day after day , keeping Americans informed and tying all the loose ends together .
We have no such situation today .
In fact , many feel that the Washington Press Corps have too cozy a relationship with members of the Bush administration .
Several members of the press corps have admitted that , at the end of the day , they often wind up running what the White House suggests as a story .
It just so happens that packaging the news is another specialty of the Bush administration .
In 2003 , the same Washington Post helped to spread the Pentagon ’s lie about Pfc. Jessica Lynch .
The invasion in Iraq was beginning to hit some rough times and the Iraqi people were not welcoming us with open arms , as was promised by the Bush war machine .
The rescue of Jessica Lynch would be just the piece of propaganda the administration would need to rally the American public .
The Pentagon painted her rescue as a valiant Special Ops effort , replete with gun battles on the ground and Black Hawk helicopters firing from the air .
The Washington Post , the New York Times and other media claimed that Lynch shot several Iraqis during her rescue and sustained several gunshot wounds herself .
This could only have happened with the cooperation of a complicit media , a media that did not check the facts being fed it by the government .
It was months later that the truth came out .
Jessica Lynch had never sustained gunshot wounds .
She had indeed been severely injured when her Humvee crashed during an ambush .
Her captors took Lynch to a hospital , where she was apparently treated well .
As far as her rescue was concerned , her captors actually left two days before the raid took place .
By the time the media found out it was misled and recanted the story , months had passed and to some the issue was not important anymore .
Sadly , there were no great repercussions for the mainstream media .
It is Jessica Lynch who received hate mail for making up the story , but it was not Jessica Lynch who was guilty .
The Pentagon made up the story and the media went along for the ride , much like they did when our president decided to lie about the reasons for invading Iraq .
The media did n’t question the Bush administration then either .
The Bush administration is n’t just adept at twisting the truth and lying to make its point .
Apparently it is also pretty adept at pre-packaging the media .

BERKELEY , Calif . 
While the City Council here has little  read , no  sway over foreign policy and distant wars , local parking is a different matter .
And so it was that a parking space directly in front of the recruiting station here for the Marine Corps was awarded on Tuesday night to an antiwar group in the hope of running the Marines out of town .
Having failed in recent years to impeach President Bush and stop the war in Afghanistan , members of the City Council approved a resolution that encourages people to nonviolently “ impede , passively or actively , ” the work of the recruiters .
To that end , the council awarded the group , Code Pink , exclusive use of the parking spot for four hours one afternoon each week , for the next six months , to stage its protests .
“ If you ’re going to join the Marines , you ’re going to join the Marines , ” said Zanna Joi , an activist with Code Pink , which favors cotton - candy - colored garb and in - your - face tactics .
“ But you do n’t have to join the Marines from our town . ”
In taking on the Marines , the council also directed the city attorney to investigate legal means of ousting the recruiting station , calling the Marines “ uninvited and unwelcome intruders ” in this bastion of liberal politics , 1960s free speech and high - minded nonbinding resolutions .
I 'm not sure the point can be made forcefully enough that John McCain is , among practical politicians , perhaps the single most committed advocate of an imperial vision of American foreign policy out there .
This case can ( and will ! ) be made at great length , but one quick way of getting at the point is through Teddy Roosevelt .
It 's well known that McCain is a huge Roosevelt admirer , and sees himself as a kind of TR for the 21st century .
At the same time , TR is a complicated , multi- faceted figure .
Among other things , however , he was an arch - imperialist at a time when imperialism was undertaken with much less of a velvet glove .
Things like McCain 's March 25 , 2002 speech at USC make it clear that he does n't see Roosevelt 's imperialism as somehow incidental to his hero 's vision :
Theodore Roosevelt is one of my greatest political heroes .
The “ strenuous life ” was T.R. ’s definition of Americanism , a celebration of America ’s pioneer ethos , the virtues that had won the West and inspired our belief in ourselves as the New Jerusalem , bound by sacred duty to suffer hardship and risk danger to protect the values of our civilization and impart them to humanity .
“ We can not sit huddled within our borders , ” he warned , “ and avow ourselves merely an assemblage of well - to - do hucksters who care nothing for what happens beyond . ”
His Americanism was not fidelity to a tribal identity .
Nor was it limited to a sentimental attachment to our “ amber waves of grain ” or “ purple mountains majesty . ”
Roosevelt ’s Americanism exalted the political values of a nation where the people were sovereign , recognizing not only the inherent justice of self - determination , not only that freedom empowered individuals to decide their destiny for themselves , but that it empowered them to choose a common destiny .
And for Roosevelt that common destiny surpassed material gain and self - interest .
Our freedom and our industry must aspire to more than acquisition and luxury .
We must live out the true meaning of freedom , and accept “ that we have duties to others and duties to ourselves ; and we can shirk neither . ”
Some critics , in his day and ours , saw in Roosevelt ’s patriotism only flag - waving chauvinism , not all that dissimilar to Old World ancestral allegiances that incited one people to subjugate another and plunged whole continents into war .
But they did not see the universality of the ideals that formed his creed .
There are a couple of things to note about this .
The sentiment that American patriotism is a higher calling than some tawdry blood - and - soil nationalism is a fairly banal one in the US and serves as an umbrella under which different kinds of ideas can hide .
But McCain brings it up and specifically ascribes this view to Roosevelt , apostle of empire .
To McCain , a commitment to universalism requires American expansionism .
Indeed , to McCain it is precisely commitment to this imperial vision that makes American patriotism superior to other brands of nationalism .
Our own patriotism would become compromised by stinginess and selfishness were we to show more restraint in world affairs .

On the face of it , the island of Sark was as tranquil as ever yesterday .
Visitors pottered around the car - free lanes and explored the rocky coastline while the locals seemed to get on with life as slowly and steadily as they always have .
But this was no ordinary day .
Hundreds of miles away on the mainland the Queen was giving royal assent to fundamental reform of the island 's constitution , until now a bastion of feudalism in the west .
For 400 years the majority of those who sit in Sark 's parliament , the Chief Pleas , have not been elected but are entitled to a seat because they own land .
Islanders have also been subservient to the seigneur , effectively the lord of Sark , who has his own private army , who until recently took a handsome cut whenever property was bought and sold - and who was also entitled to a chicken a year from his " subjects " .
No wonder when word from London finally reached Sark that Lieutenant Colonel Reg Guille , who as " seneschal " is the island 's judge and presides over its parliament , described it as a " momentous " day .
" It will see huge changes to our judiciary and government , making both more modern , " he added .
But he wanted island life to go on as normal : " It 's a very quiet and peaceful place ; we are a self - sufficient , close - knit community and we like to get on with life away from the public eye . "
There are two main reasons , or three really , for the Reform ( Sark ) Law 2008 .
Firstly , more than 30 years ago Sark signed up to the European convention on human rights .
It seemed a good idea until islanders realised that feudalism did not sit well with human rights .
The second and third reasons are the billionaire Barclay brothers , Sir David and Sir Frederick , owners of the Daily Telegraph and residents of a mock gothic castle on Brecqhou , a rocky island off Sark which is subject to its laws .
They have led the fight for feudalism to be scrapped , claiming it is unfair and unjust .
Their capitalist philosophy also makes them deeply opposed to handing over any cash to an island lord .
But not all are in favour of change .
The philosophy of the current seigneur , Michael Beaumont , is : " If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . "
As the decision came through yesterday , he was unavailable as he was riding his bicycle around the island .
His view is shared by many on Sark for whom the move towards democracy is proving painful .
Phil Falle , a local journalist , said the atmosphere at meetings of the Chief Pleas had been " terrible " of late , adding : " The island seems to be splitting into two camps , those who support the Barclays and those who do not . "
As well as pushing for democracy , the Barclays and their people have been buying up land and hotels .
Some traditionalists fear they are turning the place into a holiday resort for the rich - and believe the new system of government may make it easier for them .
On the other hand , supporters of the brothers argue that they are creating jobs , especially for young people who would otherwise leave .
Sark 's elections take place in December and the new parliament is due to begin work in the new year .
Unless , that is , legal wrangling halts the elections .
Even ahead of the privy council 's decision , the Barclays launched judicial review proceedings .
They feel the reforms do not go far enough as , although members of the Chief Pleas will be elected , the seigneur and the seneschal will hang on to some of their powers in the parliament and the judicial system .
David Barclay , who rarely gives interviews , phoned the Guardian to express his concern such figures would still have important and unelected roles .
" We are pushing for full democracy , " he said .
He also criticised Jack Straw , the justice secretary , for not intervening and pushing for stronger reforms on Sark .
" I think this is an embarrassment for him , " he said .
It appears the fight for democracy on Sark still has a little way to go .
Backstory
Lorries and cars are banned on the Avenue , Sark 's main street .
The 600 residents move goods by tractor and travel around the three - mile - long island on horse - drawn cart , bicycle or foot .
Sark is neither part of the UK , nor a sovereign state .
Elizabeth I made the island a " noble fief " to be held in perpetuity by the first seigneur and his heirs .
He split the island into the 40 tenements - chunks of land - that remain today .
In return he had to defend the island against the French .
Forty men still carry muskets .
Over the years the seigneur 's rights have been many and varied .
He has had the right to keep the island 's only pigeons and unspayed female dogs - and anything washed up on its shores .
He has the front pew in the church - and other members of the congregation have had to pay 2 p a year in pew rent .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Retired hospital porter Steve Smith , who is suffering from a potentially fatal heart defect , won almost 19 million pounds ( $ 38 million ) on Britain ’s National Lottery -- but said he would give it all up if he could spend a few more years living with his wife Ida .
“ I have a one in 10 chance of living .
It ’s like a ticking time bomb , ” said the 58 - year - old Smith , enjoying a bittersweet glass of celebratory champagne with his wife Ida .
Smith , who has an aortic aneurysm , told reporters when collecting his check : “ It ’s Ida I worry for , it ’s leaving her behind .
I would give all that back if I am allowed to still be with her because there are no shops in the cemetery are there ? ”
Smith landed the giant prize with an extra stroke of luck -- the couple stopped off on the way home from a family visit to buy some lucky dip tickets and it was one of those which hit the jackpot .

Some passengers waited for up to four hours for bags Flights from Heathrow 's new £ 4.3 bn Terminal 5 are departing with hand baggage only after luggage check - in was suspended due to a processing backlog .
British Airways , which has sole use of T5 , announced check - in of all hold luggage was suspended until Friday .
The airline has already cancelled 34 flights because of baggage problems and passengers have had to wait up to four hours to reclaim their luggage .
BA said it " sincerely " apologised to all those customers affected .
' Refunds '
Angry scenes have also been developing in the airport 's airside arrivals area , with pushing and shoving in " chaotic " passport control queues , the BBC's Priya Patel reported .
Travellers emerging from the baggage hall have told her that no luggage is coming through on carousels from arriving flights , and some complain that they have been waiting two to three hours for their bags .
Announcing the suspension of baggage check - in , Gareth Kirkwood , BA 's director of operations , said : " We sincerely apologise to those customers who have suffered disrupted journeys or baggage delays .
I 've stood in line for an hour , I get to the front of the line and they just send me to the back of another line
Passenger Ray Duffy
Passenger fury over T5 ' shambles '
" We always knew the first day would represent a unique challenge because of the size and complexity of the move into Terminal 5 .
We are working extremely hard on solutions to these short term difficulties . "
The airline is advising passengers to check in with hand baggage only if they wish to travel later , or to telephone BA if they want a refund or to rebook a flight .
BA has offered passengers on cancelled flights £ 100 towards the cost of overnight accommodation , but travellers have reported that local hotels are charging up to twice that figure .
German businessman , Hertz Merkel , flying to Dusseldorf , was one of those left waiting in the long queues at the terminal 's check - in desks .
" This is real British organisation for you .
I 've only got hand baggage but I still have to stand in the same queue .
It does n't look like I 'll be getting home today . "

Heathrow upheaval T5's economic importance Maria Matheou , 20 , a student from Greece who is studying in Leicester , said it was " ridiculous " to be told she could not take her bags .
" We can hardly go on holiday without our luggage .
We did the check - in online at 3 pm today , we got our boarding passes , we stood in line and then right at the last minute we were told we cannot take our luggage with us . "
Check - in delays also meant that Ray Duffy , who was trying to return home on a flight to Edinburgh , was turned away from security because he was too late for his flight .
But after returning to the departure hall , he discovered he could no longer fly with his luggage .
" I just hope I get home .
It 's incredible .
I 've stood in line for an hour , I get to the front of the line and they just send me to the back of another line , " he said .
' Teething problems '
The suspension of luggage check - in was just the latest problem to hit passengers hoping to leave T5 on its opening day .
BA earlier announced " initial teething problems " with car parking provision , delays in staff security screening and staff familiarisation had resulted in a backlog of baggage .
This led the airline to cancel a number of flights in and out of the terminal , including services to Munich , Frankfurt , Paris and Brussels as well as Edinburgh , Glasgow and Aberdeen .
Environmental campaigners in red T - shirts staged a peaceful protest A further technical fault also meant seven flights left T5 without luggage on board .
The BBC 's transport correspondent Tom Symonds said the backlog was caused by problems with the airport 's three - stage luggage processing system .
The first stage - the fast bag drop - was working as planned , he said .
But the second stage , an underground conveyor system , had become clogged up .
This was being blamed on staff failing to remove luggage quickly enough at the final unloading stage .
In a statement , the Department for Transport said it expected BA and airport operator BAA " to work hard to resolve these issues and limit disruption to passengers " .
Local Conservative MP
David Wilshire , who serves on the Commons Transport Committee , said it was not clear who was to blame - BA or the airport 's owner , BAA .
" The problem in getting to the real truth of this .
" ' Not my fault , guv , maybe his fault guv ' is , I think , a bit of the problem , " Mr Wilshire said .
" And we wo n't get to the bottom of this until we know a bit more .
What we have to find out is why this has happened and make sure it 's put right and hope that this is really a starting glitch .
People have been let down , let 's be honest about it . "
Earlier , hundreds of protesters - wearing Stop Airport Expansion T - shirts and opposed to plans for a third runway and sixth terminal at Heathrow - carried out a peaceful protest at the terminal .
BA has set up an information line for T5 passengers : 0800 727800

Syntax Matters
( Note : I had been working on this post before this thread showed up on Artima today , so I figured it was an appropriate time to finish it off and publish it . )
One of Carson ’s favorite phrases is to say that “ syntax matters , ” so I ’m kind of stealing his idea here .
But it ’s something I firmly believe in as well , and it ’s central enough to how we ’ve designed GScript that it warrants a detailed explanation and defense .
The most common response to any sort of language criticism always seems to be , “ But you can still do that in my language , here ’s how . ”
But of course that response is pretty much always an option ; any Turing - complete language has the same set of fundamental capabilities .
The point is that it does n’t just matter what your language can do ; what matters is how you do things using the language .
In the end it ’s impossible to be truly objective and judgments will depend on individual taste , which is fine : I ’m not trying to convince anyone that this or that way is better right now , but rather just that there are such things as better and worse ways to accomplish something and that the difference matters .
Of course , on the other hand you can take things too far ; the overhead of learning new syntactic structures can be pretty high , so in my opinion it ’s not worth jamming everything possible into the language in the name of greater expressivity .
With that said , this entry will focus more on reasons why clean , expressive syntax is important , and the subject of how to keep things from going too far will be a different entry .
I ’m fairly certain that my analysis is incomplete here , but I ’ve broken down my argument into 4 main reasons why the syntax of a language and how you express things matters .
Lines Of Code
All things being equal , less code is almost always better .
In real life , of course , things are never really equal , but as a general rule I hope it ’s non-controversial to say that being able to do task X with 50 lines of code is preferable to needing 500 lines of code to do task X . Less code takes longer to write , but the real benefits are around maintenance : less code means less of a chance of bugs , less to keep in your head , less for someone else ( or yourself 6 months later ) to read through and learn , less to test , and less to modify when you change the rest of the system .
There are always exceptions of course ; 50 lines of incomprehensible code is probably not preferable to 200 lines of dead - simple , straight - line code , and 50 lines of highly - coupled code might not be preferable to 6 different buckets of 50 lines of independent , decoupled code .
But from a language design perspective , reducing the amount of code a programmer needs to write is generally the right thing to do , and the fact that languages like Ruby and Python require so much less code than Java is one main reason why people generally end up being more productive in those languages .
Readability
I think it ’s fair to say that code is often harder to read than it is to write , and it ’s certainly true that code is read many more times than it ’s written .
As a result , writing readable code is critically important to any development project .
Better syntax makes code more readable by more clearly expressing the intent of the author .
For example , something like :
var userNames = users.map ( \u -> u. Name )
is clearer to me than
List < String > userNames = new ArrayList < String >( ) ; for ( User user : users ) { userNames.add(user.getName ( ) ) }
It ’s not just a lines - of - code issue , it ’s the fact that in the first case you read the word “ map ” and it immediately conveys a large amount of information : that the developer wanted to extract a list of names , that the operation is non-destructive , etc .
The second case requires slightly more work to understand because it looks like every other for loop in Java , so you have to dig more into the details to realize what it does ( “ okay . . . we ’re iterating here to do a simple mapping , not to perform an operation on each element , partition the list up , transform the list in place ” ) .
Of course , you can write readable code in just about any language , and in the Java case you could always refactor it into a helper method , or use some functional - like library with an anonymous inner class .
The point of better syntax is often that it makes it easier to write readable code ; the fact that there ’s only one obvious way to do most things in Python , for example , tends to make Python code much more readable than Perl code ( at least in my opinion ) .
You can write readable code in Perl , but you have to work at it ; the language itself makes it difficult .
Better syntax makes it easier to write readable code , which means that the code written in that language will , on average , be more readable .
Memorability
One thing that I think people often do n’t pay enough attention to is how easy it is to remember how to do things .
The key metric is how often you have to use something in order to stop having to look it up or rely on an auto - complete treasure - hunt in the IDE .
Are things so obvious that , even though you do n’t exactly remember , your first guess is generally right ?
If so , the designer did a good job .
Do you have to run off to the internet if you go more than 2 days without writing code using that syntax ?
That ’s generally a bad sign .
Memorability plays into both reading and writing code ; obviously it ’s hard to read code if you do n’t remember what the function calls mean or how the syntax elements interact , and it ’s clearly laborious to write code if you have to constantly look in a reference guide .
Good syntax will cause things to stick better in your head , whereas less - clear syntax might make it nearly impossible to remember things .
For example , XPath just refuses to stick in my brain ; I do n’t use it often enough , and while it ’s powerful , the syntax is basically arbitrary as far as I can tell , which means that whenever I try to write XPath expressions or need to read someone else ’s I have to look things up , slowing me down immensely .
That ’s the primary reason I did n’t add XPath support to GScript ’s XML library ; I ’d much rather use closures with find First ( ) or findAll ( ) methods , since the intention is unambiguous and the extra code is more than made up for by the hours I do n’t have to spend re-learning XPath every time I need to do something .
Is it useful to have a consistent , declarative way to query XML trees ?
Sure , in cases where you do n’t have a full - fledged programming language to use and something declarative and severely constrained is necessary .
But otherwise it ’s just too many arbitrary bits of information for me to remember on top of what I already have to keep in my head to program in Java / GScript , so I avoid it when I do have a real language to work with .
Note that this plays into both how much syntactic help you should add into a language and what syntax there should be .
If you have too many special syntactic elements , it might become difficult to remember them all .
If they ’re arbitrary , inconsistent , or otherwise unfamiliar to people , it ’ll definitely be difficult to remember them .
Discoverability
Related to the idea of memorability is the idea of discoverability : how easy is it to figure out how to do something when you ’re first starting out ?
The easier the learning curve , the more likely you are to try to learn something new , and the less time you waste doing it .
As with memorability , the ability to just guess and have that work out makes it easier to discover the correct path .
In addition , well - designed syntax will often play well with auto - complete in editors , making it easier to explore using an IDE and learn an API that way .
Lots more goes into that as well , such as proper encapsulation and object relationships , but syntax also helps .
The Upshot
Again , I ’m not trying to convince anyone right now that my particular views on language design are right ; the important thing to me is that people agree that syntax and language design matter , and that it ’s the right debate to have in the first place .
How you go about doing things in a language ( or in interacting with an API ) really does matter , and the details really are important .
Black hole found in omega Centauri [ heic0809 ]
2 April 2008
Omega Centauri is the largest and brightest globular cluster in the sky .
Images obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys onboard the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope and data obtained by the GMOS spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope in Chile show that omega Centauri appears to harbour an elusive intermediate - mass black hole in its centre .
" This result shows that there is a continuous range of masses for black holes , from supermassive , to intermediate - mass , to small stellar mass types , " explained astronomer Eva Noyola of the Max - Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching , Germany , and leader of the team that made the discovery .
Omega Centauri is visible from Earth with the naked eye and is one of the favourite celestial objects for stargazers from the southern hemisphere .
Although the cluster is 17 000 light - years away , located just above the plane of the Milky Way , it appears almost as large as the full Moon when the cluster is seen from a dark rural area .
Exactly how omega Centauri should be classified has always been a contentious topic .
It was first listed in Ptolemy 's catalogue nearly two thousand years ago as a single star .
Edmond Halley reported it as a nebula in 1677 .
In the 1830s the English astronomer John Herschel was the first to recognise it as a globular cluster .
Now , more than a century later , this new result suggests omega Centauri is not a globular cluster at all , but a dwarf galaxy stripped of its outer stars .
Globular clusters consist of up to one million old stars tightly bound by gravity and are found in the outskirts of many galaxies including our own .
Omega Centauri has several characteristics that distinguish it from other globular clusters : it rotates faster than a run-of - the - mill globular cluster , its shape is highly flattened and it consists of several generations of stars – opposed to more typical globular clusters that usually consist of just one generation of old stars .
Moreover , omega Centauri is about ten times as massive as other big globular clusters , almost as massive as a small galaxy .
These peculiarities have led astronomers to suggest that omega Centauri may not be a globular cluster at all , but a dwarf galaxy stripped of its outer stars by an earlier encounter with the Milky Way .
" Finding a black hole at the heart of omega Centauri could have profound implications for our understanding of its past interaction with the Milky Way , ” said Noyola .
Eva Noyola and her colleagues measured the motions and brightnesses of the stars at the centre of omega Centauri .
The measured velocities of the stars in the centre are related to the total mass of the cluster and are found to be far higher than expected from the mass deduced from the number and type of stars seen .
So , there had to be something extraordinarily massive ( and invisible ) at the centre of the cluster responsible for the fast - swirling stars - almost certainly a black hole with a mass of 40 000 solar masses .
" Before this observation , we had only one example of an intermediate - mass black hole - in the globular cluster G1 , in the nearby Andromeda Galaxy , ” said astronomer Karl Gebhardt of the University of Texas at Austin , USA , and a member of the team that made the discovery .
Although the presence of an intermediate - mass black hole is the most likely reason for the stellar speedway near the cluster 's centre , astronomers have analysed a couple of other possible causes : a collection of unseen burnt - out stars such as white dwarfs or neutron stars adding extra mass , or a group of stars with elongated orbits that would make the stars closest to the centre appear to speed up .
According to Noyola these alternative scenarios are unlikely : " The normal evolution of a star cluster like omega Centauri should not end up with stars behaving in those ways .
Even if we assume that either scenario did happen somehow , both configurations are expected to be very short - lived .
A clump of burnt - out stars , for example , is expected to move farther away from the cluster centre quickly .
For stars with elongated orbits , these orbits are expected to become circular very quickly . "
According to scientists , these intermediate - mass black holes could turn out to be baby supermassive black holes .
" We may be on the verge of uncovering one possible mechanism for the formation of supermassive black holes .
Intermediate - mass black holes like this could be the seeds of full - sized supermassive black holes . "
Astronomers have debated the existence of intermediate - mass black holes because they have not found strong evidence for them and there is no widely accepted mechanism for how they could form .
They have ample evidence that small black holes of a few solar masses are produced when giant stars die .
There is similar evidence that supermassive black holes weighing the equivalent of millions to thousands of millions of solar masses sit at the heart of many galaxies , including our own Milky Way .
Intermediate - mass black holes may be rare and exist only in former dwarf galaxies that have been stripped of their outer stars , but they could also be more common than expected , existing at the centres of globular clusters as well .
A previous Hubble survey of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies showed a correlation between the mass of a black hole and that of its host .
Astronomers estimate that the mass of the dwarf galaxy that may have been the precursor of omega Centauri was roughly 10 million solar masses .
If lower mass galaxies obey the same rule as more massive galaxies that host supermassive black holes , then the mass of omega Centauri does match that of its black hole .
The team will use the European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope in Paranal , Chile to conduct follow - up observations of the velocity of the stars near the cluster 's centre to confirm the discovery .

Damn , there goes my meth supply / Thank God for big local drug raids , because now you can't get coke or pot or Ecstasy anymore .
Oh wait
Do you have any sympathy for the police ?
Or the Feds ?
I mean , just a little ?
I do .
I figure you gotta muster at least a little compassion for how rough and dispiriting it must be knowing you 've done your job well and worked your ass off and maybe even risked your life , spending every single day for two years straight following leads and compiling evidence and coordinating a large drug investigation across multiple enforcement agencies , all of which finally culminated in a successful bust of some very large local meth operations .
And maybe you even made headlines by nailing a notorious drug - making family who was capable of cranking out upwards of 20 pounds of meth a month , and you were maybe lauded by the media and applauded by your boss and glad - handed by the mayor and perhaps even for a moment felt like something truly good has been accomplished .
And then , well , then you turn around and realize it's all pretty much a big , nasty joke .
Pointless , senseless , quite nearly useless — that what you 've done really makes no difference whatsoever .
And what 's more , it never really has .
Is it not brutally true ?
Is this not pretty much the norm now , the common wisdom , going on nearly 40 years of the modern and abysmal " War on Drugs " and hundreds of billions of dollars spent and countless thousands of lives lost and prisons overflowing , and yet we 're a nation that 's more illegally drug - happy than ever ?
Sometimes you just have to ask .
Because truly , this grand and insidious " war " must be one of our greatest national embarrassments , an enormous , unspoken failure , far worse in its way than the lost and disgusting war in Iraq , given how it 's caused more misery and more pain and more destruction across multiple decades and nations and governments and continues to cost countless billions of dollars and yet has , as all stats and studies reveal , almost zero effect on the overall drug culture of the nation .
This was the example just recently , a little news story that blipped across the wires saying how investigators had finally busted a big meth ring from San Francisco to Gilroy , and though there was n't much detail , it was still enough to make you say , wait a minute :
Two years of investigating ?
Hundreds of officers involved in the raids ?
One family alone capable of producing 20 pounds of meth a month ?
That 's amazing .
Yay team .
Yay justice .
And it leads to the obvious question : Did it make any sort of difference ?
Is a baggie of meth any more difficult to obtain right now than it was a month ago ?
Has there been the slightest change ?
Or is it all merely the equivalent of trying to stop a raging river with a fork ?
You already know the answer .
Sometimes you gotta re-state the obvious , so you do n't lose sight .
The truth is , big drug busts do almost nothing to stem the flow of drugs or change the complexion of the culture , save for making a handful of rather uninformed citizens and angry parents feel better for about 10 minutes , and causing the street price of your narcotic du jour to jump 20 percent for a week .
Which , I suppose , is a big part of the reason it happens at all , to give the appearance of justice and enforcement and overall safety , to prevent everyone from freaking out and whining to the mayor .
But maybe what 's most confounding is the ridiculous illogic of it all , how study after study proves that the threat of arrest and punishment , no matter how severe or even lethal , has never been the slightest deterrent to drug production , dealing , or usage — save , of course , for your average easily petrified assistant manager who wo n't go near the pot pipe at the office Christmas party because oh my gosh that stuff 's illegal and what if the cops come and take away my cat ?
It 's all amusing as it is tragic and pathetic .
How much we hate those swarthy terrorists !
How much we decry corrupt dictators and cruel governments !
Yet the U.S. government conspires and funds and works with brutal warlords and terrorists and enormously corrupt governments all over the world every single day " fighting " the flow of illegal drugs ( even as we 're often complicit in that flow ) , the vast majority of which are less dangerous and violence - inducing than good ol ' all - American alcohol .
Hypocrisy , thou art snortable .
Let me be clear .
I am no wild - eyed pro-drug legalize - everything advocate ( well , not completely ) .
I enjoy my illicit substances on intelligent and moderate occasion but I 'm also nicely aware of why they call meth the devil 's drug , the most insidious and destructive of all soul - killers , given its lethal combo of chemical toxins and addictiveness and trashy bargain - basement affordability .
I have zero reason to doubt it .
Nor do I doubt that drug - dealer culture , as a direct result of the " war , " gets incredibly violent and dangerous and makes for some mean streets indeed .
Hell , I live mere blocks from notoriously drug - dealeriffic housing projects , where crime and gunfire and death are considered pretty much weekly occurrences .
But something is deeply wrong with our overall equation .
Something rotten and rather pitiable about how we still think about drug culture and consider punishment and imprisonment the supreme solutions , and it 's evidenced by every stupid comment I read from otherwise well - meaning adults who respond to drug - bust stories by sneering " Yes !
Lock them up for life !
Kill all drug dealers !
They are ruining neighborhoods !
Destroying families !
Scum must die ! " all in typical low - grade George W. Bush eye - for - an - eye pseudo - cowboy mentality , with not the slightest wisp of a thought as to why drugs are so appealing , what forces are at play in the human heart and mind , how all those billions of dollars would go so much better for prevention and treatment — and oh yes , without thinking that those very dealers are the ones supplying their friends and neighbors with coke for the next backyard barbecue .
It is , you can say with a heavy sigh and a heavy heart and a madly tangled mind , just one of those things .
One of those enormously uncomfortable and disheartening situations in American society that keeps churning on and eating at our national soul , simply because no one , particularly not the politicians we hire to speak up and put a stop to such idiotic hypocrisy , has the nerve to speak up and put a stop to such idiotic hypocrisy .
It is like farm subsidies .
Like oil monopolies .
Like waterboarding .
Like Homeland Security and big tobacco and Dick Cheney .
Everyone with the slightest intelligence knows it 's a massive failure .
Everyone knows it 's a scam , a brutal lie , that it destroys far more than it allegedly helps .
And yet , on it goes .
It 's all so insidious and unfair and depressing it can make you want to tear out your hair and wail at the moon .
Or , you know , start doing drugs .

Denver - based Frontier Airlines Holdings , Inc. ( FRNT ) – parent company of Frontier Airlines – announced Friday that it is has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , citing unexpected problems with its credit card processor .
Frontier said it would continue normal business operations – operating its full schedule of flights and maintain employee wages , healthcare , vacation and other benefits .
President and Chief Executive Officer Sean Menke went into detailed length about the airline industry 's woes , how Frontier is holding up to them and what to expect in the next year .
" To be clear , we filed for very different reasons than those of other recent carriers , and our customers and employees can be confident that we intend to keep on flying and providing outstanding service and products , " Menke said .
Story continues below …
" We felt that Frontier would be able to withstand the challenges confronting the U.S. airline industry , which include unprecedented and significant increases in the cost of jet fuel and the impact of the credit crisis in the financial markets , without seeking bankruptcy protection .
Frontier has continued to perform relatively well in this difficult environment , and contrary to the trend , we have not seen a decrease in consumer demand , as demonstrated by our record traffic and revenue in March . "
But its principal credit card processor – which remained nameless – unexpectedly informed the company that significant proceeds from ticket sales would be withheld beginning last Friday .
" Unchecked , it would have put severe restraints on Frontier 's liquidity and would have made it impossible for us to continue normal operations , " Menke said .
Freefalling Airlines
The near freefall of the U.S. airline industry is strongly reminiscent of the downfall of financials that began tumbling last summer .
Like the financials , most of the airlines are suffering the same major problems – increased fuel costs , slowing demand and a weakening U.S. economy .
At the same time , efforts to increase cost efficiencies through mergers have been blocked by labor unions .
And recently , nearly every U.S. carrier has felt the burn .
On Thursday , the world 's largest air carrier , American Airlines – principal subsidiary of AMR Corp. ( AMR ) – canceled 933 to continue inspections on MD - 80 aircraft wiring .
Last week alone , American cancelled more than 2,500 flights and stranded an estimated 100,000 travelers .
Two weekends ago , Skybus Airlines shut down operations and declared bankruptcy , becoming the third carrier in the span of a week to close its doors – joining the ranks of Columbus , Ohio - based carrier joined Aloha Airgroup Inc. 's Aloha Airlines and ATA Airlines Inc .
Delta Air Lines Inc. ( DAL ) and Northwest Airlines Corp. ( NWA ) have been in merger talks for months now , with a major holdup coming from the 12,000 pilots between them who 've yet to endorse the deal .
Also in the merger arena , UAL Corp .'s ( UAUA ) United Airlines and Continental Airlines Inc. ( CAL ) had also started talks earlier this year , but negotiations are on pause as the two airlines are waiting to see what happens with Delta and Northwest , a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters .
A report from Calyon Securities predicted the U.S. airline industry would lose more than $ 1 billion in 2008 , mostly from the one - two combo of high fuel costs and shrinking demand , Reuters reported .
However , top carriers Delta , Northwest and Southwest Airlines Co. ( LUV ) are best positioned to weather the storm , Calyon analyst Ray Neidl said .
Frontier 's shares hit near rock bottom Friday , falling 69.43 % to close at $ 0.48 per share .
Yes , yes , I know I ’ve been promising .
So , for all of you insomniacs out there , here are a few of the notable sayings from Manny Ramirez .
It ’s actually really interesting .
He ’s significantly more approachable this spring .
It all started back in the playoffs last season , but it ’s continued through the spring .
It ’s great for us .
We can bring you another perspective from the clubhouse , and it ’s much easier to write about Ramirez when he comments .
I just walked over to him before the game , and he agreed to speak with me one - on - one .
He later spoke with a larger group of Boston media when I had finished talking to him .
His locker was on the end of the row , putting him somewhat out in the open in the extremely cramped clubhouse at the Tokyo Dome .
And all his teammates took a slight interest in the fact that he was speaking —
Mike Lowell laughed , saying that Ramirez only talks in the playoffs or Japan .
Advertisement
Something like that .
But Ramirez did say that he ’s shooting for 600 home runs — at least .
First , though , comes 500 , which is just 10 homers away at this point .
“ [ It ’s ] just another milestone that I ’m going to accomplish , ” Ramirez said , of reaching 500 home runs .
“ But my train does n’t stop there .
Six hundred .
I want to play because I love the game .
If I play six more years , why not ?
I ’m pretty sure I ’m going to reach it .
“ If my body feels good , I ’m going to keep playing .
Why stop ?
You love the game , why you ’ve got to stop ?
Age is just a number . ”
As he has repeated this spring , Ramirez is not just hoping but expecting the Red Sox to pick up both options on his contract , each for a year at $ 20 million .
“ They ’re not stupid , ” Ramirez said , of the Red Sox .
“ They know .
They know I can play and I ’m ready .
That ’s it .
I ’m going to get the two options , then I ’m going to get a four - year deal .
I ’m just going to go and get it . ”

The investment community likes Steve Ballmer .
He 's competent , aggressive and occasionally crazy .
He 's been at Microsoft 's helm for eight years , during which time the technology landscape has drastically changed several times over .
And although Microsoft has n't always kept up , it has remained ridiculously profitable .
But Wall Street loves a winner , and what happens when one of the most - feared companies in the world becomes a limp , lame underdog ?
Nothing good .
And it usually starts with the CEO 's ouster .
" This is a company that screwed up a real important product transition , and you 've got to lay the majority of the blame at the foot of the CEO , " says Paul Kedrosky , a venture capitalist and blogger .
To be fair , there is nothing in Microsoft 's financial results that suggests turmoil – third - quarter earnings topped Wall Street estimates , and the outlook was decent – but we 'd still venture to guess that Steve Ballmer 's days as CEO are numbered , thanks to a potentially botched Yahoo takeover , the abysmal Windows Vista release and a floundering web strategy .
It was on Ballmer 's watch that Microsoft developed the Windows Vista operating system , arguably one of the most disastrous product releases in the company 's history .
From a financial standpoint , Vista has generated billions of dollars in free cash flow , but the product was very late , sales have been disappointing and it's unpopular .
" If [ Microsoft ] put out a great product it might improve their branding , but financially you get diminishing returns on improving Vista since it already sells so well , " says Toan Tran , an equity strategist at Morningstar , an investment research firm .
The operating system took five years to roll out , during which time PC sales growth stalled .
And now , nobody really wants Vista , as evidenced by throngs of Windows users ' decision to downgrade to Windows XP .
" I saw an early preview release [ of Vista ] in October 2003 , and it was strategically brilliant , but it was too ambitious , " says Brent Williams , an analyst with Benchmark Co .
" It would have obliterated competition once and for all , but they never would have been able to ship it .
Almost at once they started throwing features out . "
The Vista release is just the tip of the iceberg .
Ballmer 's handling of the $ 40 - plus billion Yahoo takeover was also mismanaged from the very beginning .
" Ballmer has gone way above the call of duty to screw this up , " Kedrosky says .
" There was lots of chatter about how Microsoft had offered a deal closer to the $ 40 [ per share ] mark , so Microsoft made the mistake of prematurely indicating what [ it ] wanted to do , and now Yahoo feels like they 're getting screwed .
[ Microsoft ] is sending out all these mixed messages – it 's crazy .
Especially if you 're dealing with a passive - aggressive like [ Yahoo CEO ] Jerry Yang , who is essentially hiding in his fortress in Sunnyvale . "
But it 's not just how Microsoft has handled the takeover attempt that has drawn criticism , the reasoning behind the acquisition is equally questionable .
" It 's pretty much the worst idea ever , " says Tran .
" MSN basically died on a vine under Microsoft 's bureaucracy .
If Microsoft swallows Yahoo , it 's going to die on the vine , too . "
There are two major reasons for keeping Ballmer around : 1 ) There is n't an obvious replacement , and 2 ) It 's not clear that anyone could get Microsoft out of its current strategic mess .
But if we were talking about any other company , Ballmer would have been kicked to the curb already – other CEOs have gotten canned for lesser crimes .

[ Post No. 1 ] The March 2003 Yoo Memo Emerges !
( not an April Fool 's Joke ) : The Torture Memo to Top All Torture Memos
Marty Lederman
Subhead : The Big Kahuna : The Torture Memo that Makes the August 2002 Memo Look Like Objective and Thoughtful Legal Analysis
[ UPDATE :
As explained here , this timeline is mistaken : Jay Bybee had been confirmed to be a judge , but had not yet resigned from OLC , on March 13 , 2003 , a Thursday . ]
On Friday , March 13 , 2003 , Jay Bybee resigned from his Office as the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel , to become a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit .
The very next day -- a Saturday , mind you -- John
Yoo , merely a Deputy AAG in the Office , issued his notorious memo to the Pentagon , on behalf of OLC .
The Yoo memo effectively gave the Pentagon the green light to disregard statutory limits on torture , cruelty and maltreatment in the treatment of detainees .
This is the version of the 2002 Torture memo , which was addressed only to the CIA and the torture statute , as applied to the numerous statutes restricting the conduct of the armed forces .
None of those statues , you see , limits the conduct of war if the President says so .
It is , in effect , the blueprint that led to Abu Ghraib and the other abuses within the armed forces in 2003 and early 2004 .
Here , finally , is Part One of that memo , and here is Part Two .
( Thanks to the Washington Post for forwarding the memo . )
( Needless to say , the classification of these memos all these years was ridiculously unjustified .
There 's no reason at all that this roll out could not have occurred in 2004 . )
[ UPDATE : This next paragraph is mistaken . ]
Think about that : Either Jay Bybee -- who actually signed the August 2002 torture memo concerning the CIA -- did not know of this explosive memorandum , or it was so implausible that Bybee refused to issue it to the Pentagon .
And as soon as he was quite literally out the door , John
Yoo did not hesitate to issue the opinion on a weekend , presumably bypassing the head of the office ( Acting AAG Ed Whelan ) and the Attorney General .
( I am assured that Ed had no involvement in this matter . )
As I 've discussed previously -- see for instance here and here , and as Jane Mayer has reported in great detail , the March 14th Yoo memorandum , and the April 2 , 2003 DOD Working Group Report that incorporated its outrageous arguments about justifications for ignoring statutory limits on interrogation , was secretly briefed to Geoffrey Miller before he was assigned to Iraq , and became the source of all the abuse that occurred there in 2003 and early 2004 .
( In late 2004 , new OLC head Jack Goldsmith reviewed the March 2003 memo , was stunned by what he later called the " unusual lack of care and sobriety in [ its ] legal analysis " -- it " seemed more an exercise of sheer power than reasoned analysis " -- and immediately called the Pentagon to implore them not to rely upon it .
Later , the next head of OLC , Dan Levin , wrote the Pentagon to confirm that they rescind any policies that had been based on the Yoo memo .
See the whole story here . )
Much more to follow in subsequent posts on the substance of the March 14th torture memo .
Henry
Ford left us much more than cars and the highway system we built for them .
He changed the world ’s expectations for work .
While Ford gets credit for “ inventing the assembly line , ” his great insight was that he understood the power of productivity .
Ford was a pioneer in highly leveraged , repetitive work , done by relatively untrained workers .
A farmer , with little training , could walk into Ford ’s factory and become extraordinarily productive in a day or two .
This is the cornerstone of our way of life .
The backbone of our economy is not brain surgeons and master violinists .
It ’s in fairly average people doing fairly average work .
The focus on productivity would n’t be relevant to this discussion except for the second thing Ford did .
He decided to pay his workers based on productivity , not replacement value .
This was an astonishing breakthrough .
When Ford announced the $ 5 day ( more than double the typical salary paid for this level of skill ) , more than 10,000 people applied for work at Ford the very next day .
Instead of paying people the lowest amount he ’d need to find enough competent workers to fill the plant , he paid them more than he needed to because his systems made them so productive .
He challenged his workers to be more productive so that they ’d get paid more .
It meant that nearly every factory worker at Ford was dramatically overpaid !
When there ’s a line out the door of people waiting to take your job , weird things happen to your head .
The combination of repetitive factory work plus high pay for standardized performance led to a very obedient factory floor .
People were conditioned to do as they were told , and traded autonomy and craftsmanship for high pay and stability .
All of a sudden , we got used to being paid based on our output .
We came , over time , to expect to get paid more and more , regardless of how long the line of people eager to take our job was .
If productivity went up , profits went up .
And the productive workers expected ( and got ) higher pay , even if there were plenty of replacement workers , eager to work for less .
This is the central conceit of our economy .
People in productive industries get paid a lot even though they could likely be replaced by someone else working for less money .
This is why we ’re insecure .
Obedience works fine on the well - organized , standardized factory floor .
But what happens when we start using our heads , not our hands , when our collars change from blue to white ?

Kent Hovind's $ 250,000 Offer by John Pieret Our apologies , but you must have JavaScript enabled to view Mr. Pieret 's contact information .
Copyright © 2002 -2005 [ Posted : July 18 , 2002 ]
reationist Kent Hovind has widely publicized his " standing offer " to pay $ 250,000 for scientific evidence of evolution .
He argues that the " failure " of anyone to claim the prize is evidence that the " hypothesis " of evolution is not scientific but religious in nature .
What is the real meaning of Hovind 's challenge ?
To be as clear as possible at the very outset : Kent Hovind 's " offer " has nothing to do with the validity of the vast body of evidence , from a breathtakingly broad range of disciplines , that establishes the Theory of Evolution as one of the bedrocks of modern science .
His challenge , as will be seen , is a mere humbug without value in any rational appraisal of science .
The terms of the offer are formulated to be unattainable and it would be nothing but a total waste of time and effort for any proponent of evolution to participate in his charade .
The only intent of the offer is to gull the credulous and confuse the uninformed .
Supporters of science are not alone in this assessment .
Answers in Genesis , a creationist website devoted to promoting much the same viewpoint as Hovind 's , has said of the offer : " AiG would prefer that creationists refrained from gimmicks like this . " [ 1 ]
Even those every bit as dedicated as Hovind to opposing the Theory of Evolution recognize his offer to be a sham and an embarrassment .
The only reason to even address Hovind is to demonstrate how , like some stage magician , he is out to dazzle the unwary with what is , in the end , not very elegant sleight of hand .
No attempt will be made here to discuss the evidence supporting the Theory of Evolution because , frankly , I have neither the expertise nor the eloquence to do such a vast subject justice .
In any case , if you are reading this , you have already found one resource , the Talk .
Origins Archive , that is better equipped to inform and educate you in the real facts and issues surrounding the Theory of Evolution than perhaps any one person could hope to be .
Instead , the intent of this FAQ is to disclose , as clearly as possible , how Hovind 's offer is deceptive , even on its own terms .
Who Is Kent Hovind ?
Kent Hovind is the head of Creation Science Evangelism ( CSE ) Ministries [ 2 ] , based in Pensacola , Florida .
He and his son , Eric , stump extensively giving creationist " seminars " dozens of times a month , with some dates booked more than a year in advance . [ 3 ]
The Hovinds also operate a " theme park " , called Dinosaur Adventure Land [ 4 ] , which is best evaluated through the Hovinds ' own " virtual tour " at their site . [ 5 ]
More than one conservative Christian website lauds Hovind as being " considered by many to be one of the foremost authorities on ' Science and the Bible ' . " [ 6 ]
Given his popularity as a speaker , it is certain that he has considerable influence among certain segments of conservative Christian evolution deniers and his " $ 250,000 offer " is prominently featured on his website and in his lectures .
What Is the " $ 250,000 Offer " ?
As of the time this is being written ( July 2002 ) , Hovind 's offer is at the website of his CSE Ministries at : http://www.drdino.com/cse.asp?pg=250k.
[ May 2004 : The offer is now at http://www.drdino.com/Ministry/250k/index.jsp.] [ 7 ]
[ On the face of it , it seems like a simple matter .
Under a headline in bold typeface , separated from the rest of the terms of the offer , and below a cartoon of a man and a woman stretching an oversized dollar bill , is the following :
I have a standing offer of $ 250,000 to anyone who can give any empirical evidence ( scientific proof ) for evolution . *
My $ 250,000 offer demonstrates that the hypothesis of evolution is nothing more than a religious belief .
[ Emphasis mine . ]
Given its place of prominence , that paragraph is clearly intended to convey the impression , at least to those who bother to read no further , that there is no scientific evidence for evolution .
But this opening salvo gives only a superficial and wildly incorrect impression of what the offer really is .
What Is Wrong With the " Offer " ?
By every appearance of that opening , all that needs be done is to present some empirical scientific evidence for evolution and collect $ 250,000 .
But note the asterisk !
It leads to the following footnote :
* NOTE : When I use the word evolution , I am not referring to the minor variations found in all of the various life forms ( microevolution ) .
I am referring to the general theory of evolution which believes these five major events took place without God :
1 . Time , space , and matter came into existence by themselves .
2. Planets and stars formed from space dust .
3 . Matter created life by itself .
4 . Early life - forms learned to reproduce themselves .
5 . Major changes occurred between these diverse life forms ( i.e. , fish changed to amphibians , amphibians changed to reptiles , and reptiles changed to birds or mammals ) .
That sound you hear is the scraping of goal posts being moved .
It is true that , in its broadest possible sense , " evolution " can simply mean " change " and has been applied to such non-biological processes as star and planetary formation .
Even cultural phenomena such as the metamorphosis of language and the development of political systems have been referred to in " evolutionary " terms . [ 8 ]
Yet , in the United States today , in light of at least three - quarters of a century of conflict over the issue , " evolution " is almost universally understood , even among Hovind 's own flock , it would be fair to say , to refer to " biological evolution " ( perhaps , among creationists , with abiogenesis [ 9 ] thrown in ) .
However , Hovind is not simply using the term loosely but , instead , is trying to fashion an entirely new and idiosyncratic definition that links vastly dissimilar processes under a single rubric .
He then insists , as will be seen , that unless all can be demonstrated equally and in the same way , then none of them can be .
It is rather like demanding that a political scientist defend the values of the People 's Democratic Republic of ( North ) Korea or admit that all " democratic republics " are unworkable tyrannies .
Just because many things can go under the umbrella of one broad term does not make everything under the umbrella part and parcel of one unitary idea or process .
As Hovind would have it , there is some all - encompassing concept he calls " the general theory of evolution " that embraces ( 1 ) cosmology , ( 2 ) astrophysics , ( 3 ) abiogenesis and ( 4 ) biochemistry or genetics or something ( given the confused " Early life - forms learned to reproduce themselves " ) , in addition to ( 5 ) biological evolution .
All of the other items could be disproved without affecting the validity of biological evolution .
Since this " general theory of evolution " is not a part of science , there is no reason for any scientist to attempt to establish evidence for it .
The most charitable interpretation is that Hovind is deeply confused .
The alternative would seem to be that he has cynically constructed a strawman [ 10 ] to serve as an obstacle to succeeding at his challenge .
Nor is that the only impediment he has thrown up .
Anyone familiar with young - Earth creationism will recognize Hovind 's usage of " microevolution " as a convenient way of dismissing all demonstrated evolution below the genus level , at least .
It is clearly unfair to arbitrarily limit the evidence in this way .
Still , the expanded definition of the " general theory " could actually be a good thing for the applicant .
If , after all is said and done , the applicant has only to present any empirical evidence in support of these events , the bigger target makes it easier , not harder , to hit .
Or does it ?
As you might expect , Hovind is not done yet .
Consider the import of the phrase from the footnote " these five major events took place without God " .
That might look , at first blush , as if it means " without resort to miracles as an explanation for natural events " .
But , in fact , it requires production of empirical evidence that God had no role at all in cosmology ( including the Big Bang ) , astrophysics , abiogenesis , genetics and whatever else Hovind means by " the general theory of evolution " .
This calls for the logical impossibility of " proving a negative " .
Few , if any , atheists would go so far as to say that there could be empirical evidence that God was never active anywhere at anytime throughout the entire history of the cosmos .
More importantly , Hovind is imposing a condition that is totally outside of the Theory of Evolution .
The proposition that God never had a hand in the cosmos is certainly no part of evolution and no prerequisite for its truth . [ 11 ]
But that 's not all , folks .
Now we turn to the section of the offer called " How to collect the $ 250,000 " , where we find the applicant must :
Prove beyond reasonable doubt that the process of evolution . . . is the only possible way the observed phenomena could have come into existence .
But before we can look at that in detail , we have to find out what Hovind means by the " the process of evolution " .
For that , we must go to still another section of the offer , under " Known options " ( is it accidental that the terms of the offer are spread out so widely in the text ? ) , where we find it defined as the " idea " that :
The universe came into being by itself by purely natural processes ( known as evolution ) so that no appeal to the supernatural is needed .
Initially , why should there be a requirement that the applicant " prove beyond a reasonable doubt " any part of evolution ?
That is a legal standard having nothing to do with the process of science .
( As we will see later , there may be good reason for Hovind to insert legal terminology . )
Not only that , the standard of " beyond a reasonable doubt " seems excessive .
After all , why should science be put to that standard when most things in our day - to - day lives , including religious beliefs , are not ?
Still , it is not necessarily an insurmountable burden , though meeting it for the full range of the " general theory of evolution " would doubtless be difficult and certainly time - consuming .
But go back and note the wording : " the only possible way the observed phenomena could have come into existence " .
How do you prove that anything is the only possible way " life , the universe and everything " could have come into existence ?
Again it is calling for proof of a negative and what a negative !
In essence , you would have to prove , beyond a reasonable doubt , that God not only did n't create the universe or anything in it , but that God could n't have done it .
Since an infinite , omnipotent , omniscient being can obviously do anything it likes , including using " naturalistic " or " theistic " evolution [ 12 ] to develop the panoply of life , you logically have to prove , by empirical evidence , that God does n't exist at all in order to meet Hovind 's terms .
Clearly this is , as it is no doubt intended to be , an impossible task .
[ As many Christian theists have been the first to insist , the only way one could know definitively that God did not exist would be to be absolutely omniscient and omnipresent ; in other words , to be God oneself .
-- Ed. ]
To summarize , Hovind has gone , in the course of presenting his offer , from promising money to anyone who can present any scientific evidence for evolution ; to demanding scientific evidence of a strawman version of evolution covering numerous branches of science ; to demanding not merely evidence , but proof beyond a reasonable doubt ; to demanding proof beyond a reasonable doubt that God did n't do everything ; to demanding proof beyond a reasonable doubt that God could n't do anything and , ultimately , to demanding proof beyond a reasonable doubt that God does not exist .
At the very least , Hovind 's claim that he will pay $ 250,000 for " any empirical evidence ( scientific proof ) for evolution " can be said to be deeply deceptive .
Other Problems With the Offer
Even if Hovind had stuck with the plain meaning of that first paragraph , would the offer be legitimate ?
Whatever " evidentiary value " there is to the supposed inability of evolution supporters to meet Hovind 's challenge depends on there being some method to collect on the offer if and when evidence is produced .
For Hovind to fairly make hay out of the fact that the offer remains uncollected , he must have procedures in place to fully evaluate submissions and impartially determine if the prize should be paid .
Failing that , there should at least be legal recourse to the courts to force payment if appropriate .
Otherwise , " talk is cheap " .
Does anyone really have a chance to collect the money under Hovind 's procedures ?
The experience of those people who have inquired or who have made submissions [ 13 ] strongly suggests that fair and unbiased procedures for the review of submissions are lacking .
Hovind 's own statements do nothing to lessen these concerns .
Although the offer states that a " committee of trained scientists will provide peer review of the evidence offered " , all inquiries as to who makes up this " committee " or what their qualifications are have been rebuffed by Hovind . [ 14 ]
In one exchange with Dr. Barend Vlaardingerbroek [ 15 ] , Hovind did claim that the committee was " neutral " .
However , he followed that later on by saying " I do n't know if they [ the committee members ] are or are not young earth creationists like me but asking that question or making that stipulation would prejudice the committee . "
Of course , others , perhaps with a bit more curiosity than Hovind , might want to at least check out the committee members ' prior public statements , which could be done without risk of biasing them .
It seems more than a tad convenient that no one but Hovind knows their identities .
The most Hovind will say is that there is " a zoologist , a geologist , an aerospace engineer , a professor of radiology and biophysics , and an expert in radio metric [ sic ] dating to name a few " on the committee . [ 16 ]
He refuses to give their names because these people do not " wish to waste time arguing with skeptics and scoffers " . [ 17 ]
That is strange behavior for " trained scientists " , especially if they are impartial and were only recruited to make fair judgments based on specific evidence submitted .
But , then again , nowhere does Hovind 's offer promise that the members of the committee will be impartial or that it will be made up of a mix of people from all sides of the issue .
Within the offer itself , he only says that these people , " to the best of their ability , will be fair and honest in their evaluation and judgment as to the validity of the evidence " . [ 18 ]
In short , Hovind is free , by his own terms , to appoint a committee entirely composed of professing believers in a literal interpretation of the Bible and confirmed young - Earth creationists , just as long as they promise to be as fair as they can be .
Anyone going to the trouble to provide as much evidence as Hovind demands might want a slightly greater assurance of a fair hearing than that .
If , in fact , the committee is made up of young - Earth creationists , that would be a strange definition of " peer review " , considering that Hovind himself declares evolution supporters to be adherents of a " pagan religion masquerading as science " . [ 19 ]
Could Bible - based young - Earth creationists , whether they consider themselves scientists or not , truly conduct " peer " evaluation of something they consider a " pagan " ideology ?
How fair would such people likely be under such circumstances ?
And yet , Hovind refuses to even inquire of them about this .
On a different aspect of the issue , Hovind has implied , at least at times , that he has the right to act as a " first filter " , deciding what submissions would even be forwarded to the committee .
He has said , for instance : " Evidence of minor changes within the same kind of plant or animal does not qualify as evidence and will not be sent to the committee to waste their time . " [ 20 ]
At other times , when pressed , he seems to back off , promising to forward everything to the committee . [ 21 ]
Still , considering that he claims that " Many have responded to my offer . . . " [ 22 ] , it is puzzling why he has yet to produce a single evaluation , even an anonymous one , performed by his crack committee .
Occam's Razor suggests that whatever committee Hovind has in mind has never been invoked , despite the " many " submissions .
Then there is , as there always is , the question of the money .
It is only reasonable to inquire if Hovind even has the $ 250,000 .
In 1996 , Hovind filed for bankruptcy , declaring in official court documents under penalty of perjury that , as of that time , he was receiving no income and owned absolutely no property . [ 23 ]
If there is any reason to believe that his economic worth has significantly changed since then , it is not immediately obvious .
All he has said about the existence or whereabouts of the money is : " The offer is legitimate .
A wealthy friend of mine has the money in the bank .
If the conditions of the offer are met , the money will be paid out immediately .
My word is good . " [ 24 ]
Sliding over the last sentence for the moment , it appears that the money and its whereabouts are as anonymous as the committee .
Indeed , it is hard not to wonder if this rich friend of Hovind 's , if he or she exists , is not also sitting on the committee , if it exists , " guarding " his or her funds .
Apparently , we are never to know .
It is perhaps instructive to compare Hovind 's monetary arrangements with those of James Randi's , who has a $ 1,000,000 offer for evidence of any paranormal , supernatural , or occult power or event .
In Randi 's offer , an independent , public investment firm certifies the existence of the money and holds the account containing it . [ 25 ]
However , since Hovind has failed to provide any evidence as to his ability to pay the $ 250,000 and has instead produced only assurances that his word is good , Hovind , himself , has put the question of the value of his " personal coin " at issue .
In the same 1996 bankruptcy action [ 26 ] , the judge denied Hovind 's request for bankruptcy protection , finding :
Notwithstanding the debtor 's listing under penalty of perjury in his schedules and statement of affairs that he has no income , has no expenses , and owns no property , the evidence shows otherwise .
The judge concluded that :
Here , the debtor , who has failed to acknowledge his obligations as a citizen and taxpayer of the United States , seeks to utilize this taxpayer supported court in order to thwart the lawful collection efforts of the Internal Revenue Service . . .
The debtor having failed to file his federal income tax returns for at least the years 1989 through 1995 , having resisted collection efforts by the IRS , and having provided false information in his schedules and statement of affairs in connection with this case , I find that the debtor filed this petition in bad faith and as such the petition is subject to dismissal for cause under the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 1307 ( c ) .
No matter what your feelings about the Internal Revenue Code or even the right of citizens to resist it , it is quite a different matter to go to a bankruptcy court , which is unrelated to the enforcement of the tax laws , and file false documents under oath in a cynical attempt to circumvent those laws through the back door .
And Hovind 's willingness to blatantly manipulate the system cannot engender confidence in his " procedures " for judging the submissions made in response to his offer .
To sum up , from all the circumstances , reasonable questions arise as to whether Hovind can or will voluntarily pay on the offer if it were successfully answered , not only because of the financial loss to him and his ministry ( and / or his mysterious friend ) , but because of what it would do to his " reputation " as an evolution denier and lecturer if he was to admit in 250,000 ways that he was wrong .
The next step is to consider whether he can be forced , through the courts , to pay up or at least acknowledge that the challenge had been met .
Indeed , Hovind almost calls for such a standard himself when he said of claimants : " Treat the $ 250,000 offer as a lawyer would treat a ' who - done - it ' case .
It is your job to prove that what is being taught to our kids as fact . . . is indeed a fact . " [ 27 ]
Can the Courts Be Used to Force Hovind to Pay ?
Speaking as an attorney myself , there are many practical problems with taking Hovind to court .
Where you can get jurisdiction over him and what laws will apply , for starters .
The simplest and surest answer would be to bring the case in Florida state courts .
But then you would have to convince a judge or , more likely , a jury , to impose a significant monetary judgment against a local " man of the cloth " .
That would be a rather daunting task for any plaintiff under the best of circumstances .
Add in having to present rather complicated issues of science and religion in a courtroom , under the restrictive rules of evidence , and you have the stuff of lawyers ' nightmares .
But the question is moot in the end .
Even without an in - depth analysis of Florida law , [ 28 ]
Hovind 's offer is clearly a species of contract that is generally enforceable in law , but only upon acceptance of the terms by meeting the conditions exactly .
It is in the nature of a " reward " , which cannot be claimed unless the " item " is delivered precisely as it is described . [ 29 ]
So , while the good news is that the offer can become a binding contract that Hovind is obligated to pay , the bad news is that the courts will not , for the most part , look to see whether the conditions are fair or reasonable or even capable of being performed , at least in the absence of outright fraud .
A very basic definition of fraud ( from the Encyclopedia Britannica ) is : " in law , the deliberate misrepresentation of fact for the purpose of depriving someone of a valuable possession " .
No matter how you feel the phrase " deliberate misrepresentation of fact " might , or might not , apply to Hovind 's offer , it is clear that the offer is not intended to generate money ( the most common " valuable possession " cognizable in American courts ) , at least not from those who would claim the prize .
And while most of us would consider our time at least as important as our money , the courts do not consider the effort exerted by those who spend their days devising or responding to such point - proving exercises to be a " valuable possession " .
The courts do not favor these types of challenges but will enforce them when they are clearly made , accepted and met .
However , they will not check to see that the terms are reasonable or even rational and will not reform the terms to make them so .
At most , they will interpret any confusing terminology in a way they deem to be most clearly evident in the actual language used .
In other words , you either meet the terms exactly as Hovind has written them ( to some value of " exactly " ) or you do n't get the money .
Furthermore , one general rule courts use in interpreting contract language is that more specific language is given greater weight than general statements .
Thus , despite that opening paragraph , a court would almost undoubtedly hold that , in order to be successful , the applicant would have to meet the more specific terms set out in the section " How to collect the $ 250,000 " and the rest of Hovind 's conditions .
That would also include Hovind 's " standard of proof " .
The usual standard in civil litigation is proof " by a preponderance of the evidence " , a much lower standard than proof " beyond a reasonable doubt " , which is normally reserved only for criminal trials .
Contracts can , and frequently do , set higher or lower evidentiary standards for any litigation arising out of the contracts .
In this instance , American courts would , almost certainly , enforce the " beyond a reasonable doubt " standard set out in Hovind 's terms , despite the fact that it bears no relationship to the quality or quantity of " empirical evidence ( scientific proof ) " necessary to support a theory in scientific practice .
As we have already seen , the conditions of the challenge are logically impossible to fulfill .
The courts will not remake them to be attainable and will impose the highest possible standard of proof to boot .
Under these circumstances , the fact that no one has gone to court to collected on the offer demonstrates only that Hovind has enough cunning to make it legally impossible to do so .
Conclusion
There is much else wrong with Hovind 's presentation .
For instance , he goes on to taunt scientists by saying :
If you are convinced that evolution is an indisputable fact , may I suggest that you offer $ 250,000 for any empirical or historical evidence against the general theory of evolution .
However , note that all talk of " proof beyond a reasonable doubt " has disappeared and " historical evidence " has instead shown up .
It takes no great perspicacity to guess what that might be .
Clearly , Hovind prefers his gander served without sauce .
He also perpetrates another egregious strawman , conflating science with atheism and religion at the same time .
And the list goes on .
There comes a point , however , when a dead horse is beyond beating .
Still , one more fault in the offer must be pointed out .
Perhaps the worst aspect of Hovind 's offer is who it is intended to fool .
After all , anyone who seriously sat down to try to win the $ 250,000 and closely read the rules would quickly discover the impossibility of the conditions and the sham that the offer is .
It is no accident that the first paragraph appears so simple and easy to fulfill .
Hovind 's target audience for this bit of flimflam is just those people least likely to read any further than the opening paragraph . . . the ones who already disbelieve in evolution with a certainty born of religious fervor .
In other words , it is his own flock he wants to give an intellectual shearing .
It says much about the man .
Hovind could , of course , confound this analysis with a few simple steps .
Some possibilities would be :
Since he is demanding " scientific evidence " , he could either accept the scientific definition of biological evolution or at least engage in a dialogue with the proponents of evolution as to what the definition should be ;
He could specify exactly what evidence he would accept as satisfying the challenge and then defend his choices on scientific grounds , or else admit that he is setting a metaphysical , theological or other standard ; and
He could engage in a transparent and fair process to select a balanced , if not objective , panel of judges who have a clear standard by which to judge whether or not the terms have been met .
Until Hovind makes some reasonable effort to turn this into a true test of the Theory of Evolution , his challenge will continue to deserve nothing but disdain from advocates of evolution and creationism alike .
No human can ever know for sure if Hovind is being deliberately dishonest or is just suffering the malady of fanaticism strong enough to overcome reason and any sense of fair play .
In either event , the depressing results are plain to see . . . at least to any who choose to look .

Hovind 's declarations as to his income and assets are not the end of this story , however .
The bankruptcy court specifically found that Hovind had both income and property at the time of his filing and he was merely attempting to use the bankruptcy procedure to recover property that the Internal Revenue Service had seized for his failure to file returns or to pay income taxes .
However , the IRS investigation failed to reveal assets anywhere near $ 250,000 .
The amount the IRS determined Hovind owed in taxes ( a little over $ 21,000 total for the seven tax years ) strongly suggests that his income was considerably less than $ 50,000 a year .
His largest discovered asset was his home , which would not be subject to seizure to pay off any debt resulting from a successful claim on the prize money .

28 . Since no attempt to collect on the offer is presently pending , or ever likely to be , only a superficial web search was conducted concerning the nature of Florida contract law .
That search did indicate that Florida follows standard rules of American common law in regards to contract formation .
29 .
As an aside , this type of offer can be legally withdrawn at any time , up until the very moment that the conditions have been met .
Thus , even if there has been fairly extensive discussions over the terms ( as there have been on occasions in the past - see footnote 12 ) , Hovind , if he felt the need , could simply say that the offer is no longer in effect and avoid paying , as long as the conditions had not been fully met up to that point .
Appendix 1
Dr. Hovind's $ 250,000
Offer formerly $ 10,000 , offered since 1990 I have a standing offer of $ 250,000 to anyone who can give any empirical evidence ( scientific proof ) for evolution . *
My $ 250,000 offer demonstrates that the hypothesis of evolution is nothing more than a religious belief .
Observed phenomena :
Most thinking people will agree that -- 1 . A highly ordered universe exists .
2 . At least one planet in this complex universe contains an amazing variety of life forms .
3 . Man appears to be the most advanced form of life on this planet .
Known options : Choices of how the observed phenomena came into being -- 1 . The universe was created by God.
2 . The universe always existed .
3 . The universe came into being by itself by purely natural processes ( known as evolution ) so that no appeal to the supernatural is needed .
Evolution has been acclaimed as being the only process capable of causing the observed phenomena .
Evolution is presented in our public school textbooks as a process that : 1 . Brought time , space , and matter into existence from nothing .
2 . Organized that matter into the galaxies , stars , and at least nine planets around the sun .
( This process is often referred to as cosmic evolution . )
3 . Created the life that exists on at least one of those planets from nonliving matter ( chemical evolution ) .
4 . Caused the living creatures to be capable of and interested in reproducing themselves .
5 . Caused that first life form to spontaneously diversify into different forms of living things , such as the plants and animals on the earth today ( biological evolution ) .
People believe in evolution ; they do not know that it is true .
While beliefs are certainly fine to have , it is not fair to force on the students in our public school system the teaching of one belief , at taxpayers ' expense .
It is my contention that evolutionism is a religious worldview that is not supported by science , Scripture , popular opinion , or common sense .
The exclusive teaching of this dangerous , mind - altering philosophy in tax - supported schools , parks , museums , etc. , is also a clear violation of the First Amendment .
How to collect the $ 250,000 : Prove beyond reasonable doubt that the process of evolution ( option 3 above , under " known options " ) is the only possible way the observed phenomena could have come into existence .
Only empirical evidence is acceptable .
Persons wishing to collect the $ 250,000 may submit their evidence in writing or schedule time for a public presentation .
A committee of trained scientists will provide peer review of the evidence offered and , to the best of their ability , will be fair and honest in their evaluation and judgment as to the validity of the evidence presented .
If you are convinced that evolution is an indisputable fact , may I suggest that you offer $ 250,000 for any empirical or historical evidence against the general theory of evolution .
This might include the following : 1 . The earth is not billions of years old ( thus destroying the possibility of evolution having happened as it is being taught ) .
2 . No animal has ever been observed changing into any fundamentally different kind of animal .
3 . No one has ever observed life spontaneously arising from nonliving matter .
4 . Matter can not make itself out of nothing .
My suggestion : Proponents of the theory of evolution would do well to admit that they believe in evolution , but they do not know that it happened the way they teach .
They should call evolution their " faith " or " religion , " and stop including it in books of science .
Give up faith in the silly religion of evolutionism , and trust the God of the Bible ( who is the Creator of this universe and will be your Judge , and mine , one day soon ) to forgive you and to save you from the coming judgment on man 's sin .
* NOTE : When I use the word evolution , I am not referring to the minor variations found in all of the various life forms ( microevolution ) .
I am referring to the general theory of evolution which believes these five major events took place without God : 1 . Time , space , and matter came into existence by themselves .
2 . Planets and stars formed from space dust .
3 . Matter created life by itself .
4 . Early life - forms learned to reproduce themselves .
5 . Major changes occurred between these diverse life forms ( i.e. , fish changed to amphibians , amphibians changed to reptiles , and reptiles changed to birds or mammals ) .

More Suicide Bombers , New Tactics , More Victims U.S. concludes that suicide attacks are increasing and al Qaeda is stronger .
WASHINGTON , April 30 , 2008  --
Are we winning ?
Looking at the just - released State Department report on terrorism , the answer appears to be " no . "
The number of terror victims killed or injured is on the rise worldwide , according to the report , and al Qaeda 's senior leadership has restored some of its control over the terror group 's operations , and increased its mobility and ability to plan attacks .
Most dramatically , there was a 50 percent increase worldwide in suicide bombings last year .
All told , 66,995 people were killed or wounded in terror attacks in 2007 ( up from 59,327 in 2006 and 39,469 in 2005 ) .
Some key figures :
- Iraq was the country most heavily hit by suicide bombings , accounting for 45 percent of the attacks and 60 percent of the victims .
- The number of attacks in Pakistan doubled , and injuries and fatalities in Pakistan quadrupled .
- Well over 50 percent of those killed or injured in terror attacks were Muslims .
- 2,400 children were killed or injured in 2007 by suicide attacks , an increase of 25 percent .
- Algeria and Thailand also saw big increases in the number of terror victims .
" Around the globe people are getting increasingly efficient at killing other people , " said Russ Travers of the National Counterterrorism Center , which compiled the data for the report .
One factor contributing the increased lethality of terror attacks : increased use of backpacks by suicide bombers that are easier to sneak into crowded areas .
The report says al Qaeda " and associated networks " remain " the greatest threat to the United States and its partners . "
That threat increased last year because al Qaeda 's senior leaders had " greater mobility and ability to conduct training and operational planning , particularly that targeting Western Europe and the United States . "
Officials also blame al Qaeda 's ability to operate in Pakistan 's lawless tribal regions has allowed the terror network to reconstitute itself and plan attacks elsewhere .
Osama bin Laden 's deputy , Ayman Al - Zawahiri , restored some of his control over al Qaeda last year .
Bin Laden remained the group 's " ideological figurehead , " but " Zawahiri has emerged as AQ's strategic and operational planner , " according to the report .
Unlike the Earth , the Moon does n't have enough surface activity to cover up its blemishes .
COMMENTARY
Recently BBC
News reported that some British police departments have decided to add extra officers on nights with a full moon .
The concern is n't over werewolves or vampires — no need to issue silver bullets or wooden stakes — but more human threats such as petty thieves and violent criminals .
For years , some who work in police and emergency services ( such as doctors and nurses ) have anecdotally claimed that full moon nights are busier , crazier , and more dangerous than nights when the moon is dim .
This perception may be rooted more in psychology than reality .
Belief in the moon 's influence is an ancient one , and common in many cultures including our own .
If police and doctors are expecting that full moon nights will be more hectic , they may interpret an ordinary night 's traumas and crises as more extreme than usual .
Our expectations influence our perceptions , and we look for evidence that confirms our beliefs .
( The same thing happens on " bad days " when everything seems to go wrong , but only a few key things actually do . )
Yet carefully controlled studies have not found good evidence supporting this idea .
For example , researchers Ivan Kelly , James Rotton , and Roger Culver , in their study " The Moon was Full and Nothing Happened " ( published in the book " The Hundredth Monkey and Other Paradigms of the Paranormal , " 1991 ) examined more than 100 studies of alleged lunar effects and found no significant correlation between phases of the moon and disasters , homicide rates , etc .
Furthermore , there is no known mechanism by which the moon would somehow influence a person 's mind to make him more dangerous — except of course for his own expectations .
Still , though the evidence for any direct influence of a full moon is negligible and contradictory , there is some evidence for a less direct ( yet more obvious ) connection .
There is a good reason why there may be more crime on the nights of a full moon ; it has to do with statistics , not lunacy .
People are more active during full moons than moonless nights .
An especially beautiful full moon may draw families out into the night to appreciate it , and lovers to local necking spots .
Muggers and other criminals who ply their trade at night also use the moon 's illumination to carry out their dirty deeds .
If there is even slightly more activity — any activity — on a full moon night , then that may translate into a slight but real increase in crime , accidents , and injuries .
No werewolves needed .
Benjamin Radford is managing editor of Skeptical Inquirer science magazine , and the Spanish - language magazine Pensar .
He is author or co-author of three books and hundreds of articles on the paranormal , noted on his website .
Allan Reiss , MD , and his colleagues have a pretty good idea why your husband or boyfriend ca n’t put down the Halo 3 .
In a first - of - its - kind imaging study , the Stanford University School of Medicine researchers have shown that the part of the brain that generates rewarding feelings is more activated in men than women during video - game play .
“ These gender differences may help explain why males are more attracted to , and more likely to become ‘ hooked ’ on video games than females , ” the researchers wrote in their paper , which was recently published online in the Journal of Psychiatric Research .
More than 230 million video and computer games were sold in 2005 , and polls show that 40 percent of Americans play games on a computer or a console .
According to a 2007 Harris Interactive survey , young males are two to three times more likely than females to feel addicted to video games , such as the Halo series so popular in recent years .
Despite the popularity of video and computer games , little is known about the neural processes that occur as people play these games .
And no research had been done on gender - specific differences in the brain ’s response to video games .
Reiss , senior author of the study and the Howard C. Robbins Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences , has long been interested in studying gender differences ; in 2005 , he published a study showing that men and women process humor differently .
He and his colleagues became interested in exploring the concept of territoriality , and they determined the best way to do so was with a simple computer game .
The researchers designed a game involving a vertical line ( the “ wall ” ) in the middle of a computer screen .
When the game begins , 10 balls appear to the right of the wall and travel left toward the wall .
Each time a ball is clicked , it disappears from the screen .
If the balls are kept a certain distance from the wall , the wall moves to the right and the player gains territory , or space , on the screen .
If a ball hits the wall before it ’s clicked , the line moves to the left and the player loses territory on the screen .
During this study , 22 young adults ( 11 men and 11 women ) played numerous 24 - second intervals of the game while being hooked up to a functional magnetic resonance imaging , or fMRI , machine .
fMRI is designed to produce a dynamic image showing which parts of the brain are working during a given activity .
Study participants were instructed to click as many balls as possible ; they were n’t told that they could gain or lose territory depending on what they did with the balls .
Reiss said all participants quickly learned the point of the game , and the male and female participants wound up clicking on the same number of balls .
The men , however , wound up gaining a significantly greater amount of space than the women .
That ’s because the men identified which balls – the ones closest to the “ wall ” – would help them acquire the most space if clicked .
“ The females ‘ got ’ the game , and they moved the wall in the direction you would expect , ” said Reiss , who is director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research .
“ They appeared motivated to succeed at the game .
The males were just a lot more motivated to succeed . ”
After analyzing the imaging data for the entire group , the researchers found that the participants showed activation in the brain ’s mesocorticolimbic center , the region typically associated with reward and addiction .
Male brains , however , showed much greater activation , and the amount of activation was correlated with how much territory they gained .
( This was n’t the case with women . )
Three structures within the reward circuit – the nucleus accumbens , amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex – were also shown to influence each other much more in men than in women .
And the better connected this circuit was , the better males performed in the game .
The findings indicate , the researchers said , that successfully acquiring territory in a computer game format is more rewarding for men than for women .
And Reiss , for one , is n’t surprised .
“ I think it ’s fair to say that males tend to be more intrinsically territorial , ” he said .
“ It does n’t take a genius to figure out who historically are the conquerors and tyrants of our species - they ’re the males . ”
Reiss said this research also suggests that males have neural circuitry that makes them more liable than women to feel rewarded by a computer game with a territorial component and then more motivated to continue game - playing behavior .
Based on this , he said , it makes sense that males are more prone to getting hooked on video games than females .
“ Most of the computer games that are really popular with males are territory - and aggression - type games , ” he pointed out .
Reiss said the team ’s findings may apply to other types of video and computer games .
“ This is a fairly representative , generic computer game , ” he said , adding that he and his colleagues are planning further work in this area .

Jeremiah Wright was White House guest
The recent coverage of Rev. Jeremiah
Wright has often cast him as a marginal , almost fringe figure , but Trinity Church is a major Chicago institution , and Wright has long been a prominent pastor on the American scene .
And an anonymous blog set up to defend his church offers some compelling photographic evidence of this : A photograph of Wright and President Clinton , which it says was taken on Sept. 11 , 1998 — the date of a White House gathering for religious leaders .
[ UPDATE :
The blog seems to have taken that item down ; here 's the full image that was posted . ]
Hillary Clinton , according to her recently released schedule for the day , was present at the gathering .
Al Gore also appears in the picture .
" In the course of his two terms in office , Bill Clinton met with , corresponded with and took pictures with literally tens of thousands of people , " Clinton spokesman Jay Carson told Politico .
That 's where Clinton reportedly told the assembled clerics , at the depth of the Monica Lewinsky scandal , that he had " repented . "
As CNN reported at the time :
" I have been on quite a journey these last few weeks to get to the end of this , to the rock - bottom truth of where I am , " Clinton said in his most emotional and dramatic statement since the affair with Lewinsky became public .
" I do n't think there is a fancy way to say that I have sinned . "
Agreeing with his critics that he was not " contrite " enough during his initial Aug. 17 statement , Clinton said , " It is important to me that everybody who has been hurt know that the sorrow I feel is genuine .
First and most important , my family , my friends , my staff , my cabinet , Monica Lewinsky and her family and the American people .
I have asked all for their forgiveness . "
His comments were the first time the president has publicly apologized to Lewinsky .
Clinton went on to describe the journey he has been on during the weeks since his first public admission , saying that he has finally repented .
" I have repented , " Clinton said .
" I must have God 's help to be the person that I want to be .
A willingness to give the very forgiveness I seek .
A renunciation of the pride and the anger , which cloud judgment , lead people to excuse and compare and to blame and complain . "
UPDATE : The New York Times later this evening posted the same photograph and said it had been provided by the Obama campaign .
And here 's a screenshot of the photo on the anonymous blog , before it was removed .
Curious things , these anonymous blogs .
South Korea to Build Robot Cities by 2013
If you ’ve liked watching Lt. Commander Data , the positronic - brained second officer , in the sci - fi series Star Trek , then you ’d love to hear this .
The South Korean government plans to build two robot - themed parks close to Seoul , one in the bustling seaport of Incheon , and another in Masan by the year 2013 .
The megaproject , the first of its kind on the planet , is estimated to cost a whopping $ 1.6 billion , and will feature an array of robotic marvels allowing visitors to interact with tomorrow ’s machines .
According to reports published on the web site Korea.net , the two cities are being developed as futuristic hubs , poised to become the country ’s Silicon Valley of robotics .
Robotics is considered to be one of South Korea ’s booming industries and it has grown by leaps and bounds over the past five years , recording a 40 percent jump since the year 2003 , the site reported .
To ensure that the robotics sector continues to see such growth rates , recently , the government drew up what is known as the Robot Ethics Code , a code of ethics that will prevent android abuse by humans as well as the other way round .
It ’s basically a how - to manual for both robot - makers and robot - users that tells them how to relate to robots .
Given that the government aims to install a robot in every household by the year 2020 , perhaps , that isn ’ such a quixotic idea .
What ’s more , in a recently - out book titled “ Love and Sex with Robots “ , a British Artificial Intelligence researcher David Levy , predicts that robots will advance to such phenomenal levels in the coming years that it ’ll be possible for humans to even marry them by 2050 .

Once the word was out , there was no stopping them .
Within minutes of one lucky customer finding out that the cash machine at his local supermarket was giving out double the requested withdrawal , the news spread like wildfire .
Customers popping down to their Sainsbury 's Local store for a few basics got in on the act - and they were soon joined by hundreds of others as they alerted family and friends to the ultimate supermarket bargain .
At one stage , the queue for the cash machine was a 100 - strong - with many making multiple withdrawals in the hope they will not be traced and asked to repay the cash .
Scroll down for more ...
" It was really funny seeing all those people trying to get one over on the banks , " said a witness .
" They were walking away with huge wads of cash and big smiles on their faces .
" They were ringing their mates and telling them to get down quickly .
It makes up for all the bank charges , I guess .
I hope they do n't have to pay it back . "
The crowd began gathering at the store in Hull at around 5 pm on Tuesday and finally dispersed at 8 pm when the faulty ATM ran out of notes .
Scroll down for more ...
One man , who did not wish to be named , said : " I was driving past when I saw a huge queue at the cash machine .
" I parked up and learned that it was paying out double .
I joined the queue and when I finally got to the front , I drew out £ 200 , but it gave me £ 400 .
" The statement said I only drew out £ 200 .
I do n't know whether I will have to pay it back . "
Not everyone was so lucky .
Taxi driver David Mellors , 37 , pulled up too late and by the time he reached the front of the queue , the machine had run out of notes .
The father - of - seven said : " I was disappointed .
It was the ultimate buy one , get one free sale and I missed out . "
A spokesman for Sainsbury 's said the cash machine was run by a private company .
She declined to give the company 's name and said it was unable to comment .
Asked how much money Sainsbury 's believes was lost from the machine , she replied : " We do not know and we would not give out that kind of information . "
She added : " It ran out of money at 8 pm .
The police came to see the machine and the matter is under investigation . "
Most debit cards have a daily cash withdrawal limit of £ 300 - meaning that those lucky enough to use the haywire machine were able to take out a maximum of £ 600 .
Whether they will get to keep it is another matter .
The cash machine operator will have a record of all withdrawals made on the day .
It is then up to the discretion of the customers ' banks whether or not they seek to trace each one and attempt to reclaim any overpayment .
On similar previous occasions , some banks have chosen to write off the money rather than pursue a large number of claims .
And there may be many more potential claims to be chased after unconfirmed reports suggested that other machines were also hit by the same fault .
The Sainsbury 's spokesman said : " We think a number of cash machines outside supermarkets in Hull experienced similar problems . "

Here Matt Drudge goes again – a headline suggestive of something , but no one knows what .
It ’s just enough to get everyone talking .
And chances are this is true – not because everything Drudge reports is true , but because , as this does n’t fit into any Republican or Clinton agenda that I can think of , he has little reason to run it if it were n’t .
I ca n’t think of a reason Obama would be meeting with Bloomberg now – with the race so tight in Iowa and every moment precious – unless Bloomberg reached out in some way and wanted to discuss an endorsement .
This is only my speculation , but nothing else seems to fit .
I think the pairing discussed in the video is unlikely , but have to hand it to the guy for being prescient in seeing the possibility .
[ Yes , I know he threw out several names , but still . ]
UPDATE : CBSNews is now reporting what they call a “ mystery meeting ” and a “ coffee date ” .
The mayor has repeatedly said he has no plans to run but intends to inject himself into the national dialogue to try and influence the debate .
UPDATED AGAIN : Marc Ambinder of The Atlantic reports that Obama needs to be in Virginia by noon , so the talk will have to be short .
An Obama aide said the meeting was scheduled because of “ mutual interest ” and did not know whether the two had met before .
More coffee than ticket talk , though — and Obama had better be brief .
He ’s due to speak at the Democratic National Committee ’s winter meeting in Vienna , Virginia around noon .
Despite that bit of a downer from Ambinder – either Obama or Bloomberg must have something on the agenda .
And you can bet that “ something ” has to do with the 2008 election .
Bloomberg wants to “ inject himself into the national dialogue ” and affect the 2008 race , and he ’s now talking with one of the top candidates who is locked in a close primary .
It seems obvious to me that Bloomberg has a lot more to gain by supporting Obama than by supporting Hillary .
( And I do n’t see him endorsing anyone on the Republican side except McCain – sorry Ron Paul supporters . )
Thank you Drudge for causing me to lose sleep tonight trying to figure this out .
Sucks to be a political junkie these days .
So what ’s going on here ?
Anyone have an inside scoop ?
UPDATED , LAST TIME : The New York Daily News has the scoop on what went on at the breakfast :
Both men had two eggs over easy .
The mayor , who shook salt over his meal at least five times , drank coffee and had white toast .
The senator drank tea and had wheat toast .
And , this piece of information that might actually prove interesting :
Obama , not the billionaire mayor , picked up the $ 17.34 bill and left a $ 10 tip .
Why would this prove interesting ?
Because the general rule is that the person to request a meeting pays for it .

Mr Morales received backing from his leftist allies , including Hugo Chavez Leaders from four Latin American countries have rejected a controversial autonomy bid by a region of Bolivia .
The leaders of Bolivia , Venezuela , Nicaragua and the Cuban vice - president denounced the move as an illegal attempt to destabilise the country .
They were speaking after emergency talks in Venezuela 's capital , Caracas .
Bolivian opposition members have announced they will hold a referendum on 4 May to demand autonomy for the eastern province of Santa Cruz .
The four leaders said they will not recognise the fertile , gas - rich region as an autonomous entity .
Emergency meeting Speaking to the BBC earlier , Bolivian President Evo Morales had dismissed the vote as illegal .
They can't accept that a campesino , an Indian , can be president of Bolivia
Evo Morales
He accused the opposition - led by wealthy landowners - of refusing to accept an indigenous president .
The Caracas meeting had brought together some of Mr Morales 's closest left - wing allies - the presidents of Venezuela , Hugo Chavez , and Nicaragua , Daniel Ortega , as well as Cuba 's Vice - President , Carlos Lage .
Mr Chavez had called the emergency meeting , declaring that Bolivia was " on the point of exploding " .
Four of Bolivia 's nine provinces want greater autonomy .
All are in the less indigenous and wealthy eastern lowlands , home to most of the country 's oil and gas reserves .
Mr Morales says the push for autonomy is no more than an attempt by the rich minority to keep their long - held privileges , and to undermine his policies of helping the poor indigenous majority .
" They can't accept that a campesino , an Indian , can be president of Bolivia , " he told the BBC's Spanish - language news website , BBC Mundo .
" And if we look at history , we see that there have always been demands for federalism when the rich minority have lost control of central government , but then when they get it back again , they forget all about autonomy . "
Public resistance Mr Morales said the autonomy demands were creating division , but he did not expect them to lead to violence , adding he had faith in the " conscience of the Bolivian people " .
Mr Morales said his government could do " nothing " to prevent steps towards autonomy in Santa Cruz , but said the Bolivian public would resist them .
And he said the proposed new constitution would support a kind of autonomy .
" First comes the new constitution .
And through the new constitution the government will guarantee autonomy , " he said .
" But it will be autonomy for the people , not autonomy for the rich elite in Santa Cruz . "
The country had been due to hold a referendum next month on the draft constitution - which grants more rights to the indigenous majority - but it has been postponed by the National Electoral Court , which ruled that there was not enough time to prepare for the vote .
Opponents of the new constitution say it would unfairly privilege indigenous groups over the rest of the population .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
If you think you 're getting gouged at the pump - think again .
Like many other motorists , Daris Garnes thought she may be getting ripped off by her gas station when she filled up her Honda Accord in Brooklyn , N.Y. , on Wednesday , a day that gasoline prices hit a new record .
" When I pull up , I do n't even want to look at it sometimes , " said Garnes , a speech therapist , as she paid $ 3.59 for a gallon of unleaded .
That 's more than the nationwide gas average , but it was the cheapest choice she had .
Garnes said she figured the gas stations 's take was about $ 1.25 per gallon .
Another motorist , construction worker Thomas Anthony , guessed 65 cents .
But several other drivers estimated the station 's take was less than a dime , and it turned out they were right .
Abby Razaque , manager of the BP station where Garnes filled up , said the owner 's take was 8 cents per gallon , and that the lion 's share of the proceeds go to BP .
" I get a lot of complaints , " said Razaque .
" I tell them I have nothing to do with the price .
The [ oil companies ] are taking all the money that I am putting in my pocket . "
For every gallon of gas , about 72 % of the price goes to the producers of the crude oil from which it 's made , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration - producers like Chevron ( CVX , Fortune 500 ) , ConocoPhillips ( COP , Fortune 500 ) and BP ( BP ) .
Exxon Mobil ( XOM , Fortune 500 ) recently made history by reporting the highest annual profit ever for a U.S. company when it reported 2007 results .
Of the remaining price of a gallon of gas 13 % goes to taxes , 8 % goes to the refiners , and another 8 % goes to distribution and marketing , which includes gas stations .
" They 're not getting gouged by the gas stations , " said Peter Beutel , energy analyst for Cameron Hanover .
Beutel said that 90 % of all pumps are privately owned , and those owners make anywhere from 7 to 15 cents per gallon , so that a relatively petty expense , like a pump - and - run theft , can throw off their earnings for a whole day .
" Just because you 're seeing the street prices go up , does n't mean our profit has gone up , " said Tom McSweeney , a co-owner of a Shell station in Jericho , Long Island .
He said his former profit margin of 12 to 14 cents has dwindled to nothing .
" I bet the average person would say we were making 40 to 50 cents a gallon , " said McSweeney , adding , " I wish that were the case . "
Energy experts said that price gouging at the pump is a rare occurrence , largely because there is so much competitive pressure to keep the prices low .
" I do n't think it 's occurring at all , " said Sara Banaszak , senior economist at the American Petroleum Institute .
" The biggest factor in the price of gasoline is the price of crude oil . "
Where gas stations make their money is off retail goods like candy bars , tires and frozen burritos , as well as services , like oil changes and auto repairs .
" A lot of times , the gas stations are making more on the coffee and donuts than on the gasoline they 're selling , " said Robert Sinclair , Jr. , spokesman for AAA .
" Sometimes the profit on a gallon of gas for the retailer is less than a penny a gallon . "
Fadel Gheit , senior energy analyst for Oppenheimer , said retailers face even lower profit margins , as rising oil prices outpace gasoline .
" It does n't matter how high prices are at the pump , " said Gheit .
" If oil prices rise faster , you get margin squeeze . "

A series of updates to my earlier post about the plight of the An Yue Jiang , a Chinese cargo vessel currently searching for a suitable African port to offload a shipment of bullets , rockets , and mortars bound for Zimbabwe :
Der Spiegel reports that the ship ’s captain made haste to leave the port of Durban in South Africa last week , in part , because a court order had been issued that would have allowed Germany ’s state development bank , KfW , to seize the shipment in recovery of unpaid debts owed by Robert Mugabe ’s government .
The Associated Press says that U.S. intelligence agencies are tracking the ship and that American diplomats have requested the governments of South Africa , Mozambique , Namibia , and Angola to turn the ship away .
A senior State Department diplomat has been dispatched to Africa to underscore U.S. concern .
Agence France - Presse quotes a shipping agent as saying that the An Yue Jiang is now heading for Luanda , Angola .
But the BBC and the Associated Press report that the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the cargo ship ’s owners are considering recalling the vessel and canceling the delivery .
Meanwhile , Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai is calling for U.N. intervention to stem the gathering post-election violence in his country , where Mugabe ’s military is “ terrorizing the people . ”

The White House has released early excerpts of a speech President Bush will be giving at the Pentagon on Wednesday to mark the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the war in Iraq .
The president does acknowledge that the war came at a high price , but also continues to maintain that the U.S. is winning .
“ No one would argue that this war has not come at a high cost in lives and treasure , but those costs are necessary when we consider the cost of a strategic victory for our enemies in Iraq . ”
So the logic now is that we are fighting not to spread democracy , but to keep Iraq out of the hands of our enemies .
Bush also takes aim at critics of the war .
“ The successes we are seeing in Iraq are undeniable , yet some in Washington still call for retreat .
War critics can no longer credibly argue that we are losing in Iraq , so now they argue the war costs too much .
In recent months , we have heard exaggerated estimates of the costs of this war . ”
I think it is extremely debatable whether or not we are winning in Iraq .
Where is this progress that he will speak about ?
Is Iraq able to be responsible for its own security ?
Have basic services been restored to the country ?
It seems that President Bush has taken the position that if we are n’t losing , then we must be winning .
The president will repeat his standard mantra that if the U.S. leaves Iraq , al - Qaeda will take over the country .
“ If we were to allow our enemies to prevail in Iraq , the violence that is now declining would accelerate and Iraq could descend into chaos , ” Bush said .
“ Al - Qaida would regain its lost sanctuaries and establish new ones fomenting violence and terror that could spread beyond Iraq ’s borders , with serious consequences to the world economy . ”

But wait , the president takes his argument a step further .
He will lay out a scenario where al - Qaeda could take over Iraq , dominate the region , and you guessed it , attack America .
” Out of such chaos in Iraq , the terrorist movement could emerge emboldened with new recruits … new resources … and an even greater determination to dominate the region and harm America , ” Bush said in his remarks .
“ An emboldened al - Qaida with access to Iraq ’s oil resources could pursue its ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction to attack America and other free nations . ”
It must be pointed out that this is all speculation and fantasy on the part of the president .
There is no evidence that any of this would happen .
A bigger worry is the situation in Afghanistan , where the terrorists still are .
Speaking of Afghanistan , the president says that a rebellion against the ideology of Bin Laden is under way not there , but in Iraq .
“ In Iraq , we are witnessing the first large - scale Arab uprising against Osama bin Laden , his grim ideology , and his terror network .
And the significance of this development cannot be overstated . ”
This is interesting considering that Bin Laden has never been to Iraq , and his ideology was non-existent there until we decided to invade the country .
In short , we brought al - Qaeda with us when we invaded .
According to the president , we should keep focusing on the place where there terrorists are n’t , instead of putting more resources into where they are .
His speech seems to be full of the same rosy delusions that have been coming out of the White House since this war started .
At best , I think the U.S. will be able to maintain a stalemate in Iraq .
Victory is a very subjective term , and I would expect both Bush and McCain to continue to change the definition of victory to fit their political purposes .
No amount of delusional optimism can answer the question what did the United States really gain by going to war in Iraq ?
As we remember the dead and wounded caused by this president ’s decision , keep in mind that this is a question that no supporter of the war , including the president , has a good answer for .

I got caught cheating once .
Actually , not strictly cheating - I 'd split from my girlfriend at the time , but it was pretty soon after the break and there was still some doubt as to whether we were going to get back together or not , and then I met this girl , and ... long story short , my ex was in the flat we 'd shared together , picking up some of her things , when she spotted a pair of alien knickers on the radiator .
" Whose are these ? " she asked .
" They 're yours , " I said , shrugging nonchalantly , like it was obvious .
" I 'd recognise my own knickers , for Christ 's sake .
Just tell me whose they are . "
" Ohhhh , " I said , like it was all coming back to me , " remember I told you about that work trip I went on ?
Where we all went to Paris ?
Well , on the way back , a couple of people gave me their laundry , and I washed it , and it must 've all got jumbled up with mine . "
The trip to Paris was real .
The laundry story clearly was n't .
I 'd hoped the fact of the former would somehow obscure the lie of the latter .
It did n't work .
" Why did they give you their laundry ? "
" Huh ?
Oh .
They do n't have washing machines of their own , that 's all , " I shrugged again , chucking in a quick , " God , you 're so suspicious ! " for good measure .
At which point she started crying .
In desperation , I 'd adopted a " Dead Parrot Defence " - named after Michael Palin 's lying shopkeeper in the famous Monty Python sketch .
The Dead Parrot Defender is hoping that if they lie long and hard enough , reality itself will bend to accommodate them .
Well , duh .
It does n't pan out that way , genius .
A classic Dead Parrot Defence consists of an overtly preposterous central premise cooked up in the heat of the moment ( bonus points if it ignores a few well - known laws of nature ) , coupled with an obstinate , huffy denial of the facts .
A few years ago , while trying to hide a smoking habit from a ( different ) girlfriend , I accidentally dropped a lighter on the bedroom floor .
It rolled past her .
She stared at it .
And I indignantly claimed it had fallen through the ceiling , from the flat upstairs .
Until recently , Dead Parrot Defences have been the farcical preserve of adulterers hiding in cupboards and schoolkids whose dog ate their homework .
But now things are getting serious .
Recently , a spate of ridiculous alibis put forward by desperate murderers in high - profile cases has raised the art of the Dead Parrot Defence to awful , heartbreaking heights .
First , 37 - year - old Mark Dixie confessed to having sex with teenage model Sally Anne Bowman 's corpse , but denied being her killer .
" All I saw was a pair of legs , " he explained , " and I took advantage of her ... I thought she 'd passed out drunk or fallen . "
In fact , she 'd been stabbed seven times - although he claimed not to have noticed that .
He only realised she was dead , he said , when she failed to react to him biting her repeatedly on the face and neck .
And last week , 27 - year - old Karl Taylor denied murdering 31 - year - old businesswoman Kate Beagley during a first date .
His version of events ran as follows .
Earlier that day , while in a " suicidal and despondent " mood , he 'd borrowed a carving knife from a friend , hidden it up his sleeve and forgotten about it .
That evening , he and Beagley were sitting on a bench drinking wine .
The knife fell from his sleeve ; he picked it up and put it on the seat .
Moments later , while he was distracted by a phone call , she picked up the knife and stabbed herself 31 times in the face , neck and throat .
When the prosecutor handed Taylor a " knife " made of rolled - up paper and asked him to demonstrate precisely how Beagley took her own life , Taylor initially refused , saying he was n't " in an emotionally fit state to do that " , until the judge ordered him to do as he was told .
When asked how long the incident had lasted , he replied " minutes " .
" That 's a very long time , " noted the prosecutor , before asking why Taylor - a fitness instructor - had n't attempted to stop her .
The exchange that followed read like excerpts from a tasteless comic sketch .
" What am I going to do , use my martial arts to get the knife out of her hand ? " complained Taylor .
" Why not ? " asked the prosecutor .
" But it was an unanticipated situation , " Taylor protested .
" How was I going to take the knife out of her hand ?
What am I going to do , kick her unconscious ?
Your ideas are so outlandish . "
" What 's outlandish about suggesting you try to save her life ? "
" I 've already told you what I did .
I stepped forward and stuck my hand out .
It was an awkward situation to be in . "
" It was an awkward situation to be in " would be a great final line if this was a sketch , not a real - life murder .
By inadvertently turning their trials into jet - black farces , Dixie and Taylor added insult to injury .
That 's the trouble with the Dead Parrot Defence : it makes things worse .
It hurts more .
In which case , perhaps the punishment should fit the crime .
Squeeze them into a grotesquely undersized cell and when they complain , shrug and say , " Sorry , the building 's shrinking . "
Feed them nothing but gravel on toast , while claiming it 's the latest gourmet trend .
Offer them no -strings lifelong parole , only to withdraw it at the last minute because a dog ate the concept of liberty .
Let them end their days as a comic victim , trapped within a prison of absurdist lazy lies .
Yep .
That 'll do it .

Snow prefers Iranians to U.S. college professors
On the one hand , I realize that American college professors , in general , are featured prominently on the list of conservative boogeymen .
They ’re all a bunch of ivory - tower eggheads , we ’re told , who were drug - addled hippies in the 1960s .
Worse , they ’re poisoning the minds of our youths , the argument goes , by teaching college students a bunch of liberal , sometimes socialist , claptrap .
On the other hand , I also realize that conservative talking points emphasize the pro-American inclinations of the Iranian population .
Part of this is to help justify a military confrontation — we can launch attacks without fear of inflaming the Iranian population because , at heart , they all really like us .
( Indeed , we ’d be “ greeted as liberators . ” )
But leave it to former White House press secretary Tony Snow to link these two disparate points nicely last week .
( via the Washington Times )
Tony Snow , former press Secretary to President Bush and Fox news anchor , spoke to the Academy of Leadership & Liberty at Oklahoma Christian University last week .
The winsome and articulate Snow charmed his audience with wit : “ The average Iranian is more Pro-American than virtually any college faculty in this country . ”
And with serious talk about the war on terror and “ the second war in this country , the war on God . ”
Seriously ?
This is so dumb , I ’m almost surprised Snow would make the comments out loud , in public .
He added these words of wisdom :
“ ( These ) Times demand leadership .
A leader is someone who has a compelling vision of a better world .
Courage , inspiration to go for it and use their creativity and freedom .
Character separates a leader from a demagogue . ” [… ]
Snow also said he loved being on a stage where he could say the word “ God . ”
First , I ’d say Snow is bona fide expert on demagoguery , given his tenure at the Bush White House .
Second , I ’m curious where , exactly , Snow is prohibited from mentioning the word “ God . ”
He used it from his White House podium with some frequency , and as far as I can tell , never faced any censorship .
Maybe
Snow got confused — I suspect the only place he might have trouble talking about his faith is in Iran .
Update : Apparently , Faiz and I were writing the same post at the same time , but his adds some additional insights on Snow ’s perception of a “ war on God . ”
Among the major culprits here are inefficient appliances .
According to the United States Department of Energy , a gas burner delivers only 35 to 40 percent of its heat energy to the pan ; a standard electrical element conveys about 70 percent .
Anyone thinking about kitchen renovation should know that induction cooktops , which generate heat directly within the pan itself , are around 90 percent efficient .
They can out - cook big - B.T.U. gas burners , work faster , do n’t heat up the whole kitchen , and are becoming more common in restaurant kitchens .
Maximizing the transfer of heat from burner to pot produces better food .
In deep frying , the faster the burner can bring the oil temperature back up after the food is added , the quicker the food cooks and the less oil it absorbs .
In boiling green vegetables , a fast recovery time means better retention of vibrant color and vitamins .
No matter how efficient an appliance is , the cook can help simply by covering pots and pans with their lids .
Some of the heat that enters through the bottom of the pot exits through the top , but a lid prevents much of it from escaping into the air .
This is especially true when you ’re bringing a pot of water to the boil .
With the lid on , it will start bubbling in as little as half the time .
Turning water into steam takes a lot of energy , and every molecule that flies away from the water surface takes all that energy with it into the air .
Prevent its escape , and the energy stays with the pot to heat the rest of the water .
Once a liquid starts to boil and is turning to steam throughout the pot  the bubbles of a boil are bubbles of water vapor  nearly all the energy from the burner is going into steam production .
The temperature of the water itself remains steady at the boiling point , no matter how high the flame is underneath it .
So turn the burner down .
A gentle boil is just as hot as a furious one .
Cooking does n’t get much more straightforward than boiling and steaming vegetables , grains , and the like .
But sometimes it takes forever , which either delays dinner or results in crunchy beans and diners suffering for it later .
And you ca n’t speed the process by raising the heat .
In fact it ’s easy to save loads of time and energy and potential discomfort with grains , dry beans and lentils , and even pasta .
But it requires a little thinking ahead .
It turns out that the most time - consuming part of the process is not the movement of boiling heat to the center of each small bean or noodle , which takes only a few minutes , but the movement of moisture , which can take hours .
Grains and dry legumes therefore cook much faster if they have been soaked .
However heretical it may sound to soak dried pasta , doing so can cut its cooking time by two - thirds  and eliminates the problem of dry noodles getting stuck to each other as they slide into the pot .
The trickiest foods to heat just right are meats and fish .
The problem is that we want to heat the center of the piece to 130 or 140 degrees , but we often want a browned , tasty crust on the surface , and that requires 400 degrees .
Have you ever been accused of faking badly ?
Today , a WSJ front - pager looks at a psychology test , used increasingly by defendants in personal injury lawsuits , called the Fake Bad Scale .
In hundreds of cases , says the story , expert witnesses have testified that the test provided evidence that plaintiffs were lying about their injuries .
The test gained credibility recently after being endorsed by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory .
But now psychologists and plaintiffs ' lawyers claim that the Fake Bad Scale identifies ...
Gaming is a visual medium , and it 's amazing to think how much information we have to take in almost instantly to play games .
Especially in action games , we need to be able to quickly take notice of subtle movements and the state of numerous dials and displays that show us how well or poorly we 're doing in the game .
To do that , we have to be able to absorb a large amount of color information .
What does that soldier 's uniform look like ?
Is that a red or green mark above an alien 's head ?
Is he on my side , or is he an enemy ?
Now imagine that much of this crucial information was removed from a game ; the challenge of dealing with situational awareness would increase very quickly .
That challenge is precisely the one faced by people who are colorblind , which is a rather common genetic problem .
A reader named Tim McDaniel contacted us about this matter , and his examples were thought - provoking .
" One specific gaming example that always frustrates me is Battlefield 2142 .
I love the game , but the flags of the two teams are not distinct enough on the HUD , at least to me .
I honestly can't tell you what color they are .
Red , green , yellow , brown ? " he told Ars .
" I usually end up trying to distinguish them by brightness because one looks slightly brighter to me , but that is so slight it 's still tough . "
Your eye differentiates color by using three sets of cones that register red , green , and blue .
When one or multiple sets of cones become less sensitive , you begin to have problems telling certain colors apart .
Some people can go through their entire life not knowing there is anything wrong with their eyes , as a specialized visual exam is needed to test for specific forms of colorblindness .
Others have deficiencies so pronounced they have to rely on the position of the active light at traffic signals instead of being able to tell the difference between red and green at a glance .
There are many different forms of color - blindness , but the most common involves difficulty distinguishing shades of red and green ( plus related colors ) .
Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo as seen by someone with normal eyes and
by someone with Deuteranopia ( a red - green color deficit )
These colors often convey critical information in games .
" In many first - person shooters , you 'll come across closed doors with lights on the doors that indicate if they are locked or not .
These are usually red or green , and I often can't tell the difference .
This is a minor annoyance usually , but if it 's the difference between life and death , frustrating , " McDaniel told us .
" Countless puzzle games that rely on matching colors are unplayable to various degrees .
Even Hexic , a great game which gets it mostly right in letting you turn on shapes to augment the colors , still has the deadly ' bomb ' tiles that only differ in color . "
He 's not alone , either .
While studies do n't agree on specific numbers , color blindness affects somewhere between four and eight percent of the male population .
Inheritance of red - green colorblindness is linked to the X - chromosome , so women are much less at risk than men .
Mario and Luigi are nearly indistinguishable to someone with Deuteranopia in New Super Mario Brothers multiplayer
What can developers do ?
The fixes are relatively simple to implement .
Any time color - specific information is used as a game mechanic , give multiple options for those colors .
A simple shift to different hues , or even a drastic increase in contrast between two colors would make these issues go away for color blind individuals .
Patterns and shapes can also be used to great effect ; a flag with wide stripes across it would be fix the issues people experience in games like Battlefield 2142 .
Even though there are simple solutions to a problem that affects a large number of gamers , it 's usually not on the " short list " of concerns , as McDaniel points out .
He should know , he works on video games himself .
" I work at Aspyr , and was one of the
Engineers on the Windows port of Guitar Hero III .
In Guitar Hero , the notes are
colored , but I never used the colors , relying only on position , even
when first learning to play .
Does anyone use the colors ? " he asked , semi-rhetorically .
" I would n't
know . "
Paris , je t'aime is about the plurality of cinema in one mythic location : Paris , the City of Love .
Twenty filmmakers have five minutes each ; the audience must weave a single narrative out of twenty moments .
The 20 moments are fused by transitional interstitial sequences and also via the introduction and epilogue .
Each transition begins with the last shot of the previous film and ends with the first shot of the following film , extending the enchantment and the emotion of the previous segment , preparing the audience for a surprise , and providing a cohesive atmosphere .
There 's a reappearing mysterious character who is a witness to the Parisian life .
A common theme of Paris and love fuses all .

Two - Faced Baby Triggers Shock and Awe Some think baby , born with two faces , is a reincarnation of a god .
SAINI , India , April 1 , 2008  --
Ask anyone along the dusty , pothole - filled road heading to the tiny village of Saini , and they 'll know who she is .
The one with four eyes .
The one with two mouths .
The one with two heads .
They are not ashamed of the extraordinary looking little girl , the villagers who live near her , the young parents , the overprotective local doctor .
That 's because while she may only be 2 ½ weeks old , she is far more famous than any resident of this part of the country has ever been .
She is famous because she was born with a condition known as facial duplication .
She has one body and two faces .
" At first I was a little bit afraid , " Vinod Kumar Singh , the 24 - year - old father of the girl who still does not have a name , told ABC News .
" But then I accepted whatever God gives . "
In this case , God has given what many in this rural part of India consider a reincarnation of Ganesh , the Hindu God who is half person and half elephant .
At first , hundreds of locals came to Saini to touch the girl 's feet , dance at her bedside and offer the family money , thinking she was as divine a person as they would ever see .
" People from corner to corner from all India and all abroad come here to take the knowledge about this child , " said Harsharan Singh , the village math teacher .
" It 's a gift of God … Some people say she is like a goddess .
They call the baby a face of a goddess . "
Her two faces and the single dimple on their shared cheek are as placid as any baby 's .
She is the first child of a farming family , one of about 100 people living in a village 40 miles outside New Delhi .
Here , the average income is less than $ 2 a day , and the locals either work the field or support those who work the field in any way they can .
During a recent visit by ABC News , villagers fanned the baby , swatting dozens of flies away so she could sleep .
The village , like so many in India , is modest .
There is no electricity , there are no toilets , and there is no technology .
The parents did not know that anything was wrong with their daughter until she was born .
Tens of millions of pregnant women in rural India do not receive prenatal care .
" They 're not aware enough that they should come in for treatment , " said Dr. M. Ashmosd , the resident medical officer of nearby Saifi Hospital , where the girl was born .
Ashmosd was part of the team that delivered her vaginally .
Still , he does not know the details of the baby 's condition because the parents have not agreed to let the hospital perform a CT scan or an MRI on her head .
" I 've told them we 're ready to do the CT scan for free .
But they have ignored me , " he told ABC News .
Experts in the United States who have performed surgeries on children with similar conditions say they can't know what the baby 's prognosis will be without scans .
" A brain MRI would be illuminating , to say the least .
Without it we only can presume about what could be possible or what her quality of life would be with or without reconstructive surgery , " Jorge Lazareff , the director of pediatric neurosurgery at UCLA Hospital in Los Angeles , told ABC News .
The parents and the villagers have turned inward .
Visited by a dozen media outlets , they at first refused to allow an ABC News team to ask any questions or shoot any video , accusing reporters of " making stories for their own profit . "
Eventually , they relented , but the local doctor refused to allow the mother to speak and interrupted an interview with the father .
" She is very normal , " Dr. Brigdal Nagar yelled , pointing at an ABC News reporter and shoving Vinod Singh aside .
" We do n't need the media here .
She 's not an abnormal baby .
It 's just that she has two faces .
And she 's living a very normal life .
And if she dies in the future , it 's as God wishes . "
Villagers have tried to make her life as normal as they can .
The visitors who welcomed the baby 's birth are no longer coming around .
She is surrounded by only her family and their friends .
But perhaps she is too protected .
Because the parents wo n't agree to allow the hospital to perform a CT scan , there is no way to know exactly what she is suffering from , no way to know if her life is in danger .
In 2004 , a Dominican baby was born with a second head that was attached only to the first head , not the rest of her body .
That condition , in which the second head is the product of a conjoined twin that stops developing in the womb , is known as craniopagus parasiticus .
Surgery to remove the parastic twin killed the baby .
In 2005 , an Egyptian woman named Naglaa Mohamed gave birth to Manar , who had two heads but also the remnants of an unformed twin 's torso attached to her abdomen .
Her surgery was successful , and eventually she appeared on the " Oprah Winfrey " show .
But for the Indian baby , there is no way to tell whether she has two spinal columns , whether there are multiple internal organs , or whether she will survive until the CT scan is completed .
" She 's normal right now , " Dr. Brigdal said .
" But in the future she might face problems . "
Lazareff was slightly more optimistic , writing by e-mail that " I presume that there is no reason for her not [ to ] live a long life .
Stress on presume . "
As for the parents , they are a bit overwhelmed by all the attention .
They are overwhelmed by the terrifying thought that they have to raise a child who is so visibly different .
" She 's just a simple baby , " Vinod Singh says , before admitting with a touch of sadness , " she 's not well . "
If she survives , despite the odds , she might match her reputation .
" If everything below the neck is fine , and she could keep her head up , then she could walk around and live , " said Henry Kawamoto , a Los Angeles - based specialist in facial plastic surgery .
" And if she did that , she really would be a goddess . "
RubyFlow : A New Ruby News Site
By Peter Cooper
RubyFlow is a new Ruby news site developed by ... me over the last couple of days .
It will suit developers looking more for a " filtered firehose " of Ruby news .
RubyFlow will be faster , quicker and more raw than Ruby Inside .
Ruby Inside will continue with 1 - 2 " you gotta see this ! " posts per day ( max ) but RubyFlow will be the place to go for immediacy and volume .
Another big difference is that anyone can post to RubyFlow .
You do n't need to sign up to post although you 'll be CAPTCHAed and suffer rel= " nofollow " on your links if you do n't ( to prevent spam ) .
RubyFlow was developed because I get a lot of leads and see a lot of interesting Ruby stuff that either repeats something I recently posted about on Ruby Inside already , which is too minor , or which is too niche for the general Ruby Inside audience .
RubyFlow will give a way for news about new releases of libraries , interesting blog posts , and niche news to be published .
I 'll also be able to use RubyFlow as a " tips " site and base Ruby Inside posts on the things I see there .. so if you want future exposure on Ruby Inside , get posting and get noticed !
The entire site and the style posts is heavily influenced by MetaFilter , a very old school community weblog .
Basically , it 'll be interesting Ruby stuff , one to many links per post , and nice concise explanations .
Social bookmarking sites like del.icio.us and Reddit fall down in that you usually only get to read the title of a link ( which is useless in many cases ) whereas on RubyFlow and MetaFilter links are explained with a small blurb that puts them into context .
Keep this in mind if you post , otherwise the style police might tweak your post to fit .

So , what ’s the bigger danger to the American public : Al - Qaeda , or compact fluorescent light bulbs ( CFLs ) ?
If you follow the conservative punditry , online or off , it ’s a tough call .
Today ’s ( April 24 ) “ Mallard Fillmore ” comic strip is just the latest example of conservatives taking aim at these energy - saving bulbs , focusing primarily on the fact that CFLs contain mercury .
So , for Mallard Fillmore author Bruce Tinsley , Thomas Sowell , Rush Limbaugh ( whose content is not publicly available ) and the crowd at WorldNetDaily , let ’s review the facts :
So , why all the fuss ?
You do n’t have to read very far into any of the above - linked examples to realize that publications like WND , and commentators like Milloy , Sowell , and Tinsley have a political agenda partly based in a dislike / distrust of environmentalism , and partly based in reaction to legislation banning the use of incandescents .
In other words , the treehuggers are trying to take away your freedom as consumers … and undermine the free market … and toss us all into the shackles of godless communism …
What I find really interesting about this whole “ debate ” is that concern for the average person ’s economic interest tends to go out the window with these pundits .
Yep , these defenders of the “ common man ” never seem to mention that CFLs use 75 % less energy than incandescents , and last up to ten times longer .
The savings can be pretty significant .
Ultimately , are n’t these “ conservatives ” undermining the very market forces they claim to support ?
When I was in Kansas City a little over a week ago , I heard Daniel Wallach , director of Greensburg GreenTown , ask a provocative question : “ When did the environment become a political issue ? ”
One could ask that about CFLs … is this really something we should be arguing about ?
Use a CFL … or the terrorists win !
Yeah , I like that …

At a time when parts of the world are facing food riots , Big Agriculture is dealing with a different sort of challenge : huge profits .
On Tuesday , grain - processing giant Archer - Daniels - Midland Co. said its fiscal third - quarter profits jumped 42 % , including a sevenfold increase in net income in its unit that stores , transports and trades grains such as wheat and corn , as well as soybeans .

The Rocket Racing League announced this week that their first Exhibition Race would take place at the famed Oshkosh AirVenture EAA Airshow in Wisconsin August 1 - 2 .
Two racers will be on the course which combines the thrill of motorsports with the power of rocket engines in flight .
The Rocket Racing League will also hold Exhibition Races this year at the Reno Air Races , at Aviation Nation ( also in Nevada ) , and at the X Prize Cup in Las Cruces , New Mexico .
Teams can also now opt for rocket engines provided by Doom and Quake creator and president of Armadillo Aerospace , John Carmack .
The engines will run on liquid oxygen ( LOX ) and ethanol and include a special dose of salt water to make the rocket engines flare all the more visible from the ground ( think colored smoke from an aerobatic plane ) .
I can't wait to see one in person .
The two planes will race around a two lap course in the sky using heads up displays to see the virtual gates in the sky they must fly through at each checkpoint .
Over 700,000 people are expected to watch the races at Oshkosh alone .
The Rocket Racing League was create in 2005 by X Prize Chairman Peter Diamandis and two time Indianapolis 500 winning team partner Granger Whitelaw .
There are six teams in the league including former U.S. Navy pilots and former Air Force pilots and the league itself boasts former Space Shuttle Commander Rick Searfoss as a pilot .
The goal ?
" To advance the technology and increase the publics awareness of space travel . "
Having a couple dozen more people with extensive day in and day out knowledge of rocket engine design , maintenance , and operation would probably do a lot for aerospace .
That is the kind of experience base we are going to need to be a space faring civilization .
Then maybe all those video games you have been playing will pay off ...

DCCC to challenge Freedom 's Watch status as a non-profit
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is filing a complaint with the IRS today challenging the conservative group Freedom 's Watch status as a non-profit .
The DCCC says the group has violated its non-profit status by running attack ads in a Louisiana special election targeting Democratic candidate Don Cazayoux .
“ The DCCC is asking the IRS to hold Freedom ’s Watch accountable for its illegal election ads that are being used to mislead voters in LA - 06 , ” said Brian Wolff , the DCCC 's executive director .
“ Freedom ’s Watch is trying to avoid paying taxes by claiming to be tax exempt , while running campaign ads that benefit a Republican candidate and the NRCC .
Freedom ’s Watch illegal activity is quickly adding to Tom Cole and the NRCC ’s many problems . ”
In a letter to the IRS , Wolff asked the agency to reclassify Freedom 's Watch , which includes several former officials from the National Republican Congressional Committee , as a 527 organization and to as penalize the group for improperly claiming non-profit status .
501 ( c ) 4s and other non-profits do not have to publicly have to publicly disclose their donors , while 527s must report them to the IRS , which becomes public information .
" As a result , Freedom 's Watch is not described under section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) of the Internal Revenue Code , but under section 527 , as an organization ' organized and operated primarily for the purpose of directly or indirectly accepting contributions or making expenditures , or both , for . . . the function of influencing or attempting to influence the selection , nomination , election , or appointment of any individual to any Federal , State , or local public office , '" Wolff told the IRS .
" Freedom 's Watch has deliberately chosen to organize under section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) instead of section 527 so that it may hide its donors from public scrutiny .
By operating as a section 527 organization , however , it has willfully and flagrantly violated the registration and reporting requirements required of political organizations .
Thus , it should be subject to the statutory penalty , which is thirty - five percent of each contribution not disclosed , and thirty - five percent of each expenditure not disclosed . "
Update - Freedom's
Watch has now formally replied to the DCCC letter to the IRS .
This statement is from Ed Patru , Freedom 's Watch vice president for communications :
“ The DCCC seems to have an aversion to a robust public policy debate on the important issues of the day .
But given the positions on the issues they 're forced to defend , I guess it's to be expected that they 'd try to muzzle Freedom 's Watch 's First Amendment rights .
“ Don Cazayoux has a record of voting for higher taxes and opposing the display of ‘ In God We Trust ’ in public schools .
He supports expensive big government healthcare schemes , even if those schemes provide benefits to illegal aliens .
We disagree with Cazayoux ’s public policy positions , and we have a Constitutional right to engage in the public policy debates , as was affirmed by the Supreme Court last summer .
“ If the DCCC disagrees with our mainstream positions , they should put aside their tactics of intimidation and suppression and join us in focusing on the issues . ”

Jimmy Wales has faced criticism over direction of organisation Wikipedia started as a hobby with noble aims and in just six short years has turned into a global brand headed by a founder who is both a guiding light for devotees and a lightning rod for critics .
While Wikipedia goes from milestone to milestone in its quest to provide every person with a free encyclopaedia , Jimmy Wales 's efforts to shift the organisation towards a more business like approach has put him firmly back in the firing line .
Over the last few months the charismatic leader has been lambasted for his use of expenses , his love of the limelight , his seemingly partial editing on some Wikipedia postings and his private life .
Fallout over the latter lead to headlines such as " Wiki Quickie " and gossip sites having a field day when his ex auctioned Mr Wales 's clothes on eBay .
Personal attacks aside , Mr Wales has also been accused of damaging the core fabric of the organisation by moving to Silicon Valley , cosying up to venture capitalists , and appointing an executive director .
While all this would be in the normal course of things for most charities trying to stay afloat , in the world of the Wiki community there is concern about the organisation becoming too corporate and reliant on venture capitalists .
Keeping the faith Getting as wide an audience for the encyclopaedia remains the focus
At the new offices in San Francisco , Mr Wales is surrounded by a staff of just 16 people .
The breeze block interior is strewn with white boards and photos of some of the 75,000 people who write , edit and police Wikipedia 's millions of entries .
The personal attacks are shrugged off with a certain level of nonchalance .
" Most people see through it for what it is .
My spending habits are audited .
There are no jets or Porches .
It 's sort of silly you know . "
When it comes to talking about the future direction of the organisation , Jimmy is more animated .
He says putting it on a more professional footing is about ensuring a stable future for Wikipedia .
The business relies mostly on small donations averaging $ 30 from its tens of thousands of supporters .
It recently won a $ 3 m grant from the Sloan Foundation .
" We are really focusing on beefing up the infrastructure of the foundation itself and where we go from here .
The core values of my work are about getting a free encyclopaedia of good quality into the hands of every single person on the planet .
It 's a huge public project and I just have to ignore what people say about me . "
From little acorns I was just a guy sitting home in my pyjamas playing on the internet like everybody else but I did feel it was a big important idea
Jimmy Wales , Wikipedia Today Wikipedia is one of the world 's largest reference websites attracting nearly 700 million visitors a year .
It is written in more than 250 languages with over 2.3 million articles in its English edition .
With a degree of modesty Jimmy concedes " I thought if we are really successful we might make the top one hundred websites and now we are like number eight on the internet and much bigger than I would have ever thought . "
The speed of growth meant the organisation was more than due a degree of business direction says Executive Director Sue Gardner .
" When I came to the organisation I was surprised to find there was no one whose job it was to do fund raising and that is unheard of for a non profit .
And it 's a remarkable tribute that this could be as successful as it is with literally not one person charged with going out and looking for money to keep it all going . "
Wikipedia is now actively looking for a full time fund raiser and is unabashed about courting vac's for their contributions despite concern from the Wiki community .
" For the first time we are actively going out and cultivating people and asking them for money .
The terms are the same as they have always been .
It does n't get you a voice at the table particularly though if you have interesting things to say we are interested to hear them . "
Ms Gardner says they are also looking at cashing in on the Wikipedia brand and are open to suggestions some of which have included TV programmes and a board game .
" Our bottom line is that if it helps the mission of free knowledge that 's a big step up for an idea .
If is hurts it , it 's a deal breaker , but of course there is a whole world in between . "
Future vision With Wikipedia just recently notching up its ten millionth page article Jimmy says he always knew he would do something that would make a difference .
" I was just a guy sitting home in my pyjamas playing on the internet like everybody else but I did feel it was a big important idea .
I always had this feeling that you 're here so you might as well do something useful . "
Proof of that came on a recent trip to India where Jimmy says he met a young man in the streets of Delhi who used Wikipedia to pass his 11th grade exam .
" Wow , that 's like really something .
Here I am standing in a street with mud and a cow and we had touched his life in a positive way .
That was pretty cool . "

What are these ?
Dennis Kucinich deserves the praise and gratitude of all Americans who want our government to promote peace and justice at home and abroad .
On all the issues , Dennis took brave , honest positions that reflect his great courage and decency .
While Clinton and Obama continued to support funding the Iraq war , Dennis said the war was simply WRONG and worked to cut off funds and remove our troops before more Americans died in vain .
While many of his fellow Democrats hope the Bush administration just quietly fades away , Dennis wants to impeach Dick Cheney right now and expose his high crimes before the American public .
We do n't need more Congressional hearings on Cheney , the record is clear .
It 's time for the Democrats to follow Dennis ' lead and make Cheney an ignominious example to future leaders who contemplate lying to the public to get us into another war .
While Clinton , Obama and Edwards claim their " morality " prevents them from supporting gay marriage , Dennis takes the truly moral position : All Americans deserve the right to marry regardless of their sexual orientation .
Anything less than full marriage equality is immoral discrimination !
I congratulate Dennis for his brave campaign and I wish him great success in his congressional race .
I will do anything I can to see him reelected because we need his stalwart voice challenging his fellow congressmen and fighting for the America that he and I both believe is possible .
I promise to stay in the presidential race and continue promoting our shared ideals so that one day our party and our government will be as committed to peace and justice as Dennis Kucinich .

This kind of thing is one reason I 'm glad he 's still in the race :
In Washington today , telecom lobbyists have launched a full - court press to win retroactive immunity for their illegal eavesdropping on American citizens .
Granting retroactive immunity will let corporate law - breakers off the hook and hamstring efforts to learn the truth about Bush 's illegal spying program .
It 's time for Senate Democrats to show a little backbone and stand up to George W. Bush and the corporate lobbyists .
They should do everything in their power -- including joining Senator Dodd 's efforts to filibuster this legislation -- to stop retroactive immunity .
The Constitution should not be for sale at any price .
I 'll add that I think Edwards is right to see as largely an issue of " corporate lobbyists " with the Democrats using their habitual spinelessness on national security issues as a pretext for the more tawdry business of simply handing out favors to telecom companies .
But if the congress -- an opposition party led congress responding to a discovery that pierced a years - long executive branch coverup -- accepts this " it 's not a crime if the president asks you to do it " theory of legal liability we may as well not have any laws at all .

I
’m sure you ’ve all heard the old wise tale about drinking a gallon of milk .
Right ?
Well , rumor has it that it is physically impossible to drink a gallon of whole milk in one hour .
I know what you ’re thinking , “ Dude !
I drink a gallon of beer in an hour every Saturday night !
I can totally drink the milk ! ”
Hey , guess what ?
You can ’t .
You will barf everywhere like a giant , gross baby and nobody will like you .
Well , people might still like you , but only if you do n't spew all over them ( never guaranteed ) .
Why do I know this ?
Been there , done that .
I was just like you : young , naïve , and eager to show off my milk - guzzling skills .
You see , I am an extreme milk drinker ( still am , even after the incidents I will soon explain to you ) , and I figured that I probably drink a gallon a day anyway , so why not ?
ATTEMPT #1 : Hard and Fast
It was a random summer night and I was bored out of my mind .
I ended up visiting a friend of mine at the fudge store where she worked ( yeah , she packed fudge , eat it up losers ) and we started discussing the milk rumor .
I immediately decided that I was the chosen one , and that only I could carry out this task .
Being a little overzealous , I thought the best way to drink it would be as quickly as possible , so I immediately started downing glass after glass after glass .
And then you explode .
All the food you ate that day , covered in lumpy , white shit .
It ’s like that scene in Poltergeist where they all go into that vortex to get Carol Anne and they come out covered in weird slime shit .
That ’s what your puke looks like , get out your camera phones .
At first the milk was tasty .
Twenty minutes into my adventure it became harder and harder to drink .
For example , you know how when you ’re drinking a bucket of semen and it ’s all weird tasting and thick ?
No ?
… Well , it was like that .
You can honestly feel your stomach top off like the handle on a gas pump .
There ’s just no more room .
ATTEMPT # 2 : Slow and Steady
I used to work at Ben & Jerry ’s and one day it was downpouring , so we did n’t have many customers .
For some reason only Satan and a dairy farmer somewhere have the answer to , I had the bright idea of drinking a gallon of milk again .
I tried to analyze why I failed last time .
Maybe I drank it too quickly .
Maybe I had eaten too much beforehand .
Maybe I just was n’t driven enough to get the job done .
My co-workers and I decided this time I should pace myself and skip dinner so I would be completely empty .
This time I began to drink and things seemed to be go a little better than before .
I polished off the first three quarters off like a prize - winning gutter whore .
With a quarter of the gallon left , I really thought I would make it .
And then the puke came .
Again , and again , and again ( and again , the remix ) .
Advantage to second attempt :
So much puke you wo n't have to stay late at your shitty job to help close the store .
Disadvantage to second attempt : Wading in your own Poltergeist puke , combined with a disappointment you can feel deep down in your soul bowels .
ATTEMPT # 3 : The Day Jesus Stole My Stomach Lining and Beat Me To Death With It
I was cruising around in my parent ’s minivan with a few friends , getting high ( on LIFE , stupid stoner asshole ) when one of my pals brought up the milk thing .
I really did n’t want to do it again , but I was weak and we were bored .
Peer pressure is a horrible piece of shit and it probably never tried to drink a gallon of milk before , let alone endure the humiliation of driving around in its parent 's minivan .
Anyway , we got the milk and started driving around again .
This time I did n’t have it in me .
I was fresh off a full dinner , my heart and stomach were n't in it , and I knew what the end result would be .
Sure enough , Mr. Vomit Face paid me a visit again .
However , right before I puked , I realized we were in the neighborhood of an ex-lover ( ex - lover is the classier term for “ a kid who used to like to get head and give nothing in return ” — I ’m not bitter ) of mine .
In my milky haze , I puked into an empty Burger King cup lying in my backseat and chucked the cup out the window and onto his front steps .
It was one of my finer moments and I often think about it when wondering why I do n’t have a boyfriend .
Still want to drink a gallon of milk ?
Actually , you probably do , fuck face .
Tell the toilet I say hi—we have n’t had a decent conversation since I had one too many shots of tequila last month .
Be sure to let me know if you succeed in drinking the gallon of milk without puking , and I promise I will send you a $ 50 gift certificate to the Fucking Liar Store .
I hear they 're having a sale on “ cottage cheese . ”
China 's Communist Party has launched a two - month political education campaign in Tibet 's restive capital Lhasa to attack pro-independence sentiment and support for the Dalai Lama .
China has blamed the unrest across Tibetan areas on a small " clique " of the Dalai Lama pressing for independence and seeking to upset Beijing 's preparations for the 2008 Olympics .
Over a month has passed since monk - led protests against government control gave way to deadly anti-Chinese rioting in Lhasa on March 14 , but security forces have wrestled with continued unrest there and across other Tibetan areas , and blamed it on the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader .
In a bid to reinforce control over Lhasa , Party authorities have launched an education drive focused on officials and Party members , the official Tibet Daily reported .
The campaign to " fight separatism , protect stability and promote development " would focus on " unifying the thinking and cohesive strength of officials and the masses , deepening the struggle against separatism , and counter - attacking the separatist plots of the Dalai clique , " the newspaper said .
Party members and officials would be assessed on their " performance " in the two - month drive , which will include television programs and organised denunciation sessions .
The Dalai Lama has denounced violence and said he supports Beijing holding the Games in August , but also accused Beijing of perpetrating possible " cultural genocide " in Tibet .
China has called him an irrelevant exile .
But a huge paramilitary build - up across Tibetan areas , bans on much travel and tourism there , and now the " mass education " campaign suggest the government itself fears wider sources of discontent , including among officials and Party members .
Over the weekend , Beijing slightly loosened its usually strict ban on protest to allow angry citizens to denounce the Dalai Lama and urge boycotts of businesses accused of supporting him , especially the French supermarket giant Carrefour .
Chinese state - run media have been awash with reports accusing Western media of biased reports of the unrest and of Chinese policy in Tibet .

The game 's afoot at Blockbuster ( NYSE : BBI ) .
The DVD rental giant is ramping up its presence in video - game retailing .
The chain has always been an active renter of game titles in the past , but now its company - owned stores will begin selling a wider array of hardware , accessories , and software .
The move should redefine its stores as a place for permanent purchases , rather than transient rentals .
Blockbuster has undoubtedly noticed what niche leader GameStop ( NYSE : GME ) has been able to accomplish in a much smaller footprint .
Blockbuster will never achieve that kind of street cred among die - hard gamers , but it may as well try .
I like the move , but the tactical shift itself is n't a slam - dunk .
Awhile ago , Hollywood Video was clearing space among its flick rentals to add Game Crazy video - game sections within its stores , and where did that take it ?
Blockbuster 's nearest competitor wound up cashing out to Movie Gallery and is now wading through bankruptcy court .
Blockbuster has a better shot at making it work , in part because it 's using its strengths as a shoehorn .
For instance , the chain is now selling a PS3 package that bundles the 40 - gig version of the console with a Blu-ray movie , a PS3 game , and a dozen free weekly Blu-ray or PS3 game rentals .
OK , so maybe Blockbuster needs to brush up on its price points .
It is selling the system for $ 500 , when the console , Transformers PS3 game , and Spider - Man Blu-ray disc can be bought for just $ 450 a la carte through Amazon.com ( Nasdaq : AMZN ) .
If it can't price its subsequent rental packages as a free bonus , it 's going to turn a tactical advantage into a pricing disadvantage .
However , give Blockbuster a few months to get it right .
It knows how important this is as a way to wean itself off the DVD - rental cash cow .
In a year or two , Blockbuster may resemble a smaller version of Hastings ( Nasdaq : HAST ) , the regional media - powered department store that sells everything from CDs to video games to consumer electronics beyond its DVD rental business .
Even if Blockbuster is unsuccessful in its attempt to buy Circuit City ( NYSE : CC ) , expect Blockbuster to become more of an entertainment retailer than one that can be quickly bumped off once digital delivery becomes the celluloid standard .
" Blockbuster still rents movies , but that 's just a small fraction of its business , " I suggested recently in taking a glimpse at what Blockbuster may look like come 2010 .
" The chain has become more like a RadioShack ( NYSE : RSH ) , making the most of its small - box footprint as a Jack of all trades that specializes in media entertainment . "
OK , so maybe I should have rolled with GameStop instead of RadioShack .
Either way , Blockbuster is taking the right steps to build a stable of stallions before it has to retire its one - trick rental pony .
style= ” width : 252 px ; height : 209 px ” Top Bush aides pushed for GuantÃ¡namo torture
Richard Norton - Taylor – The Guardian ,
Saturday April 19 2008
guardian.co.uk Â© Guardian News and Media Limited 2008
Senior officials bypassed army chief to introduce interrogation methods
America ’s most senior general was “ hoodwinked ” by top Bush administration officials determined to push through aggressive interrogation techniques of terror suspects held at GuantÃ¡namo Bay , leading to the US military abandoning its age - old ban on the cruel and inhumane treatment of prisoners , the Guardian reveals today .
General Richard Myers , chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff from 2001 to 2005 , wrongly believed that inmates at GuantÃ¡namo and other prisons were protected by the Geneva conventions and from abuse tantamount to torture .
The way he was duped by senior officials in Washington , who believed the Geneva conventions and other traditional safeguards were out of date , is disclosed in a devastating account of their role , extracts of which appear in today ’s Guardian .
In his new book , Torture Team , Philippe Sands QC , professor of law at University College London , reveals that :
Senior Bush administration figures pushed through previously outlawed measures with the aid of inexperienced military officials at GuantÃ¡namo .
Myers believes he was a victim of “ intrigue ” by top lawyers at the department of justice , the office of vice - president Dick Cheney , and at Donald Rumsfeld ’s defence department .
The GuantÃ¡namo lawyers charged with devising interrogation techniques were inspired by the exploits of Jack Bauer in the American TV series 24 .
Myers wrongly believed interrogation techniques had been taken from the army ’s field manual .
The lawyers , all political appointees , who pushed through the interrogation techniques were Alberto Gonzales , David Addington and William Haynes .
Also involved were Doug Feith , Rumsfeld ’s under - secretary for policy , and Jay Bybee and John Yoo , two assistant attorney generals .
The revelations have sparked a fierce response in the US from those familiar with the contents of the book , and who are determined to establish accountability for the way the Bush administration violated international and domestic law by sanctioning prisoner abuse and torture .
The Bush administration has tried to explain away the ill - treatment of detainees at GuantÃ¡namo Bay and Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq by blaming junior officials .
Sands ’ book establishes that pressure for aggressive and cruel treatment of detainees came from the top and was sanctioned by the most senior lawyers .
Myers was one top official who did not understand the implications of what was being done .
Sands , who spent three hours with the former general , says he was “ confused ” about the decisions that were taken .
Myers mistakenly believed that new techniques recommended by Haynes and authorized by Rumsfeld in December 2002 for use by the military at GuantÃ¡namo had been taken from the US army field manual .
They included hooding , sensory deprivation , and physical and mental abuse .
“ As we worked through the list of techniques , Myers became increasingly hesitant and troubled , ” writes Sands .
“ Haynes and Rumsfeld had been able to run rings around him . ”
Myers and his closest advisers were cut out of the decision - making process .
He did not know that Bush administration officials were changing the rules allowing interrogation techniques , including the use of dogs , amounting to torture .
“ We never authorized torture , we just did n’t , not what we would do , ” Myers said .
Sands comments : “ He really had taken his eye off the ball … he did n’t ask too many questions … and kept his distance from the decision - making process . ”
Larry Wilkerson , a former army officer and chief of staff to Colin Powell , US secretary of state at the time , told the Guardian : “ I do know that Rumsfeld had neutralized the chairman [ Myers ] in many significant ways .
“ The secretary did this by cutting [ Myers ] out of important communications , meetings , deliberations and plans .
“ At the end of the day , however , Dick Myers was not a very powerful chairman in the first place , one reason Rumsfeld recommended him for the job ” .
He added : “ Haynes , Feith , Yoo , Bybee , Gonzalez and – at the apex – Addington , should never travel outside the US , except perhaps to Saudi Arabia and Israel .
They broke the law ; they violated their professional ethical code .
In future , some government may build the case necessary to prosecute them in a foreign court , or in an international court . ”
’ Sleeping giants ’ at the ends of the Earth are awakening , NASA expert says
Waleed Abdalati : “ With an ice - free Arctic - - more heat is absorbed by the planet .
Throughout recorded history , we ’ve counted on this ice being there . ”
3:42 p.m. , April 16 , 2008 -- The “ sleeping giants ” at the ends of the Earth - - the polar ice sheets -- are “ awakening , ” Waleed Abdalati , head of NASA 's Cryospheric Sciences Branch , told an audience of more than 200 at the University of Delaware on Thursday evening , April 10 .
These “ awakening ” or thawing ice sheets will affect the world , from raising sea levels and threatening the existence of polar bears , to expanding maritime commerce and impacting national security , Abdalati noted .
One of the world 's pre-eminent experts in the study of climate change , Abdalati provided evidence that the polar ice sheets are shrinking , drawing on data yielded by some 14 different scientific models used for predicting climate , to striking images of Greenland 's and Antarctica 's ice cover taken by NASA satellites .
The presentation was the latest installment in UD's William S. Carlson International Polar Year Events -- a series of public programs named after UD 's president from 1946 - 50 who conducted research in the Arctic .
The lecture also was Webcast and simulcast to UD 's island in the virtual world of Second Life .
Abdalati said he “ fell in love with NASA ” as a youngster , after watching the lunar landings .
Today , he leads a group of scientists who monitor the planet 's changing ice cover using satellites and other airborne instruments .
He also is a veteran of nine field expeditions to the Greenland Ice Sheet .
“ It 's nature in its most austere form , ” Abdalati said , showing a slide of a helicopter hovering along the edge of the Antarctic ice shelf towering taller than a football field above the waterline .
“ Does it matter that a place like this is changing ? ” he asked .
Click the above graphic to listen to this podcast .
It does when 23 feet of sea - level rise is contained in the Greenland ice sheet , and 200 feet of sea - level rise is contained in the Antarctic , and this ice affects world climate and a whole host of other issues , he went on to explain .
While Abdalati says the polar ice sheets “ wo n't go tomorrow , ” how much sea level rises in the future and how well we are prepared for it has huge social , political and economic implications for the world .
The impact of a one - meter ( 3.2 foot ) rise in sea level in the world 's oceans would amount to the inundation of 2.2 million square miles of coastline around the globe , the equivalent of one - quarter of the continental United States .
It would affect 45 million people and cost a trillion dollars , Abdalati said .
Tools such as ice - penetrating radar and NASA 's ICESat satellite have revealed that the Greenland Ice Sheet has a “ weakened underbelly , ” eroded by meltwater from thawing ice on the surface .
Since 1979 , sea ice has been shrinking by about 8 percent per decade , Abdalati said .
Every summer , sea ice thaws until it reaches a summer minimum .
Then nature “ presses a re-set button , ” and the sea ice grows back in winter , he noted .
However , the thick , old ice no longer exists in many places , leaving much thinner ice , more vulnerable to melting .
In 2007 , scientists were stunned by the 23 percent reduction in sea ice that occurred from 2005 - 07 .
In 2007 , a 76 - year - old farmer from Minnesota navigated the largely ice - free Northwest Passage in a sailboat , he noted .
An ice - free Arctic Ocean has both negative and positive implications , Abdalati noted , providing the means for moving goods from Asia to Europe more quickly , and reducing the need to use the Suez Canal , not to mention increasing access to the Arctic 's tremendous economic resources .
View in Second Life
“ With an ice - free Arctic - - more heat is absorbed by the planet , ” he said , which has huge implications for climate patterns .
“ Throughout recorded history , we 've counted on this ice being there . ”
Besides the plight of the polar bears , whose numbers are diminishing , a warmer Arctic means melting permafrost .
As this frozen ground melts , it releases methane , a strong greenhouse gas .
Melting permafrost already is costing Alaska some $ 35 million per year , where homes , highways and other infrastructure are affected by the sinking ground .
“ Climatologically , we 're in unfamiliar territory , ” Abdalati noted .
“ The effectiveness of society 's response depends on how big the changes are , how fast they come and how fast our ability will be to anticipate the changes . ”
Earlier in the evening , Frederick “ Fritz ” Nelson , professor of geography and a member of the Nobel Prize - winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , introduced the audience to UD 's Carlson IPY Events and the interesting connections the series has helped to forge , including contact with 93 - year - old Ray Drakio , the last remaining survivor of the ill - fated Wilkins expedition of 1931 to explore the Arctic in a submarine .
As fate would have it , Drakio happens to live in Newark , Del .
Tom Apple , dean of the College of Arts and Sciences , showcased the college 's polar research and scholarship , highlighting the Bartol Research Institute and its work on the world 's largest neutrino telescope at the South Pole ; the Department of Geography 's many projects such as the international Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring ( CALM ) network of 168 observatories tracking permafrost and the Sea-ice Experiment : Dynamic Nature of the Arctic ( SEDNA ) project , a multi-institutional effort involving UD faculty in geography and computer and information sciences and a UD alumna to determine the mass balance of ice cover in the Arctic ; study - abroad trips to Antarctica led by the Department of Communications ; nonfiction works by faculty in the English Department , and the study and preservation of Inuit objects by the Center for Material Culture Studies .
Janis Tomlinson , director of University Museums , announced two exhibitions being planned for UD this fall in conjunction with the Carlson series , including historical images from the American Geographical Society Library at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee that recently were featured in “ Photographs from the Ends of the Earth , ” an exhibition curated by the Milwaukee Art Museum .
The work of contemporary photographer Camille Seaman , including her majestic photos of icebergs , also will be presented .

Nearly two years ago , BBC News website readers put their questions to people in a village north of the capital , Kabul , where the Taleban had destroyed many homes during the civil war .
Village struggles against odds
Since we met the villagers in September 2005 , international aid pledges to the country have risen to more than $ 10.5 bn ( £ 5.9bn ) .
But corruption has got worse , and the Taleban have been fighting back .
Our reporter Soutik Biswas revisited the village of Asad Khyl to find out how life has changed during the last two years .
Here , villagers answer questions sent to them by readers .
Are things improving ?
Is there safety , shelter , enough food and water ?
Roy , Kansas , US RAHMAT GUL , teacher :
In our village , security has actually improved a bit .
But living conditions have n't changed much .
People are poor , there are no jobs and the crop is poor because of lack of water .
I have a job as a teacher and my salary is about US $ 60 .
It is not enough to maintain my family .
Rahmat Gul - inflation is now a big issue
In my opinion , one good way to improve our lives is to provide us opportunities to export our grapes and raisins because they are of a very good quality .
MOHAMMED SHARIF , village chief : Rahmat is right , but I think a better way to bring prosperity to our village is to set up factories , which make fruit juices .
We can sell our good fruit to these factories , and residents can get jobs there .
So it will solve the problem of unemployment and our farmers can make money too .
RAHMAT GUL : Unfortunately , not much has been done in our village .
Out biggest problem is water .
We just do n't have enough water to irrigate our land .
We had two wells when you last visited us .
Since then , the government has dug out two more wells .
Inflation has gone up and food costs more in the market .
A bag of flour used to cost 900 Afghanis ( $ 19 ) two years ago , today it costs 1400 Afghanis ( US$ 30 ) .
Five kilograms of vegetable oil used to cost 200 Afghanis ( US$ 4 ) two years ago , now it costs 340 Afghanis ( US$ 7 ) .
Beef costs more too - from 120 Afghanis ( US $ 2.5 ) for a kg of meat two years ago , it has now gone up to 200 Afghanis ( US $ 4 ) .
We need more water to irrigate our fertile land .
With enough water we can have two crop seasons - one to grow paddy ( rice ) , and the other - to grow grains and fruits .
Do you know that we can easily grow peach , apricot , pomegranates , apple , pears , watermelons , cherries and grapes ?
This used to be a very fertile area before the Soviets bombed our irrigation canals .
I had apple trees full of the fruit , my brother had two dozen peach trees at home .
Now things are different .
MOHAMMAD SHARIF :
There was a time before the Soviets invaded us Asad Khyl was so prosperous that we used to feed poor people coming to the village .
RAHMAT GUL :
The government did build a canal , which passes through the village , but it does not help irrigate our land .
The water is of no use to us - there is no way we can channel it from there to our lands .
Shukrullah - now teaches football at school
There have been a few minor achievements though - when you visited us last , we did not have electricity .
Now a generator has been installed in the village , which supplies us with electricity for five hours between 7 pm and 11 pm every day .
We have to pay 75 Afghanis ( $ 1.55 ) for every light bulb a month .
With electricity available , 60 % of the people in the village have television sets and have more entertainment , compared to only listening to the radio .
Television has made us more aware , and better informed .
When we see TV , we realise how backward we are .
At the same time , we want to preserve our Islamic values .
SHUKRULLAH , student : I love watching educational programmes and music programmes on TV .
TV has helped me understand mathematics better and has taught me some English .
Shukrullah , what kind of changes happened in your life since last time ?
What is your most urgent need now ?
Kamran , Birmingham SHUKRULLAH : I am 20 years old now , I am studying in the sixth grade .
I study Dari , geography , geometry , mathematics , English , Pashtun and history four hours a day at school .
These days I also go to the local madrassa [ religious school ] in the morning .
I still want to become a civil engineer .
I still help my father to weave carpets in my free time .
We earn $ 170 for a carpet but it takes two months to weave one .
The one change that has happened is that I have become a football trainer at school .
I always played football , but now I teach the game to the youngsters .
What scares me is the joblessness that I see around me .
Factories and new towns need to be built so enough jobs are created .
I worry a lot when I see people hanging around with no work .
It is often argued that Afghanistan was peaceful during the Taleban rule , and that after their fall , the country has not enjoyed the same level of peace and stability .
Do you agree ?
Do you see the presence of foreign forces important for the future of Afghanistan or should the Taleban be invited to participate in a broad national government ?
Farid Mamundzay , Birmingham , UK RAHMAT GUL :
You are partly right .
People did enjoy peace and stability .
But Taleban laws were harsh and draconian .
Now the laws are within the framework of a democracy and if we implement them we could have more peace and security .
To your second question - I think foreign forces should coordinate their operations with Afghan forces in a bigger way to avoid civilian casualties .
The thing is that if you invite the Taleban to join a broad - based national government , there will be no need for foreign troops in the country at all .
It would not be such a bad idea , though I wonder how the Taleban would react to such a proposal .
It would be a good idea to declare an amnesty for all the indigenous Taleban and bring them into the mainstream of politics .
The foreign Taleban should be kept out .
What are your hopes for an end to corruption and fighting ?
Anne Thorpe , Conder , Australia RAHMAT GUL : Corruption has become a big problem in Afghanistan .
It openly mocks the laws .
I have n't been affected personally , but I keep hearing stories of how deep - rooted and wide - spread it is .
MOHAMMAD SHARIF : I can tell you some stories about how corruption is ravaging our society .
Two months ago , a judge in Qarabagh district [ Asad Khyl is in Qarabagh ] was caught taking a 10,000 Afghani ( US $ 210 ) bribe from a man in return for forging some land documents .
The man complained to the shura [ village council ] and the judge was caught and sacked by the villagers .
Mohammad Sharif - the village was very prosperous before the Soviets
When I became village chief last year , I went to Kabul to get a letter of approval about my position from authorities .
The officer made me wait for a couple of days , and then he demanded a bribe for the letter .
Whenever you visit government offices , employees are telling you , ' shirni bee ' , which means ' give me sweets . '
' Sweets ' is a euphemism for a bribe .
So ' shirni ' has become a dreaded word in Afghanistan now .
The only way to curb corruption is to punish officials .
But the salaries of government workers should also be increased .
They are paid too little , so there is a lot of incentive to take bribes .
Are you happy by the efforts by the government to improve the condition of the people ?
Ritesh , Hyderabad , India RAHMAT GUL : I think that the government has done a fairly decent job .
They have built some roads and schools , provided some electricity .
Twenty four new schools have been opened in the Qarabagh district alone .
But the progress is very slow , and a lot more needs to be done .
The international community should help more .
They should give aid directly to the government , and not through NGOs to help us .
I know that people working with NGOs have very high salaries , so most of the aid actually goes back to the foreign countries as pay and prerequisites .
The government should set up an independent commission , which will be responsible for receiving aid and allocating it to various departments .
The commission should have honest , patriotic people at the top so that the money is not stolen or misused .
How passionate do you feel about your right to vote and about building a democratic Afghan society ?
Savannah , Houston , Texas RAHMAT GUL : Democracy only in name is nonsense .
It should be put into practice .
Democracy alone does not deliver much .
People should work hard and be honest .
Yes , I am passionate about my right to vote .
I use my vote carefully - I must know the person and his work well enough to vote for him .
I voted for Hamid Karzai in the presidential election .
I also voted in the parliamentary election .
What do you see as the biggest threat to the future of Afghanistan - the Taleban , the West , corruption , illiteracy , poverty , drought or something else ?
Kate Mather , London , England HAJI ABDULLAH SALEH , village elder : The Taleban is the biggest threat to the future of Afghanistan .
They are not powerful enough to topple the government , but they are a big problem .
Pakistan and Iran are supporting them with arms and funds .
Haji Abdullah Saleh - the Taleban are bad for Islam
They do n't want the country to stand on its own feet , prosper and become peaceful .
They destroyed most of the country , and their legacy is all about burning schools , gardens and houses .
This is unacceptable and it is against Islamic law .
The Taleban have made a comeback in the past year , they have re-grouped .
You can even see them in the north of the country these days .
They have begun using suicide attackers .
This is another big worry .
Recently , they killed some schoolgirls .
All this is all very worrying .
It seems people are supporting the Taleban on the pretext that the Taleban are defending Islam against Western values .
Do you agree ?
Ezra Kaimukilwa , Dar es Salaam , Tanzania HAJI ABDULLAH SALEH : The Taleban has trampled upon the good name of Islam .
They do n't observe Islamic values and laws .
They are against education .
If they served Islam , people would not have hated them , and they would have succeeded .
They do n't even have the power to defend Islam , let alone protect it .
They get outside support to create trouble .
Do you still think Americans can establish democracy in Afghanistan ?
Is President Hamid Karzai acting independently or as a puppet of US ?
Saran , Bremen , Germany HAJI ABDULLAH SALEH : American style democracy is not going to work in Afghanistan .
Our democracy has to be moulded by ourselves , not any outsider .
As for Karzai - yes , he can not act independently .
He had to release people who worked against Islam because of pressure from foreign powers - the Muslim man who converted to Christianity was released .
Village men discuss changes over lunch
He could not secure the release of the kidnapped Afghan translator of an Italian journalist , who was also taken hostage by the Taleban .
The journalist was freed , but the translator lost his life .
Karzai should be the puppet of the Afghan people , instead he is the puppet of the US .
Has support for the Taleban risen due to lack of improvements in daily life ?
Karen DeBiase , Chester , VA HAJI ABDULLAH SALEH : Support for Taleban is coming from countries like Pakistan .
There is a big rumour these days that the US is actually helping the Taleban to keep the war going .
The Taleban were created by the US and the US has all the powers in the world , so people here find it very difficult to believe that the US can't take them out .
It just does n't make sense .
Would you like to see the grandson of the previous king back in power and would he able to unite the country ?
Simon , London , UK HAJI ABDULLAH SALEH :
It is possible .
People are still fond of the royal family .
The grandson of the former king is a member of a coalition of parties opposed to the government .
It is possible for the royal family to reunite the people .
They will get a lot of support from the people .
Shaista , have you been able to carry on going to school and do you still plan to be a doctor ?
Thone , Liege , Belgium SHAISTA : I am in grade seven in school .
I want to reach my dream and still wish to become a doctor and help my people .
Shaista - still dreaming of being a doctor
There are still a lot of difficulties I am facing - I do n't have shoes , I do n't have proper school clothes , I do n't have enough books .
I bought eight books for school recently .
I needed more , but I could afford to pay only for eight .
Each book cost 20 Afghans ( US$ 0.40 ) .
This was from my own money that I had saved .
Now we have electricity for few hours in the evening , and I watch TV , some educational programmes and Indian serials .
I 've never missed a class .
But my father tells me these days that I should stop going to school from next year .
My father and other people say girls do n't go to school , only boys do .
But I want to continue , study medicine and graduate .
It is my dream to become a doctor .
Are there more opportunities for women to work and support themselves ?
What kind of education opportunities do they have ?
Tammy Georgeson , Salt Lake City , US LAL BIBI , widow :
There are no opportunities for women to work here .
Women always stay home .
If men are jobless at least they can go to bazaar and find work there .
But for women like us there are no opportunities .
Widow Lal Bibi - no aid gets to me I have tried a lot to find some work for myself , but I have not succeeded .
I need to do some tailoring , embroidery and literacy courses , which would be helpful to earn a living .
There is absolutely no opportunity for education for women .
We have not received any aid from foreign NGOs .
In fact no - one is helping women here .
If the government or the NGOs that are working for women establish some courses in tailoring , embroidery and literacy , that can help women to make a living .
I did a month - long training course last year , conducted by a Dutch NGO on how to keep cows and livestock .
I passed the training , borrowed some money and bought a cow .
I collect fodder for the cow from the gardens .
I sell the milk in the market to buy sugar , tea and basic food .
That is not enough for me .
Everything is expensive .
I can work as a tailor , embroider , carpet weaver .
But there is no such opportunity .
Life is too difficult for me .

The US administration is pressing the 27 governments of the European Union to sign up for a range of new security measures for transatlantic travel , including allowing armed guards on all flights from Europe to America by US airlines .
The demand to put armed air marshals on to the flights is part of a travel clampdown by the Bush administration that officials in Brussels described as " blackmail " and " troublesome " , and could see west Europeans and Britons required to have US visas if their governments balk at Washington 's requirements .
According to a US document being circulated for signature in European capitals , EU states would also need to supply personal data on all air passengers overflying but not landing in the US in order to gain or retain visa - free travel to America , senior EU officials said .
And within months the US department of homeland security is to impose a new permit system for Europeans flying to the US , compelling all travellers to apply online for permission to enter the country before booking or buying a ticket , a procedure that will take several days .
The data from the US's new electronic transport authorisation system is to be combined with extensive personal passenger details already being provided by EU countries to the US for the " profiling " of potential terrorists and assessment of other security risks .
Washington is also asking European airlines to provide personal data on non-travellers - for example family members - who are allowed beyond departure barriers to help elderly , young or ill passengers to board aircraft flying to America , a demand the airlines reject as " absurd " .
Seven demands tabled by Washington are contained in a 10 - page " memorandum of understanding " ( MOU ) that the US authorities are negotiating or planning to negotiate with all EU governments , according to ministers and diplomats from EU member states and senior officials in Brussels .
The Americans have launched their security drive with some of the 12 mainly east European EU countries whose citizens still need visas to enter the US .
" The Americans are trying to get a beefing up of their visa - waiver programmes .
It 's all contained in the MOU they want to put to all EU member states , " said a diplomat from a west European country .
" It 's a very delicate problem . "
As part of a controversial passenger data exchange programme allegedly aimed at combating terrorism , the EU has for the past few months been supplying the American authorities with 19 items of information on every traveller flying from the EU to the US .
The new American demands go well beyond what was agreed under that passenger name record ( PNR ) system and look certain to cause disputes within Europe and between Europe and the US .
Brussels is pressing European governments not to sign the bilateral deals with the Americans to avoid weakening the EU bargaining position .
But Washington appears close to striking accords on the new travel regime with Greece and the Czech Republic .
Both countries have sizeable diaspora communities in America , while their citizens need visas to enter the US .
Visa - free travel would be popular in both countries .
A senior EU official said the Americans could get " a gung - ho frontrunner " to sign up to the new regime and then use that agreement " as a rod to beat the other member states with " .
The frontrunner appears to be the Czech Republic .
On Wednesday , Richard Barth of the department of homeland security was in Prague to negotiate with the Czech deputy prime minister , Alexandr Vondra ,
Prague hoped to sign the US memorandum " in the spring " , Vondra said .
" The EU has done nothing for us on visas , " he said .
" There was no help , no solidarity in the past .
It 's in our interest to move ahead .
We can't just wait and do nothing .
We have to act in the interest of our citizens . "
While the Czechs are in a hurry to sign up , Brussels is urging delay in order to try to reach a common European position .
" There is a process of consultation and coordination under way , " said Jonathan Faull , a senior European commission official involved in the negotiations with the Americans .
To European ears , the US demands sound draconian .
" This would oblige the European countries to allow US air marshals on US flights .
It 's controversial and difficult , " an EU official said .
At the moment the use of air marshals is discretionary for European states and airlines .
While armed American guards would be entitled to sit on the European flights to the US , the Americans also want the PNR data transfers extended from travellers from Europe to the US to include the details of those whose flights are not to America , but which overfly US territory , say to central America or the Caribbean .
Brussels has told Washington that its demands raise legal problems in Europe over data protection , over guarantees on how the information is handled , over which US agencies have access to it or with whom it might be shared , and over issues of redress if the data is misused .
The Association of European Airlines , representing 31 airlines , including all the big west European national carriers , has told the US authorities that there is " no international legal foundation " for supplying them with data about passengers on flights overflying US territory .
The US Transport Security Administration has also asked the European airlines to supply personal data on " certain non-travelling members of the public requesting access to areas beyond the screening checkpoint " .
The AEA said this was " absurd " because the airlines neither obtain nor can obtain such information .
The request was " fully unjustified " .
If the Americans persevere in the proposed security crackdown , Brussels is likely to respond with tit - for - tat action , such as calling for visas for some Americans .
European governments , however , would probably veto such action , one official said , not least for fear of the " massive disruption given the huge volume of transatlantic traffic " .
Has the financial tipping point of life vs. death finally arrived ?
Do you now need to be financially healthy ( meaning rich ) to ease suffering from or survive diseases such as multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis , hemophilia , hepatitis C and some cancers ( such as metastatic breast cancer ) ?
The lead story in the print edition of today ’s New York Times reports this chilling fact :
Health insurance companies are rapidly adopting a new pricing system for very expensive drugs , asking patients to pay hundreds and even thousands of dollars for prescriptions for medications that may save their lives or slow the progress of serious diseases .
With the new pricing system , insurers abandoned the traditional arrangement that has patients pay a fixed amount , like $ 10 , $ 20 or $ 30 for a prescription , no matter what the drug ’s actual cost .
Instead , they are charging patients a percentage of the cost of certain high - priced drugs , usually 20 to 33 percent , which can amount to thousands of dollars a month .
Simply put :
For some drugs , you no longer pay a fixed amount as a co-pay ; you pay a percentage of the drug ’s cost ( up to a certain amount , under some plans ) .
For the past decade , those who can afford health insurance ( 47 million people do n’t have it ) or have it provided by employers have become used to drug formularies and three - tier pharmaceutical benefits .
For example , my provider requires :
• a $ 7 co-pay for Tier 1 drugs : generics , over - the - counter and certain brand names .
• a $ 15 co-pay for Tier 2 : other “ preferred ” brand - name drugs .
• a $ 40 co-pay for Tier 3 : all other drugs ; i.e , drugs not listed in the providers formulary .
Increasingly , notes The Times , insurers have added Tier 4 and Tier 5 co-pays , following the lead of Medicare drug plans ( you know , those plans in which the government bargained away its ability to get bargains ? ) .
Now Tier 4 is also showing up in insurance that people buy on their own or acquire through employers , said Dan Mendelson of Avalere Health , a research organization in Washington .
It is the fastest - growing segment in private insurance , Mr. Mendelson said .
Five years ago it was virtually nonexistent in private plans , he said .
Now 10 percent of them have Tier 4 drug categories .
The drugs covered by these Tier 4 and Tier 5 categories are expensive .
So if these tiers charge a percentage of the cost rather than a flat co-pay , it can become ruinously expensive .
If you ’re suffering from the relapsing - remitting ( RRMS ) form of multiple sclerosis , you may be taking Copaxone to reduce the relapse rate .
The drug may cost nearly $ 2,000 a month .
Your co-pay might have been a flat - fee $ 25 a month in a three - tiered plan .
Under Tier 4 or 5 , the co-pay may be a percentage of the whole cost .
At 25 percent of Copaxone ’s cost , your co-pay could hit $ 500 a month ( unless capped at a specific amount ) .
That ’s a life - altering 1,900 percent increase .
Why do insurers do this ?
Reports The Times : “ Insurers say the new system keeps everyone ’s premiums down at a time when some of the most innovative and promising new treatments for conditions like cancer and rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis can cost $ 100,000 and more a year . ” [ emphasis added ]
That ’s like taking on a second mortgage , which people may , in fact , have to do to ease their suffering or prolong their lives .
They might indeed ask :
What ’s the point of having insurance in the first place ?
Was n’t it intended to prevent financial ruin by spreading the risk across an enormous pool ?
Again , from The Times :
But the new system sticks seriously ill people with huge bills , said James Robinson , a health economist at the University of California , Berkeley .
“ It is very unfortunate social policy , ”  Dr. Robinson said .
“ The more the sick person pays , the less the healthy person pays . ”
Traditionally , the idea of insurance was to spread the costs of paying for the sick .
“ This is an erosion of the traditional concept of insurance , ”  Mr. Mendelson said .
“ Those beneficiaries who bear the burden of illness are also bearing the burden of cost . ” [ emphasis added ]
This is beyond my pittance of knowledge of health economics to figure out .
But generally , I smell a rat .
Rather , two rats .
I find it difficult to separate Big Pharma ( on which we depend for life - saving drugs ) ; Big Insurance ( on which we depend to help us pay for those drugs without driving ourselves into bankruptcy ) ; and the decade - long , dramatic rise of out - of - pocket costs for health care ( particularly for life - saving drugs ) through higher and higher co-payments .
For Big Pharma , which does the research and development for the medications that heal us and save our lives , there ’s this question :
Why do you charge so much for these Tier 4 and 5 drugs ?
( This is not the same question as this :
What factors account for the real wholesale costs of these drugs ? )
For Big Insurance , there ’s this :
Why have you shed the traditional concept of sharing the risk across a large pool of insurees ?
The subhed of The Times ‘ story is telling : Insurers shift burden .
Why ?
Here ’s the industry ’s stock answer :
Private insurers began offering Tier 4 plans in response to employers who were looking for ways to keep costs down , said Karen Ignagni , president of America ’s Health Insurance Plans , which represents most of the nation ’s health insurers .
So Big Insurance blames employers , saying they want lower costs .
But is n’t that leaving out a bunch of other factors ?
Why has the cost of health care ( and insurance to cover that cost , particularly drugs ) become so high that employers complained about the cost ?
Big Insurance is not being wholly honest in blaming employers .
Meanwhile , I observe the following trends .
According to a 2002 report by the Government Accountability Office :
[ P] harmaceutical companies spent $ 30.3 billion on research and development and $ 19.1 billion on all promotional activities , which includes $ 2.7 billion on DTC advertising , in 2001 .
Pharmaceutical companies have increased spending on DTC advertising more rapidly than they have increased spending on research and development .
Between 1997 and 2001 , DTC advertising spending increased 145 percent , while research and development spending increased 59 percent .
Promotion to physicians accounted for more than 80 percent of all promotional spending by pharmaceutical companies in 2001 .
Total promotional spending was equivalent to 12 percent of drug sales in the United States in 2001 .
[ emphasis added ; DTC = direct - to - consumer ]
According to another study using 2004 data , Big Pharma spent almost twice as much on promotion as it does on research and development :
The researchers ’ estimate is based on the systematic collection of data directly from the industry and doctors during 2004 , which shows the U.S. pharmaceutical industry spent 24.4 % of the sales dollar on promotion , versus 13.4 % for research and development , as a percentage of US domestic sales of US $ 235.4 billion .
Big Pharma lobbies Congress extensively and increased its lobbying in 2007 more than any other industry .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics :
[ T ]he pharmaceuticals / health products industry outspent all industries by shelling out $ 227 million for lobbying services , or an average of $ 1.4 million for the 164 days that the 110th Congress met in 2007 .
The drug industry has spent $ 1.3 billion on federal lobbying over the last 10 years , more than any other industry .
Its reported lobbying increased 25 percent in 2007 .
[ emphasis added ]
Overall , the entire health industry spent early $ 445 million on lobbying in 2007 .
Since 1990 , Big Pharma has made about $ 152 million in campaign contributions to candidates for federal office .
( Health services and HMOs have given nearly $ 54 million since 1990 . )
Big Insurance ( which obviously covers more than health - related insurance ) spent about $ 138 million on lobbying in 2007 and more than $ 1 billion since 1998 .
Since 1990 , Big Insurance has made more than $ 287 million in campaign contributions .
What a frickin’ mess .
Industries have carved out new social policy .
So we ought to be asking some basic questions :
What is the priority of Big Pharma ?
How does that priority fit into social policy as articulated by the legislative and executive branches of government ?
What is the priority of Big Insurance ?
How does that priority fit into social policy as articulated by the legislative and executive branches of government ?
What is the relationship between Big Pharma and Big Insurance ?
How does that relationship fit into social policy as articulated by the legislative and executive branches of government ?
Now , if we can persuade our presidential candidates to stop caterwauling about minutiae in “ he said / she said ” language , perhaps they ’ll address questions like this before we have to vote for one of these feckless dolts in November .
And we might ask our members of Congress what impact those hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign contributions and lobbying expenses have on their ability to set social policy that does n’t leave people financially bereft of hope and at risk of life when struck by serious illness .

It was like you ’d Googled “ How to TP a House ” .
STEP ONE : PICK A HOUSE WHICH :- is on the corner so lots of people driving by see your work – CHECK !- has lots of hedges and HIGH trees to hang TP on – CHECK !- has no fence to trap you in case you ’re caught – CHECK !- has no motion - sensitive lights to warn the owners – CHECK !- has no dog – DOH !
Yes , we have a dog – and you should have known that because he barks at you when you walk by .
Our barking dog woke me up .
And finally , pick a house which :- does n’t have an owner crazy enough to take down all your handiwork in the middle of the night before anyone gets to witness your genius – DOH !
I was almost SORRY to be dismantling your masterpiece before morning light .
If it helps , I actually stood back and took it all in before I started pulling down streams of white .
But , this being Seattle , I was afraid it would rain and wet TP is REALLY hard to remove from trees .
I speak from experience here .
STEP TWO : TP TECHNIQUE -- AND BEYONDFirst , your TP technique was superb .
I believe I got the benefit of your collective experience here ?
This could n’t have been your first job .- the sheer volume of TP was impressive .
I counted no fewer than six rolls - the TP was indeed in the HIGHEST branches of my trees – great arm !
I had to climb the trees and use a rake to remove the final flapping vestiges .- the TP was high quality , important because the cheap stuff does n’t cling right
But it was all the EXTRAS which put this TP job in the “ excellent ” category : -
At least a grocery bag of ripped - into - small - pieces colored construction paper scattered across our lawn .
Even in the streetlight it was pretty . -
Silly string !
Come on – who does n’t appreciate silly string ?
Especially on hedges .
That stuff is stubborn .
There ’s still some out there .-
And the coup - de - grace – the Vaseline on the door handle .
Brilliant !
As I chased you off in my bare feet ( more on this below ) I noted my flash light covered in sticky stuff .
Took me a while to figure out what had happened .
Now , on your escape – you did break one cardinal rule of the TP trade .
If discovered do NOT run in the direction of your house .
It could be argued you should lose a point for this gaff , but I suppose it can be forgiven given the lay of the land and the fact that you were likely freaked out when I burst out of my front door with flash light hand .
Would you believe I actually ENVIED you as you ran off ?
I truly did .
Because I knew your hearts were hammering at your ribs and you were experiencing that delicious fear that comes from being discovered in the middle of perpetrating a first - class prank .
“ Holy crap , dude !
He almost CAUGHT US ! ”
The thought made me laugh out loud several times as I went about putting my front yard right again .
STEP THREE - DO NO HARMFinally , what you DIDN ’T DO is also important : you did n’t trample our newly planted plants or break any tree branches .
You did n’t egg the house – that can destroy paint jobs .
You did n’t do anything to cause any real damage to our home or property .
So – in closing – do n’t be too disappointed I removed all the materials you carefully collected and brought to our house before anyone else got to see it displayed in all its glory .
I am memorializing your effort here on Craigslist for all to read .
After an hour of work , as I stood back and looked at my boring de - TP ’d yard , I brought to mind how much more colorful it had been just 60 mintues before .
With your work in mind , I held up an imaginary score card Olympics style … 10.0 !
Had there been crowds , they would have gone wild .
With respect , Home Owner , Issaquah WAP.S. btw , once is funny .
Twice ... not so much . ;)

We all know that America is the technology hub of the universe .
It is home to Intel , Microsoft , Apple , Sun , Google , YouTube , Yahoo , MIT - the list is endless .
So why , when it comes to the basics , like delivering the internet to its citizens , has it fallen way behind many other nations ?
In Manhattan people pay about $ 30 ( £ 15 ) a month for a download speed of three megabits per second ( Mbps ) via a DSL line .
Many people are very happy with that , until they realise what is going on elsewhere in the world .
US broadband speeds are much slower than in many countries " In Japan you can get 100 megabits for $ 35 , " says Selina Lo of Ruckus Wireless .
" I think that has penetrated some 30 % of subscribers .
The government is targeting for 100 megabit services to penetrate 60 % plus of the subscriber base in a few years .
" If you look at places like Hong Kong and Europe , in many places you can get over 10 megabits from your broadband network . "
Ten years ago , dozens of small DSL companies offered American consumers ever decreasing rates to the point where the businesses collapsed .
Today most New Yorkers have two choices for home net - via their phone or cable TV company .
But in New York state 52 % of residents do not have any internet access , especially rural areas and low income families .
" We have n't been able to overcome those barriers in terms of increasing the technology adoption rate of those households that are on or below the poverty level , " explains Dr Melodie Mayberry - Stewart , New York State 's chief information officer .
" I think if you look at where the US is compared to other countries , given our speed , we 're not competitive with other countries . "
Limiting use
The lack of competition has had other consequences .
Comcast , the nation 's largest residential cable TV and net company was recently accused of interfering with the downloading of video files .
Skyscrapers can cause problems for broadband firms Internet video directly threatens the popularity of traditional TV , so Comcast 's answer is to curtail download speeds for its biggest users .
" As we get more and more things that tie us into the internet - Xbox 360 , IPTV services , all sorts of broadband gaming - we 're all getting online more and more , " says Jeremy Kaplan executive editor of PC Magazine .
" And rather than opening up and getting better service , most of these cable and DSL companies are really trying to limit what we do , put caps on what we do .
As consumers we 're suffering from that . "
Public wi-fi efforts have also been held back .
Several city governments have given up or reduced efforts to provide blanket coverage for their residents .
This is because they have been worn down with lawsuits and lobbyists working for the telephone companies , who want consumers to rely on expensive cell phone plans to access the net on the go .
" Taipei , Hong Kong , Singapore - they all have wi-fi in public areas .
People can access broadband internet when they 're out in public , " says Ms Lo .
" It is the cheapest way to offer public access .
As a quality of life , as a city service , I do n't know why our city government just do n't do that . "
' Sluggish progress '
Those same companies that are discouraging competition are gradually building the next generation of fibre optic networks .
They hope to migrate their increasingly frustrated customers .
But due to simple logistics , millions of American city dwellers may not get the super fast service for years .
" Wiring up skyscrapers is a huge problem , " explains Mr Kaplan .
" They 're old , they 're giant , they 're hard to change the wiring in .
This has been the big hindrance to getting New York city wired .
Watching video online is seen as a threat to traditional TV " If you have a house in the suburbs you 're going to be one of the first to get this fast fibre service .
So it 's a strange dichotomy in the US .
The big cities are not necessarily the most advanced . "
America 's sluggish progress on the broadband and wi-fi front may , ironically , be a result of being a leader in a past era .
Companies which invested heavily in hardware and infrastructure want to maintain the status quo .
This means keeping customers in the slow lane whilst reaping profits for as long as possible , even if it means putting the country 's global high tech reputation at stake .

Real Life " Private Ryan " Screwed By Military Posted by Pile ( 8923 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
Forced to leave the combat zone after his two brothers died in the Iraq war , Army Spc. Jason Hubbard faced another battle once he returned home :
The military cut off his family 's health care , stopped his G.I. educational subsidies and wanted him to repay his sign - up bonus .
It was n't until Hubbard petitioned his local congressman that he was able to restore some of his benefits .
Now that congressman , Rep. Devin Nunes , is leading an effort to pass a bill that would ensure basic benefits to all soldiers who are discharged under an Army policy governing sole surviving siblings and children of soldiers killed in combat .
The rule is a holdover from World War II meant to protect the rights of service people who have lost a family member to war .
" I felt as if in some ways I was being punished for leaving even though it was under these difficult circumstances , " Hubbard told The Associated Press .
" The situation that happened to me is not a one - time thing .
It 's going to happen to other people , and to have a law in place is going to ease their tragedy in some way . "
Hubbard , 33 , and his youngest brother , Nathan , enlisted while they were still grieving for their brother , Marine Lance Cpl. Jared Hubbard , who was 22 when he was killed in a 2004 bomb explosion in Ramadi .
At their request , the pair were assigned to the same unit , the 3rd Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii , and deployed to Iraq the next year .
In August , 21 - year - old Cpl. Nathan died when his Black Hawk helicopter crashed near Kirkuk .
Jason was part of the team assigned to remove his comrades ' bodies from the wreckage .
Hubbard accompanied his little brother 's body on a military aircraft to Kuwait , then on to California .
He kept steady during Nathan 's burial at Clovis Cemetery , standing in dress uniform between his younger brothers ' graves as hundreds sobbed in the heat .
But Hubbard broke his silence when he found his wife , pregnant with their second child , had been cut off from the transitional health care the family needed to ease back to civilian life after he was discharged in October .
" This is a man who asked for nothing and gave a lot , " said Nunes , R - Calif. , who represents Hubbard 's hometown of Clovis , a city of 90,000 next to Fresno .
" Jason is one person who obviously has suffered tremendously and has given the ultimate sacrifice .
One person is too many to have this happen to . "
Hubbard went to Nunes , who began advocating for the former soldier in December , after hearing the Army was demanding that he repay $ 6,000 from his enlistment bonus and was denying him up to $ 40,000 in educational benefits under the GI bill .

Here are the formal comments from Black Box Voting :
EAC VOTING ADVOCATES ROUND TABLE : April 24 , 2008
I have accepted your invitation to submit the following comments to be entered into the record on behalf of Black Box Voting , by its founder , Bev Harris .
To members of the EAC and participants of the Round Table :
The entire premise of technology - based elections is based on support for the " verifiable voting " concept .
But before designing technology for elections , we must first determine how it will empower citizen controls , enabling the counting of votes in public rather than counting them in secret .
We do not consent to any form of secret vote counting , administered and controlled by government insiders and their vendors .
The people were never asked to approve such a transfer of power , have never consented to it , and indeed CANNOT consent , because the right of sovereignty over the instruments of government which we have created is an inalienable right , one which CANNOT be given away , nor can this right be removed through legislation .
It is , admittedly , possible for a government to decline to honor this right , but such an act would justify extreme measures by the people subjected to such abuse of power .
It is the public counting that is key to citizen sovereignty , not computer verification .
" Verification " of a computer report is not at all the same as public vote counting .
The core of elections was and again must return to the principle of citizen sovereignty over government .
Elections can never be based on a requirement to trust government insiders and their vendors to count our votes , nor can elections be dependent on experts to tell the citizenry that the system is okay , nor should the detailed mechanics of elections be impossible for the average citizen to understand .
Models which depend on experts and insiders create centralized control , and remove all control from government 's rightful owners – the citizens .
This represents a violation of the principles laid out in the Declaration of Independence .
Not only does my organization , Black Box Voting , refuse to participate in the design of such systems , but we will do our utmost to inform the populace that such systems must be revoked , by whatever means necessary .
" We do not consent . "

At last , a USB security token for girls !
Pre-teens in Mattels ’ free Barbie Girls virtual world can chat with their friends online using a feature called Secret B Chat .
But as an ingenious ( and presumably profitable ) bulwark against internet scum , Mattel only lets girls chat with " Best Friends , " defined as people they know in real life .
That relationship first has to be authenticated by way of the Barbie Girl , a $ 59.95 MP3 player that looks like a cross between a Bratz doll and a Cue Cat , and was recently rated one of the hottest new toys of the 2008 holiday season .
The idea is , Sally brings her Barbie Girl over to her friend Tiffany ’s house , and sets it in Tiffany ’s docking station — which is plugged into a USB port on Tiffany ’s PC .
Mattel ’s ( Windows only ) software apparently reads some sort of globally unique identifier embedded in Sally ’s Barbie Girl , and authenticates Sally as one of Tiffany ’s Best Friends .
Now when Sally gets home , the two can talk in Secret B Chat .
( If Sally ’s parents ca n’t afford the gadget , then she has no business calling herself Tiffany ’s best friend . )
It ’s sort of like an RSA token , but with cute fashion accessories and snap - on hair styles .
THREAT LEVEL foresees a wave of Barbie Girl parties in the future , where tweens all meet and authenticate to each other — like a PGP key signing party , but with cupcakes .
Without the device , girls can only chat over Barbie Girls ’ standard chat system , which limits them to a menu of greetings , questions and phrases pre-selected by Mattel for their wholesome quality .
In contrast , Secret B Chat lets girls chat with their keyboards — just like a real chat room .
But it limits the girl - talk to a white list of approved words .
" If you happen to use a word that ’s not on our list ( even if it ’s not a bad one ) , it will get blocked , " the service cautioned girls at launch .
" But do n’t worry — we ’re always adding cool new words ! "
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - A roommate - finding site cannot require users to disclose their sexual orientation , a U.S. appeals court ruled on Thursday , in the latest skirmish over whether anti-discrimination rules apply to the Web .
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said Roommates.com , which obliges users to list their sexual orientation , was different than Internet sites where people can volunteer or withhold personal information .
To inquire electronically about sexual orientation would not be different from asking people in person or by telephone if they were black or Jewish before conducting business , the panel said in an 8 - 3 ruling that partly overturns a lower federal court decision .
“ If such screening is prohibited when practiced in person or by telephone , we see no reason why Congress would have wanted to make it lawful to profit from it online , ” 9th Circuit chief judge Alex Kozinski wrote .
“ Not only does Roommate ask these questions , Roommate makes answering the discriminatory questions a condition of doing business . ”
Roommates.com says it offers more than 100,000 rental listings on its site across the United States and is owned by Roommate.com LLC .
The court contrasted such requests for information with online search engines such as Google , which could allow people to search for terms such as “ white roommate . ”
‘ CLOSE CASES ’
“ Web sites are complicated enterprises , and there will always be close cases where a clever lawyer could argue that something the Web site operator did encouraged the illegality , ” Kozinski wrote .
“ Such close cases , we believe , must be resolved in favor of immunity . ”
“ Where it is very clear that the Web site directly participates in developing the alleged illegality -- as it is clear here with respect to Roommate ’s questions , answers and the resulting profile pages -- immunity will be lost . ”
A Roommates.com section allowing users to add additional comments of their choosing is immune from liability as outlined in the 1996 Communications Decency Act , the San Francisco - based court found .
Congress “ did n’t intend to prevent the enforcement of all laws online , ” the court said .
“ Rather , it sought to encourage interactive computer services that provide users neutral tools to post content online to police that content without fear that ... they would become liable for every single message posted by third parties on their Web site , ” it said .
Three judges dissented , saying the court was creating a dangerous precedent and future confusion for Internet firms .
“ The majority ’s unprecedented expansion of liability for Internet service providers threatens to chill the robust development of the Internet that Congress envisioned , ” Judge Margaret McKeown wrote .
Roommates.com “ should be afforded no less protection than Google , Yahoo , or other search engines . ”
The Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley and the Fair Housing Council of San Diego filed suit against the Web site , claiming it violated the Fair Housing Act and various state laws .
( Sidenote : My , it has been a long time since I 've been on here and things have definitely changed !
I like ! )
I 'm sure many of you watched Duke beat the UNC Tar Heels , so I wo n't rehash it here .
But I do want to take the time to profile one particular player : Greg Paulus .
Paulus had a rough season last year , struggled to find his range , his game .
He is a smaller player among freakish athletes , and when he was n't performing well , he took a lot of flak .
A whole lot .
I 'm sure it was hard for him and his family to hear people openly discuss how awful they thought he was .
I will admit that I was in the category of people who doubted Paulus and wondered how he had made his way to Duke .
From all reports , he was a gifted QB so why would he come to a sport like basketball which seems to be such a struggle
But the mark of a real winner , a hero , if you will , is not what happens when the going is good .
It 's how they rise up when everyone thinks they are defeated .
Think about the movies .
The greatest heroes overcome adversity when all looks lost .
No guts , no glory , or so the saying goes .
Despite taking a beating from the public last year , in the last few games , Paulus has shown that Coach K was not crazy when he recruited him .
He has the range ( did you see where he was pulling from ?
He was taking whatever shot he wanted and they just dropped ) , he has heart , and even though he makes mistakes , he has shown that he can raise the level of his game to the elitest of the elite .
Which one do I value most ?
Heart .
You can teach someone how to shoot , but you can never teach heart .
And to be clear , heart is not celebrating like crazy when the other team makes a turnover in the first 10 minutes of the game .
You know who you are .
Back to Paulus .
To come back out here , still given a starting role on a squad that everyone thinks is way over your head , and now make the front page of ESPN.com ( that 's the pic above ) because of your 6 - 8 shooting from the 3 point line against the Tar Heels - that 's why we love sports .
Redemption .
Not only that , but because this is one of the biggest rivalries among all sports , his performance will probably make the big game preview reels for years to come .
While there is no telling what the future holds for Paulus , I for one am happy to see the " every man " who people least expect rising to the challenge when everyone counted him out .
That 's two in one week : Eli Manning and now Paulus .
Who 's got next ?

The nude image of Carla Bruni was sold for much more than expected
Photo being auctioned
A nude photograph of France 's first lady , Carla Bruni , has been auctioned for $ 91,000 ( £ 46,098 ) - more than 20 times the expected price .
The image was taken by photographer Michel Comte in 1993 , when Ms Bruni was a highly sought - after model .
The picture was bought by an anonymous bidder on behalf of a collector , said Christie 's auction house in New York , which sold the image .
The office of French President Nicolas Sarkozy has declined to comment .
Christie 's said the photograph had been expected to fetch between $ 3,000 and $ 4,000 .
The successful bid was for $ 75,000 , but with commission the actual price paid rose to $ 91,000 .
Rik Pike , a spokesman for the auction house , said " the media and the level of international interest for this photo " had " played their role " in the image being sold for a much higher sum .
Christie 's said money from the sale of the photograph will go to Swiss charity Sodis , which provides clean drinking water to developing countries .
The image was part of a selection of photographs auctioned by collector Gert Elfering .
It also included nude photos of models Lauren Hutton , Gisele Bundchen and Kate Moss , and an image of actress Brigitte Bardot by American photographer Richard Avedon which fetched $ 181,000 ( £ 91,600 ) .
Mr Sarkozy married Ms Bruni in February , less than four months after the end of his volatile 11 - year marriage to Cecilia Ciganer - Albeniz .
Our friends said we were crazy .
Relatives asked whether we were in financial trouble .
But in April 2005 , my wife and I bailed out of the American dream .
We sold our two - bedroom Pasadena condominium and became renters again .
We got nearly three times what we had paid for the place nine years earlier .
It seemed to us like a staggering profit -- and a sign that the market had been pumped up beyond reason .
That ’s why we decided to rent instead of buying another house right away .
We wanted a place with a yard and a third bedroom , but we were n’t willing to pay the sky - high price or take out an exotic mortgage to buy something our income did not justify .
So our plan was to take our profit and wait for prices to return to Earth .
The madness had to end , we thought .
For a while , we wondered whether we would prove to be the crazy ones as home values in Southern California overall continued rising through last spring .
But a closer inspection of real estate sales data shows that signs of trouble were already appearing when we sold .
Condo prices in the ZIP
Code where we owned ours peaked a few months after we got out in 2005 , at the median price of $ 480,000 ( almost exactly what we got for our place ) .
But at the time , a lot of people thought we had sold too early .
To stay on course , I adopted a personal anthem .
It was a Public Enemy song that hit big in 1988 during the previous real estate run-up : “ Do n’t Believe the Hype . ”
The song played in my head constantly .
I heard it whenever friends warned me that I would be missing out on massive future gains .
The music ’s volume went up as real estate agents said that if we stuck to our plan to sell and then rent , we could be priced out of the hot Southern California market for good .
The thumping chorus carried me through : “ Do n’t believe the hype ! ”
Now that the bubble has burst , my friends think I am a master of market timing .
Those who have n’t had their financial legs taken out from under them by the real estate crash are asking when they should buy investment properties to ride the next big wave of rapid appreciation .
As always , there ’s more to the story .
Lessons learned
Though I would like to claim special powers to read the future , I was really just resisting the market mania of the time .
The tech stock bubble was fresh in my mind , as was the early - 1990s real estate boom .
At the height of our most recent real estate run-up , there was constant talk of new reasons the market would not fall : immigrants , endless demand for scarce land in sunny Southern California and so on .
It all sounded to me like the Florida real estate boom chronicled by economist John Kenneth Galbraith : the boom of 1928 .
The Florida run-up , Galbraith wrote , contained “ the indispensable element of substance . ”
He meant Florida ’s obvious appeal as a sunny destination , much like that of Southern California .
Yet on top of that substance , real estate prices in Florida accelerated to the point that people depended on those gains to support their spending .
A similar phenomenon happened here .
I saw friends with otherwise good judgment buying houses they could n’t afford , confident that they could refinance when their home values went up by double - digit annual rates .
Others used home equity to pay for fancy cars , meals , vacations and other things that would never return any value .
Of the 1920s Florida bubble , Galbraith wrote , “ People want an excuse to believe ” in the boom and ca n’t be persuaded by evidence to the contrary .
This is what I saw in Southern California in 2005 .
The idea of an ever - rising real estate market was a favorite topic in much of the news media .
A Los Angeles Times Sunday magazine cover in November 2003 carried this headline : “ Will L.A. 's Real Estate Bubble Burst ?
No , Because There Is n’t One .
There ’s Just Too Much Demand , Not Enough Supply and No Room to Build .
None of That Will Change . ”
Reading those words , I thought of Galbraith , and those people in 1928 wanting an excuse to believe .
Legend has it that smart money on Wall Street knew the stock market was headed for a crash in 1929 when shoeshine boys started giving stock tips .
I sensed trouble when a homeless man told me he was studying for his real estate license .
When we held our one open house , the frenzied strangers who poured into our living room only deepened my sense that reason had given way to something like mania .
But even if I had picked up some of their exuberance and doubted myself , there was no time to reconsider .
The place sold in a week -- to a corporate economist -- while repairs were still underway , including one job that left a 3 - foot - wide hole in a ceiling .
I wondered what it would have taken to deter those eager buyers .
Asbestos ?
Rats ?
By the time the excited throngs cleared at the end of the first day , I no longer doubted my belief that the bubble was about to burst .
Reading the signs
About the time I was getting out of the market , Mark Kiesel was thinking about unloading his Newport Beach house .
An executive vice president of the Pimco investment firm , Kiesel ’s day job involved studying the housing market .
He did n’t like what he saw .
“ Basically , prices were inflated by incredibly cheap financing , ” Kiesel said .
He believed that credit would eventually tighten , which would lead to a rising inventory of houses for sale and fewer people able or willing to buy .
Kiesel had bought his house in 2004 with a 4.25 % mortgage rate .
“ When people are giving you a free lunch , you should question it .
I knew the person who loaned me money at that rate was crazy , ” he said .
“ That ’s why it had to stop . ”
So in the summer of 2006 , Kiesel sold his house -- netting a 20 % return on his investment -- and moved into a three - bedroom apartment with one - fifth the square footage of the house .
He and his wife , a lawyer , invested their proceeds in energy , metals and mining stocks .
Kiesel said they roughly doubled their money with those investments .
They are still renting the apartment , putting up with less space and keeping many of their belongings in storage .
Kiesel said he would not buy a house until 2009 or 2010 , when he thinks the market will turn around .
I ’m still renting too , but unlike Kiesel , I ’m an amateur when it comes to investing money .
Our proceeds have been in certificates of deposit while we wait to dive into homeownership again .
As a general rule , financial planners do n’t advise people to sell their house at a profit and invest in stocks or mutual funds .
“ We tell people do n’t try to time the market , ” said Laura Tarbox , a financial consultant in Newport Beach .
“ When you factor in the transaction costs of the sale , plus the [ mortgage ] tax benefits , it ’s rarely worth it -- and you still have to have a place to live . ”
To determine whether we made a smart decision , I asked Tarbox and her staff to run the numbers through a couple of scenarios .
Would we be better off now if we had simply kept the condo ?
Alternatively , what if we had bought a house right away after selling ?
Tarbox confirmed that we came out ahead by selling when we did because our condo dropped in value by about 5 % in the two years after we sold .
But our timing was extremely lucky , she said , and there are costs that eat into the windfall .
Indeed , though we made a healthy profit on the sale of our home , we ’ve had to pay rent for the last two years and have not had a mortgage interest deduction .
And when we buy a new home , we ’ll have lost the Proposition 13 property tax advantage -- meaning bigger tax bills .
We do n’t know how much bigger , however , because we do n’t know what we ’ll pay for our new house .
But had we stayed in the condo , we would also have paid about $ 14,500 in property taxes and homeowner ’s fees over the last two years -- money we could have potentially invested .
So in the end , Tarbox said , we came out well ahead .
We also did well by not buying right away .
Since we sold in 2005 , the median home price in Southern California has fallen about 9 % , according to DataQuick Information Systems .
That ’s a broad figure , but we have an example close to home that is even more on point .
One Pasadena house we ’ve had our eye on just happened to sell for $ 888,000 right after we closed our condo deal in 2005 .
It was repossessed and sold again by the bank for $ 720,000 in September -- a 19 % decline .
So had we bought that house , our investment would in theory have declined by 19 % .
Instead , we earned about 4 % on our money in CDs .
Any profit , however , must also be weighed against the intangible cost of living in a less - than - ideal rental house , one without air conditioning or a dishwasher and located an additional 20 minutes from my office .
I ’m pleased with our decision but suspect that many would not want to pay that price .
Kiesel likewise does n’t recommend that others follow the move he and his wife made .
“ I would n’t advise it at all , ” he said .
“ We were willing to sacrifice our living standards to make some money ; not everyone should do that . ”
That advice also makes sense if you put it this way : People should n’t expect to make money without sacrifice .
Great expectations
I ’ve always been wary of getting something for nothing , and that ’s what made me so dubious about our latest real estate bubble .
Too many people expected to get a bigger , better house without first earning more money .
They expected to be able to buy more things by borrowing against their home equity , not by working to boost their incomes or saving .
Many of the people who are struggling to make their house payments were duped by commission - chasing mortgage brokers who put them in loans they could n’t afford .
But it ’s also true that many of the borrowers who are in trouble knew they could n’t make the payments and were counting on rising home values to make up for any shortfalls .
As I thought through my own experience , I realized how much of a role values played in my own real estate decisions .
Memories ultimately mattered more than math .
When I was a child , my mother moonlighted at department stores in December to earn extra money for Christmas gifts , and I remember parents of many of my friends doing the same .
It never occurred to them to put everything on credit cards and worry about the consequences later .
I remembered moving as a young child to our first house in the suburbs after living in a couple of drab city apartments .
The dirt pile that would soon become our lawn was a thrilling sight .
I recalled a friend at work telling me that his family put their spare change in a cigar box for years , saving together as a family for the house they would eventually buy .
I wanted my own daughter to feel that same appreciation for our first house .
We do plan to buy again someday , on honest terms with a loan we can afford .
We did n’t expect to rent this long ; our girl is 8 , and we ’d like to get into a house soon that she will truly feel is hers .
We know the wait will make it that much more thrilling to her when we move .
But I hope the real reward comes years from now .
Maybe she will remember our experience and think twice when people are again promising something for nothing , as they inevitably will .
That lesson could be more durable than all the granite counter tops , copper pipes and oak floors in the dream houses peddled in the bubble .

See how the male toads ' mating tactics compare
Male S. bombifrons Male S. multiplicata
US researcher Karin Pfennig found female spadefoot toads will flout the general evolutionary rule of not breeding with other species .
She discovered that the amphibians , under some conditions , will mate with other species to help boost the survival rates of their offspring .
The research is published in the journal Science .
Spadefoots breed in small ponds , which can often dry out , killing any developing tadpoles .
Dr Pfennig , from the University of North Carolina , has discovered that when a pond is very shallow , one species of female spadefoot , S. bombifrons , will often mate with another closely related species , S. multiplicata , rather than males of their own kind .
She believes the reason is down to tadpole development .
S. bombifrons tadpoles develop much more slowly than S. multiplicata , meaning they have to spend longer in the ponds .
But the hybrid offspring between the two species develop rapidly , meaning that they are more likely to survive if the pond dries out quickly .

TOKYO ( Reuters Life ! ) -
The 14 felines - in - residence at Tokyo ’s Cat Cafe Calico excel at their job of making customers purr with delight .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
“ This place is n’t on my way from work , but even if I ’m pretty tired , I ’d still stop by , ” said 32 - year - old system engineer and a Calico regular Kazunori Hamanaka , as he tried to take a photo of a white and brown Bengal cat curling up in a box .
“ Stray cats run away when I try to stroke them .
Here , it ’s great that I can do that , ” said Hamanaka , who is unable to keep pets at home .
He takes about 200 photos on each visit for his blog .
Calico is one of at least three cafes that have opened up in Tokyo this year where visitors can mingle with cats as they enjoy a cup of tea .
Takafumi Fukui , the 34 - year - old owner and a long - time cat lover , quit his job at a television game company and started the cafe in March .
“ In Tokyo , it ’s not that easy to have cats , ” he said , explaining that tight housing regulations often forbid pets .
Visitors to Calico pay 800 yen ( $ 7 ) an hour or 2,000 yen for three hours in a big room where 14 well - brushed and shampooed cats hang out .
After a thorough handwash , the visitor can play with the cats , read comics or just relax .
The clean , odorless cafe -- Calico has six air fresheners and the litter trays are out of sight -- gets about 70 visitors a day during the week and 150 a day at weekends .
“ I want everyone to forget about their jobs and relax , ” Fukui said , adding that the majority of visitors to Calico are working women and children , and about 70 percent overall do n’t own cats due to allergies or housing regulations .
None of Calico ’s cats are strays , but the cafe puts up posters for abandoned cats seeking homes .
Pet dumping is a problem in Japan , where about 240,000 cats and 160,000 dogs without owners are gassed each year , government data showed .
The Calico cats are fortunate to have their admirers .
“ It is really soothing , ” Hamanaka said about his frequent visits .
“ Even three hours is not enough . ”
Americans ’ confidence in the economy continued to plunge this month as their homes lost value at the fastest rate in two decades , according to reports released on Tuesday .
The data suggested that the housing slump was far from a recovery and the job market might continue to weaken , ratcheting up pressure on the Federal Reserve , which began a two - day meeting on Tuesday , to take steps to stave off a prolonged slowdown .
The reports were consistent with a recession , economists said , though some optimists have insisted the economy is growing , albeit at a snail ’s pace .
President Bush remained in the latter camp at a news conference on Tuesday , where he said the economy was facing “ a tough time . ”
Much of the damage has stemmed from a slump in the housing market , where prices are nearly 15 percent off their high in July 2006 .

Many chimneys have been made unsafe across the region
Gales battering East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire are threatening to dislodge chimneys weakened by this week 's earthquake , firemen have warned .
Humberside Fire Service has been called out to dangerous chimney stacks and roofing at properties in Bridlington , Hull , Grimsby and Cleethorpes .
Firefighters had attended about 20 incidents by early Friday evening .
In one incident a chimney stack fell on to a bungalow in Coldstream Close , Tweed Grove , Hull , but no - one was hurt .
Elsewhere a driver was taken to hospital after a car was hit by a tree which fell in high winds on the A165 Beverley to Driffield road .
Firefighters freed the trapped person from a Ford Focus which blocked the main road .
In Scunthorpe , a woman was treated in hospital for neck pains after part of a stable was blown onto a car .
The Met Office issued a severe weather warning for the region , with gusts expected to reach up to 80 mph overnight .
In the early hours of Wednesday , properties across the region were shaken by the biggest earthquake to hit the UK in almost 25 years .
' Dangerous job '
The epicentre of the 5.2 magnitude quake was near Market Rasen in Lincolnshire .
The fire service received hundreds of calls from concerned residents in the aftermath of the tremor .
Humberside Fire Service spokesman Glenn Ramsden said : " For the second time within a few days our crews are braving the elements to make structures safe .
" This can be a very dangerous job and we advise people to stay clear of the area that our firefighters are working in . "
" Since last summer we 've had to deal with floods , an earthquake and now gales .
The only thing we have n't had is a heatwave . "
He urged residents to have any damaged property checked out by a competent builder as soon as possible .
" If the damage is not attended to , it will only get worse and should more severe weather hit the area , the damage could become life threatening , " added Mr Ramsden .
The SFGate reports about a study conducted by Duke University that showed that 75 % of college applicants cheated in some form on their way to college .
Whether that meant copying homework or utilizing Wikipedia for their academic efforts , the concerns about ethics and college admissions is growing .
The sad reality is that the students are winning while the teachers are losing .
The article claims that when teachers find out that a student has cheated , the administration does not necessarily back them up .
The word of the student is usually valued more heavily than the word of the teacher , and professional integrity becomes a problem within the community when the students ’ lies are put first .
In one case , a Stanford student continually asked her professors for a “ regrade ” after she changed the answers on a test .
When her professor caught her red handed by photocopying the original exam , the university admonished the professor for violating an honor code — an honor code that the student herself did not even keep .
So what can be done ?
Some schools are working directly with the parents .
Cheating becomes an issue that involves the parents from the first infraction .
After that , the risk becomes greater : a F on the course .
Why do students cheat ?
The goal to become successful is by far one of the presiding reasons behind this apparent lack of ethics .
As such , Stanford has a program called SOS ( Stressed Out Students ) that intervenes whenever stress is the culprit and reason behind cheating .
For now , the system is somewhat working .
Stiff penalties make it more difficult for students to cheat .
But that ’s just scraping the surface .
Many of my courses were laden with students who cheated on every single homework or test — and let ’s be honest here , I have n’t been innocent , either .
In the end , remember that if you ’re aiming for the highest score and eventually make it to the college of your choice while cheating your way through college , you may not succeed in the school of your dreams .
Instead , you ’ll find yourself to be miles behind your classmates .
You ’ll also find it important if not crucial to continue the trend of cheating .
It ’s just not worth it .
You could spend that time learning for the course instead of stressing that your classmate has the answers .
College is a knowledge - seeking venture , and bluffing your way through it is n’t the way to go .
More importantly , cheating is just a dishonest thing to do .
And the only one you fool is yourself .
Google finalized its $ 3.1 billion purchase of ad delivery giant DoubleClick Tuesday after European Union regulators ruled that the purchase does not violate anti-monopoly rules in Europe which removed the last legal hurdle for the hotly contested acquisition .
Microsoft hoped that regulators in Europe and the United States would block or attach conditions to the purchase as a way to slow Google 's growing lead in online advertising and search .
Privacy groups opposed the sale on the grounds it would give Google too much information about what individuals do on the internet and thus much power to shape what content is created online .
The European Commission did not see it that way :
[ T ]he merged entity would not have the ability to engage in strategies aimed at marginalising Google 's competitors , mainly because of the presence of credible ad serving alternatives to which customers ( publishers / advertisers / ad networks ) can switch , in particular vertically integrated companies such as Microsoft , Yahoo ! and AOL .
The market investigation also found that the merged entity would not have the incentive to close off access for competitors in the ad serving market , mainly because such strategies would be unlikely to be profitable .
DoubleClick is an ad serving and management company that web publishers use to display and target visual and rich media advertising .
The technology uses a DoubleClick cookie that reports back every time a user visits a site using the system , letting DoubleClick know that user 453689 likes to read motocross stories and GQ magazine and spends a lot of time playing online Flash games .
Google can merge that database with its deep knowledge of users ' search histories , along with its growing database of URLs visited by Google users who do n't realize that Google opts - in users users with accounts to its " Web History " program .
That program continually tracks their every step on the internet , not just when they are on a Google property , though that is n't clearly disclosed when users create a Google account nor even if they click on the " learn more " link .
So what does the purchase mean for citizens on the web ?
Very clearly , you will soon be seeing more ads served by Google technology , and Google technology will be seeing and saving more information about what you do around the web than every before .
Prior to the purchase Google said it could not say what privacy policies will govern the new online behavioral database made possible by its acquisitions , citing SEC rules .
But they did say it would improve the privacy practices around what are known as ' third party cookies , ' that is , cookies served up by a website that are not attached to that particular domain ( such as the Google Analytics cookie served up on THREAT LEVEL ) .
A Google spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment on what Google 's new policies will be for letting users opt - in or out - of tracking around the web .
Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy says the EU , like the FCC before it , does n't get the power of Google 's ad network to shape what content gets published on the web .
" By failing to impose safeguards , EC regulators have helped strengthen a growing digital colossus that will now be in a dominant position to shape much of the global future of the Internet and other online media , " Chester said in a press release .
" This decision will have profound and unfortunate consequences for the Internet ’s evolving role as a democratic communications medium . "
Like Chester , the Annenberg School of Communication 's Joseph Turow sees a foreshadowing of Microsoft buying Yahoo , thus creating a virtual duopoly in online advertising .
There is no stopping of the centralized collection and use of data about consumer ’s habits online and off . [...]
The decision portends the approval of Microsoft ’s bid to buy Yahoo , and of Reed Elsevier ’s decision to purchase Choicepoint .
In the face of a very few companies that can track all of us across media and a very few companies that can sell the media trackers even more specific information about all of us , a basic question becomes increasingly important :
What can citizens who want to control the data companies and governments have about them ( data which really tell the stories of their lives ) do ?
UPDATE : Although Google repeatedly told THREAT LEVEL it had great , but legally unspeakable plans to revamp DoubleClick 's third - party information collection practices , the plans turn out to be vaporware .
Google spokeswoman Victoria Grand writes in :
We just closed today , so we do n't have anything to update at this point .
We are only now able to begin to integrate our operations .
In the meantime , we have been working with others in the industry on the issue of privacy and advertising . [...]
[ We ] believe the industry and others interested in this , including the FTC , will agree on some helpful guidelines .
In addition to that , our policy experts , product managers and engineers have been looking at third party ad serving and privacy broadly .
If these efforts come up with useful innovations , we may offer them as suggestions for industry - wide adoption .
And Martin Laetsch , senior director of search strategy at marketing analytics firm Covario , provides some perspective on what the purchase means for Google 's revenues and their tracking databases .
With this offering , Google will now be a legitimate player in banners , video , and rich media and can offer advertisers a direct means of purchasing the majority of their online media – without an agency intermediary .
This is great for [ small and medium - sized businesses ] since it is quick and easy , but big brands get nervous when a large portion of their budget is going through a single company .
Google already has 32 % of US online ad spending and it is going to go up with this acquisition .
Google ’s revenues will sky rocket with this deal , but it will probably force large advertisers to start looking closely at the offerings from Yahoo and Microsoft .
Google now has behavioral targeting ( BT ) capabilities with DoubleClick ’s DFA product .
This is contrary to Google ’s own stated privacy policies with regards to keeping customer information which is at the heart of behavioral targeting .
Google ’s response to this is “ We are committed to transparency for end users , and to respecting the choices they make with regards to their privacy preferences . ”
They may end up with some sort of universal opt - out for tracking information , but it would n’t be surprising to see Google start to integrate behavioral targeting across multiple forms of media to start getting a comprehensive media mix optimization recommendation late in 2008 .
All of which leads THREAT LEVEL to say – get thee to the Customize Google extension for Firefox , which lets you anonymize your Google userid , block Google analytics tracking and prevent click tracking by making sure your Google web search results do n't have re-written urls .
Final Update May 13 -
Google 's Victoria Grand wrote in Wednesday to add :
You may want to point out in your piece that Web
History is for users who have chosen to sign up for a Google account and that during that sign up process the user can choose not to have Web History .
The way your piece reads now suggests that anyone searching on Google has Web History , which is not the case .
It is also important to point out that those with Web
History can delete their Web History either entirely , or in parts , at their own discretion any time they like .
Regarding merging data , there are contractual restrictions with customers which limit what we are able to do with DoubleClick data .
We closed the acquisition yesterday so are only now beginning to integrate our operations .
So , there is no data that is being combined as you describe .
Also , you should note that there is an opt - out option for users who want to delete DoubleClick cookies .

A life of splendour and opulence could soon be over for Nepal 's King Gyanendra , with the country 's monarchy facing abolition after landmark elections today .
His Royal Highness Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev is one of a kind - the world 's last Hindu king .
But the controversial monarch , who seized absolute power three years ago , looks set to be the last ruler from the Himalayan nation 's 238 - year - old Shah dynasty .
And there are n't too many subjects weeping tears at the prospect , says Kathmandu newspaper editor Kunda Dixit .
" I think it 's the end of the road .
The joke two years ago was that the biggest republican in the country was King Gyanendra himself , " Mr Dixit said .
" I think a lot of people , as elections come around , are now seeing the monarchy not as a symbol of unity but as a symbol of division in this country and that as long as there is this very ambitious king around , that we 'll never really have peace . "
King Gyanendra is the accidental king .
He came to the throne in 2001 when his drug and booze - fuelled nephew massacred the king and most of the royal family .
After that inauspicious start to a new reign , things worsened when King Gyanendra sacked the Government and imposed direct rule in 2005 .
The king claimed the commoners had failed to end the war with the country 's Maoist guerilla movement .
But he ended up at war with his own subjects , who eventually forced him into a climb down .
Once parliament was restored , politicians did King Gyanendra slowly .
Mr Dixit says the king has done this to himself .
" Not just to himself , but to the institution of monarchy .
First of all by trying to be an autocratic king at a time when modern monarchs should be in the background and sort of steering things , if at all having a hand politics , " he said .
" He wanted absolute power .
His hatred for the political process and democracy was so deep that he wanted it all for himself . "
On his way down , King Gyanendra experienced a few humiliations .
He has been made to pay tax , had his face taken off the currency , and forced to live without as many servants at the palace .
In these apparently dying days of the last Hindu king 's reign , there are lurid tales of Gyanendra sheltering behind the big pink wall of the Kathmandu palace surrounded by astrologers , counting his money and plotting an escape by a helicopter kept permanently fuelled up on the front lawn .
That he even has a helicopter at his disposal irks some of his subjects , who get to have their say today on whether King Gyanendra is indeed the last king of Nepal .
- Adapted from a story first aired on AM , April 10 .
WASHINGTON , March 14 -- A team of researchers in Bedford , Mass .
has developed a way of examining brain tissue with near - infrared light to detect signs of Alzheimer 's disease .
In the March 15 issue of the journal Optics Letters , published by the Optical Society of America , the team describes how they used optical technology to examine tissue samples taken from different autopsies and correctly identified which samples came from people who had Alzheimer 's disease .
Alzheimer 's currently afflicts some 4.5 million Americans and is the most common cause of dementia among older people in the United States .
" We 're primarily interested in finding a way of diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer 's disease during life , " says U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Research Scientist Eugene Hanlon .
" We think this technique has a lot of potential for detecting the disease early on . "
The new technique developed by Hanlon and his collaborators at Harvard Medical School / Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Boston University can detect alterations to the optical properties of the brain that occur as the tissue undergoes microscopic changes due to Alzheimer 's -- sometimes far in advance of clinical symptoms .
The technique is now being tested for its effectiveness at diagnosing Alzheimer 's disease in living people .
For several years , Hanlon and his colleagues have looked at the possibility of analyzing the brain with near - infrared light , which has the advantage of being able to safely penetrate the skull and pass harmlessly through the brain .
Inside the head , some of the infrared light scatters , however , and how the light scatters can tell researchers about the condition of the brain .
In their paper , the team reports observing an optical effect due to the presence of microscopic features of Alzheimer's .
Amyloid plaques , one of the telltale signs of Alzheimer 's disease , scatter light differently from normal brain tissue .
What Hanlon and his colleagues showed was that as the microscopic plaques accumulate , the optical properties of the brain change .
The team found that this change is detectable and that their technique could quantify differences between in - vitro samples and correctly identify signs of Alzheimer's .
This technique will be a boon to medicine if it is able to detect microscopic changes that can be related to disease progression .
While techniques like MRI are good at identifying the gross anatomical features associated with Alzheimer 's , they cannot detect more microscopic changes .
Although Alzheimer 's disease is one of the leading causes of death in the United States , claiming tens of thousands of American lives a year , there is no definitive way to diagnose it -- at least not while someone is alive .
After someone with Alzheimer 's dies , pathologists can perform an autopsy and examine slices of the brain under the microscope , looking for the same signs that Alois Alzheimer first recognized when he identified the disease more than a century ago .
Finding accumulations of amyloid plaques in the brain substance and tangle - like proteins in nerve cells is the only way to confirm with certainty that someone had Alzheimer 's while they were alive .
Since there is no way to safely examine the brains of living people this way , doctors currently diagnose Alzheimer 's disease using other methods .
They rely on reviewing medical histories , administering physical exams , and taking into account the results of a battery of neuropsychological assessments that measure cognitive performance .
A positive diagnosis is made when all other possible causes have been eliminated , but even under the best of circumstances , these diagnoses can be incorrect 10 percent of the time or more .
Accurate , early detection of Alzheimer 's could save many lives .
While there is no cure for the disease , clinically proven treatments can slow its progress -- especially if they are administered early on .
Moreover , being able to follow the disease progression over time would greatly enhance the ability of researchers and pharmaceutical companies to find new and improved drugs and treatment strategies for people at all stages of the disease .
A current rich area of research seeks to get information about what is going on in the brain without actually looking at the tissue .
Some scientists , for instance , look at whether proteins and other biomarkers in the blood or spinal fluid indicate disease progression .
Others try to image the brain with established techniques like MRI or PET scans .
Optical methods , like the one used by the Bedford researchers , are an emerging approach to imaging .

For better or worse , I am partly responsible for the recent emergence of “ atheism ” as a topic of conversation .
This is somewhat ironic , as I do not like the term and rarely use it .
I did not , for instance , refer to myself as an “ atheist ” when I wrote The End of Faith — and yet this book is my most substantial contribution to the discourse of atheism .
As I pointed out in my subsequent book , Letter to a Christian Nation , we do not have a term for a person who rejects astrology , nor do we need one .
If legions of astrologers sought to bend our public policy to their pseudo - science , we would n’t need to dub ourselves “ non-astrologers ” to put them in their place .
Words like “ reason , ” “ evidence , ” and “ commonsense ” would suffice .
So it should be with religion .
Still , one can only spend so much time quibbling over words , and there are far more consequential matters for believers and nonbelievers to discuss .
Despite my misgivings about answering to the name “ atheist , ” I consider the stigma now associated with the term to be entirely unwarranted .
This stigma is , of course , the continuous product of the inane and unctuous declarations that still pass for argument among the faithful .
One need look no further than the responses to this week ’s question to find some mesmerizing examples .
As to whether atheists and believers can have “ a productive conversation , ” I am quite sure that the answer is “ yes . ”
But I am uncertain whether this conversation can bear fruit quickly enough to keep civilization from becoming fully engorged by Iron Age stupidity and horror .
Our capacity for self - destruction is now spreading with 21st century efficiency , and yet our beliefs about how we should pass our days and nights on this earth still spring from ancient literature .
This marriage of modern technology and preliterate superstition is a bad one , for reasons that I should not have to specify , much less argue for — and yet , arguing for them has taken up most of my time since September 11th , 2001 , the day that nineteen pious men showed our pious nation just how beneficial religious certainty can be .
As someone who has spent the last few years publicly criticizing religion , I have become quite familiar with how people of faith rise to the defense of God .
As it turns out , there are n’t a hundred ways of doing this .
There appear to be just three : either a person argues that a specific religion is true , or he argues that religion is useful , or he simply attacks atheism as intolerant , elitist , irrational , or otherwise worthy of contempt .
Any conversation between atheists and believers is liable to fall into one or more of these ruts , or lurch back and forth between them :
1. Religion is true :
There are two problems with arguing that any one of the world ’s religions is true .
First , as Bertrand Russell pointed out a century ago , the major religions make incompatible claims about God and about what human beings must believe in order to escape the fires of hell .
Given the sheer diversity of these claims , every believer should expect damnation on mere , probabilistic grounds .
The second problem with arguing for the truth of religion is that the evidence for the most common religious doctrines is terrible or nonexistent — and this subsumes all claims about the existence of a personal God , the divine origin of certain books , the virgin birth of certain people , the veracity of ancient miracles , etc .
For thousands of years , religion has been a haven for dogmatism and false certainty , and it remains so .
There is not a person on this earth who has sufficient reason to be certain that Jesus rose from the dead or that Muhammad spoke to the angel Gabriel in his cave .
And yet , billions of people profess such certainty .
This is embarrassing .
It is also dangerous — and we should stop making apologies for it .
2. Religion is useful :
The argument that religion is useful is also problematic — and many of its problems are enunciated daily by bomb - blasts .
Can anyone seriously argue that it is a good thing that millions of Muslims currently believe in the metaphysics of martyrdom ?
Is it really so useful that many Jews imagine that the Creator of the universe gave them a patch of desert on the Mediterranean ?
How psychologically beneficial has Christianity ’s anxiety about sex been these last seventy generations ?
The worst problem with arguing for religion ’s usefulness , however , is that it is utterly irrelevant to the question at hand : the fact that a belief might be useful is no argument that it is true .
While there are many ways to illustrate this , here is how I recently made the point in an online debate :
The fact that certain religious beliefs might be useful in no way suggests their legitimacy .
I can guarantee , for instance , that the following religion , invented by me in the last ten seconds , would be extraordinarily useful .
It is called “ Scientismo . ”
Here is its creed :
Be kind to others ; do not lie , steal , or murder ; and oblige your children to master mathematics and science to the best of their abilities or 17 demons will torture you with hot tongs for eternity after death .
If I could spread this faith to billions , I have little doubt that we would live in a better world than we do at present .
Would this suggest that the 17 demons of Scientismo exist ?
Useful delusions are not the same thing as true beliefs .
3 . Atheism is bad :
Rather than argue for the truth of their religious beliefs , or produce evidence that religion is useful , apologists for God often attack atheism as though it were another religion .
We are told that atheism is dogmatic , intolerant , irrational , etc .
This homily has the virtue of being easy to remember and reproduce — and it now reverberates ceaselessly within the echo - chamber of American religious discourse .
It relies , however , on a many false ideas about atheism .
On Christmas eve of this year , I published an essay in the Los Angeles Times entitled “ 10 Myths – and 10 Truths – about Atheism ” in which I attempted to set the record straight .
I wo n’t repeat these points here .
Those interested can find this article on my website .
BELGRADE ( Reuters ) - Serb protesters ransacked and set fire to the U.S. embassy in Belgrade on Thursday , venting anger at U.S. support for Kosovo ’s declaration of independence .
A charred body was later found inside , but all American personnel had been accounted for and nothing suggested it was an embassy employee , U.S. officials said .
Riot police -- nowhere to be seen when the attack began -- eventually moved in to disperse the rampaging protesters but Washington was furious .
At U.S. request , the U.N. Security Council condemned “ mob attacks ” on the embassy in Belgrade .
U.S. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns called Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic to protest at the lack of security .
“ The message was very clear , that the situation was intolerable , that they needed to act immediately to provide adequate security , ” a State Department spokesman said .
Kostunica , who had earlier addressed a state - backed rally by some 200,000 Serbs against Kosovo ’s secession , had promised it would not happen again .
There were lesser attacks on other diplomatic missions , but none was entered .
Germany said its embassy was attacked , Croatia protested over damage and local agencies said missions of Britain , Turkey and Bosnia were also hit .
Hospital officials said around 150 people were injured in street clashes , including 30 police and a Dutch reporter .
Serbia ’s foreign minister swiftly condemned the violence by a few hundred “ vandals ” .
Jeremic told Reuters in an interview the attacks on embassies and foreign businesses were unacceptable and regrettable acts by isolated extremists .
“ They hurt Serbia ’s image abroad , they do not represent the collective feeling of the Serbian people , ” he said .
“ Acts of violence are not going to be permitted on the streets of Belgrade or anywhere in Serbia . ”
Gangs also vandalized shops and banks , especially Western ones , leaving a trail of smashed glass and debris .
There was some looting .
Serbia considers Kosovo its historic heartland and has waged a diplomatic campaign against the secession of the predominantly ethnic Albanian region , which declared independence on Sunday .
Thursday ’s “ people ’s rally ” from which the rioters emerged was Serbia ’s biggest since protesters filled the streets in 2000 and stormed the old Yugoslav parliament building to oust nationalist autocrat Slobodan Milosevic .
“ As long as we live , Kosovo is Serbia , ” Kostunica told the crowd in front of the same building .
“ We ’re not alone in our fight .
President ( Vladimir ) Putin is with us , ” he said , paying tribute to the Russian leader who has opposed U.S. and European states ’ recognition of Kosovo .

The rally had been subdued as Serbs of all ages listened to speeches , melancholic patriotic songs and poems about Kosovo , seen as the birthplace of a medieval kingdom and Serbia ’s religious roots .
NO POLICE
When police arrived to disperse the crowd at the U.S. embassy -- under attack for the second time in a week -- they fired teargas and beat and detained rioters .
They secured the streets and tried to cordon off the whole embassy district .
Rioters -- many wearing balaclavas and scarves to hide their faces -- had attacked the U.S. embassy with sticks and metal bars after destroying two guard boxes outside .
Slideshow ( 47 images )
They ripped metal grilles from windows and tore a handrail off the entrance to use as a battering ram and gain entry .
One man climbed up and ripped the Stars and Stripes off its pole .
Other people jumped up and down on the balcony , holding up a Serbian flag as the crowd below of about 1,000 people cheered them on , shouting “ Serbia , Serbia ” .
Black smoke billowed out of the embassy .
Papers and chairs were thrown out of the windows , with doors wedged in the window frames and burning .
American officials said only security personnel were at the embassy at the time , in a different area .
PRAYERS
Meanwhile , the main rally proceeded as planned with a march to the city ’s biggest Orthodox cathedral for a prayer service .
State television switched between scenes of the rioting and the serenity of choral singing at the church service .
The lack of passion at the main rally appeared to support comments by Western analysts and some ordinary people that most Serbs were bitter but resigned to the loss of Kosovo and tired of years of conflict with neighboring states .
“ I do n’t think this protest might change anything , but I do n’t see any other way to express my dissatisfaction , ” said Danica , a government employee who declined to give her surname .
In other protests , several hundred Serb army veterans stoned Kosovo police at a border before dispersing .
No one was hurt .
In Banja Luka in Bosnia , several people were hurt when protesters clashed with police at the U.S. consulate .

Among simple even numbers , some are superabundant , others are deficient : these two classes are as two extremes opposed to one another ; as for those that occupy the middle position between the two , they are said to be perfect .
And those which are said to be opposite to each other , the superabundant and the deficient , are divided in their condition , which is inequality , into the too much and the too little .

In the case of the too much , is produced excess , superfluity , exaggerations and abuse ; in the case of too little , is produced wanting , defaults , privations and insufficiencies .
And in the case of those that are found between the too much and the too little , that is in equality , is produced virtue , just measure , propriety , beauty and things of that sort - of which the most exemplary form is that type of number which is called perfect .

There exists an elegant and sure method of generating these numbers , which does not leave out any perfect numbers and which does not include any that are not ; and which is done in the following way .
First set out in order the powers of two in a line , starting from unity , and proceeding as far as you wish : 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 , 256 , 512 , 1024 , 2048 , 4096 ; and then they must be totalled each time there is a new term , and at each totalling examine the result , if you find that it is prime and non-composite , you must multiply it by the quantity of the last term that you added to the line , and the product will always be perfect .
If , otherwise , it is composite and not prime , do not multiply it , but add on the next term , and again examine the result , and if it is composite leave it aside , without multiplying it , and add on the next term .
If , on the other hand , it is prime , and non-composite , you must multiply it by the last term taken for its composition , and the number that results will be perfect , and so on as far as infinity .

... only one is found among the units , 6 , only one other among the tens , 28 , and a third in the rank of the hundreds , 496 alone , and a fourth within the limits of the thousands , that is , below ten thousand , 8128 .
And it is their accompanying characteristic to end alternately in 6 or 8 , and always to be even .
When these have been discovered , 6 among the units and 28 in the tens , you must do the same to fashion the next .
... the result is 496 , in the hundreds ; and then comes 8128 in the thousands , and so on , as far as it is convenient for one to follow .

Six is a number perfect in itself , and not because God created all things in six days ; rather , the converse is true .
God created all things in six days because the number is perfect ...

... I think I am able to prove that there are no even numbers which are perfect apart from those of Euclid ; and that there are no odd perfect numbers , unless they are composed of a single prime number , multiplied by a square whose root is composed of several other prime number .
But I can see nothing which would prevent one from finding numbers of this sort .
For example , if 22021 were prime , in multiplying it by 9018009 which is a square whose root is composed of the prime numbers 3 , 7 , 11 , 13 , one would have 198585576189 , which would be a perfect number .
But , whatever method one might use , it would require a great deal of time to look for these numbers ...

... here are three propositions I have discovered , upon which I hope to erect a great structure .
The numbers less by one than the double progression , like
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
1 3 7 15 31 63 127 255 511 1023 2047 4095 8191 let them be called the radicals of perfect numbers , since whenever they are prime , they produce them .
Put above these numbers in natural progression 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , etc. , which are called their exponents .
This done , I say
When the exponent of a radical number is composite , its radical is also composite .
Just as 6 , the exponent of 63 , is composite , I say that 63 will be composite .
When the exponent is a prime number , I say that its radical less one is divisible by twice the exponent .
Just as 7 , the exponent of 127 , is prime , I say that 126 is a multiple of 14 .
When the exponent is a prime number , I say that its radical cannot be divisible by any other prime except those that are greater by one than a multiple of double the exponent ...
Here are three beautiful propositions which I have found and proved without difficulty , I shall call them the foundations of the invention of perfect numbers .
I do n't doubt that Frenicle de Bessy got there earlier , but I have only begun and without doubt these propositions will pass as very lovely in the minds of those who have not become sufficiently hypocritical of these matters , and I would be very happy to have the opinion of M Roberval .

Authoritarians seeking to extend repression have always drawn innocents into manufactured crises .
None was more innocent than Jacques Barrot , who , in 2005 , helped trigger a wave of death when he entered France 's annual pig squealing contest at the Pyrenean village of Trie- sur - Baïse .
Barrot did n't win : that honour went to Yohann and Olivier Roussel for delivering an impressive impersonation of pigs mating .
However , history remembers Barrot rather than the Roussels because an Associated Press photographer snapped him wearing a plastic snout standing at the microphone and put it on the news wires .
The next time it appeared , someone had doctored the picture and added the caption : ' Here is the real image of Mohammed . '
Two radical imams , whom Denmark had foolishly welcomed as asylum seekers , included it in a dossier they were hawking round the dictatorships of the Middle East , on how Danish newspaper Jyllands - Posten had insulted Muslims .
After at least 100 deaths and the storming of Danish embassies in Syria and Iran , journalists pointed out that the newspaper had n't included a picture of M Barrot among the innocuous cartoons it had run to uphold the right to mock religion .
The clerics then said an anonymous poison pen writer had sent the wounding picture to a Danish Muslim .
It was , they added , an insult to their faith as great as Ayaan Hirsi Ali 's championing of the rights of Muslim women .
Too many people forgot too quickly that the violence of 2005 did not have as its ' root cause ' the decision of a small Danish newspaper to satirise the godly .
For three months after Jyllands - Posten published , there was no rage from the ' Arab street ' or any other street .
Only after lobbying from the imams and sly political calculation from the powerful did the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) unleash the protests by demanding that the UN impose sanctions on Denmark .
Like the Reichstag fire and Sergei Kirov 's assassination , the cartoons controversy most suited those who affected to be most outraged .
The mayhem continues .
Last month , Danish police arrested suspects allegedly planning to attack a cartoonist .
Danish papers reprinted the cartoons as a gesture of solidarity .
( As no British editor has had the nerve to run them , I should say nearly every issue of Private Eye has more ' provocative ' jokes about Christianity . )
The Sudanese government threatened to expel Danish aid workers in retaliation .
Sudan is one of the largest recipients of aid from Denmark .
If that stops , more will die .
In language filled with the optimism of the struggles against 20th - century totalitarianism , Article 19 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights states : ' Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek , receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers . '
But faced with a conflict between high principle and a reactionary stunt , the UN Secretary General chose the side of the hysterics .
A spokeswoman for Ban Ki-moon said that he thought that the new cartoon controversy showed that ' freedom of expression should be exercised responsibly and in a way that respects all religious beliefs ' .
All religious beliefs , that is .
Even if they do not respect each other .
Even if by the normal standards of intellectual life , they make no sense .
Even if the behaviour of their followers does not inspire respect , but fear .
If the UN were to order us to ' respect all political beliefs ' , conservatives would say they were n't prepared to respect communists , leftists would say they were n't prepared to respect fascists and everyone else would burst out laughing .
Yet the UN Human Rights Council is proposing in all seriousness to protect religion by doctoring its universal defence of freedom of expression .
The OIC is pushing it to approve a super - blasphemy law that would make it an offence to ' defame ' any religion .
Keith Porteous
Wood of the National Secular Society said attending the discussions was an Orwellian experience , with speakers using the language of liberalism to justify oppression .
' Anyone seeking to draw attention to the capital offence of apostasy in Islamic countries will be lucky to be heard , ' he reported .
' Anything deemed the slightest bit critical of Islam is immediately jumped upon . '
To the bafflement of outsiders , communist China and Cuba have joined the states of the Islamic conference .
Both are officially atheist and China persecutes its Muslim minority .
But what unites dictatorships is more important than what divides them and no one should be surprised that communist elites will use any weapon available to assault principles which threaten their power .
Sitting in Britain , it is easy to feel superior .
We can dismiss the UN as a club without rules that negates its own standards by granting membership to countries that break every article in the declaration of human rights .
You need only look around to realise that complacency is unwarranted .
Last week , Channel 4 launched a libel action against West Midlands Police and the Crown Prosecution Service , which had accused its film - makers of inventing all - too - real scenes of clerics preaching misogyny , anti-semitism and homophobia .
They must have found accurate investigative reporting disrespectful .
The government seeks to deny us the very language we need to describe religious terror and insists civil servants do n't call Islamic extremists Islamic extremists but ' anti-Islamic extremists ' .
He is n't alone in succumbing to obfuscation and appeasement .
The past five years have been among the most shameful in BBC history .
It presents tiny groups of extreme right wingers as the authentic voice of Islam while shunning liberal - minded Muslims or asking hard questions of those who would oppress them .
Meanwhile , it is not only authoritarian states at the UN which want a universal blasphemy law .
The Archbishop of Canterbury is as keen on criminalising criticism .
AP reported that Yohann and Olivier Roussel triumphed after unleashing a ' cacophony of oinks and grunts ' .
Why go to Trie - sur - Baïse when you can hear them at home ?
A coalition of black leaders and pastors called on the federal government yesterday to “ defund ” Planned Parenthood from receiving $ 336.7 million annually in government funds and accused the family planning giant of targeting unborn black children .
Standing on the lawn in front of the Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington building at 1108 16th St. NW , black leaders cited a series of YouTube videos recorded by a group of students from the University of California at Los Angeles .
The students posed as donors who wanted their money to help abort a black child .
Recordings of their conversations with clinic workers in New Mexico , Ohio , Idaho and Oklahoma posted on YouTube showed the workers agreeing to the donations .
“ Let ’s demand the firings of those employees , ” said the Rev. Clenard Childress , founder of BlackGenocide .
org .
“ Black America must wake up and stand up to this racist organization that purposely plans abortion facilities firmly in black and minority neighborhoods and urban communities , sometimes right next door to schools , ” said Day Gardner , president of the National Black Pro-Life Union .
She gestured toward a charter school a few doors away .
In one YouTube exchange , James O’Keefe , a first - year law student at UCLA and an adviser for the Advocate , a pro-life student newspaper , called the Columbus , Ohio , Planned Parenthood affiliate on July 10 to say he wanted to donate the money “ because there ’s definitely way too many black people in Ohio . ”
The unidentified Planned Parenthood worker responded , “ Well , for whatever reason , we ’ll accept the money . ”
In a statement last month , Planned Parenthood said , “ Two local employees violated the organization ’s principles and practices when they responded to deceptive calls from a political opponent who posed as a racist donor and secretly taped the conversations .
“ It is clear these employees made serious mistakes , and we apologize again for the way this was handled . ”
The organization said it was “ training employees in communication skills for handling racist or other offensive callers . ”
Some of the about 30 black leaders present said Planned Parenthood should fire the employees .
Rep. Trent Franks , Arizona Republican , appeared at the demonstration to say he will introduce legislation making it illegal to abort on the basis of sex or race .
“ If the Democrats ca n’t vote for that , then they ca n’t vote for anything , ” he said .
A related bill , the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act to defund Planned Parenthood , sponsored by Rep. Mike Pence , Indiana Republican , is in committee .
In a statement released yesterday , Planned Parenthood Federation of America said 97 percent of its health care services “ are related to prevention ” and said its work should not be politicized .
“ Planned Parenthood partners with both local and federal governments to fill the gap through which millions of Americans would fall without our support .
It ’s time to stop playing politics and start working together toward commonsense solutions to keep all Americans healthy and safe , ” it said .
Planned Parenthood ’s annual report says it received more than one - third of its $ 926.4 million 2006 - 07 budget from federal grants and contracts , including Title X family planning funds .
In 2006 , it performed 289,750 abortions in the U.S. , although it says it does not use federal funds for the procedure — a distinction pro-life groups dismiss because money is fungible .
Although blacks represent 13 percent of the U.S. population , 37 percent of all abortions are performed on black women , according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute , a New York - based nonprofit focused on sexual health .
The Web site www.blackgenocide.org estimates that 10 million to 13 million black pregnancies — about one - third of black America ’s current 36 million population — have been aborted since the procedure was declared a constitutional right in 1973 .
Participants in the demonstration said the YouTube video proved what they have suspected for years about Planned Parenthood , whose founder , Margaret Sanger , said in a Dec. 19 , 1939 , letter that , “ We do n’t want word to get out that we want to exterminate the Negro population . ”
The text of the letter was read aloud by Miss Gardner .
“ Most of these clinics are in the black community , ” said the Rev. Jesse Lee Petersen , founder of the Los Angeles - based Brotherhood Organization of a New Destiny .
“ Why ?
Because the black community has allowed this to happen . ”
Mentioning the name of a nationally known black pastor from Dallas , he said , “ Where is T.D. Jakes ?
If he cared about black women , he ’d be here . ”

The story of an elite paramilitary unit in future Japan has already been adapted into three animated films and two television anime series .
DreamWorks has released the second animated Ghost in the Shell film , Innocence , in North America .
DreamWorks also released Millennium Actress and produced Transformers , another live - action science - fiction film with Japanese roots .
Variety reports that Universal and Sony also negotiated for the rights , which the Production I.G anime studio was pitching for the manga 's original publisher Kodansha .
What turned the dealmaking in DreamWorks ' favor was co-founder Steven Spielberg 's enthusiasm for the project .
The entertainment trade newspaper quotes the acclaimed director and producer : " Ghost in the Shell is one of my favorite stories .
It 's a genre that has arrived , and we enthusiastically welcome it to DreamWorks . "
WASHINGTON 
Tens of thousands of airline passengers will soon be flying on jets outfitted with anti-missile systems as part of a new government test aimed at thwarting terrorists armed with shoulder - fired projectiles .
Three American Airlines Boeing 767-200s that fly daily round - trip routes between New York and California will receive the anti-missile laser jammers this spring , according to the Department of Homeland Security , which is spending $ 29 million on the tests .
Jets will fly with the jammer device mounted on the belly of the plane , between the wheels .
The device works with sensors , also mounted on the plane , that detect a heat - seeking missile and shoot a laser at it to send the missile veering harmlessly off course .
Anti-missile systems have been tested on cargo planes .
But " this is the first time these systems have been tested on actual passenger airlines in commercial service , " says Burt Keirstead , director of commercial aircraft protection at BAE Systems , which developed the anti-missile device .
" It 's the ultimate consumer use of the equipment . "
Officials emphasize that no missiles will be test - fired at the planes , which will fly between New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport and the international airports in Los Angeles and San Francisco .
The purpose of the tests is to determine how well the laser - jamming technology works on routine flights , how the devices affect fuel consumption and how much maintenance they require , according to Keirstead .
Although there has not been an attempt to take down a jet on U.S. soil with a shoulder - fired missile , Homeland Security has warned about the possibility because the portable , lightweight weapons can be bought on the black market for as little as a few hundred dollars .
There have been numerous deadly attacks on military jets and cargo planes overseas , and several near collisions with passenger planes .
In 2002 , two shoulder - fired missiles narrowly missed an Israeli airliner jet as it took off with 261 passengers in Mombassa , Kenya .
The Defense Department uses laser - jamming technology on its planes , but using the systems on commercial airliners is much more controversial because of concerns about cost and maintenance .
" If this is going to break down every other month vs. every fifth year , obviously that 's a big , big difference , " says Jim Tuttle of the Homeland Security Department 's Science and Technology division .
Keirstead says the systems could be installed for somewhere from $ 500,000 to $ 1 million per plane , but it 's unclear how much it would cost to maintain them .
Airlines have balked at paying the cost , and Congress would have to decide whether the federal government would foot the bill .
American Airlines spokesman John Hotard says company officials agreed to participate in the tests in case Congress eventually requires airlines to install the devices .
But American is " philosophically opposed " to anti-missile technology on commercial planes , he says .
" When you look at the cost benefit , it would be an extremely expensive proposition , and in the end , is it really going to work ? "

College students and their families are rightly outraged about the bankrupting costs of textbooks that have nearly tripled since the 1980s , mainly because of marginally useful CD - ROMs and other supplements .
A bill pending in Congress would require publishers to sell “ unbundled ” versions of the books  minus the pricey add - ons .
Even more important , it would require publishers to reveal book prices in marketing material so that professors could choose less - expensive titles .
The bill is a good first step .
But colleges and universities will need to embrace new methods of textbook development and distribution if they want to rein in runaway costs .
That means using digital textbooks , which can often be presented online free of charge or in hard copies for as little as one - fifth the cost of traditional books .
The digital books can also be easily customized and updated .
Right now , textbook publishers are calling the tune .
They add as many bells and whistles as they can and pump out new editions as quickly as possible  as a way of making perfectly good textbooks obsolete .
Not every book can be cheap .
A specialized text that only a few people know how to write and that reaches a small audience will be costly by definition .
But there is no reason for an introductory textbook to carry a price tag of , say , $ 140 in an area like economics where the information changes little from year to year .
Schools are beginning to balk at outrageous pricing .
Rice University offers textbooks for some classes free online and charges a nominal fee for the printed version .
A new company called Flat World Knowledge , based in Nyack , N.Y. , plans to offer online textbooks free and hopes to make its profit by selling supplemental materials like study guides and hard copies printed on demand .
Implanting False Memories : Lost in the Mall & Paul Ingram
“ Do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , or whatever it is that you think you remember ? ” — Elizabeth Loftus
In 1990 George Franklin became the first ever US citizen convicted of murder by a witness who recovered repressed memories more than 20 years after the event .
The fact that the witness was Franklin ’s daughter , Eileen , ensured the case was splashed across the news media .
Franklin was released in 1996 after 6 years in prison when irregularities were discovered in Eileen ’s evidence : it emerged she had been hypnotised before testifying .
There is a good reason why hypnotised witnesses are barred from testifying in some jurisdictions : under hypnosis people are highly suggestible .
Even without hypnosis , studies show that people ’s memories are open to influence .
But , can it be demonstrated in the lab that memories for entirely false events can be implanted ?
False memories are hard to research for one simple reason : it ’s difficult to verify whether the memories in question are false or not ( Loftus , 1993 ) .
Often a considerable amount of time has passed since the original event and it ’s not possible to corroborate what people say .
But , while it ’s difficult , it ’s not impossible – it just takes some concerted effort .
Lost in the mall
Elizabeth Loftus , Distinguished Professor at the University of California , Irvine , has been at the forefront of psychological research into repressed memories and testified in George Franklin ’s case .
She has also carried out some fascinating research into the possibility of implanting false memories .
In a seminal study Loftus and Pickrell ( 1995 ) recruited 24 participants who were to be presented with four stories from when they were between 4 and 6 years old , three of which were true , and one false .
To get the true stories , the researchers spoke to participants ’ relatives to get three events for each person which had really happened .
The events were chosen so that they were not traumatic or emotionally difficult to recall .
Each family was also asked to provide the circumstances of another event that could possibly have happened , but did n’t .
In each case the false memory was for getting lost in a shopping mall .
Relatives provided details of a specific shopping mall it could have been along with other details to make the fake story plausible .
They also confirmed that an event like this had not actually occurred .
Do you remember this ?
Participants themselves were told they were involved in a study about their ability to recall details of childhood memories .
Each participant was first sent a written description of the four events their relatives had outlined – three being real and one fake .
They were then asked to write down which events they remembered and more details of the events those events .
Then , soon after , participants were interviewed .
At this point they were reminded about the four memories and asked to recall as much as they could about them .
At a second interview a week later , a similar procedure was followed .
At the end of both interviews participants rated the clarity of their memories .
It was then revealed to them that one of the memories was false and they were asked to guess which one it was .
Of the 24 participants , 5 falsely recalled the made up ‘ lost in the mall ’ event as a real memory , although participants understandably found the implanted memory much less clear .
This may seem like quite an unimpressive proportion , but considering the very low level of suggestion or coercion involved in the interviews , it does at least show the possibility of implanting false memories .
A later study with more participants which examined a wider range of memories was carried out by Hyman and Pentland ( 1996 ) .
This found that , depending on experimental variables , at least some kind of false memory could be implanted in between 20 % and 40 % of participants .
But psychologists have done better .
In a fantastically titled paper , ‘ A picture is worth a thousand lies ’ , Kimbereley Wade and colleagues used a doctored photograph of a fictitious balloon flight to implant false memories ( Wade , Garry , Read & Lindsay , 2002 ) .
Using similar interview procedures to Loftus and Pickrell ( 1995 ) , they found that 50 % of participants created either complete or partial false memories of the flight .
The bizarre case of Paul Ingram
Critics argue that the problem with these sorts of studies is that they only implant inconsequential memories .
Traumatic memories , such as those claimed by George Franklin ’s daughter , might be a completely different matter .
This is a fair point and difficult to refute because it would be highly unethical to implant traumatic memories into participants .
Well , actually this has been done , in one of the most bizarre and dramatic false memory experiments ever documented .
In 1988 Paul Ingram , a police officer , was arrested for sexually abusing his two daughters , an allegation he strongly denied .
Over an extended period of five months , however , he was subjected to pressure by fellow police officers , psychologists and other advisors , suggesting he had committed child abuse , including having raped his own daughters .
Eventually Ingram began to confess to all manner of rapes , child sexual abuses and even to participation in a Satan - worshipping cult which had allegedly murdered 25 babies .
At one point the prosecution brought in the renowned memory researcher , Dr Richard Ofshe , now Professor Emeritus at the University of California , Berkeley .
He was asked to interview Ingram .
Ofshe soon became suspicious of Ingram ’s credibility .
In order to test Ingram , he made up a story that his son and daughter claimed he had forced them to have sex with each other while he watched .
This was something Ofshe confirmed with both son and daughter had not actually happened .
Over a period of hours , and despite initially denying the memory , Ingram slowly began to generate these false memories .
Ultimately Ingram wrote a three - page confession to a crime that was completely fabricated .
What else might he have fabricated under this kind of intense pressure ?
Unfortunately for Paul Ingram , Ofshe ’s report was n’t issued until after he had already confessed to the crimes and been convicted .
He was then unable to withdraw his guilty plea .
Paul Ingram remained in jail until 2003 and is still a registered sex offender despite many doubting his guilt .
—
The case of Paul Ingram along with the experimental studies on false memories probably represent two extremes of a continuum .
At one end , when politely asked within the context of a psychology study , some people can be induced into believing relatively benign false memories .
Perhaps as many as 50 % .
At the other end , when placed under incredible psychological pressure , like Paul Ingram , who knows what people will claim to remember .

( Business 2.0 magazine ) --
The term " urban farming " may conjure up a community garden where locals grow a few heads of lettuce .
But some academics envision something quite different for the increasingly hungry world of the 21st century : a vertical farm that will do for agriculture what the skyscraper did for office space .
Build a 21 - story circular greenhouse , says Dickson Despommier , an environmental science professor at Columbia University , and it can be as productive as 588 acres of land - growing , say , 12 million heads of lettuce a year .
With the world 's population expected to increase by 3 billion by 2050 - nearly all of it in cities - and with 80 percent of available farmland already in use , Despommier sees a burgeoning need for such buildings .
So he talked to fellow academics at the University of California at Davis about using rooftop solar panels to power 24 - hour grow lights and found NASA - like technology that would capture evaporating water for irrigation .
" We need to devote as much attention to vertical farming as we did to going to the moon , " Despommier says .
" It will free the world from having to worry where our next meal will come from . "
It should also turn a handsome profit .
Despommier 's calculations peg the construction cost of a 21 - story vertical farm at about $ 84 million , operating costs at $ 5 million a year , and revenue at $ 18 million a year , based on the price of produce at upscale Manhattan delis .
Getting product to market is one of the most expensive parts of traditional agriculture , but with a vertical farm , your retailers are just down the block .
Despommier has been talking to VCs in both the United States and Europe .
The Sustainable Agriculture Initiative , a group of 20 food companies including Coca - Cola ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , Kraft ( Charts ) , McDonald 's ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , and Nestl� , has expressed interest , as has IBM ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) .
Kristin Reynolds , program representative at the University of California 's Small Farms Program , says her only concern is that vertical farming could grow too big too fast : " It needs to be developed cautiously , so it does n't take markets away from small - scale farmers . "

FAIR LAWN , N.J. 
He had wrestled as an all - American , led high school and college football teams to winning seasons , and once rushed for six touchdowns in a game .
He was once in Sports Illustrated , a teenage “ Face in the Crowd . ”
But that was all more than a decade ago , before the coaches in the N.F.L. and the Canadian Football League saw him and did not take a second look .
That was before the Colgate University diploma and the years of corporate consulting , and before his company transferred him to its Chicago office and then transferred him back to its New York office , and before the bald spot and the new job selling orthodontics .
Now , the day before his 34th birthday , Jamal Patterson was driving his sport utility vehicle through these vinyl - sided precincts of diminished dreams .
He parked outside a cavernous gym , traded his slacks and his Oxford shirt for camouflage shorts and a sweatshirt depicting a clenched fist , and he took his place among the fighters .
There were two weeks left to train and 14 of his 219 pounds left to cut before the mixed martial arts match of his life , billed as New Blood , New Battles , on Friday at the Izod Center in East Rutherford .
Patterson is scheduled to fight Vladimir Matyushenko , the light heavyweight champion of the International Fight League who is known as the Janitor .
In preparation , Patterson was squeezing in workouts between his sales calls .
For bats in peril , white noses nothing to sniff at
First it was bees .
Now bats have come down with a mysterious ailment that 's killing them by the thousands in upstate New York and Vermont , sparking fears of a massive die - off if it is not contained .
Dubbed " white nose syndrome " for the rings of white fungus found around many of the affected bats ' snouts , the plague claimed 13,500 ( 90 percent ) of 15,000 bats over two years , and since last January has spread from four caves west of Albany , New York , to four other sites in the state and to one in neighboring Vermont , the Associated Press reports .
The syndrome apparently kills the bats while they hibernate , depleting their fat reserves months ahead of schedule , according to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ( DEC ) , which noted that the role of the fungus is unclear .
In a statement , DEC bat specialist Alan Hicks called the illness " the gravest threat to bats [ we ] have ever seen . "

Pharma - hired researcher gave company confidential drug study
A diabetes researcher last year leaked a confidential document to drug giant GlaxoSmithKline , which has paid him around $ 75,000 in consulting and speaking fees since 1999 , according to a letter to Glaxo president of U.S. pharmaceuticals from Iowa Sen.
Charles Grassley .
Grassley , the ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on Finance , requested more details about the company 's actions after researcher Steven Haffner , a professor of internal medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio , tipped Glaxo to a study he was reviewing for possible publication in The New England Journal of Medicine , a violation of journal policy .
The article , published last May , reported a 43 percent increase in heart attacks among diabetics who took Avandia ( rosiglitazone ) , Glaxo 's blood glucose –regulating drug , for at least 24 weeks .
Haffner told Nature News , " why I sent it [ to Glaxo ] is a mystery . … I was n't feeling well .
It was bad judgment . "

Venter 's genomic " watermarks " decoded
When genomics pioneer Craig Venter announced last week that his team had constructed the first man-made bacterial genome , he disclosed that researchers had embedded five " watermarks " in the DNA containing coded messages .
The " code " was simply the genetic code , in which the order of DNA subunits specifies a sequence of amino acids , each abbreviated by a letter .
Wired Science recruited researchers not involved in the study to decode the messages , which were VENTERINSTITVTE ( there is no amino acid for " U " ) , CRAIGVENTER , HAMSMITH , CINDIANDCLYDE and GLASSANDCLYDE .
The latter three biograffiti seem to refer to Venter 's co-authors Hamilton Smith , John Glass and Clyde Hutchison .

Why naked mole rats never ask for water at Mexican restaurants
And now , yet another weird factoid about African naked mole rats , the hairless , cold - blooded mammals that congregate in subterranean colonies : pain does n't always hurt them .
U.S. and German researchers report in PLoS Biology that the animals squirm as other mammals do when pinched or poked , but are insensitive to pain from chemicals such as acids or the molecule capsaicin , the scorching factor in chili sauce and pepper spray .
The team attributes the mole rats ' bravery in the face of hot sauce in part to a dearth of the pain - transmitting neurotransmitter known as " substance P " :
When rubbed with a herpes virus that produces P , the freaky rats felt the burn .

Brain - tickling implant boosts memory
Electrodes implanted deep in the brain improved the memory skills of a man receiving an experimental treatment for morbid obesity .
Canadian researchers were testing deep - brain stimulation as a way to suppress the appetite of a 50 - year - old patient by electrically tweaking his hypothalamus ( involved in learning and memory ) .
As the electrodes were being implanted , the man reportedly had a memory burst of a day in the park with friends three decades earlier .
He also performed better on complex memory tests when the stimulator was on .
Unfortunately , the electrodes have n't helped his weight : they do quell his appetite , according to news reports , but when he wants to eat , he just turns them off .
The study is to appear in Annals of Neurology .

Spy satellite coming down to Earth
A van -size U.S. spy satellite has lost power and is expected to rain fragments on Earth later this month , although where they will land is still anybody 's guess .
The Associated Press reports that amateur satellite watchers have tracked the object , details of which are still classified , since its launch in December 2006 and immediate power failure ; the news agency noted that a British hobbyist who captured video of the craft , US 193 , estimated it measures 13 to 16.5 feet ( four to five meters ) across and weighs up to 10,000 pounds ( 5,000 kilograms ) , plummeting 1,640 feet a day from a current altitude of some 173 miles ( 278 kilometers ) .
An Air Force general told the AP that pieces of the satellite would likely survive reentry , possibly carrying a small amount of the toxic rocket fuel hydrazine .
Uncontrolled satellite reentries are nothing new : the biggest was that of the 75 - ton Skylab , debris from which scattered harmlessly in 1979 in the Indian Ocean and Western Australia .

Plastic bottles in hot water
If the term endocrine disruptor sounds scary , then do n't boil your plastic baby bottles .
A new study by University of Cincinnati researchers examines the rate at which polycarbonate drinking bottles — as in baby and sports bottles — release bisphenol A , a so - called endocrine disruptor that mimics natural estrogen and may interfere with human endocrine ( hormone ) systems as it does in animals .
The key , researchers say , is the temperature of the liquid in the bottle :
When exposed briefly to boiling water , the subsequent rate of bisphenol A leaching from the plastic container into its contents spiked from 0.2 to 0.8 nanogram ( billionth of a gram ) per hour to eight to 32 nanograms per hour .
The authors say it is unclear what level of bisphenol A or similar compounds , such as phytoestrogens in soy , might pose a risk .

The initial question is who will check the President and his or her people ?
During a time of national fear , who will hold the Executive accountable for its national security abuses or , perhaps more important , prevent them from occurring ?
More particularly , who will hold the President accountable for lies aimed at legitimating or covering up abuses of power ?
There are two quick answers , found in most civics books .
The first is the electorate -- it can vote out the President at the next election .
But that often is years later , and only if it is the President 's first term and if executive dissembling is publicly revealed and constantly criticized .
The second quick answer is the Judiciary .
It is the role of the courts to hold the Executive to constitutional dictates .
But what is the reality ?
The simplistic answer , that the judiciary checks the executive , is rooted in a widely - held fallacy -- that as a separate co-equal branch of government it is politically independent and that its judgments are necessarily neutral and objective .
Bush v. Gore and Korematsu v. U.S. are just two of many cases that starkly reveal that fallacy by exposing the political underpinnings of judicial decisionmaking in controversial cases .
It is not that nine black - robed men and women simply vote their personal and political preferences .
The legal method imposes decisional constraints .
To maintain public legitimacy judges have to speak in the language of statutes , rules , and case precedents .
As many commentators have observed about Bush v. Gore , however , the moorings of the legal method are a weak tether in hot political cases .
The intricacies of stare decisis and the complexities of the three - tier standard of equal protection review , for instance , are manipulable by sophisticated , politically attuned judges .
As illuminated by the Hamdi and Padilla " enemy combatant " cases and the prosecution of Dr. Wen Ho Lee , public advocacy emerges in two realms .
The first realm is critical legal argument by lawyers and civil and human rights organizations aimed at shaping judges ' threshold selections of the level of judicial scrutiny , and ultimately the judges ' responses to the specific legal challenges to executive actions .
As a complement to usually narrow traditional legal arguments , this kind of critical legal advocacy aims to reveal what is really at stake , who benefits and who is harmed ( in the short and long term ) , who wields the behind - the - scenes power , which social values are supported and which are subverted , how political concerns frame the legal questions , and how societal institutions and differing segments of the populace will be affected by the court 's decision .
The second realm of advocacy is a species of public education : journalist essays , pundit commentaries , public letters to the editor , clergy sermons , scholars ' op - ed pieces , community workshops and school forums , all critically analyzing and advocating the need for the courts to carefully scrutinize the Executive 's national security actions .
The goal is to create in the public culture a compelling sense that it must be the courts that exercise " watchful care " over our constitutional liberties -- that the Executive is charged with protecting our people and institutions from threats from without , and in turn that our courts are charged with protecting our liberties from threats from our own institutions .
The timing of both kinds of public advocacy is crucial .
Advocacy of accountability is imperative at the " front end " and at the " back end " of apparent national security abuses :
Every single one of the members of congress and the cabinet and all the national " leaders " should have gone on general strike themselves the day they heard about waterboarding .
We can allow them to get away with it or we can send a clear message to the next president that ENOUGH is ENOUGH !
The sat -nav had told the driver to carry straight on - so he did
A driver , stranded after he drove into a river , said his sat - nav system guided him in there .
The mini - bus driver was on his way to collect a fare in Castle Acre , near King 's Lynn , Norfolk , when he took a wrong turn into the River Nar .
Pat Bowles , from Streamline Taxis , said : " Normal people would stop and back out but because his sat -nav told him to keep going that 's what he did .
" I do n't think he did think until he could n't go any further . "
The incident happened as the driver was following his sat-nav on Saturday .
Ms Bowles said it had given the driver 's colleagues plenty of amusement : " He 's had taxi drivers going into the office with snorkels on .
" We 've also had phones calls , texts coming through asking if they can book river trips . "

The company was founded in 2006 by Steve Fambro and Chris Anthony , two independent entrepreneurs with experience in everything from composites and biotechnology to aerodynamics and finance .
This combination of expertise led to the Aptera , a truly unique vehicle that looks like a cross between a dolphin and a helicopter .
Technically classified as a motorcycle , the vehicle will only be available to residents of California when it 's initially produced .
If the Aptera sells well , AC hopes to offer its vehicle to national and international markets .
The initial prototype of the Aptera achieved 230 mpg , a number that is 195 mpg over the projected standard outlined in President Bush 's recent energy bill .
As of now , the developers still have more time to work out the kinks and improve its efficiency -- AC expects the Aptera to be ready for Californians in late 2008 .
How fast will the Aptera go ?
Since it 's technically a motorcycle , what are its safety features ?
Read on to learn more about the Aptera .
People who adopt four healthy behaviours – not smoking ; taking exercise ; moderate alcohol intake ; and eating five servings of fruit and vegetables a day – live on average an additional fourteen years of life compared with people who adopt none of these behaviours , according to a study published in the open access journal PLoS Medicine .
Rather than focusing on how an individual factor is related to health , the study calculates the combined impact of these four simply - defined forms of behaviour .
The results suggest that several small changes in lifestyle could have a marked impact on the health of populations .
There is overwhelming evidence showing that lifestyles such as smoking , diet and physical activity influence health and longevity but there is little information about their combined impact .
Furthermore the huge amount of information provided by these studies and the varying definitions of a health behaviour that these studies use can often make them confusing for public health professionals and for the general public .
For example : small amounts of alcohol appear to be related to lower risk of cardiovascular disease health but what is the overall impact on longevity “
In order to examine the combined impact of changes in lifestyle , Kay - Tee Khaw and colleagues from the University of Cambridge and the Medical Research Council used a health behaviour score that is easy to understand in order to assess the participants in the study ( who were from Norfolk , United Kingdom ) .
Between 1993 and 1997 , 20,000 men and women between the ages of 45 and 79 , none of whom had known cancer or heart or circulatory disease , completed a questionnaire that resulted in a score between 0 and 4 .
A point was awarded for each of the following : not currently smoking ; not being physically inactive ( physical inactivity was defined as having a sedentary job and not doing any recreational exercise ) ; a moderate alcohol intake of 1 - 14 units a week ( a unit is half a pint of beer or a glass of wine ) ; and a blood vitamin C level consistent with eating five servings of fruit or vegetables a day .
Deaths among the participants were recorded unti l 2006 .
After factoring in age , the results showed that over an average period of eleven years people with a score of 0 – i.e. those who did not undertake any of these healthy forms of behaviour – were four times more likely to have died than those who had scored 4 in the questionnaire .
Furthermore , the researchers calculate that a person who has a health score of 0 has the same risk of dying as someone 14 years older who had scored 4 in the questionnaire ( i.e. someone engaging in all four healthy forms of behaviour ) .
This was independent of social class and body mass index .
The study forms part of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition ( EPIC ) , conducted across ten European countries , the largest study of diet and health ever undertaken .
As a related editorial discusses , individuals in isolation often cannot make the lifestyle changes they want and a set of complex processes affect how research is translated into effective public health policy .
The results of this study need to be confirmed in other populations and an analysis of how the combined health behaviours affect quality of life is also needed .
Nevertheless the results of the study strongly suggest that these four achievable lifestyle changes could have a marked improvement on the health of middle - aged and older people , which is particularly important given the ageing population in the UK and other European countries .

Of all the methods scammers use when hunting for victims , phishing is one of the most difficult to guard against .
Phishing attacks are designed to exploit societal vulnerabilities more than technical flaws , and , in some cases , are extremely difficult to block .
Even the best anti-malware software suite can't stop an end user from willingly revealing personal information , particularly if the web site being used to collect the data does n't trip any high - alert security alarms .
The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has taken an interest in educating consumers on the dangers of phishing .
To that end , the government organization has prepared three separate 60 - second videos on the ways and scenarios a consumer might possibly encounter a phisher .
Behold , Phishy Home , Phishy Office , and Phishy Store in all their puissant glory .
The ads all follow a common theme .
In each , we see a friendly and believable - sounding man requesting personal information from a consumer who grows increasingly suspicious as the conversation progresses .
The ads do a good job of demonstrating how a phisher can introduce itself from a seemingly safe vector " I 'm with your credit card company , we suspect several unauthorized transactions on your card " followed by a request for information that the legitimate credit card company might ask for .
" You give me your social security number , and we 'll take care of you . "
In Phishy Home , the consumer appears perfectly ready to hand over this information , but begins to balk when the phisher requests his PIN number .
Sadly , it 's never quite this easy .
Unfortunately , this is where the FTC 's videos fumble the ball .
Instead of accusing the would - be phisher of identity theft based on his requests for personal information , his targets discover a large fin sticking out of his back .
This might be good for a bit of humor , but it does n't teach the viewer anything about why the phisher can be identified as such .
Virtually every legitimate bank or credit card company has an explicit policy against asking for certain types of customer information over the phone , and it's often printed on any statement or notice the company sends .
Phishy Home , in my opinion , does the best job of communicating its message , and the FTC does deserve credit for attempting to spread the word on the dangers of phishing .
The government has also launched a web site at www.onguardonline.com to address phishing and identify theft in more detail .
The site gives a thorough treatment to a wide range of topics , and actually looks to be a solid reference point for anyone who thinks they may have been the victim of identity theft , or simply wants more information on the topic .
All in all , this is good work , though hopefully future videos will spend a bit more time on identifying phishers and a bit less time gawking over a large plastic fin .

NEW YORK —
The number of individuals filing for bankruptcy surged during the first - quarter as American households struggled to stay on top of debt , according to a report released Wednesday .
The American Bankruptcy Institute said that consumer bankruptcy filings increased 27 % nationwide in the first three months of the year , compared with the same period last year .
In March alone , 86,165 individuals filed for consumer bankruptcy – a 13 % increase over the 76,120 cases filed in February .
“ Bankruptcies are rising due to the heavy burden of household debt and growing mortgage problems , ” said ABI Executive Director Samuel J. Gerdano .
“ We expect this trend to continue through 2008 . ”

EVANSTON , Ill . ---
Nuclear power has advantages , but , if this method of making power is to be viable long term , discovering new solutions to radioactive waste disposal and other problems are critical .
Otherwise nuclear power is unlikely to become mainstream .
A team of Northwestern University chemists is the first to focus on metal sulfide materials as a possible source for nuclear waste remediation methods .
Their new material is extremely successful in removing strontium from a sodium - heavy solution , which has concentrations similar to those in real liquid nuclear waste .
Strontium - 90 , a major waste component , is one of the more dangerous radioactive fission materials created within a nuclear reactor .
The results will be published online the week of March 3 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
By taking advantage of ion exchange , the new method captures and concentrates strontium as a solid material , leaving clean liquid behind .
In the case of actual nuclear waste remediation , the radioactive solid could then be dealt with separately -- handled , moved , stored or recycled -- and the liquid disposed .
" It is a very difficult job to capture strontium in vast amounts of liquid nuclear waste , " said Mercouri G. Kanatzidis , Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and the paper 's senior author .
" Sodium and calcium ions , which are nonradioactive , are present in such enormous amounts compared to strontium that they can be captured instead of the radioactive material , interfering with remediation . "
Strontium is like a needle in a haystack : sodium ions outnumber strontium ions by more than a million to one .
The material developed at Northwestern -- a layered metal sulfide made of potassium , manganese , tin and sulfur called KMS - 1 -- attracts strontium but not sodium .
" The metal sulfide did much , much better than we expected at removing strontium in such an excess of sodium , " said Kanatzidis .
" We were really amazed at how well it discriminates against sodium and think we have something special .
As far as we can tell , this is the best material out there for this kind of application . "
KMS - 1 works at the extremes of the pH scale -- in very basic and very acidic solutions , the conditions common in nuclear waste -- and everywhere in between .
Metal oxides and polymer resins , the materials currently used in nuclear waste remediation , perform reasonably well but are more limited than KMS - 1 : each typically works in either basic or acidic conditions but not both and definitely not across the pH scale .
In earlier work , Kanatzidis and his team had found KMS - 1 to be very quick and facile at ion exchange .
( The material gives up an ion and takes another to maintain charge balance . )
Knowing this and also that the ion exchange process is a removal process , the researchers decided that strontium was an interesting ion with which to test their new material .
The solution the researchers used in the lab contained strontium and two " interfering " ions , sodium and calcium , in concentrations like those found in the nuclear waste industry .
( Nonradioactive strontium , which works the same as the radioactive version , was used in the experiments . )
KMS - 1 , a free flowing black - brown powder , was packaged like tea in a teabag and then dropped into the solution .
The all - important ion exchange followed : the metal sulfide " teabag " soaked up the strontium and gave off potassium , which is not radioactive , into the liquid .
KMS - 1 does its remarkable work targeting only strontium by taking advantage of two things : strontium is a heavier ion than calcium , and sulfur ( a component of KMS - 1 ) attracts heavier ions ; and KMS - 1 attracts ions with more charge so it attracts strontium , which has a charge of 2 + , and does n't attract sodium , which only has a charge of 1 + .
So , as Kanatzidis likes to say , " Our material beats both sodium and calcium . "
" The nuclear power process generates enormous amounts of radioactive liquid waste , which is stored in large tanks , " said Kanatzidis .
" If we can concentrate the radioactive material , it can be dealt with and the nonradioactive water thrown away .
I can imagine our material as part of a cleansing filter that the solution is passed through . "
Looking to the future , to be a scaleable and affordable remediation method , the metal in the metal sulfide needs to be inexpensive and readily available and also make a stable compound .
" We focused on potassium , manganese and tin because we have been working with them for some time , " said Manolis J. Manos , a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern and lead author of the paper .
" All three metals make stable compounds and are common and abundant . "
" Our next step is to do systematic studies , including using an actual waste solution from the nuclear power industry , to learn how KMS - 1 works and how to make even better metal sulfides , " added Manos .
###
In addition to Kanatzidis and Manos , Nan Ding , a former graduate student in Kanatzidis ' group , now at Claflin College in South Carolina , is the other author of the PNAS paper , titled " Layered Metal Sulfides : Exceptionally Selective Agents for Radioactive Strontium Removal . "
Israeli forces used tanks backed by airstrikes in the pre-dawn raid
Israeli forces have clashed with Palestinian militants during a raid on northern Gaza , hours after rejecting a truce offered by Hamas .
Palestinian doctors say a 14 - year - old girl died and eight other people were injured in the raid , in Beit Lahiya .
They say the casualties included the girl 's mother , but were mostly gunmen involved in clashes with the Israelis .
Reports say the target of the raid was local Hamas leader Hassan Marouf , but the Israeli army refused to comment .
The Associated Press news agency quotes witnesses as saying the Israelis seized him from his home amid heavy fighting .
The Israeli army said none of its troops were injured .

The raid began before dawn , with an Israeli undercover force entering northern Gaza backed by tanks and aircraft .
Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants fired at them with machine guns , mortars and homemade bombs .
On Friday Hamas proposed a six - month " period of quiet " in Gaza , which it said could then be extended to the West Bank .
Israel dismissed the proposal as a ruse to allow Hamas to " re-arm and re-group " .
A Fresno high school sophomore was shot dead by a campus police officer Wednesday after he struck the officer in the head with a bat inside the school , Fresno police said .
The officer fired on the 17 - year - old boy at least once as he struggled to regain his footing after being knocked to the ground , Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer told reporters at an afternoon news conference .
Officers tried to revive the student but he died at the scene , Dyer said .
Police did not identify the teenager because he was a minor .
Dyer said investigators were looking into the possibility that a second shot was fired , but were n’t been able to verify it .
Investigators are interviewing five students who witnessed the shooting , police said .

Authorities did not identify the officer except to say that he was a 10 - year veteran of the department who had been stationed at Roosevelt High School for three years .
Several students identified him to the Fresno Bee as Junus Perry , 38 .
The officer was taken to Community Regional Medical Center for treatment of a 2 - inch gash to the head , Dyer said .
“ There was a great deal of blood loss , ” Dyer said .
The officer was released from the hospital with stitches to close the wound , police said .
He will be on paid administrative leave pending an investigation .
Roosevelt High School , in southeast Fresno , is one of eight public high schools in the city of 450,000 .
District records show that Roosevelt ’s academic performance lags well behind state averages .

Most of the 2,700 students were in class when the incident began shortly before noon , Dyer said .
The officer was struck with the bat as he walked out of his office and fell backward in a daze , Dyer said .
As the officer tried to draw his firearm , the weapon ’s magazine clattered to the floor , Dyer said .
The student with the bat approached the officer again , the chief said , prompting the officer to reach for a second firearm attached to his ankle .

Dyer said the campus officer had never talked to the student before the confrontation and the officer did n’t know what sparked his attack .
He is employed by the Police Department but works full time at the high school .
The 6 - foot - 1 , 250 - pound sophomore had been at Roosevelt since January , he said .
Ruth Quinto , acting superintendent of the Fresno Unified School District , said teachers were asked to keep students in classrooms until police could sweep the campus for other attackers .

When it became clear that it was an isolated incident , parents were permitted to pick up their children at the school , Quinto said .
She reassured parents that the campus had remained secure .
“ Our students were safe in their classrooms , ” she said at the news conference .

The US said Syria 's reactor was similar to a North Korean one The UN 's nuclear watchdog has said it will investigate US claims that Syria was building a secret nuclear reactor with North Korean help .
The International Atomic Energy Agency criticised the US for withholding its intelligence until seven months after Israel bombed the site .
The US said the alleged Syrian reactor " was not for peaceful purposes " .
Syria has said the US claim is " ridiculous " and has denied any nuclear links to North Korea .
The site of the alleged reactor , said to be like one in North Korea , was bombed by Israel in 2007 .
' Unused military site '
The director general of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , Mohamed ElBaradei , has now been briefed by the US on their claims but " deplores " the delay , a statement from the agency said .
" The agency will treat this information with the seriousness it deserves and will investigate the veracity of the information , " the statement said .
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS 6 Sept 2007 : Israel bombs site in Syria 1 Oct : Syria 's President Assad tells BBC site was military 24 Oct : New satellite images taken show site bulldozed clear 24 April 2008 : US claims Syrian site was nuclear reactor
Nuclear power in Middle East US claims raise wider doubts
Full text : US allegations
Send us your comments
The agency was critical of both the US delay in releasing the information and of Israel 's bombing of the site before the IAEA could inspect it .
" The director general views the unilateral use of force by Israel as undermining the due process of verification that is at the heart of the non-proliferation regime , " the statement said .
The statement is a clear indication that Mr ElBaradei is not accepting the US claims at face value and wants his own first - hand information , says BBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall .
Syrian officials have said the site that was bombed by Israel on 6 September 2007 was an unused military facility under construction .
Building on the site had stopped some time before the air strike , the Syrians said .
On Thursday , American security officials showed members of Congress evidence they said proved Syria was building a nuclear reactor with North Korean assistance .
Among the evidence they displayed were pictures - said to have been obtained by Israel - allegedly taken inside the facility showing the reactor core being built .
The images showed striking similarities between the Syrian facility and the North Korean reactor at Yongbyon , the US said .
However , the facility was not yet operational and there was no fuel for the reactor , officials said .
US concern The White House said Syria 's " cover - up " operation after the Israeli air strike reinforced its belief that the alleged reactor " was not intended for peaceful activities " .

In late October 2007 , an independent American research organisation , the Institute for Science and International Security ( ISIS ) , released pre- and post - strike satellite images of the site which indicated it had been bulldozed flat after the bombing .
" Until 6 September , 2007 , the Syrian regime was building a covert nuclear reactor in its eastern desert capable of producing plutonium , " the White House statement said .
" The Syrian regime must come clean before the world regarding its illicit nuclear activities . "
The statement added that the US had long been " seriously concerned about North Korea 's nuclear weapons programme and its proliferation activities " .
' Ridiculous allegations ' Syrian officials have denied any North Korean involvement in their country .
" These allegations are ridiculous , " Syria 's ambassador to the UK , Sami Khiyami , told the BBC .
Images of alleged Syrian site " We are used to such allegations now , since the day the United States has invaded Iraq - you remember all the theatrical presentations concerning the WMDs [ weapons of mass destruction ] in Iraq . "
Mr Khiyami said the facility was a deserted military building that had " nothing to do with a reactor " .
Syria is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , which gives it the right to enrich its own fuel for civil nuclear power , under inspection from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
North Korea has previously denied transferring nuclear technology to Syria .
Ulterior motive ?
The White House insists it is committed to the ongoing six-nation diplomacy , between North Korea and the US , China , Japan , South Korea and Russia that led to a landmark deal with Pyongyang , in February 2007 .
North Korea agreed to give up its nuclear weapons in return for aid and its removal from a blacklist of state sponsors of terrorism .
But the US has accused Pyongyang of missing the deadline to make a full nuclear declaration as promised .
The CIA briefing and statement coincided with the end of a two - day meeting between US and North Korean officials on Pyongyang 's nuclear programme , which both sides say went well - fuelling speculation that a deal may be imminent .
But questions are being asked whether the reactor claim is designed to reinforce those diplomatic efforts or an attempt by some in the administration to undermine them .

Sun Microsystems is hiring two expert dynamic language developers particularly versed in the development of the Python and off - shoot Jython languages .
James Gosling , vice president and Sun Fellow , announced March 3 as part of his keynote at Sun Tech Days in Sydney that Ted Leung , an Apache Software Foundation ( ASF ) member and long - time Python developer at the Open Source Applications Foundation ( OSAF ) , and Frank Wierzbicki , lead implementer of the Jython project , will become Sun employees .
Jython is an implementation of the Python language on the Java Virtual machine ( JVM ) , and the two new hires will be working full - time on Jython and paying particular attention to developer tools , Sun officials said .
Leung and Wierzbicki join other technologists , such as Ian Murdock , Charles Nutter , Thomas Enebo and Nick Kew , who have recently joined Sun to pursue open - source project development and community activities .
Murdock is the founder of the Debian Linux project , Nutter and Enebo are lead developers on the JRuby effort to create an implementation of Ruby on the JVM , and Kew is involved in a variety of ASF technologies and is working on OpenSolaris at Sun .
Over the past couple of years , Sun has been making a major investment in Ruby technology and its community .
Now the company wants to do the same with a variety of technologies , such as Python and Jython , Sun officials said .
JRuby is running successfully today on the Java platform , with performance generally better than the most widely deployed C - language version , Nutter said during a presentation at the Lang.NET conference on Microsoft 's campus in Redmond , Wash . , in January .
Jython has been running for years , and has been deployed in production in a variety of applications .
Meanwhile , Sun is working on an effort known as the " Da Vinci Machine " project , which is working on changes to future releases of the Java platform to make it an even better host for dynamic languages , said John Rose a Sun engineer and lead of the Da Vinci Machine project , who also spoke at Lang.
NET .
According to Sun officials , they said the Java platform is bigger than just the Java language , and they support giving developers a choice , so Sun is planning to support multiple languages on the Java platform .
Sun has made investments in Ruby and JRuby , and even offered contributions to the Ruby on Rails community .
In addition , Sun has included Ruby and JRuby tooling support in its open source NetBeans IDE ( integrated development environment ) as well as its optimized runtime environments GlassFish and Solaris - with JRuby and Ruby , respectively , Gosling said .
The company hopes to make similar investments in the Python technology and community , Sun officials said .
They said that while the company expects that Jython will have a role to play , just as JRuby does , Sun will use native Python and will invest in its growth .
As for Python and Jython support in NetBeans , Sun officials said stay tuned .
Python is a dynamic object - oriented programming language that is used for many kinds of software development , from Web to desktop applications , running on a spectrum of operating systems as well as virtual machines .
Python offers high developer productivity and ease of integration with other languages and tools and enjoys an avid user community .
Sun is following Microsoft in supporting popular dynamic languages such as Python and Ruby to run on the companies ' core application platforms and hiring the talent to get it done .
Microsoft hired Jim Hugunin to bring Python to the .
Net Framework with his IronPython implementation , and the software giant also hired Ruby expert John Lam to bring Ruby to .
Net in a project known as IronRuby .
Meanwhile , Sun is a platinum sponsor in the upcoming PyCon 2008 conference , the annual conference on Python development .
Sun officials said the company recently submitted an application for membership in the Python Software Foundation ( PSF ) .
GUATEMALA CITY ( Reuters ) - Guatemala is investigating radio advertisements seeking elite ex-soldiers , who have been known to work for drug cartels , to smuggle goods into Mexico , officials said on Thursday .
The ads were broadcast in the lawless northern jungle region of Peten , home to a tough military training center for Kaibil soldiers , infamous during Guatemala 's civil war as a brutal guerilla - fighting , special forces unit .
" We invite all citizens who have served in the military and graduated as Kaibils to work securing vehicles transporting merchandise to Mexico , " the radio spot said , according to a local newspaper .
The ad gave a telephone contact number .
Former Kaibil soldiers have been lured to work as assassins and run security for powerful drug lords by cash payments that can be as much as 10 times the average army salary , according to a Kaibil commander interviewed by Reuters .
Spokesmen for the Interior Ministry and the army said authorities still were investigating the origin of the radio ads , which may have been transmitted on pirated airwaves .
Created in the 1970s to fight a counter - insurgency campaign against leftist guerrillas during the 1960 - 96 civil war , the red - bereted Kaibil fighters were made to eat raw dog guts as part of their training .
They were accused of massacres during the war , which left more than 200,000 dead .
More recently , beheadings of policemen and drug rivals in Mexico have been blamed on ex-Guatemalan soldiers working with the Zetas , a renegade unit that broke from the Mexican army to serve as the Gulf cartel 's enforcement arm .
The Zetas have used brazen advertising along the northern U.S. - Mexico border to recruit foot soldiers , stringing banners from bridges over main roads in the towns of Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo offering well - paid jobs .
Some 75 percent of the cocaine leaving Colombia is smuggled through Central America and much of it ends up crossing the porous Guatemalan - Mexican border .
Drug planes land on secret jungle landing strips and trucks move the cargo north to the United States .
President Felipe Calderon is cracking down on Mexico 's drug gangs , deploying thousands of police and soldiers to hot spots around the country .
Drug violence in Mexico has killed more than 900 people this year .

Election judges at a Far North Side Chicago precinct told 20 voters that a non-working voting pen contained " invisible ink . "
It 's invisible ink , officials said .
The scanner will count it .
But their votes were n't recorded after all .
" Part of me was thinking it does sound stupid enough to be true , " said Amy Carlton , who had serious doubts but went ahead and voted anyway .
As it turns out , Carlton was one of 20 voters at the precinct who were given the wrong pen to use .
They were also then told , apparently by a misinformed judge , that the pens have invisible ink , elections officials said .
As a result , the votes were not counted .
But officials insisted there were no dirty tricks involved .
You are here : Home / Bizarre Stuff / Uncategorized / Secret Archives of the Vatican
You would think that the Vatican ’s Secret Archives would be some dumb conspiracy theory .
I mean , it sounds ridiculous .
The Vatican ’s Secret Archives .
Let it roll off your tongue .
Surely , we ’re into serious conspiracy weirdness here .
Except , of course , that there really is such a thing .
And it ’s pretty much exactly what you think it is .
There are a lot of reasons for an organization like the Catholic Church to have Secret Archives .
After all , they ’ve been in the conspiracy business for millennia longer than Majestic - 12 .
They ’ve been in the disinformation business for about 18 times as long as Donald Rumsfeld has been alive .
They were taking secret vows when the Masons were just a bunch of architects .
And they have more to hide that Richard M. Nixon on his worst day .
The Catholic Church first officially started keeping a library around the fourth century .
Formed at the height of the first great heresy craze , the contents of this library included a lot of attacks on heretical branches of Christianity and the documents and scriptures used by these heretical branches ( which the Church fathers admitted to having read ) .
The entire contents of the pre-eighth century archives , presumably including all these fascinating heresies , mysteriously disappeared , according to the Vatican ’s official account of the library ’s history , “ for reasons not entirely known . ”
The library was strictly closed to the public until around the 15th century , when the church decided to open its contents for the masses .
OK , not all of the contents .
Starting in the fourth century , the Catholic Church , in a position of political power for the first time , had been ruthlessly suppressing what it saw as heresy :
" Theodosius is said to be the first ( Roman emperor ) who pronounced heresy a capital crime ; this law was passed in 382 against the Encratites , the Saccophori , the Hydroparastatae , and the Manichaeans .
Heretical teachers were forbidden to propagate their doctrines publicly or privately ; to hold public disputations ; to ordain bishops , presbyters , or any other clergy ; to hold religious meetings ; to build conventicles or to avail themselves of money bequeathed to them for that purpose .
Slaves were allowed to inform against their heretical masters and to purchase their freedom by coming over to the Church .
The children of heretical parents were denied their patrimony and inheritance unless they returned to the Catholic Church .
The books of heretics were ordered to be burned . "
Well , most of the books .
After all , you would have to be pretty stupid to destroy valuable intelligence on your most hated enemies ( read the Catholic Encyclopedia ’s entry on heresy for a sense of the magnitude of enmity we ’re talking about here ) .
Around the time the library first opened to the public , Pope Paul IV issued the “ index of prohibited books . ”
Reading , possessing or distributing these books had a spiritual penalty of excommunication ( i.e. , condemnation to hell without appeal ) , and in Catholic countries , they often had civil penalties as well ( of varying severity , depending on the nature of the books ) .
Ironically , the pope issued an order later that same year mitigating the penalties regarding violations of the Index ’s non-reading list , but the order was conveniently “ lost ” until 1909 .
Whoops !
Guess they should ’ve invented the Dewey decimal system while they were opening the library .
This minor paperwork snafu justified 400 years of suppression and censorship , and when the modification of the order was discovered , it was ignored in favor of 400 years precedent , until the church finally lightened the order ( slightly ) in 1966 .
While all this sounds pretty revolting to the American mindset , the church officially condones censorship even today : “ Censorship of books is a supervision of the press in order to prevent any abuse of it .
In this sense , every lawful authority , whose duty it is to protect its subjects from the ravages of a pernicious press , has the right of exercising censorship of books . ”
Starting in the third century , the Church had expressly ordered the destruction of heretical books , but their contents were clearly referenced by the main heresy - hunters of the day , such as Irenaeus , a Father of the Church who wrote extensively about the fallacies of heresy .
His texts explicitly admit he had read some of the source materials , as well as showing a great familiarity with the various beliefs of the many different heretic sects in existence at the time .
The church ’s official history of the archives confirms it contained such materials as a resource for those designated to fight against heresy .
Thus , the existence of a secret archive became inevitable for an organization obsessed with information control .
Whatever form this archive took , it indisputably dates back to the fourth century at the latest .
According to the Vatican , the early secret archive contained mainly the names of believers and wealthy patrons of the church , but as noted above , it almost assuredly contained copies of heretical and banned works , information deemed too “ dangerous ” for the public .
As the centuries wore on , the list of banned and dangerous books grew and grew , thanks to repeated expansions of the enemies list and aggressive attempts to snuff out the list ’s members .
The Inquisitions rounded up hundreds of books on topics ranging from Protestantism to Witchcraft and ritual magic , to the libraries of groups like the Knights Templar and the Cathars .
The latter groups might have had some particularly explosive additions for the library .
Modern Conspiracy theorists have speculated that the Templars and the Cathars could have been protecting secrets like the possibility that Jesus Christ did n’t die on the cross as advertised , and that there might be hard evidence to support that claim , not to mention descendents of the allegedly sexless messiah .
Pope Pius IV is credited with first officially designating the existence of something which would formally be called the “ Secret Archive . ”
The actual building was completed early in the 17th century and remained an ironclad fortress of forbidden information until the end of the 19th century , when it was purportedly opened to select scholars .
A heavily edited index of the Archives contents was published , and a large set of rules were developed regarding who got access to what .
An even more secret archive known as the “ Apostolic Penitentiary ” exists , containing papal documents and canon law , and a lot of other stuff which is super - classified .
Absolutely no one is allowed access .
As the 20th century dawned , the increasingly free flow of information around the world ( and the decreasing political power of the Catholic Church ) made it more and more difficult for the Vatican to effectively control what people were reading .
Archaeological discoveries of ancient Gnostic texts spilled the beans on the original heretics , and a vast surge of interest in all things magical and occult just made things worse .
It ’s difficult to justify banning access to the rituals of witchcraft , just for instance , when every major bookseller in American carries three or four flavors of “ Teen Witch Spell Kits . ”
Another predictable problem arose when the Vatican admitted the secret archives existed .
People very naturally began guessing what might be in there , sometimes very accurately .
Among the more recent good guesses were the contents of the Third Secret of Fatima , an allegedly devastating prophecy of doom delivered by the Virgin Mary in a series of appearances to illiterate peasant children which was allegedly revealed by the Church in 2000 .
Under intense pressure , the Church released a series of 20th century documents from the secret archives relating to papal complicity in the rise of the Nazis in Germany .
In addition to Nazi collaboration , the archives are generally thought to contain rather a lot of information about the Catholic Church ’s wrongdoings , such as the current scandal on priestly pedophilia .
In fact , the archives contain miles of allegations concerning the sexual kinks and other vices enjoyed by priests and bishops , dating back to at least the 14th century , and possibly even earlier .
Realizing the danger of such disclosures , the Vatican structured access to the archives to allow a minimum of accidental disclosures and a maximum of secrecy .
The most obvious way to do this is also the most effective .
It ’s strictly prohibited to go browsing the shelves in the Vatican ’s secret archives .
It ’s unclear whether even the archive ’s librarians are allowed to do so .
Scholars wishing to review information in the archives have to arrive at the gate knowing exactly what documents they want , which is a pretty crappy way to encourage scholarship but a great way to make sure no one stumbles onto the Explicit Erotic Diaries of Jesus and Mary .
Scholars also have to present their research requests in writing in advance , allowing the librarians ample time to decide between their three options in responding â€ ” 1 ) bring out the requested document , 2 ) claim the document does n’t exist , or 3 ) admit the document exists but refuse to give the scholar access .
So if you were hoping poke around the archives looking for evidence that Jesus was an extraterrestrial , just forget it .
You have a better chance of getting a guided tour of Area 51 than getting a glimpse of the Sacred Alien Rectal Probing Device .
Robotic Body Scoopers : Bring Out Your Dead
If you have ever seen “ Monty Python ” , then you would remember the scene where the filthy man covered in muck comes around with a wheel barrel chiming “ Bring out your dead “ .
In Japan , the task of extracting their dead has become a bit more advanced .
Meet Robokiyu the Rescue Robot , whose job it is to come in and extract the dead from any situation .
Owned by the Tokyo Fire Department and controlled by remote control Robokiyu uses two movable arms to drag a person ’s body up the slide located in the front of the machine .
Do n’t worry if you happen to be presumed dead and picked up by Robokiyu , he has fresh oxygen pumping through him at all times for your convenience .
Robokiyu is also not above apology and will happily pour you a drink to say sorry .
Still I can only imagine how scary that would be .
Laying out after a long night of drinking to have be jolted awake in the arms of some giant robot trying to eat you … wow
You can see the official released PDF from the Tokyo Fire Department here – link .

If you like to download to listen to music in your tablet .
SoundCloud is among the best since they have been in the industry for some time .
If you want lots of music then you can choose from over 120 million of tracks .
You do n’t need to pay for anything as you can sign an account for free .
It is available in Web , iOS , Android , Sonos , Chromecast and Xbox One .
The company is based in Germany , which makes it a hotspot for downloaded music .
The company makes money through subscription , allowing premier partners to monetize their content through pre-roll audio ads , channel sponsorships , mobile display ads , and native content .
Interest going down
However , their sales must have been down for some time now since according to Google Trends , the number of people using the sites has dramatically goes down from January 2018 up to June 9 2018 .
Most of its users are coming from Delaware , New York , Hawaii , Louisiana , and Rhode Island .
It seems that it is hard to stay on top if you do n’t have something new to offer to your customers and that is what happening to SoundCloud right now .
Too many competitors
They must have been among one of the best in the industry at one time , but times are changing and there are a lot of competitors in the market offering the same thing .
You can choose among a list of apps to use in downloading the music .
That is the problem and with nothing new to offer , most people would rather use other apps since they must have seen something in there that SoundCloud do n’t have .
If this goes on , then there wo n’t be any way to tell on what the future holds for the company as it might get dissolve .
Of course , the company would surely find something to boost their popularity , but it would be a long shot and with many apps offering the same thing , how on earth this app would be among the top choices .
In fact , while working on his leaded gasoline additives for GM , Midgley managed to give himself lead poisoning .
Over the course of its first year in operation , ten employees died of lead poisoning and many others became ill .
Naturally , GM did n't like this .
Not because people were dying , but because the work was taking too long , probably because of all the people dying .
So , in the name of good old - fashioned American efficiency , they made a new plant and started using a faster , more dangerous method .

Within two months the new plant had a slew of new lead poisoning victims suffering hallucinations and insanity , as well as five more deaths .
Midgley did the only responsible thing .
At a press conference , he washed his hands in the leaded mixture and breathed in the fumes for a full minute to show it was safe .
Thus , for decades cars would continue to pump Migley 's poison into the air .

Polar ice caps melting ?
Let Westboro tell you why
by Jeremy Hooper
Speaking on the topic of the " Million * Fag* March , " the weekend event that was held in protest of Westboro Baptist Church 's anti-gay antics , an unidentified member of the Phelps family says the following on WBC 's blog :
This little event is a new milestone for the fags and their enablers of this generation .
They must do this - heretofore , they have hidden in the dens and rocks and scampered out under cover of darkness to work their mischief - vandalism , theft , etc .
They have even had a small protest here and there - just a couple .
They NEED to do this - they MUST get their resolve stiffened and they MUST encourage this generation to see that this is a good path for them to take - it will certainly result in making the Word of God disappear from off the land and that means - MAKE US SHUT UP .
So - hold onto your hat and stay tuned !
We will shortly see the face of this event and what the Lord will do in response !
The Lord is coming and america is DOOMED !!
Things are getting into place and the very earth is preparing for that awesome and fiery event !!
The dummies call it global warming !
Okay , first off : Gays have been hiding under the cover of darkness ?
What , was this blog post written in 1972 ?
Because let 's be real here --
Gays have been taking to the streets , airwaves , political arena , and national consciousness for decades now .
Westboro , what with their pickets of anyone who even farts in a gay - friendly manner , should be aware of this fact more than anyone .
But disingenuous presentations of gay visibility aside , let 's now instead talk about global warming .
Is Westboro seriously looking at climate change as if it's the Earth 's way of telling us that the Lord 's coming to destroy us ?
Hmm .
That just seems to us like such " a convenient untruth . "
And it also seems like a very roundabout way to send a message .
Hell , we can't even all agree that such a change is even happening .
Would n't the Earth 's preparation for God 's wrath be a little more undeniable ?
Would n't it be the sort of thing that makes people want to get their asses to a church rather than to the Home Depot to pick up some energy efficient light bulbs ?
But whatever -- you can decide for yourself whether it's our horrid treatment of the environment or if it's the slow dissipation of the horrid treatment of gay people that 's truly jacking up the planet .
As for us , we 'll continue to love the way we were meant to love , and to recycle the lube bottles when we 're done .
*** NOTE : The full Westboro blog post can be found on their website .
However , a link from us is something those insensitive creatures will never receive .
Your thoughts
RECYCLE !.... Oh HOOT !!
I love it .
Thanks for making my AM .
But you must warn us about these comments that can wreak our keyboards !...
No ,
of course , we should just expect them of you , especially in the AM and be sure our coffee , or bev of choice , is safely down before we read you .

NEW ORLEANS 
There is disappointment but little surprise here at a federal judge ’s grudgingly absolving the Army Corps of Engineers of liability in the flooding of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina .
Although the decision , issued Wednesday , was sharply critical of the corps , the judge ’s finding has if anything only hardened the ill feelings against the government that have hung over this city since the storm .
The plaintiffs in the class - action suit dismissed by the judge were many of the hundreds of thousands of people who filed claims here against the corps last year because of the levee breaches that flooded the city .
They lined up in cars and on foot and jammed the streets around the agency ’s district headquarters , acting out what has been a loudly spoken article of faith since the days in 2005 when water covered 80 percent of New Orleans and ruined the homes of thousands : the corps  not nature , not a record - breaking storm surge and not local politics or local negligence  was to blame .
The judge , Stanwood R. Duval Jr. of the Federal District Court here , a son of South Louisiana , heartily seconded that notion on Wednesday , suggesting that the corps was guilty of “ gross incompetence . ”
But Judge Duval said he was powerless to rule favorably on the lawsuit because the Flood Control Act of 1928 granted legal immunity to the government in the event of failure of flood control projects like levees .
PHILADELPHIA
It had to be the first time in history that a presidential candidate had a hip - hop moment .
Barack Obama , who says he listens to Jay - Z along with his “ old school guy ” favorites like Earth , Wind & Fire and the Temptations , alluded to the rapper ’s 2003 hit “ Dirt Off Your Shoulder ” on Thursday to sweep away concerns about his pugnacity .
After conceding that the Philly debate was tough , he brushed the imaginary lint of Hillary , George and Charlie from his shoulders , in a wordless reference to Jay - Z ’s lyrics in his anthem about not letting anyone crimp your ride as you cruise from the bottom to the top : “ Got some , dirt on my shoulder , could you brush it off for me . ”
There ’s no doubt the cat is cool .
It ’s easy to imagine the wild reception many parts of the world would give a President Obama as he loped down the stairs of Air Force One in his aviator glasses , the chic and chiseled Michelle on his arm .

If you could plug a speaker into my brain , I think it would sound a lot like Curtis Roads ' music .
Here 's what you 'd hear : a thousand marbles bouncing on a tile floor , a swarm of bees , and some Morse code — all at the same time and all in a cave .
Roads is the foremost composer in a genre called microsound , where notes are broken into barely audible fragments as short as 1/1,000 of a second .
It 's a demanding field : Years of effort can yield only a few seconds of music .
Roads has been working on one arrangement for more than 20 years , and so far it 's only six minutes long .
I 'm listening to that piece at his home studio in Santa Barbara , California .
A dense wall of sound reverberates from a pair of $ 8,000 Bowers & Wilkins speakers .
Roads shakes his head sadly — it just does n't sound right to him .
At this point the only thing he 's sure of is the track 's title : 1987 , the year he started to compose it .
Back then , Roads was editor in chief of the MIT - based Computer Music Journal .
He was also one of the leading proponents of electronic music at a time when raves were beginning to popularize it .
Still , he felt that rave music was n't going to deliver the masterpiece the genre needed if it was to be taken seriously .
" The ravers create some beautiful sounds , but they do n't have a narrative , " he says .
" That 's what separates the men from the boys . "
Roads wanted to be a man , so he stepped down from the journal 's top spot and set about crafting his magnum opus .
But he could n't just start composing .
While Haydn , Mozart , and Beethoven could simply sit at the piano and create masterpieces , Roads first had to invent his own instrument .
He needed to code programs that could break open the note and manipulate the resulting shards of sound .
He felt like a physicist searching for subatomic particles .
His Cloud Generator software — a program that produces a startling range of sounds , from strange clicks to ethereal chirps — contains about 30,000 lines of code and took about a year to write .
Armed with this new instrument , Roads selected his favorite millisecond - long fragments and began arranging them bit by bit in the audio- editing app ProTools .
His indie - label debut , 2005 's Point Line Cloud , brought critical accolades but few listeners .
To many , his music remained inaccessible .
The piece that would transform computer music from obscure , nerdy noodling to crowd - awing Wagnerian epic has thus far eluded him .
But Roads remains committed .
He pushes back from the mixing board , rolling his chair across the slick wooden floor .
A few taps on the Mac keyboard pull up another unfinished track .
Thousands of sonic pinpricks fill the screen — the computer 's hard drive makes loud crunching noises as it loads the file .
Roads presses Play and I hear what sounds like a car crashing off a bridge .
The title does n't bode well for its completion : Never .

Klaatu on the Telecommunications Reform Act
Wilson Forbrush klaatu@clark.net
The following is a speech from the February 10 rally against the CDA , held opposite the White House .
Ahem , Hi .
I 'm not used to public speaking so if I am a bit hesitant or inarticulate , please forgive me .
Thank you .
We are gathered here today to protest the enactment of the Telecommunications Reform Act .
Most of us are probably mostly interested in the provisions within that much larger bill , provisions referred to as the Communications Decency Act , or the Exon / Gorton Bill .
It does n't matter what you call it , it relegates the Internet to a status less - covered by the First Amendment than would be most high - school publications .
Now , I will not go into any detail regarding the ignominy of having our favorite toy locked away from us by patriarchs who smugly patronize us as they advise us that when we 've grown up , we 'll know better .
I will not go into detail regarding the inarguable circumvention of our First Amendment rights , since that is not the issue here , the First Amendment rights which we are now exercising will remain untouched !
- pause - Especially freedom of the press .
But it will be the established press whose rights remain untouched .
We are the Internet ; We the People .
It is only by our consent that our government derives its just powers .
But the only consent that counts is informed consent , and we cannot be informed , not fully , unless we have an unrestricted flow of information between the people .
The Telecommunications Reform
Act of 1996 , while under seeming guise of fostering competition , is actually a bill which not only attempts ( under the ' indecency ' provisions ) to stifle the fastest way for any individual to reach the greatest number of his fellow citizens , peacefully assembled in cyberspace - but it stifles competition .
That 's right , this entire act is in direct contravention of Antitrust Law !
A trust is a gentleman 's agreement , where the robber barons of industry agree behind their closed doors to stay out of each other 's territories .
Constant negotiation between the corporate monoliths of the telecommunications industry have been underway , and behind closed doors these agreements have been reached .
We live in an age of mergers .
Microsoft joins NBC , and the immense entertainment machine of Disney has swallowed ABC whole .
Newspapers are owned by broadcast corporations which have their own interlocking directorships , and the web is drawn ever tighter .
While some news is too big to hide , and that we do see , there are millions of voices with stories to be told .
If the corporate communications trusts do not find those voices worthy , we do not hear them , and in the absence of a Fairness Doctrine or a people 's press those voices are silenced as surely as if they had been shot dead .
We are the Internet !
We the people .
The Internet is our medium .
We have our voices there , and the corporate sponsors of corporate media do not yet own us !
We can say what we want , and all who will listen can hear , and Bill Gates of Microsoft cannot through sponsorship - cancellation silence us because we prefer Linux as an operating system ; Michael Eisner of Disney cannot cancel us because we do n't want to watch " G " - rated cartoons !
We are not motivated by soap or deodorants .
Corporate sponsors hold no terrors for us , and publishing - houses ' marketing - specialists have no power over our need to publish today .
We have issues , intelligent issues , and we think for ourselves , and we participate in a creative act everytime we send E-mail or post on UseNet or make our own homepage .
We exercise our minds when we set up our servers , and when we establish our own links to the nets , we are cutting ourselves free of the loop of corporate media .
We are paying our own way , buying freedom of expression and the right to create .
We 're building it , we 're paying for it , we 've demanded it and we got it .
Our own private communications structure !
One that 's not available for shareholder buyouts .
The Telecommunications Reform
Act is not about indecency !
It is not about competition , it is anti-competition .
This is not about freedom of the press , it 's about the Establishment Press in collusion with the Telecom Monoliths stamping out the competition represented by We the Internet ; and the powers - that - be turn a winking eye and offer a hearty handshake to the corporate media that control public opinion and keep their kind in power .
We the People , We the Internet , This is not about decency , nor corporate competition , this is the Establishment Press , the Corporate Aristocracy , quaking in fear of their lives !
This is the Association of Buggy - Whip Manufacturers petitioning the State House to ban Automobiles and keep the roads safe for horses , or perhaps I should say dinosaurs .
We now have the means for the common citizens of average means to reach all of their peers .
No Harris / ABC
Polls , no sound bites , no talking heads on an idiot box .
We can publish to the entire world for the cost of an Internet subscription .
We 're saving a lot of trees and the energy needed to make them into paper .
Lots of corporate interest will be losing money , and the media giants of all stripes are , more importantly , losing audiences .
And we 're speaking our minds , directly to each other , by the millions .
That 's what this is all about .
Do n't let the PACs and the corporate media monopolies get away with this .
The only indecency here is the insult to the American people , thinking that we 're stupid enough to not notice what 's up .
Thank you .
Bomb Bomb Iran by Summer 's End ?
When Senator John McCain serenaded reporters last April with his " Bomb Bomb Iran , " I had to wonder .
Was this a taste of his aging flyboy humor ?
Or was he telling us what to expect should he ever become president ?
We may never find out .
If Vice President Dick Cheney has his way , he will beat McCain to the punch , possibly as soon as late May , after President George W. Bush returns from celebrating the 60th anniversary of Israel 's creation .
The evidence is surprisingly public , though in several bits and pieces that fit together like a jigsaw .
I hope that I 'm wrong in how I 've put the puzzle together , but here 's how it looks to me .
On February 25 of this year , Cheney made a surprise visit to the Sultanate of Oman , a longtime military ally just across the Strait of Hormuz from Iran .
He had come , an Omani official told The Associated Press , " to discuss regional security issues , including the US standoff with Iran over its nuclear program . "
A little over three weeks later , Cheney returned to Oman as part of a ten - day visit to several countries in the region , including Israel , Turkey and Saudi Arabia .
While in Oman , he gave an interview to Martha Raddatz of ABC News .
" Can you foresee any point where military action would be taken ? " Raddatz asked .
Cheney tried to downplay the question , but Raddatz persisted , asking specifically about the National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) , which concluded that Iran had shut down its nuclear arms program five years ago .
Cheney read the NIE differently .
The Iranians definitely had a program to develop a nuclear warhead , which they apparently stopped in 2003 , he insisted .
" We do n't know whether or not they 've restarted . "
Cheney emphasized that the Iranians were continuing with their uranium enrichment , which - he said - would give them the fissile material to make nuclear weapons .
He offered no evidence that the Iranian program would or could produce the highly enriched uranium they would need to make a bomb .
" VP : Iran May Have Resumed Weapon Program , " the headlines ran .
" Cheney : Iran might be next US target . "
The Israeli web site DEBKA added that Cheney was specifically talking about possible US military action in the region to shut down Iran 's nuclear program .
Punctuating Cheney 's remarks , the US Navy continues to build up its forces in the region , which now include two nuclear aircraft carriers and strike groups capable of attacking Iran or defending against missile attacks from Iran .
America 's military brass are also chiming in .
The Pentagon is considering " potential military courses of action " against Iran , warns the nation 's top military officer - Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
" It would be a mistake to think that we are out of combat capability . "
Mullen presented his threat , he said , as a response to Iranian support for Iraqi militias fighting US forces , as well as their support for Hamas , Hezbollah and the Taliban in Afghanistan .
He also repeated as fact Dick Cheney 's belief that Iran was pursuing nuclear weapons .
Mullen raised all this the day after the CIA reported to Congress that North Korea had supplied Syria with a nuclear reactor , which an Israeli air strike had destroyed last September .
Mullen 's timing added weight to his threat and raised the question of what role Israelis might play in an airstrike on Iran .
Cheney himself touched on the question when he returned from his ten - day trip .
In an interview with neo -conservative journalist Hugh Hewitt , he mentioned the widely reported threats that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has made against Israel .
" I know the Israelis well enough , and I was just there a couple of weeks ago , to know there is n't any way they 're prepared to ignore those kinds of statements coming out of Tehran , " said Cheney .
" They have to take them seriously , given their history .
And I think they perceive the possibility of an Iran armed with nuclear weapons as a fundamental threat to the very survival of the state of Israel . "
What exactly would the Israelis do ?
Cheney refused to say .
But an Israeli airstrike against Iran would prove far more difficult than the strike against Syria , and the Israelis would likely need American help in clearing the airspace over Iraq , guaranteeing non-interference from Saudi and other Arab air forces , sharing satellite intelligence , blinding Iranian radar , and possibly refueling the Israeli planes .
The Israelis would , of course , use long - range F - 15s and bunker - buster bombs that the US supplied , while the Iranians have announced that they will respond to any attack as coming from both Israel and the United States .
With all this in mind , Cheney might well want the Israelis to make the first strike , and when the Iranians try to retaliate , American forces could intervene " in self - defense " and " defense of our ally Israel . "
To be sure , others have previously predicted American and Israeli airstrikes against Iran , and those strikes never happened .
Hopefully , my parsing of the tea leaves will fail as well , either because of intervening events or a decision by Bush not to press ahead .
But Cheney has clearly started the war drums beating , and unless Congress shows far more gumption than it has on Iraq , I would not plan a late spring or summer trip to Iran or anywhere else in the Middle East or Persian Gulf .

Right now the Senate is embroiled in debate over whether or not to grant the major telecom companies ( chiefly AT&T and Verizon ) retroactive immunity for their participation in the NSA ’s illegal surveillance program , in addition to legitimizing vast new surveillance powers over Americans with almost no oversight .
You already know my feelings about that , so I wo n’t belabor the point .
On this issue , as with many others ( such as their opposition to net neutrality ) , the two giants of the telecom industry have been largely buddy - buddy .
Both of them stand to lose millions in damages from lawsuits brought against them for their actions , before even getting into the bad publicity the case has already caused .
It ’s easy to forget that these two companies are ( at least in a technical sense ) competitors , and do n’t always pursue the same goals in the same way .
Case in point :
I ’ve written recently about AT&T ’s desire to filter Internet traffic for illegal or copyrighted content , and how this may dovetail with the Bush regime ’s plans to spy on the Internet in greater detail .
Yesterday , Verizon ’s Tom Tauke told the New York Times ‘ Saul Hansell that his company , essentially , would not be getting down like that :
He said the companyâ€™s view combines a concern for the privacy of its customers with self interest .
It may be costly for it to get into the business of policing the traffic on its network .
Indeed , phone companies have largely spent a century trying not to be liable for what people say over their lines .
â€ œWe generally are reluctant to get into the business of examining content that flows across our networks and taking some action as a result of that content , â€  he said .
This is probably the closest any Verizon rep will ever get to admitting that discriminating in favor of or against Internet content is a bad idea , and that companies who build and host the “ pipes ” should n’t worry about what travels through them .
Now , as Matt Browner - Hamlin astutely notes , Verizon did n’t start suddenly giving a damn about customer privacy , as much as they do n’t want to be on the hook for enabling copyright violations , in addition to their potential liabilities from illegal spying lawsuits .
That ’s a lot of dough , even for a company with as much cash in the bank as Verizon .
Verizon also has less to worry about in terms of a bandwith crunch that might lead to content filtering and bandwith metering solutions toyed with by AT&T , Time Warner Cable , and Comcast .
Verizon ’s high - powered FiOS service is built on a direct fiber cable to the home ( FTTH for short ) , whereas AT&T ’s competing high - speed service , U - Verse , relies on traditional telephone copper wires for the “ last mile ” connection to subscribers .
Verizon , so far , has been winning the all - important connection speed battle , as well as many more overall customers than U - Verse .
But a buildout of this magnitude costs money , and even with Verizon ’s deliberate targeting of FiOS to wealthy suburban communities ( redlining lower - income and multi- dwelling units ) and massive phone rate increases , it ’s still going to take a decent chunk out of Verizon ’s stock price to make FiOS profitable .
This is actually one reason for the corporation ’s initial support of tiered pricing for Internet service and content favoring –they wanted to gouge money from content providers in order to subsidize their buildouts .
And having to play Internet traffic cop , with all the liabilities that may bring , could potentially cost Verizon more than it can handle .
Better to continue playing the “ dumb pipe ” and let the money roll in .
This , then , begs the question–why is AT&T pushing forward with its plans when Verizon is not ?
Is AT&T getting preferential treatment or subsidization from the government if it offers itself up as a content policeman for Hollywood and Washington both ?
I do n’t have an answer to that .
But this is one of the many issues that consumers and activists need to keep an eye on relating to these two companies , both of whom are intimately intertwined with the activities of our government at the highest levels , even as they ’re waging a quiet , unseen war for control over the hearts and minds–and wallets and bandwith –of America ’s communications .

Congress nods to tax hikes in shaping post - Bush budget
WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday rejected the idea of renewing many of President Bush 's tax cuts as all three major presidential candidates interrupted their campaigns to vote .
The House approved a budget blueprint that would raise taxes by $ 683 billion over the next five years .
The Senate did embrace Bush reductions aimed at low - income workers , married couples and people with children .
The House budget plan would provide generous increases to domestic federal programs , but it still is designed to bring the government 's budget back into the black by letting all of Bush 's tax cuts expire at the end of 2010 .
That plan passed the House on a 212-207 vote with Republicans unanimously opposing it .
The Senate voted 99 - 1 to extend the cuts for some workers as well as couples and parents .
Senators voted 52 - 47 to reject a move to extend tax cuts for middle - and higher - income taxpayers , investors and people inheriting businesses and big estates .
The votes were mostly symbolic , but they put senators in both parties on the record for when the tax cuts actually expire in three years .
Arizona Sen . John McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , voted for the full roster of Bush tax cuts .
Democratic presidential rival candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton , D - N.Y. , and Barack Obama , D - Ill. , voted against them .
The Senate was debating and voting into the night on a $ 3 trillion Democratic budget blueprint for 2009 .
The non-binding plan envisions a balanced budget in four years and promises generous increases for domestic programs , but achieves those goals only by assuming major tax increases when Bush 's tax cuts expire .
Obama and Clinton both promise to reverse Bush 's tax cuts for wealthier taxpayers , but the Democratic budget they 'll be voting for would allow income tax rates to go up on individuals making as little as $ 31,850 and couples earning $ 63,700 or more .
The House measure anticipates larger surpluses while allowing $ 683 billion worth of tax increases over five years with the expiration of Bush 's tax cuts .
Congress ' annual budget debate involves a non-binding budget resolution that sets the stage for subsequent bills affecting the annual appropriations bills .
Unless such follow - up legislation is passed , though , the budget debate has little real effect .
Congress rarely tackles difficult budget issues as elections loom , however , and a standoff with Bush means that Democrats might even take a pass on advancing the 12 appropriations bills .
Wasabi , or Japanese Horseradish , has a particularly pungent taste and scent .
Now researchers in Japan are using wasabi's overpowering odor in a new type of smoke detector / fire alarm that wakes the deaf through scent instead of sound .
You may have seen or even eaten wasabi before - it's that little dab of light green paste that comes alongside and often inside sushi .
As the old Brillcream ads used to say , however , " a little dab'll do ya " ... wasabi is STRONG .
Though not technically horseradish , wasabi packs a potent punch if you ingest too much at a time .
Image a severe slurpee brain freeze , only hot ... yes indeed , you want to be careful with wasabi !
Wasabi 's pungent perfume is said to be so strong it can wake the dead ... but in this case , it 's being used to wake the deaf .
Prototypes of a new silent smoke alarm that sprayed canned wasabi extract into a room succeeded in waking 13 out of 14 test subjects within 2 minutes .
One subject who is actually deaf awoke a mere 10 seconds after the wasabi essence was sprayed .
According to assistant professor Makoto Imai of Japan 's Shiga University of Medical Science , " The experiment was useful to ensure that the new device allows those with hearing disabilities to escape during an emergency . "
Watch an English - language video from the BBC explaining the device and testing below :
One might ask , " why not just use flashing lights " ?
It 's true that some current silent smoke detecting fire alarms designed for the sonically impaired use strobe lights , but think about it - our eyes are closed when we slumber and many people sleep with the blankets pulled over their head .
They do n't stop breathing , though !
Plans are afoot to release a finished version of the wasabi fire alarm for retail sale within the next several years .

*** UPDATE , Sept. 30 , 2011 : The Japanese team who invented the Wasabi Silent Smoke Alarm has been awarded the " prestigious " Ig Nobel Prize for 2011 .
Now that 's hot !
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - More than half of U.S. doctors now favor switching to a national health care plan and fewer than a third oppose the idea , according to a survey published on Monday .

The survey suggests that opinions have changed substantially since the last survey in 2002 and as the country debates serious changes to the health care system .
Of more than 2,000 doctors surveyed , 59 percent said they support legislation to establish a national health insurance program , while 32 percent said they opposed it , researchers reported in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine .
The 2002 survey found that 49 percent of physicians supported national health insurance and 40 percent opposed it .
“ Many claim to speak for physicians and represent their views .
We asked doctors directly and found that , contrary to conventional wisdom , most doctors support national health insurance , ” said Dr. Aaron Carroll of the Indiana University School of Medicine , who led the study .
“ As doctors , we find that our patients suffer because of increasing deductibles , co-payments , and restrictions on patient care , ” said Dr. Ronald Ackermann , who worked on the study with Carroll .
“ More and more , physicians are turning to national health insurance as a solution to this problem . ”
PATCHWORK
The United States has no single organized health care system .
Instead it relies on a patchwork of insurance provided by the federal and state governments to the elderly , poor , disabled and to some children , along with private insurance and employer - sponsored plans .
Many other countries have national plans , including Britain , France and Canada , and several studies have shown the United States spends more per capita on health care , without achieving better results for patients .
An estimated 47 million people have no insurance coverage at all , meaning they must pay out of their pockets for health care or skip it .
Contenders in the election for president in November all have proposed various changes , but none of the major party candidates has called for a fully national health plan .
Insurance companies , retailers and other employers have joined forces with unions and other interest groups to propose their own plans .
“ Across the board , more physicians feel that our fragmented and for - profit insurance system is obstructing good patient care , and a majority now support national insurance as the remedy , ” Ackermann said in a statement .
The Indiana survey found that 83 percent of psychiatrists , 69 percent of emergency medicine specialists , 65 percent of pediatricians , 64 percent of internists , 60 percent of family physicians and 55 percent of general surgeons favor a national health insurance plan .
The researchers said they believe the survey was representative of the 800,000 U.S. medical doctors .
Nato has been split on US missile defence plans , amid Russian objections
Nato countries have agreed to back US plans to site a missile defence system in Europe , at a summit in Romania .
Member states will endorse a communiqué backing the plan to position missile defence bases in the Czech Republic and Poland , US officials said .
Albania and Croatia were invited to join the 26 - member alliance .
But Georgia and Ukraine will not be put immediately on the path to membership , while Macedonia was told it must solve a dispute with Greece before joining .
The communiqué on missile defence , circulated by US officials , acknowledges ballistic missile proliferation as " an increasing threat to allied forces , territory and populations " .
It says the US - led system will make a " substantial contribution to the protection of allies " .
Georgia 's and Ukraine 's membership in the alliance is a huge strategic mistake which would have most serious consequences for pan-European security

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Win some , lose some for US Georgia eyes Iraq route Send us your comments
It also calls for steps to be taken to deploy a parallel Nato system to defend any countries not covered by the US scheme
The BBC 's diplomatic correspondent , Jonathan Marcus , says that consensus on missile defence is a significant achievement for US President George W Bush , who wanted to get full Nato support for the project before he leaves office .
The alliance had been deeply divided , amid strong Russian objections to the plan .
The US says the system is needed to counter a potential threat from rogue states like Iran , but Moscow fears it could be used against Russia .
The agreement emerged as US and Czech officials announced they had reached a deal to site a to base a missile defence radar on Czech soil , while Poland and the US resumed talks in Warsaw on locating 10 interceptor missiles in Poland .
' Not happy '
Nato has confirmed it will not yet offer membership to Georgia or Ukraine after the 26 - member alliance was split on the issue .
Nato Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told a news conference Georgia and Ukraine would become members eventually , something Moscow described as a " huge strategic mistake " .
NEW NATO MEMBERS Albania
Pop : 3.6 million Area : 28,748 sq km Military service : compulsory but due to be abolished by 2010 Army : aiming for army of 14,500 Croatia
Pop : 4.4 million Area : 56,538 sq km Military service : draft abolished in 2008 Army : aiming for army of 16,000 Germany and France had been opposed to putting the two former Soviet republics on the path to membership , amid concerns voiced by Russia over Nato 's eastward expansion .
Georgian diplomats said they were " not happy " with the delay but welcomed the promise of eventual membership .
Nato officials said Macedonia could begin talks on joining the alliance as soon as it had resolved a dispute with Greece over its name .
Macedonia 's membership was strongly opposed by Greece , which has a northern province that is also called Macedonia .
It argued that the former Yugoslav republic 's insistence on being known as Macedonia implied a territorial claim .
Macedonian officials said their rejection was a " huge disappointment " that would undermine stability in the Balkans , and said they would leave the three - day summit early .
French deployment
Our correspondent says the decisions on Georgia , Ukraine and Macedonia are setbacks for President Bush , who had been pushing for membership for all three countries .
Q&A : Missile defence Row as Nato door creaks open Greek veto for Macedonia bid Separately , President Nicolas Sarkozy indicated France would decide next year whether to return to the Nato military command it left in 1966 in protest at the dominance of US commanders .
He also said a battalion of extra French troops would be deployed to Afghanistan , easing fears of a crisis within the Western coalition there .
The US says the French move , expected to involve up to 1,000 extra soldiers , will free up some of its troops to move to southern Afghanistan , where Canada had demanded Nato reinforcements be sent .
Canada 's parliament voted last month to extend its military mission in volatile southern Afghanistan to 2011 - but only if its allies sent reinforcements .

Italian architects Massimiliano and Doriana Fuksas have won the competition to design a new terminal at Shenzen Bao'an International Airport in China .
The 400,000 square metre terminal will be built in three phases , with the final elements completed in 2035 .
Here 's all the info from the architects :
--
Shenzhen is one of the most important industrial and touristical locations of whole China .
Shenzhen is located in the southern portion of the Guangdong Province , on the eastern shore of the Pearl River Delta .
Neighbouring the Pearl River Delta and Hong Kong , Shenzhen ’s location gives it a geographical advantage for economic development .
Shenzhen International Airport Terminal will be the gateway to the city of Shenzhen .
The first and last image an air traveller has of a city are those created by the traveller ’s impression of the airport .
T3 in Shenzhen International Airport can positively influence the image that international , national business people and tourists have of Shenzhen .
The master plan for Shenzhen Bao’an International Airport intends to offer world - class transportation services .
Achieving this means that Shenzhen airport must be operate at the following levels :
Globally - T3 at Shenzhen Bao’an International Airport must serve as the global aviation gateway between China and the rest of the world .
Nationally - as the fourth largest following Beijing , Shanghai , and Guangzhou in China , Shenzhen Bao’an International Airport is a trunk of domestic flights and hub of national flights .
Enhancement of transfer services between international and domestici flights will improve the distribution of wealth among all Chinese cities .
Regionally - Currently , there are more than 40 cities with populations of over one million within 3.5 hours flying time of Shenzhen .
This makes Shenzhen an excellent location for a regional hub .
Passengers travelling from neighboring cities could fly to Shenzhen to connect with long distance global flights or flights to other Asian cities .
In construction terms , its design optimises the performance of materials selected on the basis of local availability , functionality , application of local skills , and low cost procurement .
Remarkably , it will have been designed and built in just few years .
For the complete of T3 Shenzhen Bao’an Airport there are three phases .
Phase 1 ( in 2015 )
Major facilities in Phase 1 will include the unit terminal with 63 contact gates , the first stage of the APM , traffic system , parking place , landscape , and shopping centre .
Train service for APM will not be available until the complete of Phase 2 .
Phase 2 ( in 2025 )
Expansion after Phase 1 will occur based on masterplan .
During Phase 2 , the first remote passenger concourse will be constructed to add gates and the satellite terminal with rail stations will be operational .
This will require expansion of the APM .
Phase 3 ( in 2035 )
Development of the airport ’s west side will continue until about 2035 when T3 Shenzhen International Airport will be fully constructed .
Phase 3 continues the demand driven development process .
The satellite terminal will again undergo expansion and more remote concourse will be added during this decade .
And also there will be expansion of Terminal head house .
The volume of extension of Terminal head house is going to be glass facade with glass roof so that the extension of building can have continuity in terms of construction material .
Consequently this way of extension can have merits not only for the aesthetic reason but also for construction .
Designed for maximum flexibility to cope with the unpredictable nature of the aviation industry , like its predecessors , it aims to resolve the complexities of modern air travel , combining spatial clarity with high service standards .
Terminal and Concourse
The passenger terminal and concourse constitute the major portion of the passengers ’ perception of an airport .
Factors which affect passengers ’ impressions include processing times , walking distances , ease of orientation , crowding , and availability of desired amenities .
Each of these has been carefully considered in developing the concept for the passenger terminal and concourse .
The terminal is open to views to the outside and planned under a single unifying roof canopy .
Natural light is coming through the skin that is double skins with pattern .
The skin avoids direct sunlight to reduce energy consumption and creates elegant atmosphere .
It makes the air travellers have marvellous impression with comfort .
Terminal
The plaza provides access to the baggage handling , departures and arrivals hall on the ground floor as well as to the cafes and restaurants , offices and facilities for business meetings .
Void in the grand departure hall establishes not only a visual link between different levels but also the passages of natural light to the other levels .
The grand departure hall has vast plaza with check - in counters that is brighten elegantly by the diffusion of light from the roof .
This provides a pleasant waiting space with check - in desks , an information counter , car rental companies and airline counters .
The mega - trusses are used to have this vast closed plaza .
Travellers arrives at the terminal at 14 m through the car way .
The canopy of the airport can make them feel welcome with light effect that is created by double slit of canopy .
After check - in two types of travellers , international and domestic departure is going to divide vertically .
For international departure travellers has to go down using escalators while domestic travellers go to security are a( CIQ ) at 14m .
Concourse
Concourse area is one of key function area at the airport .
Concourse area at T3 Shenzhen International Airport is composed with three levels .
Each level is destined for independent function : departure , arrival , and services .
The form of the concourse is simple , but elegant .
It is also for the consideration of expansion of the airport in the future .
The concept of interior space is fluid .
There are two different spatial characters in concourse space .
One is movement , the other is pause .
Retails and waiting lounges will be islands for pause .
Especially retails are key - tenant in concourse space , not only for the management of airport but also for the impression of airport with high - services .
Retails and waiting lounges seem to be made naturally following spatial fluid .
The inner skin is made of very fine net .
The movement of this skin gives concourse space elegant atmosphere .
When we see the concourse from 14 m level it will be marvellous space .

Jonathan Pollard AP NEW YORK ( AP )  A former U.S. Army mechanical engineer was arrested Tuesday on charges he slipped classified documents about nuclear weapons to an employee of the Israeli Consulate who also received information from convicted Pentagon spy Jonathan Pollard , authorities announced .
Ben-ami Kadish faces four counts of conspiracy , including allegations that he conspired to disclose U.S. national defense documents to Israel and that he acted as an agent of the Israeli government , U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia and FBI officials said .
A criminal complaint said the activities occurred from 1979 through 1985 while Kadish worked at the Army 's Armament Research , Development and Engineering Center in Dover , N.J. Kadish , a U.S. citizen , is accused of taking classified documents home several times and letting the Israeli government worker photograph them .
The documents included information about nuclear weapons , a modified version of an F - 15 fighter jet , and the Patriot missile air defense system , the complaint said .
According to the complaint , the Israeli government worker on numerous occasions during 1979 - 1985 gave Kadish lists of U.S. national defense classified documents for Kadish to obtain .
The complaint said Kadish , born in Connecticut , was employed from October 1963 to January 1990 as a mechanical engineer at the Army 's Picatinny Arsenal in Dover , where the research center is based .
The complaint said the Israeli worker , whose name was not given , is an Israeli citizen .
It said that in the late 1970s , he was employed at Israeli Aircraft Industries in Israel , a defense manufacturing contractor for the Israeli government .
From July 1980 through November 1985 , he was the consul for science affairs at the Israeli Consulate General in Manhattan , the complaint said .
The complaint noted that Pollard was charged in November 1985 with espionage - related offense after he provided classified information to the same Israeli worker , among other people .
The Israeli worker left the United States in November 1985 and has not returned , the complaint said .
Pollard , a former civilian intelligence analyst for the U.S. Navy , pleaded guilty while standing trial for transferring military secrets to Israel while working at the Pentagon .
He is serving a life sentence .

One in a series of articles about three teenagers and their wartime enlistment in the Marines .
In the nine months after he graduated from high school , Lance Cpl. Daryl Crookston was trained to close and kill .
The proper pursuit of the enemy was pounded into him during boot camp and combat drills .
Last month , as his unit prepared to ship out to Afghanistan , some Marines in Crookston ’s platoon did n’t think he was capable of killing a man .
He ’s deeply religious .
He had chosen to stop cursing and drinking -- and that , in the Marines ’ testosterone - stoked world , suggested weakness .
Crookston , 19 , and away from home for the first time , is certain he could kill if called upon , particularly if his quarry were one of the religious zealots of the Taliban .
If Talibs can kill for their ideals , he said , he could kill for his .
“ I ’m defending my homeland -- my family -- my country , ” he said , weary and filthy after a long day of training in the Mojave Desert .
“ And I ’m willing to kill for my country . ”
Combat and killing were remote concepts in June , when Crookston and two friends graduated from high school in Santa Clarita after joining the Marine Corps .
They enlisted in the buddy program , which guaranteed they would go through boot camp together .
Crookston , Daniel Motamedi and Steven Dellinger hoped they would be assigned to the same unit .
But after 13 weeks of boot camp and eight weeks of infantry training , they were sent to different battalions .
All were in California , but training demands kept them apart .
Crookston was the first to deploy to war -- to Kandahar from the Marine base at Twentynine Palms the first week of April .
Lance Cpl. Motamedi ’s battalion is scheduled to leave Camp Pendleton soon on a “ float , ” a ship to the Middle East , where the unit could be sent to Afghanistan or Iraq by summer .
Lance Cpl. Dellinger , 19 , will remain at Twentynine Palms until his unit , inevitably , is deployed into combat .
For the friends , the lure of combat motivated them to enlist .
They considered war a noble calling , a sure path to manhood and glory .
All three chose infantry , a position virtually assured of combat .
Asked whether they had second thoughts about enlisting in a time of war , all gave the same brisk answer : “ No regrets . ”
The friends trained together at the School of Infantry at Camp Pendleton last fall .
There , the boot camp graduates were drilled on grunt work -- the dirty , demanding business of laboring in small groups to find and kill the enemy over rough terrain , sometimes in the dark .
They spent days either assaulting or defending a mock Middle Eastern village erected on a bald hillside , firing blanks .
During one exercise , the Marines fired wildly when attacked by a sniper , played by an instructor .
“ You dumped rounds with no idea what you ’re firing at ! ” the instructor screamed afterward .
“ That volley of fire probably went into civilian homes .
That ’s how you kill innocent people ! ”
Later , another instructor , Sgt. Louis Serafin , said aggressiveness was preferable to timidity .
“ I ’d rather have them trigger - happy now , in training , than be hesitant ” in combat , he said .
Serafin , an Iraq veteran , assured the Marines that it was normal to be disoriented .
“ Combat is controlled chaos , ” he said .
The instructors stressed death and danger .
The focus was on killing the enemy before the enemy could kill them .
“ Get yourself ready physically and mentally , ” an instructor advised .
“ It ai n’t going to be no Hollywood movie .
Marines are going to die over there .
Get used to it . ”
Crookston and Motamedi , 18 , moved on this spring to weeks of specialized desert training to prepare them for combat overseas -- Crookston at Twentynine Palms and Motamedi at Ft. Irwin , 85 miles away .
At both bases , elaborate Afghan villages were stocked with wily insurgents , complacent Afghan police , inscrutable villagers and reclusive women with their faces covered -- all played by Afghan Americans .
For Crookston , boot camp and combat training were the most trying experiences of his young life .
“ It ’s definitely not as glamorous as everyone depicted it , ” he said .
“ It ’s exhausting . ”
The Marines also faced stultifying boredom , the endless rote , the mind - numbing sameness of the pale desert landscape -- all staples of overseas deployment .
They slept in the dirt and cold , wolfed down packaged MREs , stank of stale sweat and unwashed feet , just like troops in Afghanistan .
Channeling the aggression
The desert training was blunt and practical .
Marines learned to rub their hands together when examining a buddy for wounds in the dark ; blood is sticky .
They were told to carry markers for scrawling on the foreheads of the wounded : “ T ” after applying a tourniquet , and “ M ” after giving morphine .
After one live - fire exercise known as Mojave Viper , at Twentynine Palms , Capt .
George Gordy critiqued Crookston ’s platoon .
They had not been sufficiently lethal .
“ The best way to suppress someone is to freakin ’ kill ‘ em , ” Gordy said .
He told the platoon to remember the acronym SAM-K -- suppress , assess , move and kill .
The Marines nodded absently .
It seemed likely that even if they forgot the first three letters , they would always remember the last .
After briefing sessions , the Marines typically shout “ Kill ! ” as a sign - off .
When they are particularly motivated , they scream “ Kill ‘em all ! ”
At Ft. Irwin one morning , Motamedi ’s platoon was sent to search a village for insurgents and weapons , and to detain an HVT -- a high - value target , or insurgent leader .
The platoon was accosted by the police chief and mayor , who screamed at them and tried to block their way .
The Marines manhandled the police chief .
That drew a rebuke from an observer - controller known as a coyote , an Army officer acting as a sort of referee .
No touching the role - players , the coyote warned .
It got worse when a villager refused a Marine ’s order to move out of a doorway guarded by Motamedi .
The Marine pointed his automatic rifle -- loaded with blanks -- between the villager ’s eyes .
The coyote cursed and slapped the rifle barrel aside .
“ That ’s the kind of . . . that gets civilians killed ! ” he screamed .
The exercise baffled some Marines .
They had trained to be decisive and aggressive , but they were dressed down when they took harsh action .
That was the point , the trainers said -- to learn to distinguish between insurgents and civilians , and to channel their aggression toward insurgents .
They should treat civilians with respect , they were told , but within limits .
“ Do n’t show compassion , ” a gunnery sergeant said .
“ Compassion gets Marines killed . ”
Two Marines were “ killed ” by insurgents and ordered to drop dead .
Four more were designated as killed or badly wounded by a fake bomb that exploded with a harmless pop and hissing gray smoke .
After the platoon had captured its target and loaded “ casualties ” for evacuation , some Marines pronounced the exercise “ fake , ” “ bogus ” and other , unprintable , adjectives .
Motamedi tried to be charitable .
“ It was weird , but I guess it was kind of realistic , ” he said .
“ There are a lot of distractions .
You have to multi-task and really focus . ”
Just like real life
Motamedi got a good taste of reality when he and his platoon mates were rushed onto a truck headed for a live - fire exercise at Ft. Irwin one afternoon .
They sat in the truck for three hours , hot and miserable .
They could only listen as helicopters fired missiles , mortars rained down and other platoons assaulted targets with live ammunition .
Just as in real combat , the delay was never explained .
The same week , Crookston ’s platoon was sent charging into an assault on a mock Afghan village at Twentynine Palms .
But except for firing a few blanks at fake insurgents high in the hills , Crookston pulled security for two uneventful hours , manning his post atop a gun truck .
Worse , instead of fighting back when the insurgents launched a counterattack , the platoon commander decided to withdraw .
Crookston and his mates had to watch Taliban fighters taunt them from a ridge line .
Later , after another exercise , coyotes showed Crookston ’s platoon the roadside bombs they had failed to notice on patrol .
“ The scary thing was how well - concealed the IEDs were , ” he said later .
“ One was hidden in some garbage .
It makes you think about what the real thing would do to us . ”
At Ft. Irwin , a civilian contractor named Jay screened a disturbing video made by insurgents .
It showed a U.S. convoy in Afghanistan from the viewpoint of a mountain hide - out , where insurgents waited to detonate a roadside bomb .
On the screen , an insurgent cries out “ Allahu akbar ! ” --
God is great .
A Humvee is engulfed by a red fireball .
The soldiers in the Humvee had turned off their Duke , a device that jams the radio signals that detonate three - quarters of IEDs in Afghanistan , Jay said .
The device interferes with music on soldiers ’ iPods .
A second insurgent - made video showed a Duke - equipped convoy passing by as an insurgent screams , “ Hit them ! ” A confederate tries , but repeatedly fails , to trigger the IED .
Jay paused for effect , then told the Marines that not a single U.S. soldier had died in Afghanistan from a radio - controlled IED while riding in a vehicle equipped with a Duke .
“ So the moral is : Keep the Duke on .
It ’ll save your life , ” Jay said .
The focus on roadside bombs , and the drills on treating wounded buddies and avoiding civilian casualties , brought the reality of Afghanistan closer .
Crookston grew more sober - minded and introspective .
He tried to convince himself that , in a way , it was better that his two friends were not going to war with him .
“ I do n’t have to worry because I know they ’re safe back at main side , ” on U.S. soil , he said .
Some Marines , Crookston said , suggested telling family members that they were n’t likely to survive Afghanistan , if only to guarantee a pleasant surprise when they returned home safely .
“ I do n’t look at it that way , ” he said .
“ Every time I go on a patrol , I want to think , ‘ Hey , you know what , I ’m coming back . ’ ”
Shipping out
Crookston set about saying his goodbyes .
He and Motamedi had drifted apart after infantry school .
They had not talked in weeks , but they exchanged text messages saying farewell .
Crookston said goodbye in person to Dellinger , who arrived at the end of a family dinner in Valencia the night before Crookston shipped out .
Crookston ’s parents , Kim and Kymmer Crookston , had strung red , white and blue crepe paper above the dinner table , which bore a centerpiece with a small American flag .
There were red , white and blue plates and a pie decorated with the Stars and Stripes .
A handmade banner read : “ Return With Honor . ”
On the table was a photo of Crookston in uniform , looking resolute , and a small inscription : “ Our American Hero . ”
Crookston looked trim and fit .
His dark hair had been shaved to the scalp , a pre-deployment ritual for first - timers .
He had put off changing from T - shirt and jeans to desert camouflage fatigues , but now the time had come .
He pulled on the uniform .
Late that night , Kim and Kymmer drove their son to Twentynine Palms , where buses were waiting to take his company to the flight line .
They stayed up all night , waiting in the cold desert air .
At 3:30 a.m. , the Crookstons were among the few family members still there , waving and taking photographs , as the bus prepared to pull away .
Their son worked his way to a seat .
The parents reached up and pressed their hands against the glass , where their son ’s narrow face was framed by the window .
Crookston had prepared himself for this emotional goodbye , and for the fear and uncertainty ahead .
He was trusting now in his religious faith , and his family ’s support , to help him persevere .
“ We ’re going over ; we will be receiving contact , ” he said not long before he left .
“ Someone is definitely not coming back .
One way or another , there ’s going to be death .
. . .
It ’s just the way things are . ”

Eleven years after she won the Booker Prize for The God of Small Things , 14 conversations ( 2001 - 2008 ) with Roy on her social and political activism appear in a new book The Shape of the Beast .
Even before The God of Small Things hit the world of fame , this female Rushdie of India attracted lot of media attention when she criticised Shekhar Kapur ’s film Bandit Queen , based on the life of Phoolan Devi , charging Kapur with exploiting Devi and misrepresenting both her life and its meaning .
For sometime Roy was involved as film script writer as well .
She even tried her hands at acting in films .
Not many remember but Arundhati Roy played a village girl in the award - winning movie Massey Sahib .
( Click on the Image for a Video of an Interview with Arundhati Roy on The Shape of the Beast ) .
The Shape of the Beast finds Roy fulminating against the 2002 Godhra genocide , empathising with the adivasis of Dantewada in Chhattisgarh and venting against the military operations in Nagaland , Kashmir and Manipur .
Through this book Roy has revealed both a personal and social journey .
“ In India , people who are politically radical are socially conservative and those who are socially radical are politically conservative – and I ’m torn between the two .
It is about the same dilemma that I face as a writer .
The book is somewhere between the spoken and the written word and answers fundamental questions ” , says Arundhati , the architect turned writer .
In these conversations , Roy talks about the necessity of taking a stand , as also the dilemma of guarding the private space necessary for writing in a world that demands urgent , unequivocal intervention .
Five of the fourteen conversations are with David Barsamian , an American radio producer , who has also interviewed the likes of Noam Chomsky , Edward Said and Tariq Ali .
Couple of years ago , Barsamian and Roy had co-authored a similar book
The Checkbook and the Cruise Missile : Conversations with Arundhati Roy
Says Barsamian , “ She is a strong , courageous woman and has strong thoughts , as do many of the others I have interviewed .
She is also mischievous and has spoken candidly on a range of issues that have mattered to her , around her , ” said David Barsamian , founder of Alternative Radio . ”
In these writings Roy describes her participation in a Narmada Bachao Andolan as , “ absolutely fantastic . ”
She jokes that her Supreme Court charge for “ corrupting public morality ” - in the case of her novel The God of Small Things - should have been changed to “ further corrupting public morality . ”
She calls on her training as an architect to explain what she means by the “ physics of power . ”
Like a house of cards , she argues that “ unfettered power . . . cannot go berserk like this and expect to hold it all together . ”
Roy is a spokesperson of the anti-globalization / alter - globalization movement and a vehement critic of neo-imperialism and of the global policies of the United States .
She is very critical of India ’s nuclear weapons policies and the approach to industrialization and rapid development as currently being practiced in India .
Arundhati Roy who is also vying with Salman Rushdie for The Best of Booker , is popular for her searching and fierce prose .
People do await another work of fiction from this celebrated author .
Since The God of Small Things ( which is now published in 32 languages ) , she has published two volumes of her non-fiction writing , The Algebra of Infinite Justice ( 2001 ) and An Ordinary Person ’s Guide to Empire ( 2005 ) .

Growing relief that the global economy has so far escaped the worst case scenario from the eight - month - old credit crisis has stabilised financial markets .
World stocks , as measured by MSCI , are hitting three - month highs and pulling the dollar off its March record low .DXY against major peers .
Many central banks , faced with the twin problem of the credit crisis and rising prices , have cut interest rates to ease the flow of credit , leaving inflation issues for tomorrow .
However , the relentless surge in resource prices from oil to rice and the resilience of emerging economies risks are turning inflation into the bigger worry for policymakers and asset markets .
Japanese inflation , which hit a decade - high in March triggering one of the biggest ever sell - offs in yen bonds on Friday , is a case in point .
“ If the global economy has struggled out of the frying pan of the credit crunch , it seems destined to fall into the fire of high inflation ...
High inflation is cruel to the owner of financial assets , ” said Tim Bond , head of global asset allocation at Barclays Capital .
“ Equity markets will rally for a limited period of time on belief that weakness in earnings will be short - lived .
Moving into next year , you will see markets come off on the inflation story .
Investors who see some of the rise in earnings being driven by inflation generally take the view that ’s not sustainable . ”
EQUITIES , BONDS UNDER PRESSURE
Bond says during the last inflation crisis of 1970 - 1980 , only a handful of asset classes gave positive real returns , including banks , basic resources , energy and industrial goods equity sectors , physical oil and physical commodities .
During that decade , the S&P 500 index ’s price earnings ratio fell as low as 7 from a high of around 18 .
Although the picture is distorted this time by the weakness of financial firms , Bond estimates the P/E ratio could fall to around 13 if U.S. inflation expectations fire up .
According to I /B/E/S data , the 12 - month forward P/E ratio for the S&P 500 index stands at just below 15 , compared with around 16 before August .
Bond says default rates would have difficulty improving because inflation could raise nominal interest rates .
Inflation index - linked bonds offer some protection but will share the rise in real yields , bringing negative or low returns on medium - to long - term linkers .
APPLYING BRAKES
The Reuters - Jefferies CRB Index .CRB of 19 commodity markets hit an all - time high this week , up 50 percent since early 2007 , driven largely by strong demand from emerging economies .
“ The credit crisis is a Wall Street or City problem but commodity prices are the problem in the high street .
It will invariably affect both consumer and corporate spending , ” said Jeffrey Solomon , managing member of U.S. - based investment firm Ramius Capital .
Rising energy and food costs are already weighing on consumer and business morale , especially in the euro zone where shoppers have started to scale back spending .
Euro zone inflation hit a record high of 3.6 percent in March while Bank of England officials have warned on inflation , which could exceed 3 percent later this year -- both well above the central banks ’ target levels .
The Fed ’s preferred measure of inflation , stripping out food and energy , is running at 2.5 percent .
“ Measures of prices are screaming for attention ...
It is apparent that ( U.S. and euro zone ) central banks have begun fretting about inflation , ” State Street said in a note .
“ The job of central bankers is to know when to apply the brakes ...
Ideally the economy should come to a smooth halt rather than smashing into traffic or careening off the road . ”
Of sectors which typically outperform when inflation expectations rise , State Street says institutional investors are already buying the consumer discretionary sector and flows momentum is improving for industrials , materials and IT .
Flows into consumer staples , utilities and health care -- sectors which typically underperform in times of higher inflation expectations -- have become more negative .
BitBlaze : Binary Analysis for Computer Security
Binary analysis is imperative for protecting COTS ( common off - the - shelf ) programs and analyzing and defending against the myriad of malicious code , where source code is unavailable , and the binary may even be obfuscated .
Also , binary analysis provides the ground truth about program behavior since computers execute binaries ( executables ) , not source code .
However , binary analysis is challenging due to the lack of higher - level semantics .
Many higher level techniques are often inadequate for analyzing even benign binaries , let alone potentially malicious binaries .
Thus , we need to develop tools and techniques which work at the binary level , can be used for analyzing COTS software , as well as malicious binaries .
The BitBlaze project aims to design and develop a powerful binary analysis platform and employ the platform in order to ( 1 ) analyze and develop novel COTS protection and diagnostic mechanisms and ( 2 ) analyze , understand , and develop defenses against malicious code .
The BitBlaze project also strives to open new application areas of binary analysis , which provides sound and effective solutions to applications beyond software security and malicious code defense , such as protocol reverse engineering and fingerprint generation .
The BitBlaze Binary Analysis Platform
The underlying BitBlaze Binary Analysis Platform features a novel fusion of static and dynamic analysis techniques , dynamic symbolic execution , and whole - system emulation and binary instrumentation .
The BitBlaze platform has different components for each task : Vine , TEMU , and Rudder .
The three components in tandem provide the power for effective analysis of real - world binary programs for various applications .
Vine , the static analysis component .
Open source release available now .
Vine provides an an intermediate language for assembly ( ILA ) , and an infrastructure for analyzing programs written in this language .
ILA is a full language in which programs can be written , type - checked , then compiled down to assembly .
We also provide analysis on the ILA , such as abstract interpretation , dependency analysis , and logical analysis via interfaces with theorem provers .

TEMU , the dynamic analysis component .
Open source release available now .
TEMU provides a dynamic analysis environment through whole - system emulation and dynamic binary instrumentation .
TEMU is OS - aware ( i.e. , it understands OS - level semantics ) and enables various fine - grained dynamic analysis to build upon , such as dynamic taint analysis and fine - grained behavioral analysis .

Rudder , the component for online dynamic symbolic execution .
Rudder is an engine for online dynamic execution on binaries .
At a high level , with a specified set of input sources of interest , Rudder can automatically explore different execution paths in a program determined by the input sources .
It will automatically build logical formulas representing the constraints on the chosen input to take the followed paths .
Release Information :
We are now making some key parts of the BitBlaze Binary Analysis Platform available under open - source licenses .
See a separate page for more information .
In conjunction with our BlackHat 2010 presentation , we have also made a demonstration binary release of some tools for trace - based crash analysis .
BitBlaze in Action : Security Applications
In particular , we show below three classes of security applications : ( 1 ) vulnerability detection , diagnosis , and defense ; ( 2 ) automatic in - depth malware analysis and defense ; ( 3 ) automatic model extraction and analysis .
Vulnerability Detection , Diagnosis , and Defense Hybrid Information - and Control - Flow Graph ( HI - CFG )
Many security analysis tasks require understanding the high - level structure of a binary program in terms of both its control - flow and the data it operates on .
To facilitate the automatic reverse engineering of such structure , we have introduced a new program representation , a hybrid information - and control - flow graph ( HI - CFG ) .
Our research explores algorithms to infer a HI - CFG from an instruction - level trace , without requiring source - level information or static analysis .
Identifying Causal Execution Differences for Security Applications
A security analyst often needs to understand two runs of the same program that exhibit a difference in program state or output .
This is important , for example , for vulnerability analysis , as well as for analyzing a malware program that features different behaviors when run in different environments .
Differential Slicing is an automatic slicing technique for the analysis of such execution differences .
The causal difference graph it outputs captures the input differences that triggered the observed difference and the causal path of differences that led from those input differences to the observed difference .
Automatic Defense System against Zero-day Exploits and Worms
Worms such as CodeRed and SQL Slammer can compromise millions of hosts within hours or even minutes and have caused billions of dollars in estimated damage .
How can we design and develop effective defense mechanisms against such fast , large scale worm attacks ?
Sting is an automatic worm defense system which proposes a suite of novel techniques to automatically detect new exploits , perform in - depth diagnosis , and generate effective anti-bodies ( vulnerability signatures and hardened binaries ) to protect vulnerable hosts and networks from further attacks .
Automatic Patch - based Exploit Generation
Security patches are supposed to fix vulnerabilities in programs .
But what are the security implications of a security patch ?
In this work , we propose new techniques and demonstrate that one could automatically generate exploits from the patch binary and the original vulnerable program binary and sometimes in minutes of time .
Loop - extended Symbolic Execution : Buffer Overflow Diagnosis and Discovery
Loop - extended symbolic execution ( or LESE ) is a new technique that generalizes the results of previous dynamic symbolic execution techniques , which broadens the results with effects of loops .
LESE is a key enabler for powerful automated discovery of security vulnerabilities , especially buffer - overflows , which is highly inefficient with pure symbolic / concrete execution .
It also enables deeper diagnosis of known vulnerabilities , which allows automated signature generation tools to reason about variable - length input or repeated elements in the input .
Measuring Quantitative Influence
Dynamic taint analysis is a fundamental tool for detecting overwrite attacks , but it is limited to an all - or - nothing distinction as to whether values are under the control of an attacker , and suffers from both false - positive and false - negative errors .
We propose quantitative influence to more precisely characterize the degree of control an attacker has over a value .
A specialization of the concept of channel capacity from information theory , we show that quantitative influence can be computed precisely using a decision procedure .
Quantitative influence accurately distinguishes real attacks from false positives among warnings generated by a dynamic taint analysis tool on vulnerable binary servers .
Statically - Directed Dynamic Automated Test Generation
Static analysis , dynamic analysis , and symbolic execution have complementary strengths for exploring the space of program executions , but on its own each has significant limitations .
How can we combine them to leverage the best features of all three ?
Our work on statically - directed dynamic automated test generation explores a three - stage process .
It first performs dynamic analysis to build a control - flow model , then performs static analysis to search for potential vulnerabilities , and finally uses dynamic symbolic execution to prove that warnings are true positives by finding concrete test cases for them .
In an evaluation on a suite of buffer - overflow benchmarks extracted from real applications , the results of the first two phases allowed symbolic execution to trigger vulnerabilities it otherwise could not , including all but one of the benchmarks .
Automatic Malware Analysis and Defense Detection and Analysis of Privacy - Breaching Malware
A myriad of malware such as keyloggers , Browser - helper Objects ( BHO ) based spyware , rootkits , backdoors , accesses and leaks users ' sensitive information and breaches users ' privacy .
Can we have a unified approach to identify such privacy - breaching malware despite their widely - varied appearance ?
Panorama proposes a unified approach to detect privacy - breaching malware using whole - system dynamic taint analysis .
Hidden Code Extraction from Packed Executables
Code packing is one technique commonly used to hinder malware code analysis through reverse engineering .
Even though this problem has been previously researched , the existing solutions are either unable to handle novel samples , or vulnerable to various evasion techniques .
Renovo proposes a fully dynamic approach for hidden code extraction , capturing an intrinsic nature of hidden code execution .
Detection and Analysis of Malware Hooking Behaviors
One important malware attacking vector is its hooking mechanism .
Malicious programs implant hooks for many different purposes .
Spyware may implant hooks to get notified of the arrival of new sensitive data .
Rootkits may implant hooks to intercept and tamper with critical system information to conceal their presence in the system .
A stealth backdoor may also place hooks on the network stack to establish a stealthy communication channel with remote attackers .
HookFinder proposes fine - grained impact analysis to automatically detect and analyze malware 's hooking behaviors .
Since this technique captures the intrinsic nature of hooking behaviors , it is well suited for identifying new hooking mechanisms .
Automatic Malware Dissection and Trigger - based Behavior Analysis
Malware often has embedded behavior which is only exhibited when certain conditions are met .
Such trigger - based behavior includes time bombs , logic bombs , and botnets programs which reacts to commands .
Static analysis of malware often provides little utility due to code packing and obfuscation .
Vanilla dynamic analysis can only provides limited view since the trigger conditions are usually not met .
How can we design automatic analysis methods to uncover the trigger conditions and trigger - based behavior hidden in malware ?
BitScope enables automatic exploration of program execution paths in malware to uncover trigger conditions ( such as the time used in time bombs and commands in botnet programs ) and trigger - based behavior , using dynamic symbolic execution .
BitScope also provides in - depth analysis of the input / output behavior of the malware .
Automatic Model Extraction and Analysis Extracting security - related models from browsers for analysis and vulnerability discovery
In this work , we show how to use string - enhanced white - box exploration techniques to automatically extract security - related models from browsers and to automatically discover cross -site scripting ( XSS ) vulnerabilities by comparing the extracted models with websites ' filters .
Deviation Detection in Binaries
Many network protocols and services have several different implementations .
Automatically identifying deviations in different implementations of the same protocol / service can enable the detection of potential implementation errors without protocol specification , and can enable automatic generation of fingerprints to identify an implementation remotely .
How can we automatically identify such deviations in binaries implementing the same specification ?
Deviation Detection automatically identifies deviations in different binaries to detect implementation errors and generate fingerprints .
It is achieved by building symbolic formulas that characterize how each binary processes an input .
Protocol Reverse Engineering and Application Dialogue Replay
Many network protocols are proprietary or have no well documented specification .
However , many security applications require protocol reverse engineering and application dialogue ( network trace ) replay .
Dispatcher , Polygot and Replayer automatically extract information about network protocols and enables application dialogue replay using binary analysis .
FPGate project got Microsoft BlueHat Prize Contest 's Special Recognition Award in 2012 .
FPGate stops attacks targeting function pointers by limiting indirect transfers to only those targets that are legal in the original program .
When deployed together with other existing lightweight protections , FPGate can provide a level of protection comparable to CFI ( Control Flow Integrity ) , stopping almost all control fow hijacking attacks including ROP .
FPGate has two main advantages compared with previous solutions : it can inter - operate well with existing non-hardened libraries , so it can be deployed progressively ; we also develop a method to recognize all sources and targets automatically in modern security - sensitive binary executables , thus FPGate can be applied directly on these binary files .
The performance overhead of FPGate is only 0.36 % in average measured using SPECint 2006 .
FPGate is a joint work of Lenx with Chao Zhang , Zhaofeng Chen , Lei Duan from Peking University , and Laszlo Szekeres , Stephen McCamant , Dawn Song from UC Berkeley .

Ah - Fang , an illegal Chinese migrant , works as a housekeeper in an ' Oriental ' brothel in Cheam .
She earns £ 180 a week - a step up from the £ 50 she got picking leeks .
And at least she does n't suffer the degradations of the brothel 's ' Misses ' who sell sex for 14 hours a day .

CHENZHOU , China ( Reuters ) - Emergency crews struggled on Saturday to restore power to parts of southern China blacked out for a week by heavy snow as forecasters warned of no quick end to the worst winter weather in 50 years .
Mobilising the might of the state , China has deployed more than 300,000 troops and nearly 1.1 million militia and army reservists to get traffic moving and ensure power supplies , the official Xinhua news agency reported .
The freak weather , which has killed at least 60 people in parts of the country unused to heavy snow , could last another week , the Central Meteorological Station said .
In Chenzhou , a city of 4 million in the southern province of Hunan , which has been without electricity for eight days , shopkeepers huddled under blankets while cooks warmed their hands over their woks .
At least the snow had stopped falling by late Saturday afternoon .
“ At night there is nothing you can do but just pile on extra blankets .
If you have an electric heater you ca n’t use it , ” said Hu Jun , 20 , pacing up and down to keep warm as he charged his mobile phone at an outside stall .
About 5,000 workers have been mending frozen power lines leading to Chenzhou , with some soldiers firing submachine guns to shatter ice cloaking the cables , according to Xinhua .
Premier Wen Jiabao arrived in Chenzhou by train on Saturday to oversee relief efforts .
Officials said earlier they hoped to partially restore electricity to the city by the end of the day .
“ These are small problems for us Chinese people .
We ’re not afraid of difficulties here , ” said a woman working in a convenience store , half - burned candles on the counter .
“ Things are all pretty normal , ” said the woman , who gave only her family name , Liu .
But a taxi driver struck a different note .
“ Ninety percent of people are complaining and nobody thinks the government has handled this well at all , ” the man , who would not give his name , said .

INFLATION WORRIES
There have been no reports of crowd trouble at railway stations that have been thronged with people trying to get home for the Lunar New Year holiday , the most important festival in the Chinese calendar .
New Year ’s day falls on February 7 .
But prices of food are rising sharply because of the weather chaos .
With inflation already near an 11 - year high , Wen told his cabinet on Friday that officials had to “ ensure economic and social stability ” in the face of the disaster , Xinhua reported .
“ It ’s difficult .
Prices of goods have gone up , ” said Hu , charging his phone .
The cost of a boxed lunch had doubled to 10 yuan ( 71 pence ) , while a piece of coal for the stove that normally costs a few cents had gone up to 3 yuan , he said .

“ And do you know how much candles are ?
They ’re three yuan as well ! ” he said .
The blizzards have created China ’s worst - ever power crisis after toppled power lines and icy rails crippled the rail network , holding up thousands of coal trains .
Miners are now working overtime and , as the railways creak back to life , coal shipments are being given priority , reducing crowded passenger trains to a crawl .
A train from the southern metropolis of Guangzhou bound for Beijing took 17 hours to get to Chenzhou , a journey that normally takes less than five hours .
Train L44 was packed with migrant workers , for whom the Lunar New Year is usually the only chance they get all year to see their families .
Millions of others are resigned to being stuck in the factory towns where they toil .
Many roads are also still badly clogged .
Huang
Yan , a student , said a bus trip to her village in central Anhui province that usually takes one hour ended up taking eight hours .
The government has put the immediate economic losses of the weather chaos at $ 7.5 billion ( 3.8 billion pounds ) .
It says that 223,000 houses have been toppled by snow or ice and 862,000 damaged .
As much as 6 inches of snow covered Shanghai , the financial capital , which posted a yellow snowstorm alert for the first time in 135 years .
Beijing was cold but clear .
Elizabeth B. Moynihan , the widow of Daniel Patrick Moynihan , the New York senator who , from a hayfield on his upstate farm , helped shepherd Hillary Rodham Clinton into his Senate seat , has endorsed Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination .
In an e-mail statement to the Obama campaign , Mrs. Moynihan , an architectural historian who successfully managed three of her husband ’s four Senate campaigns , said she had been inspired by an Op - Ed article by Caroline Kennedy , daughter of the slain president , in The New York Times on Sunday .
Mrs. Moynihan added that she was also dismayed at Bill and Hillary Clinton ’s recent hostility toward Mr. Obama ’s candidacy .
She wrote that her husband , who died in 2003 , “ would have become excited , as I have , to see Barack Obama rekindle hope in our young as he encourages them to participate in the political process , and I know Pat would approve , applaud and encourage me to join Caroline Kennedy in supporting Barack Obama ’s candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president . ”
“ It is a rare gift to be able to inspire people to share a vision that requires commitment and dedication , ” she wrote in the e-mail message , to David Axelrod , a senior adviser to Mr. Obama .

Tight credit conditions have made it difficult for some homeowners
President Bush
The move aims to shield homeowners most vulnerable to the impact of rising mortgage payments which it is feared could lead to a fresh wave of defaults .
This and other measures could help more than a million people , Mr Bush said .
He described the housing downturn as a " serious challenge " but insisted that the economy remained " resilient " .
US stock markets rallied on the news of the White House plan , the benchmark Dow Jones index closing up more than 1 % .
' Terrible burden '
The crisis in the sub - prime mortgage sector - where loans were offered to people on low incomes and with poor credit histories - has put the brakes on the entire housing market .
Thousands of sub - prime mortgage holders have already defaulted on their payments because of the burden of higher interest rates and have lost their homes as a result .
The steps I have outlined today are a sensible response to a serious challenge
President Bush
Foreclosure wave sweeps across America
With an estimated 1.8 million homeowners who took out loans with discount " teaser " rates facing higher payments next year , it is feared that many others could suffer a similar fate .
Announcing a package of measures , Mr Bush said the threat of foreclosure was a " terrible burden for hard - working families and communities across the country " .
Homeowners seeking assistance have three options .
They can either have their payments frozen at an introductory rate for five years , refinance their mortgage at a lower rate or refinance through the Federal Housing Administration .
The government estimates that 1.2 million homeowners facing " preventable foreclosures " would qualify for such help , although they will have to request assistance themselves .
He said efforts to make it easier for homeowners to refinance their mortgages , announced in August , were beginning to work and announced a new telephone advice hotline for people worried about their mortgage situation .
He also urged Congress to provide more money for mortgage counselling and to take decisive action to reform the tax code and the regulation of mortgage financiers .
KEY POINTS OF BUSH PLAN Vulnerable homeowners can either freeze interest payments or refinance mortgages at a lower rate New national hotline for mortgage advice Borrowers with good credit histories given extra flexibility to refinance Congress urged to increase funding for mortgage counselling Federal Reserve to announce reforms to mortgage regulations soon
Mr Bush said his plans did not signal a " bail - out " for mortgage lenders , property speculators or those " who made reckless decisions to buy a home they knew they could n't afford " .
" There is no perfect solution , " Mr Bush said of the malaise in the housing market .
" But the steps I have outlined today are a sensible response to a serious challenge . "
The administration 's plans drew a mixed response from Wall Street , with analysts saying the success of the measures would depend on how they were applied .
" Something other than lower interest rates is needed to fix the sub - prime crisis and a freeze on mortgage interest payments is a big step in the right direction , if it works , " said Cary Leahey , managing director of Decision Economics .
But leading Democrats criticised the plan as belated and insubstantial , Senator Christopher Dodd describing it as " little more than financial wallpaper " .
' Weathering the storm '
Falling house prices have severely dented consumer confidence in the US , leading the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice in recent months to underpin the economy .
Mr Bush said the underlying prospects for the US economy were positive .
" The economy is strong , flexible and dynamic enough to weather this storm , " he argued .
The US property downturn sparked the crisis in global financial markets which has seen top banks in the US , Europe and Asia lose billions of dollars on mortgage - related investments .
Several countries , including the UK and Canada , have cut interest rates in recent days in an effort to boost faltering consumer confidence .
Wall Street could lose over 36,000 jobs because the financial credit crisis has rocked markets and stunned the US economy , labour market analyst with New York state 's labour department , James Brown estimated .
" History suggests it 's going to be something of that magnitude , " Mr Brown said , noting Wall Street employment peaked at 200,300 in December 2000 , nine months before the September 11 , 2001 air attacks .
Losing one in five jobs on Wall Street could have dire consequences for the New York City 's economy .
Mr Brown 's estimate was almost double the 20,000 job losses over the next two years that the city 's Independent Budget Office forecasted in March .
At the end of last month , there were 182,300 people working at banks and brokerages , down more than 5,000 jobs since September .
The smaller scope of the layoffs seen so far , however , likely reflects the lag between the end of severance payments and when job hunters file for unemployment benefits , Mr Brown explained .
Unlike much of the nation , layoffs and falling profits on Wall Street pose a bigger risk to New York City 's economy than the housing - led downturn that threatens the nation , according to economists and Mayor Michael Bloomberg .
Bankers , brokers and traders earned an average salary and bonus of $ 340,312 a year in 2006 , Mr Brown said .
Wall Street 's total compensation amounts to almost 35 per cent of all salaries and wages earned in the city , according to city officials .
The taxes that Wall Street 's denizens and their employers pay mean the city 's finances mirror this sector 's roller - coaster cycles .

Ron Paul : Iraq is not Nazi Germany Nick Langewis and David Edwards

Print This Email This " Congressman Paul , I 've heard him now in many debates talking about bringing our troops home , and about the war in Iraq , and how it 's failed .
And I want to tell you that that kind of isolationism , sir , is what caused World War II ... You allow Hitler to come to power with that kind of attitude of isolationism ... "
-- Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) , to Congressman Ron Paul ( R - TX ) at the CNN / YouTube GOP debate " Iraq is not Nazi Germany , " says Congressman Ron Paul to CNN 's Wolf Blitzer , " and besides , I thought it was Hitler that caused World War II , not the American people , who opposed going in . "
Senator and fellow presidential candidate John McCain confuses " isolationism " and " non-intervention , " says Paul .
" I advocate non-intervention :
Not getting involved in the internal affairs of other nations , and not pretending a country like Iraq is equivalent to Nazi Germany . "
Continues the Congressman , " Iraq had no Army , no Navy , and no weapons of mass destruction ; had nothing to do with 9/11 ... so the comparison makes no sense . "
" Under what circumstances , if you were President , " asks Blitzer of the Congressman , " would you intervene outside the borders of the United States in some crisis around the world ? "
" When Congress directed me to in an act of war , " responds Paul , saying that he would act when Congress followed proper procedure and determined that there was a national security threat .
Congressman Paul also responds to a clip of McCain , who professes to know the thoughts of the troops in Iraq about the effects of the recent troop " surge , " and progress being made in Iraq as a result .
The troops , says McCain , do n't agree with Paul 's assessment .
" I do n't believe we went to the war for the right reason , " says Paul .
He reiterates the absence of " weapons of mass destruction , " along with the lack of a connection between Iraq and the World Trade Center attacks in 2001 .
" We plan to keep fourteen bases over there , a huge naval base , and we have this huge embassy -- we have a permanent plan to stay there and take over these $ 30 trillion worth of oil in that region , and the people in those countries know that .
And that 's why they 're very angry .
And to deny that is folly .
It just means that we have expanded the opportunity for the terrorists to come here because there are greater motivations . "
Congressman Paul cites , when questioned about whether he would have the support of Republican voters , an Iowa poll that showed 50 % of Republicans being opposed to the war in Iraq .
Also , Paul says , he has the support of independents in New Hampshire -- McCain 's old voter base .
" Since 70 % of the American people want out of the war and are tired of it , Republicans better pick somebody who 's opposed to war , or have a new foreign policy , or they can't win . "
" We can't even fight the war without borrowing the money from the Chinese , " adds the Congressman .
" It really does n't matter whether I 'm right or wrong ; the war 's going to end because we 're going to have such a political and financial havoc here , with the devaluation of our dollar , because we just can't keep affording -- this is usually how empires end ... "

DETROIT , Aug. 1 — The Toyota Motor Company passed the Ford Motor Company in July for the first time to rank as the second - biggest carmaker in the United States , behind General Motors , auto sales reports out today showed .
All of the major Detroit companies reported double - digit sales declines in July compared with 2005 , when auto sales reached record levels because of the popularity of employee discount programs .
Toyota ’s milestone was evidence that American buyers are again flocking to Japanese companies in the wake of high gasoline prices .
Each of the Detroit companies ’ lineups remain dominated by trucks and sport utility vehicles , while the major Japanese companies each sell a greater percentage of cars than light trucks in the United States .
Toyota ’s win over Ford came only three months after Toyota passed DaimlerChrysler , including both Chrysler and Mercedes - Benz , to rank as the third - biggest company in terms of American sales .
