Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2008 February 7
Explanation : Nearly 50 million light - years away in the constellation Ursa Major , NGC 4013 was long considered an isolated island universe .
Seen edge - on , the gorgeous spiral galaxy was known for its flattened disk and central bulge of stars , cut by silhouetted dust lanes .
But this deep color image of the region reveals a previously unknown feature associated with NGC 4013 , an enormous , faint looping structure extending ( above and toward the left ) over 80 thousand light - years from the galaxy 's center .
A detailed exploration of the remarkable structure reveals it to be a stream of stars originally belonging to another galaxy , likely a smaller galaxy torn apart by gravitational tides as it merged with the larger spiral .
Astronomers argue that the newly discovered tidal stream also explains a warped distribution of neutral hydrogen gas seen in radio images of NGC 4013 and offers parallels to the formation of our own Milky Way galaxy .
Governments of the Group of Eight ( G8 ) countries need to take urgent action on the emerging global crisis in water and sanitation , say business leaders from some of the world ’s largest companies who have endorsed the United Nations Global Compact .
In a letter released today by the UN Global Compact Office , the chief executive officers of 19 corporations call on G8 leaders to actively address the issue of water during their upcoming summit in Japan in July .
The business leaders are all endorsers of the UN Global Compact ’s CEO Water Mandate , which was launched by Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon last year .
“ It is increasingly clear that lack of access to clean water and sanitation in many parts of the world causes great suffering in humanitarian , social , environmental and economic terms , and seriously undermines development goals , ” the letter states .
It is estimated that approximately one billion people lack access to safe drinking water , and 2.6 billion do not have access to adequate sanitation .
The letter cites a recent UN Development Report , which argues that the costs to sub-Saharan African economies of not having basic universal access to water and sanitation represent about five per cent of gross domestic product .
“ Water is not just an environmental issue – it is a poverty and development issue , an economic issue , and therefore a business issue , ” the chief executives state .
The letter notes that in 2000 , world leaders committed to the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) , including a concrete target to “ halve , by 2015 , the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation . ”
“ We are pleased that business leaders have taken the initiative and are urging governments to take seriously this emerging crisis , ” said Georg Kell , Executive Director of the UN Global Compact .
The Global Compact pledges participating businesses – now numbering some 3,600 in over 100 countries – to observe principles regarding human rights , labour rights , environmental sustainability and the fight against corruption .

Advertisement Scientists have deciphered the genetic blueprint of the duck - billed platypus , one of the oddest creatures on Earth .
The animal comes from an early branch of the mammal family , and like mammals it is covered in fur and produces milk .
However , it lays eggs like a reptile .
Researchers say this unique mixture of features is reflected in its DNA .
The genome sequence , which is published in the journal Nature , holds clues to how humans and other mammals first evolved , they add .
The platypus ( Ornithorhynchus anatinus ) is the latest in a string of mammals , including the mouse , rat , sheep , horse and dog , to have its genome decoded .
But it is the only member of the monotremes ( egg laying mammals ) for which we have a genetic blueprint .
Dr Chris Ponting , of the MRC Functional Genetics Unit at the University of Oxford , UK , is one of more than 100 researchers from the US , UK and Australia , who took part in the study .
He said the platypus was chosen because of its unusual features .
Platypus Genome
About two - thirds the size of the human genome Contains about 18,500 genes Has 52 chromosomes , including 10 sex chromosomes
The platypus is so strange that it was considered a hoax when sent from Australia to European researchers in the 19th Century .
" It has a very weird appearance because it 's a mishmash of the bill of a duck , the eyes of a mole , the eggs of a lizard and the tail of a beaver , " Dr Ponting told BBC News .
" It was one of several ( mammals ) we could have chosen , but it was certainly the one that everyone seemed to wish to sequence because of its unusual features . "
Dr Ponting said the genome sequence enabled scientists to look back in time to see what an early mammal would have been like .
He said : " It 's wonderful to see all of the different mishmash of features that the platypus exhibits ; to see those features reflected in the DNA , in the genes of this creature , which has held mysteries for the scientists and the general population ever since it was discovered 200 years ago . "
The DNA came from a female , nicknamed Glennie , which was captured in the wild in New South Wales , Australia .
The sequence was then compared with stretches of DNA from about 100 platypuses living in the wild .

Dr Mark Batzer , from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge , who also worked on the study , said the data would help in conservation efforts by allowing scientists to investigate population size , structure and breeding habits .
" In the case of the platypus , clearly we learned a lot about a unique organism that has relevance in terms of its endangered status and conservation biology , " he said .
" One big surprise was the patchwork nature of the genome with avian , reptilian and mammalian features , " he added .
The platypus and the small spiny mammal known as the echidna are the only existing species of monotremes in the world .
All other mammals give birth to live young .
The platypus is widespread in the eastern states of Australia , living in and around streams and rivers .
They have acute sight , but only open their eyes above water .
Underwater , they rely on touch and a special sense called electro - reception that allows them to detect tiny changes in the electrical field generated by their prey .

What are these ?
Rep. Peter DeFazio ( D - OR04 ) railed against the Republican special interests that prevent any real progress from being made on getting control over skyrocketing fuel prices and huge profits being realized by oil companies while consumers struggle with high fuel costs .
Now , there ’s a few things we could do .
Now , the president ’s a big free trader , right ?
He ’s trying to push us into more free trade agreements .
They say they work great .
He wants “ rules - based trade . ”
Well , we ’re in the WTO , they have rules .
The rules say you can not restrict the supply of a commodity simply to drive up the price .
That ’s what OPEC ’s doing .
Now five members of OPEC are in the WTO .
Will this president – the oil man –- the friend of the Saudis and the others – will he file a complaint in the World Trade Organization against OPEC ?
No .
I wrote to him three years ago , asking him to do that .
The answer was no .
If the Saudis and the OPEC countries want to get together and collude to drive up the price of the oil , that ’s just fine with George Bush .
He ’s all for free trade , and rules - based trade , except when the rules might hurt some of his buddies .
And then , the oil industry just piggy backs on top of that .
The Gavel :
The price for regular gasoline reached a record $ 3.53 per gallon today – 23 percent more than this time last year and 140 percent more than when President Bush took office .
The Democratic - led Congress has passed a number of key bills to reduce the burden of rising gas prices on Americans and make America less dependent on foreign oil – but the President has threatened to veto each one .
House Democrats call on President Bush to support House - passed legislation such as the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels ( NOPEC ) Act , The Energy Price Gouging Act , and the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act and bring real relief to America ’s families and businesses now .
Full transcript below the fold :
I believe it ’s April Fool ’s Day here on the floor of the House .
To hear the members of the GOP – the Grand Old Oil Party – talking about how they ’re there for the consumers , they want to do something to help American consumers .
The same party that benefits disproportionately from massive campaign contributions from the oil and gas and coal industries .
The same party that holds the White House , with two oil men in the White House .
The same party , on the Senate side , defeated our energy provisions because they would have God forbid , made the oil and gas companies pay taxes like other members of the corporate committee .
It would have taken away subsidies .
They ’re crying crocodile tears about the massive profits that their buddies are making , their campaign contributors , their sponsors .
And the president , the oil man .
And the vice president , the oil man supply services company .
Q : Will the gentleman yield ?
No , I wo n’t yield .
Thank you very much .
Now , there ’s a few things we could do .
Now , the president ’s a big free trader , right ?
He ’s trying to push us into more free trade agreements .
They say they work great .
He wants “ rules - based trade . ”
Well , we ’re in the WTO , they have rules .
The rules say you can not restrict the supply of a commodity simply to drive up the price .
That ’s what OPEC ’s doing .
Now five members of OPEC are in the WTO .
Will this president – the oil man –- the friend of the Saudis and the others – will he file a complaint in the World Trade Organization against OPEC ?
No .
I wrote to him three years ago , asking him to do that .
The answer was no .
If the Saudis and the OPEC countries want to get together and collude to drive up the price of the oil , that ’s just fine with George Bush .
He ’s all for free trade , and rules - based trade , except when the rules might hurt some of his buddies .
And then , the oil industry just piggy backs on top of that .
Now , there is another thing they could do .
They can help us with a provision we put in the Farm bill , which is stalled in the Senate , which would close the Enron loophole .
Remember Enron ?
Ken Boy , the President 's favorite guy ?
He just died before he went to jail .
Well , the Enron boys convinced the Republican Congress to give them a special loophole , to deregulate energy commodities , to allow for massive speculation .
And there is widespread agreement in the financial community that about 50 cents of the price that 's being paid at the pump today is being paid purely because of speculation brought about by the Enron loophole .
You really want to do something about the high price of oil ?
Help us close the Enron loophole .
Get your president to file a complaint against OPEC for colluding to drive up the price of oil .
Help strip out the taxpayers ' subsidies to the oil , coal and gas industry .
You are taking out of their wallets while you are taking it out of their pockets at the pump .

He proved he would eat anything when he chewed on opponent Evander Holyfield 's ear in the ring 11 years ago .
But it appears boxer Mike Tyson , once known as the " Baddest Man on the Planet " because of his formidable fighting skills , has been enjoying rather finer foods of late .
He is now far from the lean , mean fighting machine that made him famous the world over .
In fact , he was almost unrecognisable as he left the appropriately named Mr Chow 's restaurant in Beverly Hills last night thanks to his new , cuddlier physique .

Heavyweight : Mike Tyson 's body is no longer the temple it once was
The father - of - six still holds the title of the youngest world heavyweight champion , but it seems this accolade is almost all that is left of his previous life .
About the only recognisable part of Tyson today is the famous tattoo on his face .
In a loose blue shirt and grey trousers , he still cuts a formidable figure but it is now due to his size rather than his muscle power .
His weight has reportedly ballooned to a monster 20st and it had been thought he was on a punishing detox regime .

Tyson is almost unrecognisable now compared to when he was in his prime
There has been growing speculation the 41 - year - old might be preparing to return to the ring once again for another bout with Holyfield .
It would be their first fight in more than a decade and Tyson has already sounded out his opponent .
However , if these pictures are anything to go by , any potential comeback appears a long way off .
It has also been said he may instead by contemplating a second career as a cage - fighter after refereeing the world cage - fighting championships in Britain two years ago .
Tyson has already made one ill - fated return to boxing after he was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2003 after blowing an estimated £ 200 million fortune .
A Hollywood biopic of his life , with Jamie Foxx taking on the star part , has already been approved .
Dubbed Iron Mike , the boxer beat 12 of his first 19 victims before the end of the first round - a record that helped him become the most feared fighter on earth .
But he is as equally well - known for his behaviour beyond the ring and his career never quite recovered after he was jailed for rape for three years in 1992 .
He managed to regain part of the heavyweight title before losing it to Holyfield in 1996 .
Their re-match a year later ended in disqualification for Tyson after he chewed off a section of his opponent 's ear .
He eventually retired from competitive boxing in 2005 after consecutive losses to journeymen .
Wii consoles , on average , sit on the shelves for just an hour before they are purchased .
That stat comes straight from Reggie Fils - Aime ( pictured ) , Nintendo of America 's president , who visited the Wired.com offices Wednesday to discuss the company 's strategy .
The conversation was dominated by discussion of the fact that Wii is still sold out in North America , 17 months after its launch .
" We are passionately upset about the lack of product relative to demand , " said Fils - Aime , who hit the points that Nintendo has been reiterating all along about its runaway hit game machine :
The production numbers are determined by Nintendo's Japanese parent , and Nintendo of America does its best to remind Japan of the " missed opportunities " when it does n't have enough product to go around .
Fils - Aime noted that North America gets about 40 percent of the 1.8 million Wii consoles Nintendo manufactures every month .
The Americas are the only territory in which supply and demand are out of whack for Wii : Fils - Aime said you can walk into stores in Japan and Europe and find Wii on shelves .

How much of the traffic on the internet is peer - to - peer file trading ?
Everyone seems to agree it represents a lot of the traffic , but the truth is no one knows ( with the possible exception of the ISPs and backbone providers in the middle , and they are n't telling or sharing raw data ) .
One of the most recent reports on P2P traffic came from a traffic optimization firm called Ellacoya in June 2007 .
Their report said that http - based web traffic had overtaken peer - to - peer traffic on the net , thanks to streaming media sites like YouTube .
Ellacoya , since acquired by Arbor Networks for its traffic - shaping technology , pegged http traffic at 46 percent of the net 's volume , with P2P traffic close by at 37 percent .
The company says the data was based on about 1 million North American broadband subscribers .
But little is known about when , how and where the company collected the data , or how it analyzed the packets .
Independent internet researchers , including KC Claffy of the Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis , ran their own tests in 2003 and 2004 – following conflicting reports that file sharing was decreasing and increasing .
Using data from an internet backbone link in San Jose , California , the researchers found that P2P traffic was steady , if not increasing .
For instance , BitTorrent grew some 100 percent in popularity from 2003 to 2004 , but the researchers found that it was getting harder to track P2P bits , since P2P traffic was increasingly using encryption and random ports , making it harder to quickly identify the application that a packet was coming from .
The last time Sprint published an analysis of 30 large internet links ( January 10 , 2005 ) , it found that file sharing accounted for less than 6 percent of the packets in the tube , with regular web traffic clocking in at more than 50 percent of the flow .
Speaking at Supernova conference last July , Claffy expressed confusion at how the government can have a public policy debate about network management when no one except the network operators knows anything about traffic on the net .
NBC filed something with the FCC using the Cache Logic study , done a year after the Pew Internet study , saying that file sharing was dropping and our study showing file sharing was increasing .
And the Cache Logic study just came out with a number – no trends , just that file sharing was 30 to 50 percent of traffic , and NBC uses that number - – way old , no peer review , no methodology – to say ' You guys , the FCC , have to start policing the network and getting this file sharing off the network . '
All of the data out there is suspect .
The information is vital .
Comcast claims that torrents of purloined pop music and movies are filling the internet 's tubes – requiring them to block , divert and dam peer - to - peer traffic .
And AT&T says it 's going to create technology to detect such sharing by its customers .
Traditional web traffic , here in dark blue , appears to eat 10 times more bandwidth than file sharing ( lighter blue ) in this study from Sprint in 2005 .
* Image : Sprint * In Washington , D.C. , Congress is once again considering legislating rules for ISPs , while the five - member Federal Trade Commission is publicly wringing its hands over whether to fine or censure Comcast for its BitTorrent blocking and whether to adopt stricter net - neutrality guidelines generally .
For the next couple of weeks , Threat Level is taking a hard look at some of the unsolved mysteries of the internet .
This is the first one .
We would love to know if good measurements of P2P traffic are out there or if , indeed , the debate over net neutrality is taking place without the slightest bit of verifiable data .
UPDATE : Ipoque , a P2P traffic management firm , released its own study of internet traffic in 2007 , focusing on Germany , Australia , Eastern Europe and Southern Europe .
According to their report , P2P traffic accounted for between 49 % and 83 % of internet traffic in these regions .
Using deep packet inspection techniques , the company says it could identify the types of files being traded , as well as unique hashes that pinpointed unique files .
For instance in the Middle East , the most popular BitTorrent Audio download was Beyonce 's Listen , according to Ipoque .
( Does that mean American foreign policy is winning or losing ? )
The study is unlikely to please internet scientists , since the data set is not public nor is there much discussion of how the numbers were arrived at .

At the University of Michigan Health System , one of the first to experiment with full disclosure , existing claims and lawsuits dropped to 83 in August 2007 from 262 in August 2001 , said Richard C. Boothman , the medical center ’s chief risk officer .
“ Improving patient safety and patient communication is more likely to cure the malpractice crisis than defensiveness and denial , ” Mr. Boothman said .
Mr. Boothman emphasized that he could not know whether the decline was due to disclosure or safer medicine , or both .
But the hospital ’s legal defense costs and the money it must set aside to pay claims have each been cut by two - thirds , he said .
The time taken to dispose of cases has been halved .
The number of malpractice filings against the University of Illinois has dropped by half since it started its program just over two years ago , said Dr. Timothy B. McDonald , the hospital ’s chief safety and risk officer .
In the 37 cases where the hospital acknowledged a preventable error and apologized , only one patient has filed suit .
Only six settlements have exceeded the hospital ’s medical and related expenses .
In Dr. Das Gupta ’s case in 2006 , the patient retained a lawyer but decided not to sue , and , after a brief negotiation , accepted $ 74,000 from the hospital , said her lawyer , David J. Pritchard .
“ She told me that the doctor was completely candid , completely honest , and so frank that she and her husband  usually the husband wants to pound the guy  that all the anger was gone , ” Mr. Pritchard said .
“ His apology helped get the case settled for a lower amount of money . ”
The patient , a young nurse , declined to be interviewed .
Mr. Pritchard said his client netted about $ 40,000 after paying medical bills and legal expenses .
He said she had the rib removed at another hospital and learned it was not cancerous .
“ You have no idea what a relief that was , ” Dr. Das Gupta said .
Invoking a criminal statute more commonly used to go after computer hackers or crooked government employees , federal prosecutors in Los Angeles on Thursday charged a Missouri mother with fraudulently creating a MySpace account and using it to “ cyber - bully ” a 13 - year - old girl who later committed suicide .
The girl , Megan Meier , hanged herself in her upstairs bedroom two years ago , shortly after being jilted by an Internet suitor she thought was a 16 - year - old boy .
The case caused a national furor when it was alleged that the “ boy ” was actually Lori Drew , the mother of one of Megan ’s former friends .
Drew , 49 , of Dardenne Prairie , Mo. , was indicted by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles .
She is accused of providing bogus information to Beverly Hills - based MySpace when she created an account in the name of the imaginary boy , Josh Evans .
Drew then used the account to obtain information about Megan in violation of MySpace rules , which she used “ to inflict emotional distress ” on the girl , prosecutors allege .
Speaking at a noon news conference , U.S. Atty .
Thomas P. O’Brien said he believed it was the first case of its kind in the nation .

He said Drew , posing as “ Josh , ” began flirting with Megan , telling her via e-mail that she was “ sexy . ”
The flirting went on for weeks and their correspondence took on an increasingly sexual tone before Josh abruptly cut off the relationship .
O’Brien said Josh told the girl “ the world would be a better place without her . ”
“ This adult woman allegedly used the Internet to target a teenage girl with horrendous ramifications , ” O’Brien said .
“ This was a tragedy that did not have to happen . ”
Sal Hernandez , who heads the FBI office in Los Angeles , accused Drew of “ hiding behind cyber walls in cyberspace ” in allegedly perpetrating the hoax .
Drew ’s attorney , H. Dean Steward , denied that his client either created the MySpace account or directed anyone else to do so .
Advertisement
“ There are a lot of issues we ’re going to need to raise , including why this case is happening in Los Angeles , ” Steward said .
“ This seems like a Missouri case no matter how you cut it .
There is a lack of connection with California .
All of the witnesses are from Missouri , with one or two exceptions being from MySpace , ” he said .
Drew , who faces up to 20 years in federal prison if convicted , is expected to be arraigned in Los Angeles next month .
News of the indictment left Megan ’s parents , Christina and Ron Meier , in tears .
The pair said they had all but given up hope that any criminal charges would be filed in their daughter ’s death .
Advertisement
“ I just want some justice after all this time , ” said Ron Meier .
“ For the first time in as long as I can remember , I actually have hope , ” he said .
Local and federal authorities in Missouri initially looked into the circumstances surrounding Megan ’s October 2006 death in Dardenne Prairie , an upper - middle - class enclave of about 7,400 people 35 miles northwest of St. Louis , but declined to file charges , saying they were unable to find a statute under which to pursue a criminal case .
O’Brien said attorneys in his office were aware of the case , saw a Los Angeles nexus because MySpace Inc. is a local company and began their own investigation with the assistance of prosecutors in Missouri and FBI agents in Los Angeles and Missouri .
Advertisement
Before the grand jury was convened , the Meiers said , officials from the U.S. attorney ’s office in California traveled to Missouri to talk to them and other potential witnesses about the details of the MySpace communications .
Among those questioned by the grand jury , according to sources , was 19 - year - old Ashley Grills , a former temporary employee in Drew ’s advertising coupon business .
Grills could not be reached for comment Thursday .
But earlier this year , she told ABC News ’ “ Good Morning America ” that she , Drew and Drew ’s teenage daughter had taken turns typing out messages to Megan Meier .
During the interview , Grills said that Lori Drew tapped out messages “ when we did n’t know what to say . ”
Advertisement
She said Drew told her to keep mum after Meier ’s suicide .
Specifically , Drew is charged with one count of conspiracy and three counts of accessing protected computers without authorization to obtain information .
The indictment alleges that she provided false information when she registered for the MySpace account and violated various aspects of the company ’s terms of service , including prohibitions on soliciting information from anyone under 18 and using information obtained from MySpace to “ harass , abuse or harm ” other people .
MySpace did not respond to an e-mail request for comment .
Advertisement
The federal statute under which Drew is charged is more often used to prosecute defendants who have hacked into computers with the intent of causing damage or improperly accessed computers for financial gain , legal experts said .
Rebecca Lonergan , a law professor at USC and former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles , said applying the statute in this case is a stretch .
After reading the indictment , she said there was some ambiguity as to whether MySpace or Megan was the victim .
The case hinges , she said , on getting the circumstances surrounding Megan ’s tragic death before a jury if the prosecution “ has any hope of winning . ”
“ This is an extremely aggressive prosecution , ” she said .
“ L.A. is doing a laudable thing in trying to find a charge .
But I ’m not sure the courts are going to let this stand . ”

Jimmy Carter 's Proposed Energy Policy
In 1977 Posted by Pile ( 11466 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
President Jimmy Carter delivered a televised speech on April 18 , 1977 .
More than 30 years ago Carter addresses important issues regarding the future of energy use and policy in America .
Check it out .
Tonight I want to have an unpleasant talk with you about a problem unprecedented in our history .
With the exception of preventing war , this is the greatest challenge our country will face during our lifetimes .
The energy crisis has not yet overwhelmed us , but it will if we do not act quickly .
It is a problem we will not solve in the next few years , and it is likely to get progressively worse through the rest of this century .
We must not be selfish or timid if we hope to have a decent world for our children and grandchildren .
We simply must balance our demand for energy with our rapidly shrinking resources .
By acting now , we can control our future instead of letting the future control us .
Two days from now , I will present my energy proposals to the Congress .
Its members will be my partners and they have already given me a great deal of valuable advice .
Many of these proposals will be unpopular .
Some will cause you to put up with inconveniences and to make sacrifices .
The most important thing about these proposals is that the alternative may be a national catastrophe .
Further delay can affect our strength and our power as a nation .
Our decision about energy will test the character of the American people and the ability of the President and the Congress to govern .
This difficult effort will be the " moral equivalent of war " -- except that we will be uniting our efforts to build and not destroy .
I know that some of you may doubt that we face real energy shortages .
The 1973 gasoline lines are gone , and our homes are warm again .
But our energy problem is worse tonight than it was in 1973 or a few weeks ago in the dead of winter .
It is worse because more waste has occurred , and more time has passed by without our planning for the future .
And it will get worse every day until we act .
The oil and natural gas we rely on for 75 percent of our energy are running out .
In spite of increased effort , domestic production has been dropping steadily at about six percent a year .
Imports have doubled in the last five years .
Our nation 's independence of economic and political action is becoming increasingly constrained .
Unless profound changes are made to lower oil consumption , we now believe that early in the 1980s the world will be demanding more oil that it can produce .
The world now uses about 60 million barrels of oil a day and demand increases each year about 5 percent .
This means that just to stay even we need the production of a new Texas every year , an Alaskan North Slope every nine months , or a new Saudi Arabia every three years .
Obviously , this cannot continue .
We must look back in history to understand our energy problem .
Twice in the last several hundred years there has been a transition in the way people use energy .
The first was about 200 years ago , away from wood -- which had provided about 90 percent of all fuel -- to coal , which was more efficient .
This change became the basis of the Industrial Revolution .
The second change took place in this century , with the growing use of oil and natural gas .
They were more convenient and cheaper than coal , and the supply seemed to be almost without limit .
They made possible the age of automobile and airplane travel .
Nearly everyone who is alive today grew up during this age and we have never known anything different .
Because we are now running out of gas and oil , we must prepare quickly for a third change , to strict conservation and to the use of coal and permanent renewable energy sources , like solar power .
The world has not prepared for the future .
During the 1950s , people used twice as much oil as during the 1940s .
During the 1960s , we used twice as much as during the 1950s .
And in each of those decades , more oil was consumed than in all of mankind 's previous history .
World consumption of oil is still going up .
If it were possible to keep it rising during the 1970s and 1980s by 5 percent a year as it has in the past , we could use up all the proven reserves of oil in the entire world by the end of the next decade .
I know that many of you have suspected that some supplies of oil and gas are being withheld .
You may be right , but suspicions about oil companies cannot change the fact that we are running out of petroleum .
All of us have heard about the large oil fields on Alaska 's North Slope .
In a few years when the North Slope is producing fully , its total output will be just about equal to two years ' increase in our nation 's energy demand .
Each new inventory of world oil reserves has been more disturbing than the last .
World oil production can probably keep going up for another six or eight years .
But some time in the 1980s it can't go up much more .
Demand will overtake production .
We have no choice about that .
But we do have a choice about how we will spend the next few years .
Each American uses the energy equivalent of 60 barrels of oil per person each year .
Ours is the most wasteful nation on earth .
We waste more energy than we import .
With about the same standard of living , we use twice as much energy per person as do other countries like Germany , Japan and Sweden .
One choice is to continue doing what we have been doing before .
We can drift along for a few more years .
Our consumption of oil would keep going up every year .
Our cars would continue to be too large and inefficient .
Three - quarters of them would continue to carry only one person -- the driver -- while our public transportation system continues to decline .
We can delay insulating our houses , and they will continue to lose about 50 percent of their heat in waste .
We can continue using scarce oil and natural to generate electricity , and continue wasting two - thirds of their fuel value in the process .
If we do not act , then by 1985 we will be using 33 percent more energy than we do today .
We can't substantially increase our domestic production , so we would need to import twice as much oil as we do now .
Supplies will be uncertain .
The cost will keep going up .
Six years ago , we paid $ 3.7 billion for imported oil .
Last year we spent $ 37 billion -- nearly ten times as much -- and this year we may spend over $ 45 billion .
Unless we act , we will spend more than $ 550 billion for imported oil by 1985 -- more than $ 2,500 a year for every man , woman , and child in America .
Along with that money we will continue losing American jobs and becoming increasingly vulnerable to supply interruptions .
Now we have a choice .
But if we wait , we will live in fear of embargoes .
We could endanger our freedom as a sovereign nation to act in foreign affairs .
Within ten years we would not be able to import enough oil -- from any country , at any acceptable price .
If we wait , and do not act , then our factories will not be able to keep our people on the job with reduced supplies of fuel .
Too few of our utilities will have switched to coal , our most abundant energy source .
We will not be ready to keep our transportation system running with smaller , more efficient cars and a better network of buses , trains and public transportation .
We will feel mounting pressure to plunder the environment .
We will have a crash program to build more nuclear plants , strip - mine and burn more coal , and drill more offshore wells than we will need if we begin to conserve now .
Inflation will soar , production will go down , people will lose their jobs .
Intense competition will build up among nations and among the different regions within our own country .
If we fail to act soon , we will face an economic , social and political crisis that will threaten our free institutions .
But we still have another choice .
We can begin to prepare right now .
We can decide to act while there is time .
That is the concept of the energy policy we will present on Wednesday .
Our national energy plan is based on ten fundamental principles .
The first principle is that we can have an effective and comprehensive energy policy only if the government takes responsibility for it and if the people understand the seriousness of the challenge and are willing to make sacrifices .
The second principle is that healthy economic growth must continue .
Only by saving energy can we maintain our standard of living and keep our people at work .
An effective conservation program will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs .
The third principle is that we must protect the environment .
Our energy problems have the same cause as our environmental problems -- wasteful use of resources .
Conservation helps us solve both at once .
The fourth principle is that we must reduce our vulnerability to potentially devastating embargoes .
We can protect ourselves from uncertain supplies by reducing our demand for oil , making the most of our abundant resources such as coal , and developing a strategic petroleum reserve .
The fifth principle is that we must be fair .
Our solutions must ask equal sacrifices from every region , every class of people , every interest group .
Industry will have to do its part to conserve , just as the consumers will .
The energy producers deserve fair treatment , but we will not let the oil companies profiteer .
The sixth principle , and the cornerstone of our policy , is to reduce the demand through conservation .
Our emphasis on conservation is a clear difference between this plan and others which merely encouraged crash production efforts .
Conservation is the quickest , cheapest , most practical source of energy .
Conservation is the only way we can buy a barrel of oil for a few dollars .
It costs about $ 13 to waste it .
The seventh principle is that prices should generally reflect the true replacement costs of energy .
We are only cheating ourselves if we make energy artificially cheap and use more than we can really afford .
The eighth principle is that government policies must be predictable and certain .
Both consumers and producers need policies they can count on so they can plan ahead .
This is one reason I am working with the Congress to create a new Department of Energy , to replace more than 50 different agencies that now have some control over energy .
The ninth principle is that we must conserve the fuels that are scarcest and make the most of those that are more plentiful .
We can't continue to use oil and gas for 75 percent of our consumption when they make up seven percent of our domestic reserves .
We need to shift to plentiful coal while taking care to protect the environment , and to apply stricter safety standards to nuclear energy .
The tenth principle is that we must start now to develop the new , unconventional sources of energy we will rely on in the next century .
These ten principles have guided the development of the policy I would describe to you and the Congress on Wednesday .
Our energy plan will also include a number of specific goals , to measure our progress toward a stable energy system .
These are the goals we set for 1985 :
-- Reduce the annual growth rate in our energy demand to less than two percent .
-- Reduce gasoline consumption by ten percent below its current level .
-- Cut in half the portion of United States oil which is imported , from a potential level of 16 million barrels to six million barrels a day .
-- Establish a strategic petroleum reserve of one billion barrels , more than six months ' supply .
-- Increase our coal production by about two thirds to more than 1 billion tons a year .
-- Insulate 90 percent of American homes and all new buildings .
-- Use solar energy in more than two and one - half million houses .
We will monitor our progress toward these goals year by year .
Our plan will call for stricter conservation measures if we fall behind .
I cant tell you that these measures will be easy , nor will they be popular .
But I think most of you realize that a policy which does not ask for changes or sacrifices would not be an effective policy .
This plan is essential to protect our jobs , our environment , our standard of living , and our future .
Whether this plan truly makes a difference will be decided not here in Washington , but in every town and every factory , in every home an don every highway and every farm .
I believe this can be a positive challenge .
There is something especially American in the kinds of changes we have to make .
We have been proud , through our history of being efficient people .
We have been proud of our leadership in the world .
Now we have a chance again to give the world a positive example .
And we have been proud of our vision of the future .
We have always wanted to give our children and grandchildren a world richer in possibilities than we 've had .
They are the ones we must provide for now .
They are the ones who will suffer most if we do n't act .
I 've given you some of the principles of the plan .
I am sure each of you will find something you do n't like about the specifics of our proposal .
It will demand that we make sacrifices and changes in our lives .
To some degree , the sacrifices will be painful -- but so is any meaningful sacrifice .
It will lead to some higher costs , and to some greater inconveniences for everyone .
But the sacrifices will be gradual , realistic and necessary .
Above all , they will be fair .
No one will gain an unfair advantage through this plan .
No one will be asked to bear an unfair burden .
We will monitor the accuracy of data from the oil and natural gas companies , so that we will know their true production , supplies , reserves , and profits .
The citizens who insist on driving large , unnecessarily powerful cars must expect to pay more for that luxury .
We can be sure that all the special interest groups in the country will attack the part of this plan that affects them directly .
They will say that sacrifice is fine , as long as other people do it , but that their sacrifice is unreasonable , or unfair , or harmful to the country .
If they succeed , then the burden on the ordinary citizen , who is not organized into an interest group , would be crushing .
There should be only one test for this program : whether it will help our country .
Other generation of Americans have faced and mastered great challenges .
I have faith that meeting this challenge will make our own lives even richer .
If you will join me so that we can work together with patriotism and courage , we will again prove that our great nation can lead the world into an age of peace , independence and freedom .

Lisp as Blub
There 's a problem in the server software .
When the load gets high , it fails catastrophically instead of gradually .
Robert and Patrick Collison are investigating , but they 're still not sure what the problem is .
My guess from the external evidence is that it 's related to garbage collection .
Killing the server process fixes the problem , at least for a day or two .
pg -
What happened ?
And there 's the problem with Lisp for writing server software .
Long lived processes , shared state threading , and garbage collection make it extremely difficult to fail gracefully .
Even if your code is completely correct and bug free , it can still crash , hang or just run unacceptably slow and there is nothing you can do to correct it without completely restarting .
There is no macro or meta programming technique to fix this problem .
There are things you can do to mitigate it ( mostly by generating less garbage ) , but once you reach a certain level of activity in the system where the garbage collector can no longer keep up ( and it will happen ) , then every line of code in your system is now a potential failure point that can leave the whole program in a bad state .
Lisp has this problem .
Java has this problem .
Erlang does not .

When MediaDefender rained down an attack of some 8,000 SYN packets a second on an open BitTorrent tracker that pointed the way to hundreds of thousands of copyrighted movies for the taking , it had no idea it was shuttering a legitimate San Francisco media company .
Revision3 , the San Francisco - based site that produces and distributes the popular Diggnation show and others via the BitTorrent protocol , went offline over the Memorial Day weekend after its servers buckled under the attack .
Revision3's distribution tracker was open , and was pointing the way for pirates to download copyrighted movies unbeknownst to Revision3 .
MediaDefender is paid by the recording and motion picture industries to seed fake files to illicit torrent tracking services .
When Revision3 closed the tracker during the holiday weekend , the result was a denial of service attack by MediaDefender , which had been seeding the tracker with fake torrents .
" Our systems were targeting a tracker not even knowing it was Revision3 's tracker , " Randy Saaf , Media Defender 's CEO , said in an interview .
" They were using the tracker as the tracker for their legitimate content .
It had been open for years . "
At Fenopy.com , Revision3's tracker was used for 296,000 downloads , mostly of unauthorized copyrighted movies , Saaf said .
Jim Louderback , Revision3's CEO , said the attack shut down the company 's internet site , RSS server and internal corporate e-mail .
It 's an open debate whether MediaDefender 's actions were lawful , even when it targets illicit torrent - tracking sites pointing the way to unauthorized , copyrighted material .
The FBI is examining the Revision3 affair .
One bureau source told Threat Level that it was a " gray " area in federal computer security law .
Then there 's the area of corporate responsibility .
Louderback said in an interview that Revision3 closed the hole in its tracker over the Memorial Day weekend and subsequently got slammed by MediaDefender .
" That 's when MediaDefender went into overdrive and started pummeling us , " Louderback said .
" If a tracker was previously open and suddenly shut , their systems are automatically configured to put them out of business . "
Saaf said MediaDefender had been seeding the tracker with fake torrents for some time .
Fake files corrupt BitTorrent downloads .
" We saw an open BitTorrent tracker with a lot of pirated content on it .
We had been posting fake files to their tracker .
Over Memorial Day weekend , Revision3 changed some configurations , " Saaf said .
MediaDefender , of Santa Monica , California , holds some 2,000 servers with a 9 - GBps dedicated connection .
Louderback said if MediaDefender was " concerned that we were tracking copyrighted material , they should have called us . "
He wondered aloud over what tragedy may have happened had Revision3 " been an airport using BitTorrent to distribute approaches to the runaway ? "

There are fears that higher energy prices will dent consumer spending
Consumer prices rose 0.8 % in November from October , above market forecasts .
The figures come as US and UK central banks have been cutting interest rates to bolster weakening economic growth .
The higher than expected inflation figure saw the dollar post its biggest one - day rise against the euro in more than three years .
This is because traders now expect the Federal Reserve to delay any further rate cuts .
By late Friday afternoon trading in New York , the euro was down 1.5 % to $ 1.4412 against the dollar .
This is the strongest the dollar has been against the single European currency since October .
" The fear is that inflation will become the bigger concern , " said John Forelli of Independence Investment in Boston .
" It would be a lot easier to carry out their plans if inflation was not a concern . "
US shares fell on concerns that the Federal Reserve would now not cut interest rates .
That expectation helped strengthen the US dollar as investors looked for assets in currencies that offered higher returns .
' Dilemma '
Earlier on Friday , a report showed that inflation in the eurozone , which covers the 13 nations that use the single European currency , also surged .
According to figures from Eurostat , consumer prices rose 3.1 % in November compared with the same month in 2006 , the biggest rise in more than six years and up from October 's 2.6 % .
Central banks are battling to keep inflation in check as a slump in the price of the US dollar , and higher energy costs have pushed up prices .
However , at the same time they are also trying to limit the impact of a global credit crunch caused by problems in the US mortgage market .
There are fears that the high energy costs and problems in the financial markets will act as a brake on consumer spending , and hamper economic growth .
Analysts said that central banks including the US Federal Reserve will have a number of factors to consider when setting borrowing costs in coming months .
" The data highlights the huge dilemma the Fed is under between trying to quell the financial dislocations in the market , easing policy , all the while inflation rates are starting to climb higher , " said Kim Rupert at Action Economics .
" It 's going to be a difficult road . "
Background figures
The last time US inflation rose by such a large amount on a monthly basis came after an energy shortage in the wake of hurricane Katrina in September 2005 .
As well as energy , the cost of clothing , airline tickets and medication also rose in November in the US .
Consumer prices increased 4.3 % on a yearly basis - the most dramatic rise since June 2006 .
While the US central bank has cut interest rates three times in recent months to boost the economy , analysts suggest that these figures will make another interest rate cut less likely .
For the year to date , inflation is at 4.2 % - compared with 2.6 % in the same month in 2006 .
Separate figures from the Fed on Friday showed further evidence that the economy may not be slowing as quickly as first thought , analysts said .
Industrial production rose 0.3 % in November , reversing October 's 0.7 % drop , the Fed said .
This reversal stemmed from higher output at auto factories , contributing to the overall 0.4 % rise in manufacturing output .

Microsoft Office 2007 File Format Approved As ISO Standard
SEATTLE ( AP ) -- The format Microsoft Corp .'s ( MSFT ) Office 2007 programs use to save documents was approved as an international standard Tuesday , a step the company touted as proof it is willing to make once - proprietary technology work openly with competing programs .
But the International Standards Organization vote did n't quiet some opponents , who argued that the Office Open XML standard still locks out competitors and gives Microsoft customers no choice but to keep buying its programs forever .
The decision was made public on the Web site of a European standards organization , Ecma International , on Tuesday .
ISO is expected to formally announce the vote Wednesday .
Years before Microsoft started selling Office 2007 , its plan to switch to a new way of saving Word , Excel and PowerPoint files sparked concerns that future changes made by the software maker could render government or corporate archives unreadable , especially by non- Microsoft programs .
In 2005 , Massachusetts went so far as to direct state government offices to save documents as OpenDocument Format files , already an ISO standard whose inner workings were freely available to Microsoft and competing software makers alike .
The responsibility for maintaining standards falls to groups like ISO , not the companies that developed them .
Massachusetts reversed its stance after Microsoft promised to turn over responsibility for the OOXML format to Ecma International .
In January 2007 , Ecma submitted OOXML to ISO , a broader international organization , for a sped - up approval process .
Both Microsoft 's OOXML and ODF - backed by Sun Microsystems Inc. ( JAVA ) , International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM ) and others - make it easier for computer programs to read and understand the contents of a file .
That helps ensure older files will still be readable even if the program used to create them has changed significantly .
Before Microsoft turned OOXML over to Ecma , the software maker had sole control over the technology and no obligation to make it compatible with rivals ' products .
Critics argued that Microsoft essentially gave customers no choice but to stick with Office if they wanted documents to be readable in the future .
They also worried that Microsoft would drop support for OOXML someday , leaving customers with no way to see old files .
Making OOXML a standard is meant to address both problems , and ensure that competing programs can read and save OOXML files today and read them far into the future , even if Microsoft moves on .
" The input from technical experts , customers and governments around the world has greatly improved the Open XML specification and will make it even more useful to developers and customers , " said Tom Robertson , general manager of interoperability and standards at Microsoft , in a statement .
" We are committed to supporting this specification in our products , and we will continue to work with standards bodies , governments and the industry to promote greater interoperability and innovation . "
In an interview last week , Robertson said Microsoft and Ecma addressed almost all the issues raised during the ISO process , but some critics remain unsatisfied .
Even though Norway 's standards body voted for OOXML , Steve Pepper , a member of the organization , said Microsoft used strong - arm tactics to win approval .
" This vote is a tragedy for standardization , " Pepper told the Associated Press in Switzerland .
And Marino Marcich , head of the OpenDocument Format Alliance , said that despite promised changes to the specification , " OOXML does n't play well with the products of other software companies " like IBM and Sun .
He claimed that Microsoft failed to fully document all the features in the format and that some of the code was proprietary , leaving other companies vulnerable to copyright lawsuits .
What 's more , Marcich said , Microsoft can still use a version of OOXML in Office 2007 that does n't exactly match the one approved by ISO .
In a statement , Robertson said Microsoft is " committed to supporting this specification in our products . "

This post continues an exercise I began a month or so ago of trying to figure out how civilization could be moved to a mostly sustainable footing by 2050 , while still being recognizable as civilization , and in particular allowing some continued level of economic growth between now and then , especially in the developing countries .
Let me remind you of the parameters of the exercise :
Population :
The global population is able to grow and go through its demographic transition with death rates continuing to go down .
No die - offs .

No die - offs .
Economy :
The world economy is able to grow on average over the period - modestly in developed countries , faster in developing countries .

Carbon emissions :
The global energy infrastructure will be mainly replaced with non-carbon - emitting energy sources by the end of the period , and residual emissions will be rapidly diminishing .
: The global energy infrastructure will be mainly replaced with non-carbon - emitting energy sources by the end of the period , and residual emissions will be rapidly diminishing .
Fossil fuels :
I assume that peak oil is here about now but that declines will be governed by the Hubbert model ( and thus will be gradual ) .
I assume natural gas and coal are globally plentiful enough that climate policy is required to prevent their full use .
: I assume that peak oil is here about now but that declines will be governed by the Hubbert model ( and thus will be gradual ) .
I assume natural gas and coal are globally plentiful enough that climate policy is required to prevent their full use .
Technology : I do not assume any massive breakthroughs - no technological miracles that solve problems in ways completely unknown or untested today .
However , where technological sectors have long established rates of progress in key metrics , I extrapolate the metric to continue improving at the historic rate ( eg the economics of solar power , or the yields / acre of agriculture are assumed to keep improving on the historical trajectory ) .

Impact on wild ecosystems .
Developed countries are assumed to maintain the protections they currently have in place ( for national parks , wildernesses etc ) .
Developing countries are assumed to exploit their unused land up to the point of best current practices for developed countries .
Whatever impact on ecosystems arises from climate change due to past carbon emissions and the tail of emissions to 2050 is viewed as unavoidable .

Conservatism
Other than the above , I use the overarching principle of trying to assume as little change in the way the world works as possible - I assume it remains a more - or - less free market world , in which national governments regulate their own countries to temper the worst excesses of the free market and periodically enter into treaties on the more pressing global problems .
I assume it remains full of highly imperfect humans mostly struggling to improve their own circumstances .
I assume people are willing to come together and take collective action for the common good , but only when the need for that action has become so overwhelming and immediate as to be irrefutable .
In Powering Civilization to 2050 I argued it was potentially feasible to transition to power civilization with a mix of solar , wind , and nuclear energy , with the transition well on the way to completion by 2050 .
( Luis de Sousa made a broadly similar argument in Olduvai Revisited 2008 ) .
This would require a period of belt tightening and conservation in the next couple of decades , but once the transition had overcome the critical threshold ( as solar energy in particular became cheap ) , I suggested energy in general would get cheap again .
I adopted the UN medium population projection which has population at about 9 billion by 2050 , with growth slowing sharply .
Making plausible assumptions for economic growth between now and 2050 if energy was available , we got to a world GDP of about $ 350 trillion in 2050 ( in 2006 purchasing power parity dollars ) , versus about $ 70 trillion in 2007
If the average global citizen was significantly wealthier in 2050 , they would undoubtedly want to drive more .
The switch to primarily electrical energy sources for civilization would preclude doing this with all liquid fuels .
In Four Billion Cars in 2050 ?
I argued that , given that the average citizen will be living in a dense third world city by 2050 , we can assume rates of ownership typical of the most car - free corners of western Europe at the moment ( Holland ) , which gives rise to a few billion cars in 2050 .
I further argued that it seems feasible that this many plugin - hybrids could be built - there appears to be enough lithium for the batteries - and run on less than 10 mbd of liquid fuels .
In this piece I want to look at another area that many people think is likely to be a critical bottleneck to civilization continuing - the area of food , agriculture , and soil .
I am of course not an expert in these areas , but happily there is a lot of excellent scholarship and scenario building that I can lean on .
My task is reduced to reporting of the existing science , with some modest adjustments to reflect where my assumptions differ from those of published scenarios ( most especially the assumption of a near - term peak in oil supply , and a full - speed effort to convert society to carbon - free energy sources . )
Let 's begin with two very helpful UN Food and Agriculture Organization reports : World agriculture : towards 2015/2030 , and the sequel World Agriculture : Towards 2030 /2050 .
What these reports do is basically look at projections for population and economic growth and then estimate how much food people would want in the future , and what quantity of agricultural commodities would be required to fulfill that demand .
The first report focusses a lot more on the supply - side factors of how this could be done , while the second report extends the analysis out further in time but confines itself much more to demand side considerations .
The input assumptions about population and world GDP are slightly different than mine , but close enough that I am just going to adopt their food scenario wholesale , rather than trying to construct my own from first principles .
The differences would be small - much smaller than the other uncertainties in the problem .
Let me first summarize their scenario , and then we will start to explore the potential bottlenecks that might prevent achievement of this much food production .
( However , I strongly encourage readers that care about where their food is going to be coming from in the future to take the time and read the FAO reports themselves . )
Let 's start with a look at what the FAO scenario has for average nutrition .
This next graph shows both history and projections to 2050 for daily dietary energy ( in Kilocalories / day / person ) in various regions of the world , as well as the global average .
Per capita food availability 1970 - 2050 for various regions , together with world average .
Values for 2000 and before are data ( left of the vertical red line ) , 2010 onwards are projections ( right of vertical red line ) .
Source : Table 2.1 of UN Food and Agriculture Organization , World Agriculture : Towards 2030/2050 .
As you can see , the history is that most regions of the world have been getting more and more food .
The exceptions are some of the formerly communist countries which suffered a partial collapse of their societies as they attempted to transition to a different economic system .
The FAO projects that as the developing countries continues to grow faster than the developed world , they will be able to afford more food , and thus they will continue to approach , but not completely achieve , developed world levels of ( over ) feeding .
I could quibble with a few things here - I might guess that wealthier developing countries will get closer to current developed country averages by 2050 , and I wonder about the sharp trend break between the past and the projections in the developed world .
Still , these are minor issues - I think this has to be in the right ballpark for any scenario that assumes continued improvement of economic conditions in the developing world , and no major societal collapses ( which is what we are trying to figure out how to avoid ) .
If we take the FAO 's scenario breakout of food groups ( which they give by weight on a per- capita basis ) and multiply by population , we get the following for total food demand :
Total food requirement 1970 - 2050 by major food types .
Values for 2000 and before are data ( left of the vertical red line ) , 2010 onwards are projections ( right of vertical red line ) .
Source : Table 2.7 of UN Food and Agriculture Organization , World Agriculture : Towards 2030 /2050 and UN Medium Population Scenario for population figures .
Note that I did not include " Other food " , which is only given in calorific terms in the table , and constitutes less than 10 % of calories .
Fruits and green vegetables would be included under that category .
As you can see , by 2050 , the world would need to be producing about 50 % more food than it is today ( by weight - somewhat more in terms of energy in crops , since the meat component grows more than 50 % ) .
This contrasts with roughly doubling the planetary food production over the last 40 years .
However , it 's still an awful lot of extra food to produce - the required absolute increase in food production is similar in size to what has been achieved in the last forty years .
Let 's now consider a variety of potential bottlenecks to achieving this kind of increase in food production .
One major area of concern ( water ) I will reserve for its own future piece , but I address the other big potential constraints that I am aware of .
Land Use and Crop Yields
The doubling of global food production since the 1960s has not come about because of expanding cropland .
The world has about 14.8 billion hectares of land area , and the uses of it over the last few decades are as follows :
Major classes of global land use 1961 - 2003 .
Source : FAO .
As you can see , the areas of cropland and pasture have increased slightly , at the expense of forests and other land , but the shifts are small percentage - wise .
Instead , increased food production for the planet 's extra billions of humans has largely come from big increases in agricultural yields .
I 'm going to start with some yield data for the US , where we have long time series on yields for a number of crops .
After that , we 'll discuss the global situation .
I have taken National Agricultural Statistics Service data on average US yields and reexpressed them on a common basis as a multiplier of the 1900 - 1935 average ( or for those crops were the series does n't start till after 1900 , from whenever it does start until 1935 ) .
Average United States yields per unit area for selected crops , 1900 - 2007 .
Yields are expressed as a multiplier of the 1900 - 1935 average .
Source : National Agricultural Statistics Service .
All the series show a roughly similar pattern .
They were all fairly flat ( with noise ) until sometime in the late 1930s or 1940s .
Then they all took off and began growing roughly linearly ( again with noise ) .
Modern yields are anywhere from 2.3 to 6.5 times greater than yields in the early twentieth century .
Although some series have had periods of lagging for a decade or two ( eg peanuts after 1983 , dried beans - garbanzos and the like - after 1990 ) , on the whole most of the series look like they are still increasing - there is no obvious pattern of yields flattening off yet .
I encourage you to stare at this remarkable data for a long time .
It 's really worth thinking about the implications of it .
Here are a few conclusions I draw .
Firstly , mechanization ( and fossil - fuel powered machinery ) are not the main cause of modern yields .
Steam tractors were in widespread use in the late 1800s and early 1900s :

Source : Ontario Govt Photo Archive .
The first gasoline powered tractor to be mass produced was introduced by Ford in 1917 .
Yet the yield take - off does n't begin until 1940 , and is almost certainly due to the agricultural innovations that comprise the green revolution .
As The Future of Crop Yields and Cropped Area explains it :
The Green Revolution strategy emerged from a surprising confluence of different lines of agricultural research ( Evans , 1998 ) – the development of cheap nitrogenous fertilizers , of dwarf varieties of major cereals , and of effective weed control .
Nitrogenous fertilizers increase crop production substantially , but make plants top - heavy , causing them to fall over .
The development of dwarf varieties solves this problem , but at the cost of making plants highly susceptible to weeds , which grow higher than the dwarf plants , depriving them of light .
The development of effective herbicides removed this problem .
Further Green Revolution development focused on crop breeding to increase the harvest index – the ratio of the mass of grain to total above - ground biomass .
Secondly , anyone who wants to suggest that the world can be fed other than through industrial agriculture has some explaining to do about this data .
Every crop shows yields prior to the green revolution that were flat and a small fraction of modern yields .
If we returned to yields like that , either a lot of us would be starving , or we'd be terracing and irrigating most of the currently forested hillsides on the planet for food .
While shopping for locally grown produce at your nearest organic farmer 's market , stop and give a moment of thanks for the massive productivity of the industrial enterprise that brings you , or at least your fellow citizens , almost all of your calorie input .
Which raises a third important point .
Food = Area Cropped x Average Yield .
If average yields had not increased like this , humanity 's impact on natural ecosystems would be much greater .
It 's true that industrial agriculture has a lot of impacts ( nitrogen runoff and the like ) .
However , the alternative would probably have been worse , since it would have required us to intensively exploit enormous areas of fragile , and currently less intensively exploited , land .
Fourthly , the period of greatest global warming , since 1950 , coincides with the explosion of yields .
I do not suggest that global warming caused increased yields .
But at any rate , it would be hard to argue that industrial agriculture yields cannot grow rapidly in the face of the kind of warming we have seen to date : they just did
Well , is the global situation the same , or is this US data unrepresentative ?
I do n't have access to as much data , but roughly , yes , it 's the same :
As you can see , global cereal yields are on the same roughly linear upward trajectory since 1961 .
Cereals are by far the most important food crop since not only do people eat a lot of them directly , but they also account for much of the input to the meat and dairy food groups that people eat , and thus are the base for the bulk of human calorie intake .
So obviously the critical question is whether or not yields can continue to increase in this manner ?
If we can just project out the linear increase than clearly a linearly increasing amount of food from a roughly constant amount of land is feasible , and humanity will be able to feed itself without having too much further impact on other ecosystems .
On the other hand , if yields fail to increase , then we will be faced with unpleasant tradeoffs like trying to farm fairly unsuitable regions ( think tropical rainforests , or the hilly parts of the western US ) , or not have enough food .
So are we near some kind of theoretical yield limit ?
Some people seem to think so .
Lester Brown , who has been issuing alarming prognostications about food for several decades now , writes in Chapter 4 of his book Outgrowing the Earth
Although the investment level in agricultural research , public and private , has not changed materially in recent years , the backlog of unused agricultural technology to raise land productivity is shrinking .
In every farming community where yields have been rising rapidly , there comes a time when the rise slows and eventually levels off .
For wheat growers in the United States and rice growers in Japan , for example , most of the available yield - raising technologies are already in use .
Farmers in these countries are looking over the shoulders of agricultural researchers in their quest for new technologies to raise yields further .
Unfortunately , they are not finding much .
From 1950 to 1990 the world ’s grain farmers raised the productivity oftheir land by an unprecedented 2.1 percent a year , slightly faster than the 1.9 annual growth of world population during the same period .
But from 1990 to 2000 this dropped to 1.2 percent per year , scarcely half as fast .
The argument in the second paragraph does n't hold water to me .
Population has been increasing pretty much linearly in recent decades , and agricultural yields have also been increasing pretty much linearly - I do n't see any break from that pattern in the 1990 - 2000 decade .
Of course , a linear rise will look like a dropping exponential growth rate , but Brown is careful to only point out the slowing in the yield growth rate .
What he does n't tell you is that world population growth had also dropped to only 1.4 % during 1990 - 2000 .
In general , food prices until very recently were in a multi- decade secular decline , indicating that food production was not under serious supply - side constraint until the last few years :
Ratio of crude food / feed producer price index to all US consumer prices , Jan 1969 - Dec 2007 .
Source : St Louis Fed .
And the argument in the first Brown paragraph I quoted does n't seem to be how the agricultural scientists themselves are feeling .
For example , Science reported last week :
A decade ago , sequencing the maize genome was just too daunting .
With 2.5 billion DNA bases , it rivaled the human genome in size and contained many repetitive regions that confounded the assembly of a final sequence .
But last week , not one but three corn genomes , in various stages of completion , were introduced to the maize genetics community .
In addition , researchers announced the availability of specially bred strains that will greatly speed tracking down genes involved in traits such as flowering time and disease resistance .
These resources are ushering in a new era in maize genetics and should lead to tougher breeds , better yields , and biofuel alternatives .
" We 're sitting on very exciting times , " says Geoff Graham , a plant breeder at Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc .
The geneticists are well on the way to having complete genome sequences for thousands of corn varietals from all over the world .
If I was a corn geneticist , I 'd be pretty excited too .
A more grounded attempt to estimate the issue seems to be the FAO 's discussion in World agriculture : towards 2015/2030 :
The slower growth in production projected for the next 30 years means that yields will not need to grow as rapidly as in the past .
Growth in wheat yields is projected to slow to 1.1 percent a year in the next 30 years , while rice yields are expected to rise by only 0.9 percent per year .
Nevertheless , increased yields will be required - so is the projected increase feasible ?
One way of judging is to look at the difference in performance between groups of countries .
Some developing countries have attained very high crop yields .
In 1997 - 99 , for example , the top performing 10 percent had average wheat yields more than six times higher that those of the worst performing 10 percent and twice as high as the average in the largest producers , China , India and Turkey .
For rice the gaps were roughly similar .
National yield differences like these are due to two main sets of causes :
Some of the differences are due to differing conditions of soil , climate and slope .
In Mexico , for example , much of the country is arid or semi-arid and less than a fifth of the land cultivated to maize is suitable for improved hybrid varieties .
As a result , the country 's maize yield of 2.4 tonnes per ha is not much more than a quarter of the United States average .
Yield gaps of this kind , caused by agro-ecological differences , cannot be narrowed .
Other parts of the yield gap , however , are the result of differences in crop management practices , such as the amount of fertilizer used .
These gaps can be narrowed , if it is economic for farmers to do so .
To find out what progress in yields is feasible , it is necessary to distinguish between the gaps that can be narrowed and those that cannot .
A detailed FAO / IIASA study based on agro-ecological zones has taken stock of the amount of land in each country that is suitable , in varying degrees , for different crops .
Using these data it is possible to work out a national maximum obtainable yield for each crop .
This maximum assumes that high levels of inputs and the best suited crop varieties are used for each area , and that each crop is grown on a range of land quality that reflects the national mix .
It is a realistic figure because it is based on technologies already known and does not assume any major breakthroughs in plant breeding .
If anything , it is likely to under - estimate maximum obtainable yields , because in practice crops will tend to be grown on the land best suited for them .
The maximum obtainable yield can then be compared with actual national average yield to give some idea of the yield gap that can be bridged .
The study showed that even a technologically progressive country such as France is not yet close to reaching its maximum obtainable yield .
France could obtain an average wheat yield of 8.7 tonnes per ha , rising to 11.6 tonnes per ha on her best wheat land , yet her actual average yield today is only 7.2 tonnes per ha .
For example :
Gap between actual national yields and estimated yield with best currently known varietals and inputs .
Source : FAO report , World agriculture : towards 2015/2030
And so ,
Similar yield gaps exist for most countries studied in this way .
Only a few countries are actually achieving their maximum obtainable yield .
When real prices rise , there is every reason to believe that farmers will work to bridge yield gaps .
In the past , farmers with good access to technologies , inputs and markets have responded very quickly to higher prices .
Argentina , for example , increased her wheat production by no less than 68 percent in just one year ( 1996 ) , following price rises , although this was done mainly be extending the area under wheat .
Where land is scarcer , farmers respond by switching to higher - yielding varieties and increasing their use of other inputs to achieve higher yields .
It seems clear that , even if no more new technologies become available , there is still scope for increasing crop yields in line with requirements .
Indeed , if just 11 of the countries that produce wheat , accounting for less than two - fifths of world production , were to bridge only half the gap between their maximum obtainable and their actual yields , then the world 's wheat output would increase by almost a quarter .
Another way to try to get at the issue is to look at how current yields compare to the theoretical potential of photosynthesis .
This is generally expressed as ( NPP ) - the amount of carbon that plants can fix , exclusive of that used to power their own respiration .
The net primary productivity is the photosynthetic product that is available to be eaten by people and other animals , rot into the soil , etc .
Here is a map of the fraction of net primary productivity appropriated by humans published by Haberl et al last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , which I take to be a decent representative of the state - of - the - art in this kind of calculation :
You might look at the red - 60 % - 80 % appropriation of NPP in many of the world 's key crop growing areas , and think there was n't enough head room for another 50 % + increase in yield in those areas .
However , it 's important to understand exactly how the accounting in these calculations is done .
Let 's consider a piece of the US midwest that used to be tall - grass prairie and is now under corn .
What Haberl et al would do is first use a vegetation model ( specifically , this one ) to establish that it would be a prairie there absent human intervention , and figure out how much carbon the prairie would have fixed as NPP .
That quantity they call NPP 0 ( for that particular area - they compute NPP 0 for every cell in a global grid ) .
So this is an estimate of the theoretical carbon fixation in the absence of any human influence .
In particular , this is with the rainfall that falls naturally - carbon fixation in actual use could potentially exceed this if the crop was irrigated .
Then they would run the model again , but constrained to have cornfields rather than prairies .
The carbon fixed by the model in that scenario would be NPP act .
Thus a model estimate of the actual carbon fixation in the actual human use of the area .
Next , they would figure out NPP h which would be basically the carbon in the harvested corn based on national agricultural statistics ( and in agricultural residues if those were harvested and statistically tracked also , but not likely in the case of corn ) .
So NPP h is the part that we humans really use ( either by eating or feeding to our animals ) .
Given the actual NPP act , and the NPP h they would then compute the difference , NPP t - basically the carbon in the corn stover which gets returned to the ground , eaten by mice , or whatever happens to it .
So then the human appropriation of net primary productivity ( HANPP ) is defined as 1 - NPP t / NPP 0 .
That is to say , if you look at the carbon that the prairie would have fixed , and then the carbon in the corn-stover , the difference is what is considered to be human appropriated .
And that 's the thing in the map that 's 60 - 100 % in the midwest ( and other heavily utilized major cropland areas ) .
However , this is not the same as the theoretical yield .
In particular , a lot of the appropriated carbon comes about due to the difference between NPP 0 and NPP act - the corn field does n't fix as much carbon as the prairie , probably mainly because it starts the season out as bare soil and has to grow an annual crop from seed , instead of being a set of perennial grasses that can sprout from last year 's roots and cover the available area in chlorophyll much faster .
Let 's look at their Table 2 to make this clearer .
This table shows the global breakdown of HANPP by food class .
If we look at the " Cropping " category , we can see the different figures .
Summary of human appropriation of net primary productivity .
NPP 0 is modeled carbon fixation in wild condition .
NPP act is carbon fixation in actual human usage .
NPP h is carbon harvested or unfixed by harvest .
NPP t is residual carbon flowing into ecosystem .
Source : Haberl et al : Quantifying and mapping the human appropriation of net primary production in earth ’s terrestrial ecosystems
As you can see , the average m2 of cropfield ( worldwide ) would fix 0.6 kg of carbon if it was n't actually a field , but instead was covered in whatever the climactic climax vegatation is in that location .
As a square meter of a field instead , it fixed 0.4kg of carbon , and of that humans got , on average 0.3 kg as food and straw etc , leaving 0.1 kg to go to the ground .
So the HANPP is considered to be 5/6 ( 1 - 0.1/0.6 ) .
( The authors insist on three significant figures ( 83.5 % ) , but I 'm skeptical that the calculations are really that accurate ) .
However , hopefully it should be clear by now that that does n't mean there 's a theoretical limit of only increasing yield by a further 1/ 5 .
Instead , there are multiple targets for the agronomists and geneticists to go after .
The gap between the 0.4kg of NPP act and the 0.6kg NPP 0 could be addressed with plants that had a longer growing season , covered the ground earlier , etc .
To the extent some cropland is water - limited , irrigation could potentially increase the total NPP feasible .
To the extent the 0.3kg of NPP h is showing up as straw rather than food , then potentially that could be increased further .
A few decades down the road , one imagines heat - loving genetic mutant corn plants that pop up in the spring from perennial roots , promptly cover the ground with leaves that flatten themselves to the soil , and then start spitting out corn kernels , which can be harvested several times a year .
It might not look much like a corn plant , but made into Doritos , people would probably still eat it ( well , Americans would , anyway ) .
In short , another factor two of global cropland yields seems not to be ruled out on theoretical grounds .
However , much more than that would appear to require the geneticists to come up with better photosynthesis ( black plants basically - on which there has been no progress , as far as I understand ) .
Finally , it 's worth mentioning that the FAO thinks there is considerable potential to use more land for agriculture :
There is still potential agricultural land that is as yet unused .
At present some 1.5 billion ha of land is used for arable and permanent crops , around 11 percent of the world 's surface area .
A new assessment by FAO and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis ( IIASA ) of soils , terrains and climates compared with the needs of and for major crops suggests that a further 2.8 billion ha are to some degree suitable for rainfed production .
This is almost twice as much as is currently farmed .
Here 's the breakdown for where the alleged potential cropland is :
Regional breakdown of land considered available for cropping , compared to land in present use for that purpose .
Source : FAO report World agriculture : towards 2015/2030
However , " much of the land reserve may have characteristics that make agriculture difficult , such as low soil fertility , high soil toxicity , high incidence of human and animal diseases , poor infrastructure , and hilly or otherwise difficult terrain . "
Caveat emptor !
If you look carefully at this figure - with the available land mainly in South America and Sub- saharan Africa , and the HANPP map above , you 'll realize that much of what the FAO is talking about is cutting down the remaining tropical rainforests and using them for agriculture .
I do n't think that 's a very good idea for a host of different reasons - better that we eat mutant corn , I think .
The great bulk of the best land is almost certainly in production already .
Soil Loss
It appears to me that until recently , there has been a good deal of scientific confusion on the seriousness of soil erosion , estimates of the rate of erosion vary by more than an order of magnitude , and the overall data situation make global oil reserves look like a model of precision .
As such , I do n't think it 's possible to make a clear evaluation of how near term the threat is globally .
My best impression is that it 's regionally quite severe , especially on fragile and marginal lands ( dry , steep , or thin - soiled ) , but is probably not a near - term ( next few decades ) threat on the core agricultural regions from which most food comes ( which tend to be flatter places with deep soils that do n't erode quickly ) .
It is certainly a major concern on the century timescale .
However , there are many cultural practices that can help while still allowing good yields and , if I 'm reading the literature correctly , erosion appears to be controllable , even within the context of fairly industrial styles of agriculture .
Let me quickly sketch some of the debate .
The last global evaluation appears to have been GLASOD done by Oldeman et al and published in 1990 .
They produced a map which looks like this :
Global map of soil degradation .
Source : GLASOD map , as shown in FAO report World agriculture : towards 2015/2030
This looks really bad - everywhere humans are , the soil is degraded , and much of the world 's core crop land is in the " severely degraded " category .
However , that did not yet have much noticeable effect on global yields , which have continued to increase by leaps and bounds since then .
Moreover , this map was produced by what amounts to a survey of soil scientists , who used their subjective judgement .
The instructions for filling out the questionaire describe how to set up the map cells , and then say :
The next step involves evaluation of the degree , relative extent , recent past rate and causative factors for each type of human - induced soil degradation , as it may occur in the delineated physiographic unit .
This evaluation process should be carried out in close cooperation with national and / or international experts with local knowledge of the region .
The evaluation process results in a list of of human - induced soil degradation types per physiographic unit , ranking them in order of importance .
So this does n't sound like a precise , quantitative sort of estimate .
And more quantitative estimates are dogged with problems .
A central issue is that most soil eroded from place A ( let 's say a steep field on the side of a valley ) is n't necessarily lost to cultivation .
Instead , it may end up in place B ( let 's say the flood plain of the river in the bottom of the valley ) where it may still be of use in cultivation .
The US is the best measured place , in that we at least have a national agency charged with regular quantitative assessments of soil erosion ( a legacy of the dustbowl years ) .
The last assessment was the 2003 National Resources Inventory .
NRCS maps of US soil erosion in 2003 .
Source : US National Resources Conservation Service 2003 National Resources Inventory
These estimates are made by applying models ( the Universal Soil Loss Equation and the Wind Erosion Equation ) to topographical and climate data .
The model inputs are things like the rainfall data , the slope of the field , the erodibility of the particular soil , etc .
The overall amounts of erosion are decreasing , and the amount is not imminently scary .
The current national average of 4.7 tons / acre / year corresponds to a little more than 1 kg / m2 / yr , which in turn is about 1 mm / year , or an inch in twenty five years .
That 's not good , but does n't sound like a likely disaster before 2050 , particularly given that the rate of erosion is dropping quite rapidly .
However , these estimates in one way overstate the problem because the USLE and WEE are designed to assess how much soil is removed from its original location , but not where that soil goes .
Most of it is unlikely to make it all the way out to the ocean , but instead end up somewhere else where it may be put to use .
An extraordinary paper by Trimble in 1999 assessed the details of where soil went in a single valley in Wisconsin by doing detailed samples and cross sections of the alluvial plains .
His estimates of the trends and disposition of soil is as follows :
Clearly , the soil erosion is decreasing , but also , most of it has n't gone that far , and , therefore , could potentially be put back at some point in the future if that becomes economically desirable .
Still , in the long term , it seems that eroding an inch every few decades from upland areas is certainly not sustainable , though it 's not an imminent crisis either .
In an important meta - analysis last year , D. Montgomery compiled erosion rates for a wide variety of situations and plotted the following cumulative density function for the probability of different erosion rates :
Cumulative distribution function of soil erosion and formation rates from numerous studies around the world .
Hollow circles represent rates of soil formation , solid line is geological erosion rates , triangles are soil erosion rates under native vegetation , while diamonds are soil erosion rates under various conservation tillage methods ( terracing or no- till agriculture ) .
Solid circles represent plough - based agriculture .
Source : D. Montgomery , Soil erosion and agricultural sustainability
The key things to note are these :
Rates of soil production and erosion under native vegetation are roughly similar , suggesting soil depths are naturally in equilibrium .
Rates of " agricultural " erosion are a couple of orders of magnitude higher , suggesting that ploughing is not a long - term proposition .
Rates of " Conservation " erosion are roughly comparable to to natural erosion rates under native vegetation .
This covers more sustainable management regimes such as terracing and no -till agriculture .
This suggests that the long - term sustainability of industrial agriculture requires the use of no - till farming systems in which ploughing is not done , crop residues are left on the field , and weeds are managed another way ( primarily via herbicides today ) .
Fertilizer
The three major fertilizer nutrients applied in industrial agriculture are Nitrogen ( N ) , Phosphorus ( P ) , and Potassium ( K ) .
None appear to be a critical constraint on agriculture to the 2050 timeframe , though there are significant issues with nitrogen in the short term .
Nitrogen fertilizer is manufactured via the Haber - Bosch process in which nitrogen gas ( which forms almost 80 % of the atmosphere ) is heated with hydrogen over an iron catalyst at high temperatures and pressures to form ammonia ( NH 3 ) which is subsequently reacted with other compounds to form urea , ammonium sulphate , and other compounds used as fertilizer .
Presently , almost all the hydrogen input to this process is produced by steam reformation of natural gas , and this is the cause of the short term problem since natural gas supplies are problematic , and likely to worsen with both Europe and North America probably at or past peak natural gas .
Fertilizer manufacture is exiting these regions and moving to the Middle East , Trinidad , and other places with more natural gas .
However , in the long term , there 's no reason nitrogen fertilizer has to be made from natural gas .
In my scenario in which energy production is dominated by renewable / nuclear electricity by 2050 , the natural source of hydrogen for Haber - Bosch is by electrolyzing water .
Producing nitrogen fertilizer is unproblematic as long as society has ample energy .
The reserves and reserve - base for phosphorus are enormous .
According to the USGS , 2006 global production of phosphate rock was 145 million tons , while reserves were 18 billion tons , and the reserve base was 50 billion tons .
For the 2050 timeframe , I consider reserve base to be the more appropriate number for the same reasons discussed under lithium .
The reserve base for phosphate rock is 350 times larger than 2006 production , so there is no evidence of a problem at present .
Some bloggers are concerned that the Hubbert linearization suggests peak phosphorus has already past .
However , Hubbert linearization is not very reliable if there is no independent evidence to suggest peak is at hand , due to the problem of dual peak structures giving rise to misleading linear regions ( eg see the UK oil linearization ) .
In this case , with enormous reserves , and stable phosphorus prices ( they have n't varied outside the range of $ 27 - $ 28/ton from 2002 - 2006 ) , it seems very unlikely that phosphorus is in trouble .
JD has made a similar point ( snark warning ) .
Potassium comes from the mining of potash .
The USGS estimates the global reserve base to be 550 times larger than current usage .
So potassium is unlikely to limit civilization any time soon .
Fuel use in Farming and Food Transport
I do n't have global statistics , but at least in the US , agriculture is a minor user of oil .
In total , it only used 2.2 % of oil in 2000 .
This contrasts with cars and light trucks , which used 40 % , heavy trucks which used 12.7 % , air travel at 6.7 % etc .
Since agriculture is such a critical industry , we can ensure it is preferred for oil usage .
Furthermore , all shipping trade only uses 2.5 % of US oil use .
Most of that is shipping things other than food , but the bulk of food transportation is in there too .
Amongst critics of globalism , the image of strawberries being flown from Chile is a popular thing to pick on .
However , things like strawberries form a miniscule fraction of our diet .
A more representative image of global food trade would be a grain ship like this one :
Grain ship docked in Australia .
Shipping is extremely energy efficient - two orders of magnitude better per ton - mile than air freight .
Thus , long - haul shipping of food will be cost effective long after oil has peaked .
Ships can also be run on nuclear power , as the US navy has been demonstrating for decades .
In Conclusion
There seems to be reason for cautious optimism that if other global problems can be solved , food production will not be a critical constraint on civilization to 2050 .
If industrial agricultural yields maintain their historical trajectory , there will be enough food without needing much more land .
In case yields fail to continue increasing , more land is potentially available globally , though likely of poor quality .
Soil erosion is an important problem , but not a critical emergency , and can seemingly be solved permanently with no - till farming methods .
Fertilizer does not appear to be seriously constrained in the long - term , though nitrogen fertilizer needs to be transitioned away from reliance on natural gas .
Agriculture only needs a tiny fraction of global liquid fuel use to operate , and this can be maintained for a long time , since food production is a critical infrastructure .
However , if we were to keep growing the conversion of food into biofuels , all bets would be off .
Other sources
In addition to the sources linked directly above , I consulted the following references
Moreover , even after attempts by the Court and the Congress to rein in these methods - which were once prosecuted by the US as war - crimes - the president continued to defend , use and advance violations of Common Article Three in violation of the law and the Constitution .
In the last week , we have also learned the following : that some Gitmo inmates have testified to being injected with some kind of substance :
Adel al - Nusairi remembers his first six months at Guantanamo Bay as this : hours and hours of questions , but first , a needle .
" I 'd fall asleep " after the shot , Nusairi , a former Saudi policeman captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2002 , recalled in an interview with his attorney at the military prison in Cuba , according to notes .
After being roused , Nusairi eventually did talk , giving U.S. officials what he later described as a made - up confession to buy some peace .
" I was completely gone , " he remembered .
" I said , ' Let me go .
I want to go to sleep .
If it takes saying I 'm a member of al - Qaeda , I will . ' "
We have also discovered that the president is still insisting that he has the power to violate Geneva at will on a case - by - case basis , rendering the rule of law moot and the Constitution toothless .
Money quote :
While the Geneva Conventions prohibit “ outrages upon personal dignity , ” a letter sent by the Justice Department to Congress on March 5 makes clear that the administration has not drawn a precise line in deciding which interrogation methods would violate that standard , and is reserving the right to make case - by - case judgments .
“ The fact that an act is undertaken to prevent a threatened terrorist attack , rather than for the purpose of humiliation or abuse , would be relevant to a reasonable observer in measuring the outrageousness of the act , ” said Brian A. Benczkowski , a deputy assistant attorney general , in the letter , which had not previously been made public .
And so abuse and torture are entirely dependent , we are told , on the apparent motives of the abusers and torturers .
But torture is actually defined in the law as an illegal tool devised not for sadism 's sake but as a means to extract information .
And notice the extremely slippery slope .
We no longer have torture as an extreme last resort in the face of a ticking time - bomb ; we have authorized it simply " to prevent a threatened terrorist attack . "
That means any time anywhere by anyone authorized by the government after 9/11 , no ?
And if a foreign government were to use such a standard ?
What do we say then ?
We also know that the torture and interrogation camp at Guantanamo Bay has become for many of its inmates the functional equivalent of a lunatic asylum .
It is not very hard to see why .
If you were not crazy before you got there , it will not take long for the abuse and isolation and total hopelessness of the place to get into your head .
The cells are 8 by 12 feet , have no windows and inmates are in solitary confinement and stationary for 22 hours a day .
There is no escape and no possibility of a fair trial by any traditional standards of " fair " .
No one locked up in these conditions has been tried or convicted of anything .
And we wonder why some have attempted suicide or gone on hunger - strike ?
From the New York Times a few days ago on the conditions endured by the most high - profile of the prisoners :
“ Conditions are asphalt , excrement and worse , ” [ Hamdan ] wrote his lawyers in February .
“ Why , why , why ? ”
At Guantánamo , there are no family visits , no televisions and no radios .
A new policy will for the first time permit one telephone call a year .
In the cells where Mr. Hamdan and more than 200 of Guantánamo ’s 280 detainees are held , communication with other detainees is generally by shouting through the slit in the door used for the delivery of meals .
Mail is late and often censored , lawyers say .
Conditions are more isolating than many death rows and maximum - security prisons in the United States , said Jules Lobel , a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who is an expert on American prison conditions .
We have evidence of what abuse and torture does to prisoners , in the case of Jose Padilla , an American citizen subjected to torture at the behest of the president :
Dr. Hegarty , one of two mental health professionals who examined him , said Mr. Padilla was " fearful of being thought of as crazy . "
She described him as " hypervigilant , " his eyes darting about , his face twitching into grimaces , his " startle response " on constant high alert .
" During questioning , he often exhibits facial tics , unusual eye movements and contortions of his body , " Mr. Patel said .
" The contortions are particularly poignant since he is usually manacled and bound by a belly chain when he has meetings with counsel . "
These things are continuing for all we know .
This is what the United States has become .
To see what is in front of one 's nose needs a constant struggle .

Just the other day he tap danced for the press corps while waiting on John McCain , and on Saturday night he was serenading a crowd of several hundred in what he said was his first -- and last -- performance for the annual Gridiron Club dinner with his own special rendition of ' Green , Green , Grass of Home . '
While video of Bush 's impromptu soft - shoe routine on the White House steps was broadcast far and wide , members of the press corps were sworn to off - the - record secrecy before viewing his Gridiron song & dance .
During the routine , Bush joked about Dick Cheney 's penchant for secrecy , former FEMA director Michael Brown 's incompetence and " some oil rich Saudi . "
A few attendees apparently ignored Bush 's secrecy directive and surreptitiously filmed the proceedings with cell phone cameras .
Videos of the event were posted to YouTube and are reproduced below .
The Gridiron Club has only 65 active members , did not admit women until the 1970's , and did not include television or radio correspondents until just 2005 .
The New York Times boycotted because of the off - the - record ground rules .
Absent from the affair were jokes about searching for WMD 's from President Bush , the topic of a previous poorly received presidential comedy routine .
Even Helen Thomas , one of the president 's fiercest questioners from the White House press gallery , appeared in a skit dressed as a 19th - century schoolmarm pretending to be Condi Rice teaching democracy to foreign heads of state .
The dinner is ' off the record ' but a Youtube user , framjam , captured Bush 's song on his cellphone camera .
From George W. Bush 's performance : " And there to meet me is my mama and papa , down the lane I look and there comes Barney , heart of gold and breath like honey ; it 's good to touch the brown brown grass of home . [... ]
For there 's Dick and Condi , my old compadre , talking to me about some oil rich Saudi , it 's good to touch the brown brown grass of home .
That old White House is behind me , I 'm once again carefree , do n't have to worry ' bout a crisis in Pyongyang .
Down the lane I look Dick Cheney is strolling with documents he 's been withholding , it 's good to touch the brown brown grass of home . "
From the downtown Renaissance Hotel , the annual Gridiron dinner , Saturday , March 8 , 2008 : After his song , this is George W. Bush 's farewell :
Recently , there were a number of media stories about how the U.S. Army has been recruiting more men with criminal records .
When pressed about this , the army released a report showing that recruits let in via " moral waivers " made better combat soldiers .
That is , they got promoted faster , re-enlisted at a higher rate , got more awards for valor and were noted for superior combat performance .
They were also better educated , and more likely to talk back .
A slightly higher percentage of them got punished for that .
All this is nothing new .
It was noted as far back as World War II , when detailed records of troop performance were first compiled and analyzed .
A disproportionate number of troops that excelled in combat , also had disciplinary problems when off the battlefield .
The conventional wisdom was that someone with a " taste for combat " also lacked respect for authority .
Research since World War II has shown that risk - taking behavior is the basis of brave acts , as well as criminal ones , drug use , and addiction to things like gambling and dangerous sports .
The U.S. Army has , for the last sixty years , turned down most recruits with a criminal record .
The reason was that , since an army ( especially in peacetime ) depended on discipline to function , anyone who broke the law had already demonstrated problems with following orders .
Before September 11 , 2001 , the army found that 27 percent of recruits with criminal records ( and given a " moral waiver " to enlist ) , did n't finish their enlistment because of misconduct ( refusing to obey orders , or just a bad attitude ) .
This was twice the rate of troops who did not need a moral waiver .
Back then , less than four percent of recruits got moral waivers .
That usually required references from teachers , clergy or employers attesting to how the applicant had shaped up , and was worthy of acceptance .
But since 2004 , the percentage of recruit getting in with moral waivers has tripled to 13 percent .
Yet there has not been a noticeable decline in troops quality .
There is still a higher percentage of moral waiver recruits getting discharged early , but not double the rate of those without moral waivers .
The army has found ways to lower its traditional admission standards , yet still get people who can perform well in a professional force .
This is not just the case with those who do poorly on written tests , or did not finish high school .
It 's especially the case with those allowed in on waivers .
The most common items waived are medical conditions , criminal records or drug use , in that order .
Last year , most of the moral waivers were for juvenile offenses .
Less than one percent ( 511 ) of last years recruits ( 80,407 ) received moral waivers for adult criminal records .
Keep in mind that the numbers were talking about here are small , and that the negative impact of recruits with moral waivers is basically non-existent .
Most waivers are for medical problems .
For example , many urban recruits have asthma problems .
If the recruit is headed for a job that does not require the kind of physical effort that low grade asthma would interfere with , a waiver would be granted .
If a prospect has a low grade ( no felonies ) criminal record , and appears to have moved on from that sort of thing , a waiver is possible .
Same with prior drug use .
Prospects are made aware of the regular , unannounced , drug tests for troops on active duty .
Asking for testimonials from responsible adults helps deal with those seeking moral waivers .
The army also has new psychological tests that indicate those that have put their bad behavior behind them , and which have n't .

Bars in Minnesota are finding interesting and creative ways to get around the state smoking ban :
What started as a quirky idea to get around the statewide smoking ban appears to be spreading like wildfire .
Dozens of bars are expected to stage “ theater nights ” this weekend in which patrons are dubbed actors .
The law , which went into effect in October , permits performers to smoke during a theatrical production .
“ Two weeks ago , we had one bar doing this , ” said Mark Benjamin , a criminal defense attorney who launched the theater - night idea .
He estimates 50 to 100 bars could be on tap for theater nights this weekend based on phone calls , e-mails and requests for the how - to - stage - a- theater - night packet that he ’s devised .
And many bar owners are passing on the information quickly among themselves without getting in contact with him .
When people are this drawn to smoking , especially in a place so brutally cold as Minnesota , where it was - 9 degrees F the last time I was there , is it any surprise that they ’ll find * any * way to get around this nanny state idiocy , even if it eventually means blatant violations of the law ?
I ’d say that perhaps these advocates of a smoking ban should simply drop the veil , show their true colors , and declare that they wish to see smoking made illegal nationwide .
I would hope that this would lead to widespread outrage among Americans in favor of individual freedom .
But in modern times , where the Constitution and its protection on individual rights has been replaced by worship at the idol of democracy , I think there would n’t be much resistance at all .
After all , I live in California , where I think there ’s more social acceptance of marijuana than there is of tobacco .
The biggest fight would not come from individual citizens , but from the beneficiaries of government largess paid for by cigarette taxes .
Our society is about to change drastically , and not in 20 or 50 years , and not because of cybernetics or nanotechnology .
It ’s about to change due to lifecasting .
Lifecasting in its current form is where people broadcast , usually via a mounted camera at home , a significant portion of their lives .
Justin.tv is one of the most successful examples of this form of expression .
But this is just the first stage of lifecasting ; the real impact to society , which is about to come , requires a particular condition to exist .
That tipping point will come when a significant percentage of society is broadcasting their lives , nearly continuously , from mobile devices .
You might be thinking , “ Ah , that ’s just another “ social media ” trend , i.e. “ something those crazy Internet kids are doing ” .
This is true of lifecasting in its current , infantile stage , but not in the stage it ’s about to reach .
Within the next 5 - 10 years lifecasting will change the way people interact with each other in nearly all settings .
Lifecasing will redefine how the rules by which we expose ourselves to the world .
More Than the Sum of the Parts
The reason lifecasting is currently being overlooked is because the technologies that will power it are rather unremarkable by themselves .
It ’s basically composed of three pieces : 1 ) mobile video via mobile phone or some other highly portable camera , and 2 ) the ability to send that video out in real - time to the Internet , and 3 ) the ability to quickly parse the incoming content into usable chunks .
Nothing major , really .
In fact , two of the three are already being done .
The issue is scale , and that ’s the part that ’s about to change .
How many devices can stream live video ?
How many mobile phone carriers support the constant upload of a video stream from their entire user - base ?
And finally , how many services are out there that take in these videos and tag them , make them searchable , integrate them with social networks , etc ?
Very few .
A Visible New World
Once these elements change ( see iPhone / 3G / 4G LTE ) our world will change with it .
Here ’s how it ’s going to play out :
All phone carriers will start supporting all - you - can - eat data plans , and they ’ll get much cheaper .
The bandwidth ( both download and upload ) on said services will increase very rapidly , e.g. the next network upgrade after 3G is going to be scary fast ( try between 100 - 300 Mb ) .
All mobile phones are going to do video , and they will all ride these newer , faster networks .
Within the next ten years a significant percentage of people in first - world countries are going to be broadcasting every moment of their waking lives ( and in many cases their sleeping lives as well ) .
This is a friction point for some .
Why would people want to broadcast their lives ?
Wo n’t it only be a few fringe people and not a “ significant percentage ” ?
No .
It ’ll be a massive number .
Many forces will influence the adoption of “ casting ” by the masses .
Here are a few :
Youth .
The world is getting younger , and young people will naturally be drawn to the idea of sharing everything about their lives .
It appeals to the sense of self - importance present in most young people .
It makes sharing your life with loved ones infinitely more easy .
In order to see what you ’re doing , they do n’t have to contact you for an account of what happened , or even what is happening .
They just tune into your view of the world .
They see what you see .
They hear what you hear .
There will be pressure from loved ones to continue casting in order to allow others to feel close to them .
Financial incentives .
There will be an explosion of services focused solely on harvesting interesting events from everyday lives .
I ’ll go into these services in detail later , but the point is simply that there will be financial benefits to participating .
Civic reasons .
The government will offer incentives to “ casters ” because your set of eyes will help find and apprehend criminals .
More on this later .
Impact
Now we get to the core of it .
So what , right ?
Why should we care ?
Ok , so let ’s assume you ’ve accepted that the numbers will be there .
Let ’s consider the implications .
Millions of people uploading their actual life perspective with sound and video , and all of this content will be stored , tagged and made searchable by Google , Microsoft , etc. — instantly — as it ’s coming in .
Oh , and add to it the fact that most of it will be geotagged as well .
It ’s staggering to even think about .
Consider the sheer number of things that take place during everyone ’s daily lives that are lost forever .
Well , no longer .
As lifecasting becomes mainstream , public places will become 24/7 broadcast zones .
If anything at all happens worth noting it will be discussed , propagated across the Internet and the people involved will be unable to the ramifications of the events they were a part of .
The Camera is Everywhere
He notion of being unable to show any sort of negativity without it being shown to the world ( with your name , address , and place of business ) will have a staggering effect on society .
Here are a few scenarios to think about .
One improper comment out of your mouth can now get you fired , or even aired on CNN .
A single off - color joke about wanting to “ do ” some woman at work , or maybe you made fun of a handicapped person as they walked by .
A simple funny face would be enough .
Or maybe you ’re a racist who makes some mouthbreathing comment about black people while eating in a restaurant with a friend .
The person did n’t hear it , and nobody was offended ( then ) , but unfortunately for you it was captured by four different people who were lifecasting near you at the time .
Oh , and the guy at work that hates you caught it on the Internet and just sent the link to your VP , who is black .
Fail .
In short , everything you do will be subject to scrutiny by the entire Internet .
And any undesirable behavior that is captured will be easily distributed for ill - effect .
You will be able to quite literally cuss someone out while driving to dinner and have someone send you the video of you doing it ( titled “ This guy ’s an asshole ” ) as you ’re being seated .
Who else is getting a copy of that video showing you inventing new ways to be vulgar ?
The list of bad behavior that we all do constantly is nearly endless , but now it ’ll be visible :
Rudeness
Dirty looks
Bad Jokes
Foul language
Cruelty
Maliciousness
Snobbery
Condescension
Enjoying the Misfortune of Others
Everyone is a Reality Show Star About to Have a Big Break
But it wo n’t be only bad things that are captured ; the ever - present cameras will also catch the positive things :
Random acts of kindness
Heroism ( did they know they were being casted ? )
Rescues
Extremely strange , unlikely events , i.e. freak occurrences
Humorous scenarios
Baby and child cuteness that would have otherwise been lost
The Concepts of Time and Location
A particularly scary thing about this is the fact that any place with lots of people will be under what equates to constant surveillance .
And virtually all video will include highly precise time and location metadata .
Hanging out with that other guy or other girl in public will get a lot more difficult .
“ What the hell !
Someone just sent me a cast of you at the mall with Cindy ! ”
It ’ll be possible to simply type in a location and watch as various views of that place stream in and out .
So the screen is black for a little bit because nobody is around , then all of a sudden you see the place from the north , and it passes quickly ( someone in a car ) .
Then you see it from the right , and it ’s bobbing up and down ( someone walking ) , plus you hear a conversation .
Then the screen splits because you ’re now seeing two different views of the same place .
And you can even see the two people casing now , because their cameras are catching each other .
Customer Service Feedback ?
One of the things that got me thinking about this was being the recipient of abominable customer service .
I ’ve seen people absolutely ignore me while shouting and playing with friends in the back — while I was clearly visible , only to come to the register , not look at me , and mumble , “ Watchu wuh ”
Imagine these types of events being captured constantly , with the option to instantly upload them to a given drop - off point to be reviewed by staff for that given company .
So you clip your cast and send it to the URL for McDonald ’s review service .
It goes into a queue and gets acted upon immediately depending on severity .
Or even better , how about McDonald ’s having staff that simply scan lifecasts that are coming from their stores ’ locations .
So while it ’d be kind of weird to put up full - time video cameras in their stores to track employee behavior they ’d be able to simply query Google for all video coming from their stores ’ locations .
They could get paid to just sit there and watch those feeds and look for corporate policy infractions .
So a customer gets a dirty look , or the lines are WAY too long at a particular location .
A form is n’t filled out and mailed in by some customer a week later .
No .
It ’s seen in real - time , escalated , and two minutes later a corporate manager is calling that store manager saying , “ WTF ? ” Instead of saying , “ some customer said one of your employees was rude . ” , the manager will say , “ I ’m looking at a video of one of your employees being rude to customers .
Take them off the line and fire them immediately . ”
As with the other types of behavior , poor customer service in this new environment will have instant ramifications .
Crime Fighting / Government Surveillance
This is a big one , and it ’s scary too .
Ok , so we already see here what all is going to be captured .
Now imagine law enforcement tapping into it .
So many crimes that would have gone unsolved will now be trivial to take care of .
Suspect grabbed a purse at location x then ran off to the north .
Ok , show me all Google lifecast video for the area he just ran to ( remember , most all video will have location metadata in it ) .
Parsing lifecasts will become a regular part of crime fighting .
Now add the government to it .
Think of the NSA walking into Google and demanding a full feed of their data .
Now imagine their face , voice and other types of recognition software being trained on the full feed of incoming casting data .
It ’ll be like tapping into millions of sets of eyes to look for and track somebody .
The order to the computer will be : “ Find Daniel Miessler . ”
At that point the interface will be irrelevant .
Whether it ’s phone , a static video camera or a lifecaster — it ’ll all be the same — all being fed into the same search / analysis algorithm that can find my identifier tokens , e.g. credit card numbers , phone numbers , my voice , my facial characteristics , my license plate , or even someone browsing the web the way I tend to .
Castwatching as a Service
An entire new profession will arise from this .
Castwatchers .
People watching lifecasts for various reasons .
You ’ll have people watching lifecasts looking for celebrities so they can report on current locations .
Imagine a Google Maps mashup called Oceans 17 — it tracks all celebrities that were in the movie , i.e. Brad Pitt , George Clooney , etc. and displays constantly updated markers on a Google map .
Of course , you roll over the icon and get their current activity .
Like , drinking coffee — and the text is a link to buy the coffee they ’re drinking .
Oh , and on the side you can click to view the casts that are updating the location .
In other words , here ’s Brad Pitt from two tables over .
Here ’s Brad Pitt from the perspective of the waiter .
Then you ’ll have reporters watching for new stories they can pounce on .
In fact , there will be pools of trained analysts who can spot interesting behavior .
And that can be sold as a service .
So people will subscribe in order to look for blackmail - able offenses .
So if you see someone that looks rich acting guilty while interacting with drugs or sex , research who the person is and give me their location .
Think of what the tabloids will do .
Find me racism .
Find me suffering .
Find me sex .
They ’ll be paying these kinds of services to dig up garbage that will sell .
Security and Privacy
Being in information security one of the things that freaks me out is that many people , if not most , are going to keep location - tracking / metadata enabled for at least their friends and family .
And many are going to keep it enabled for everyone .
People who get no attention can scarcely believe the “ too much attention ” problem even exists , so they ’ll lifecast continuously and allow anyone and everyone to know exactly where they are .
What could go wrong , right ?
Facial Recognition
This one ’s a bit farther in the future , but not too far .
One of the most significant applications of lifecasting will be widespread use of facial recognition technology .
This point is best made with an example .
Let ’s say you ’re sitting in a restaurant near the door , and your casting camera has a view of people as they come in .
Well , your device ( your personal computer ) , which is currently called your phone — will take a picture of the person as they come in , try and get any other angles of the person if they were just uploaded by people in the same restaurant with another angle , and then it will use both / all of those images to perform a search on Google for that person .
Think about this .
Every person you see , and hence your device sees , will get queried against Google for a match .
If it finds the person , their identity information ( whatever ’s available ) gets sent to your device .
Your device will then perform its matchup algorithm on the data pulled down vs. your data that it already has .
Where are they from ?
What do they like to do ?
Etc .
The next and most interesting extension of this functionality will be an addition to the crime - fighting piece .
It ’s also the scariest .
Carriers will offer subsidies for your service fees if you volunteer to use facial recognition at all times and allow law enforcement access to your uploads .
So in other words , everyone casting with this service turned on will be helping the police , FBI , DHS , etc. catch the people they ’re looking for .
They ’ll be able to send profiles to your device and use your device ( passively ) to scan for those profiles .
This will either be mandatory ( depending on where our society is when this happens ) or it may be a service that you choose to take part in as a “ good citizen ” , with a reward of reduced cost for your other addons .
Accidents
Imagine the video that will be available of car ( and other vehicle ) accidents .
If you thought the video on “ Crazy Car Crashes ” was extreme , wait till you have visibility to 100,000 % more crashes .
Drama
We ’ll start being exposed to some of the most touching and heartwrenching scenes ever witnessed .
Real stuff .
Imagine the scenarios that happen in the movies and on the TV shows , only real .
All that stuff really happens ; it happens every day , but it ’s never captured .
But now it will be , and many of the subjects of the “ best ” drama will become instantly famous .
“ She was the one in “ the breakup ” .
Imagine the whole Internet watching a breakup between a couple that they did n’t know was being recorded .
Millions will want to know about their lives .
What are they doing now ?
Are they dating again ?
Who will pay to watch the “ casts ” of their first dates with their new boyfriends and girlfriends ?
Also , aside from breakups , imagine the lovers in Paris .
The handholding .
The sweet words .
The smiles .
The laughs .
These precious moments that have hardly ever been captured other than in Hollywood will now be regularly brought to billions .
And once again , the participants will have the option to become famous , even if only for a moment .
Fights
Simple .
Let ’s say we ’re currently only capturing a millionth of a percent of all fights .
Now let ’s bump that up to 3 % .
Now add knife fights .
Attempted muggings .
Shootouts .
One defender , multiple assailants .
All this stuff that there ’s very little video on will now be captured on a regular basis .
Instant Celebrity
People who used to be unknown will quickly be discovered .
That super fat guy at Arby ’s ?
He ’s online now .
140,000 views in 5 minutes .
Someone just submitted his name .
Here ’s where he lives .
Here ’s his username on eBay .
Oh , another caster is walking up to him now and asking him if he knows he ’s famous .
That ’s being casted as well .
Etc .
Perspecive Sharing
One of the coolest consumer benefits of this kind of thing is going to be the social - networking aspect .
Right now we can call our friends , text them , send them email , and that ’s about it .
In Japan and Europe you can do a bit of video on a mobile phone , but it ’s not all that ubiquitous yet .
Well once this is commonplace you ’ll have another option for staying close to friends and family — changing to their perspective .
Basically , they share out their camera to a group of people ( I ’m looking at you , identity services ) and if you are in the group then when you click on their contact in your mobile device you ’ll have multiple options :
Voice call Video call Text Email ( will merge into others soon ) PerView ( perspective view )
This gives a whole new meaning to , “ Dude , check this out . ”
When you send that to a friend now , via voice or text , it will be a prompt to change to your perspective .
And it wo n’t matter if you ’re on the other side of the country , or the world .
You ’re sitting in a restaurant and a gorgeous woman is at the next table over .
You are just eating your burger but you want your buddy to see how fine she is .
“ PerView Ping Brian ” , you say to your device .
Brian is sitting at work and vocally accepts the incoming PerView ping ( which he has setup to automatically begin a voice call as well ) and he immediately sees the woman that you ’re looking at .
“ Damn , dude … go ask her out .
I ’ll watch . ”
Countermeasures
There ’s no doubt that there ’ll be a total backlash against casting ( lifecasting ) .
Many places will have signs displayed : “ No lifecasting allowed . ”
Why ?
Because it ’ll scare away customers .
People will demand establishments to become safe from the eyes of the Internet .
People will get wanded for cameras ( which mobile phones will have anyway ) when entering certain areas .
Plus , who ’s going to consent to having their mobile devices taken from them at the door ?
People will constantly be looking for who ’s watching them .
For who ’s recording them .
In fact , many organizations will not only search people ( that ’ll be largely ineffective ) but will actively jam the frequencies of the mobile devices to keep them from lifecasting from their environments .
The game will become figuring out how to cast from places that do n’t want you casting from them .
Remember , people will be going to these places to do the things that they do n’t want anyone seeing .
Now factor in the people who are paid to catch those same people doing those things .
And a new arms race will begin .
Language
So what ’s the lingo that will surround this new phenomenon ?
Here are a few obvious / unimaginative options .
I ’ll rely on readers to come up with better ones .
First , for lifecasting itself :
Lifecasting Casting Shooting Being “ live ” Streaming
Then for going offline , i.e. NOT lifecasting .
Going Dark Unplugging Dropping Off Deadening Hibernating
Conclusion
I ’m only barely touching the first few layers of this thing .
It ’s just massive .
I ’m kind of overwhelmed right now and just need to post this as - is despite it being a jumbled mess of word things .
I ’ll continue to work on the organization of the idea and add examples as I remember / think of them .
I ’ll also update it with ideas from the comments .
I ’d love to hear your thoughts on the idea , i.e. do you think it will be as big as I think it will ?
If not , why not ?
What specifically will stop this from becoming reality ?
My answer ?
Nothing .
Notes
Thursday 24th April
KUALA LUMPUR , Malaysia
Iran has been kicked out of an international defense show in Malaysia for exhibiting missile equipment in violation of U.N. rules , an official said Thursday .
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak said Iranian companies were ordered out of the Defense Services Asia show Tuesday because their exhibition was deemed “ offensive . ”
“ Unfortunately , when we came around to inspecting their stand , they displayed equipment that clearly contravened the U.N. resolution — equipment such as missiles and missile systems and others , ” Najib told reporters .
May 29 , 2008 --
Six young men died last year after swimming in lakes or pools infested with a brain - eating amoeba , the CDC reports .
The bad blobs -- known as Naegleria fowleri or N. fowleri -- thrive in warm , fresh water all over the world .
But the key word here is warm .
The amoeba loves heat .
In the U.S. , it inhabits the relatively hot waters of lakes , hot springs , and poorly maintained pools in Southern or Southwestern states .
All six of the 2007 cases were in Florida , Texas , and Arizona ( the victims ' names and swimming sites come from local media reports ) :
May / June 2007 : Angel Arroyo Vasquez , age 14 , of Orlando , Fla. , was swimming in an apartment swimming pool .
July 2007 : Will Sellars , age 11 , of Orlando , Fla. , was swimming and wakeboarding in Lake Conway .
August 2007 : Richard Almeida , age 10 , of Kissimmee , Fla. , was swimming and wakeboarding at Orlando Watersports Complex .
August 2007 : John " Jack " Herrera , age 12 , participated in water activities during summer camp at Lake LBJ in Texas .
August 2007 : Colby Sawyer , age 22 , ruptured his eardrum while wakeboarding at Lake LBJ in Texas .
September 2007 : Aaron Evans , age 14 , was swimming at Lake Havasu in northeastern Arizona .
Why the deadly amoeba struck these six and not the thousands of other people exposed in the same places at the same times is a mystery , says CDC epidemiologist Jonathan Yoder .
" Humans are the accidental host -- we are not part of this amoeba 's life cycle , " Yoder tells WebMD .
" But when it finds a nice warm environment like your nose , it looks for a food source . "
Congress is poised to re-authorize the federal law against human trafficking with new provisions that will both increase penalties for sex workers and effectively decrease our ability to aid genuine victims of trafficking .
In my first contribution to Rewire , I tried to disentangle the subjects of trafficking and sex work .
Understanding this distinction is crucial , because Congress is poised
to re-authorize the federal law against human trafficking with new
provisions that will both increase penalties for sex workers and
effectively decrease our ability to aid genuine victims of trafficking .
The Department of Justice , which is responsible
for enforcing the bill ’s provisions , is opposing these misguided
changes — and so should anyone else who is concerned about human
trafficking in its many forms .
It
is already sadly evident that the U.S. government ’s anti-trafficking
program has devolved into a global campaign against sex work and is not
working to halt trafficking .
In a 2006 report critical of the program , the Government Accountability Office found that
" the U.S. government has not developed a coordinated strategy to combat
trafficking in persons abroad …or evaluated its programs to determine
whether projects are achieving the desired outcomes . "
Now comes a plan to further ratify this failure .
The Trafficking Victims ’ Protection Reauthorization
Act addresses the crime of trafficking in persons , which is recognized in U.S law as cases that involve force , fraud or coercion , which includes threats , intimidation , and psychological abuse .
The law offers protection to workers who are most vulnerable to abuse —
immigrants , people in forced labor , and minors who exchange sex for
cash or goods .
The bill currently before Congress , however , would
expand the definition of " sex trafficking " to include cases in which no
elements of force , fraud or coercion were involved .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

Specifically , the House version of the TVPRA would expand U.S. laws against prostitution by re-defining most prostitution - related activities , regardless of consent , as trafficking .
Human
trafficking is a complex issue , but there is widespread agreement about
its key distinguishing features , namely the use of force , fraud or coercion .
HR 3887 throws out these cornerstones and threatens to re-define all prostitution , arguably even all sex work , as trafficking .
And it would require the involvement of federal law enforcement through a broad new provision that covers
actions " affecting " interstate commerce ( rather than actual activities
that involve the crossing of state lines , the standard trigger for
bringing in the feds ) .
Therefore , most prostitution - related activities defined as sex trafficking would fall under federal law even if no interstate commerce was involved .
The
immediate consequences of this definitional sleight - of - hand are bad
enough : the use of federal resources to prosecute state - level offenses
involving consenting adults who may not see themselves as victims of a
crime .
But turning the DOJ into the prostitution police is not the
worst of it .
By shifting the focus of the law from genuine cases of
trafficking to prostitution as a whole , the bill threatens to divert
resources from those most in need : the real victims of trafficking .
The
Department of Justice has written to members of Congress to express its
opposition to the proposed reauthorization bills , saying that the
changes would remove their focus from genuinely abusive situations that
involve force , fraud or coercion and place it instead on the over 100,000 prostitution - related arrests annually .
The DOJ ’s resistance to the changes stem also from the fact that addressing each prostitution case as a potential trafficking case would significantly increase their caseload
while reducing the likelihood of convictions .
Trafficking cases require
an identifiable victim .
Contrary to popular mythology , most sex workers
are not in coercive situations .
If they do not choose to self - identify
as victims or otherwise participate in the prosecution of their
associates , the case may collapse .
The
dangers of laws that are both overly general and backed by heavy
penalties should be familiar to any student of U.S. history .
The 1910
White Slave Traffic
Act , better known as the Mann Act , criminalized
interstate travel for " immoral acts , " which at that time referred
fairly generally to ( female ) promiscuity and interracial sexual
activity .
In practice , the application of the law was often
distinguished by racism or political bias .
High - profile victims of
racist prosecutions under the Mann Act included Chuck Berry and Jack Johnson , while Charlie Chaplin and Frank Lloyd Wright , suspected of Communist sympathies , were subject to politically motivated Mann Act prosecutions .
Above
all else , however , application of the Mann Act was sexist .
The law
purported to protect women , yet the overwhelming majority of those
charged under the Act were women .
Women were tried and jailed for
crossing state lines to visit men , often men that they would later
marry .
It seems inconceivable to us today that simply visiting a
romantic partner in another state could be grounds for conspiracy
charges , yet this is exactly what happened .
In
1986 , the scope of the Mann Act was amended to cover only acts that
were crimes in the location where they were committed .
When the Act was
conceived in 1909 , prostitution was not a crime in any state of the
Union .
But within twenty years , every state had passed
laws criminalizing prostitution .
Today , almost a hundred years from its
conception , the Mann Act remains on the books as a law enforcement tool
targeting prostitution .
This little - known law got its
moment in the spotlight recently when four people involved with the
Emperors Club VIP , whose best - known client was New York governor Eliot Spitzer , were charged with Mann Act offenses .
Just
as the Mann Act , ostensibly created to protect women , was used largely
to prosecute them , the targets of the re-authorized TVPRA will not be
international traffickers .
They are more likely to be prostitutes
( including , once again , many women ) , charged with trafficking offenses
that exist only on paper .
If
no " victims " or " traffickers " can be found , some will have to be
created .
The threat of additional charges or the promise of immunity
can be used to persuade some of those charged to testify against their
colleagues .
During
the initial period of the TVPRA , despite lavish spending on raids and on
services for victims of trafficking , there was an embarrassing lack of
migrants coming forward to take advantage of the protection offered by
the law and to cooperate in the prosecution of their traffickers .
The
expanded definition of trafficking provided by HR 3887
should make up the shortfall in trafficking victims , but only by
spuriously applying trafficking charges to cases that do not involve
force , fraud or coercion .
There is something deeply
wrong with our government when the answer to the desperate problem of
human trafficking is to change the definition of the crime so we can
claim we ’re doing something about it .
It ’s a tactic that is misguided
at best and at worst , downright cynical .
Equating
prostitution and trafficking simultaneously denies the agency of sex
workers and trivializes the experiences of people in genuinely abusive
situations .
Enshrining this wrongheaded equation in law delivers a
double whammy .
On the one hand , it undercuts the ability of government
agencies to provide services to those who desperately need them .
On the
other it opens the door to the same kind of abuses seen with the Mann
Act , creating " victims " where none exist and bringing the full force of
anti-trafficking law to bear on a group that is already stigmatized and
marginalized by society .
By any standards , this would be a gross
miscarriage of justice .

Asustek Computer plans to add a desktop computer to its Eee PC family that will launch globally in July , the company revealed Thursday .
The new desktop , dubbed Eee Box , is a white mini-PC about the size of a hardback book and will come with either a Linux or Windows XP OS .
Eee Box will come in a range of configurations , including a choice of hard drives from 80G bytes to 250G bytes in size , and allow users to surf the Internet wirelessly via 802.11n Wi -Fi .
The device comes with four USB ( Universal Serial Bus ) ports , two each in front and back , and a slot for MMCs ( Multimedia Cards ) , SD ( Secure Digital ) cards and Memory Sticks .
The most basic version of the device , which will come with an 80G - byte hard disk and run a Linux OS , will cost around NT $ 10,000 ( US$ 328 ) , an Asustek representative said .
She declined to comment further on the device or its components .
The new desktop will be part of the popular Eee PC family of Asustek low - cost laptops that allow people to access the Internet wirelessly .
The company set a target of shipping over 5 million Eee PC laptops this year , and said a shortage of laptop batteries was the only thing holding back sales .
Asustek has already launched several versions of the Eee PC since last year .
The cheapest one runs on a Linux OS from Xandros , has a 7 - inch screen , carries 2G - bytes of NAND flash memory for storage and sells for around NT $ 7,999 .
The company launched its latest version last month , the Eee PC 900 , which boasts an 8.9 - inch screen , an Intel Celeron M microprocessor , and runs on either Linux or Windows XP .
The Eee PC has become popular for its low price , small size and weight , which is less than 1 kilogram .

WASHINGTON ( WOMENSENEWS )
–Like many aid workers and activists trying to improve the lives of women in developing countries , Inonge Mbikusita - Lewanika has long viewed education as the key to solving many of her countrywomen ’s problems .
Mbikusita - Lewanika , a former member of Zambia ’s parliament and now the country ’s ambassador to the United States , says the benefits of educating girls are so numerous–from raising marrying ages and lowering birth rates to stemming health and economic problems –that she would like to install a plaquereading " Send the Girls to School " in every village .
But 30 years after the U.S. government and other aid - givers began to promote gender equality in their programs , they , like Mbikusita - Lewanika , have learned that relieving the burdens of poor women is more complex than once thought .
Foreign aid officials from the United States , United Kingdom , United Nations and various nongovernmental organizations say that it is not enough to open the school door to girls if their families are besieged by unemployment , unclean water , labor - intensive household chores and , increasingly , debilitating health problems such as HIV / AIDS .
Nor is it enough to get a few women elected to the parliament or congress while women in the countryside still suffer age - old discriminations .
To succeed , say aid experts , gender - equality programs must be integrally incorporated into the aid process from top to bottom , beginning with constant attention to gender issues at the policy level and ending with a wide distribution of burden - relieving aid in the rural areas where discrimination is often most ingrained .
In Africa , for instance , women perform about 75 percent of agricultural work , according to Mark Blackden , the lead economist in the World Bank ’s Poverty Reduction and Management of Gender Equity Division .
He estimates the continent ’s per-capita income would have doubled over the last 30 years if women had been given more aid and education to help with crop production .
But aid givers have only recently realized that " one does indeed need to talk about the African farmer and her husband , " Blackden said .
Instead , because of cultural misunderstandings , they have often directed agricultural education and technology to men .
As a result , Mbikusita - Lewanika said , it is not uncommon to see men sitting on tractors as women and girls continue to cultivate with a hand hoe nearby .
Clearing a small plot of land in this manner can involve 18 - hour days , leaving women little time to raise their children , gather fire wood , walk long distances to find potable water and , increasingly , care for the sick .
With such intensive household labor needs , Mbikusita - Lewanika said girls often have little time for school .
" The average woman takes care of everyone else but herself , " Mbikusita - Lewanika said at a recent Capitol Hill briefing for legislative staff .
In countries where economies have been destroyed by conflict or AIDS , another factor diminishes the rationale for education :
The lack of jobs when a girl graduates .
As a result , Mbikusita - Lewanika said that , while education " may be the most important investment , it may not necessarily be the first investment " that donors should undertake .
For instance , providing drinking water would save women in many Zambian villages 1 1/ 2 hours a day , she said .
In 1973 , the U.S. Congress passed the Percy Amendment requiring that the nation ’s foreign aid help integrate women into the mainstream of developing countries ’ societies .
Since then , the U.S. Agency for International Development –the main administrator of U.S. development aid–and other organizations have progressed from conducting a few gender equality projects a year to considering gender issues as a part of nearly every decision .
While women ’s issues once were often segregated in a separate office or set of discussions , all programs are now expected to address their impact on women .
" The progress can be summed up in one sentence :
It is no longer a separate thing , " USAID administrator Andrew S. Natsios told a Washington foreign aid conference earlier this month .
More Work to Be Done
Still , aid officials and activists say there is much more to do .
According to the World Bank , more than 20 percent of the world ’s population still lives on about $ 1 per day .
The majority are women .
And women ’s burdens , especially in AIDS - stricken Africa , are growing as they bear bigger social and financial burdens .
One way donors can begin to lift that burden , Mbikusita - Lewanika told legislative staff , is to bypass governments and distribute aid money to local faith - based organizations and other groups that work at the local level and already know the intricate problems the women in their community face .
Many central governments have not established effective ways to distribute help in the countryside , she said .
Other officials suggest increasing funding to fight HIV / AIDS in Africa .
The $ 2 billion the Bush administration is prepared to spend in 2004 " is not enough , " said Kathryn Wolford , president of Lutheran World Relief , based in Baltimore .
Wolford also suggests an increased focus on debt relief for poor countries , which would free funds for social programs and infrastructure that could relieve women ’s burdens .
Other activists say aid organizations need to collect and process more data showing the positive link between women ’s participation and economic development .
While many activists suggest that there is already too much talk about women ’s problems and not enough action to solve them , economists say that more convincing evidence of the link between women ’s progress and economic progress could be found .
At the foreign aid conference , Phil Evans , the senior social development adviser for the United Kingdom ’s U.N. mission , said that statistical gender analyses are often riddled with " methodological problems , " in large part because researchers have focused on studying women instead of placing them in a societal context .
Some say the United States should signal its commitment to gender equality by ratifying the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women , an international treaty that aims to outlaw discrimination against women and requires signatory countries to periodically report on their progress .
President Carter signed the treaty in 1980 but the U.S. Senate has not ratified it as 174 nations have done .
Ratifying the treaty would send a powerful signal that the United States will join the world to " use the instruments available to us to hold countries accountable " for improving women ’s lives , Geeta Rao Gupta , president of the Washington - based International Center for Research on Women , told legislative staff .
New Solutions in Afghanistan
In Afghanistan , USAID is attempting to deal with these challenges and its methods are not always very subtle .
To encourage families to educate their daughters , USAID gives extra rations of vegetable oil to girls who attend school every day for a month , Natsios said .
The number of girls attending school has increased overall from 6 percent to 35 percent , Natsios said , and is reaching 50 percent in some towns .
Not all of USAID ’s work in Afghanistan is so targeted at women and girls but Natsios said he has found that nearly every project is having an impact on women ’s status .
For instance , the U.S. program that is building a 300 - mile road from Kandahar to Kabul is unexpectedly improving women ’s health in southern Afghanistan .
Now mothers in childbirth and women in other forms of medical distress can be driven to medical facilities in Kabul in a matter of five to six hours .
Before the road was built , the trip could take two days , Natsios said .
In addition , USAID has installed day - care centers in all Afghan government ministry buildings .
Natsios said women who work for the ministries –many now widows with young children–said they would not return to their jobs unless their children had a safe place to go .
While many activists and government officials say gender issues are no longer seen as women ’s alone , they hope the next 30 years will bring a greater resolution to age - old problems .
" It has taken a very long time to get as far as we are and ( we ) have a very long road to go , " said Julia Taft , assistant administrator and director of the United Nation ’s Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery .
Lori Nitschke is a freelance journalist living in Washington , D.C. She was recently a Knight - Bagehot fellow at Columbia University in New York , where she received master ’s degrees in journalism and business administration .

Words are funny things ; while " quizzes " can be fun , the very similar " interrogations " usually are n't .
And interrogation is exactly what the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) has in mind for Bell Canada .
Late last week , the regulator issued a detailed set of " interrogatories " ( PDF ) complete with chart that must be filled in by May 29 .
The goal is to find out exactly how Bell 's deep packet inspection technology throttles traffic and the justifications for using it on all Bell traffic , even that sold at wholesale rates to smaller ISPs .
Anyone interested in these matters stands to learn plenty of interesting information 10 days from now .
One of the claims that Bell Canada makes in its defense is that 5 percent of users generate 60 percent of its total traffic and that 60 percent of this total traffic is P2P that is negatively impacting 95 percent of all customers ( did you follow that ? ) .
The CRTC wants to see the calculations , and it wants to Bell Canada to show its work .
" Provide full rationale and evidence in support of Bell Canada 's view that 95 percent of its customers were being negatively affected , " says the first of the CRTC interrogatories .
The list of questions goes on :
Explain in detail how the values for total traffic and P2P traffic during the peak period were determined .
The explanation should describe how measurements were carried out , indicating the period of time over which measurements were taken , what peak period was used , whether a single sample or an average of are multiple days ( indicate number of days ) was used
Describe all other approaches , if any , considered by Bell Canada as an alternative to shaping P2P traffic to address the network congestion it described , and explain why each approach was rejected .
Include a discussion of the conditions under which Bell Canada would augment its network capacity to address congestion
Provide data on the growth of traffic on Bell Canada 's network for supporting Internet access from 2004 to 2008 , indicating the mix of P2P and non -P2P traffic over time .
Further , describe to what extent Bell Canada has increased its network capacity to support the traffic growth
In paragraph 14 of its Answer , Bell Canada submitted that " the actual content of the packet is not examined , just the protocol headers encapsulating the content . "
Discuss whether the DPI technology deployed by Bell Canada has the capability to examine the content of the P2P traffic being shaped and to identify the sender and the intended recipient
Please fill this in and show your work
The gist of these questions is clear :
Bell has to detail the methodology behind these traffic claims , claims that are often put forward by both ISPs and DPI providers , but which generally do n't describe the way the information was gleaned .
In addition , the CRTC is going to take on the thorny question of when and how ISPs should be allowed to throttle and whether they are doing it in place of making necessary network upgrades .
And if that 's not enough , the regulator wants detailed information on Internet traffic growth that ISPs are generally reluctant to provide in much detail ( we took a look at the estimates last month ) .
Given all these meaty questions , it 's no wonder that CRTC head Konrad von Finckenstein said recently that the Bell Canada complaint " will have wide - ranging consequences and will lead to a much wider debate .
This will undoubtedly occupy much of our time this year . "
Michael Geist , who noted both the CRTC letter and Finckenstein 's comment , calls the plan " an aggressive timeline . "
A decision should be made within 90 days of the final June 26 comment date , by which point the FCC might finally have produced a ruling of its own in its investigation of comcast .
The CRTC has already refused to stop Bell 's throttling on an interim basis , but might well come to a different conclusion when the full process is complete .
Given the thoroughness of the questions and the interesting data called for in the interrogatories , the CRTC at least seems willing to give the matter real attention .
Between the Comcast case pending at the FCC and the Bell Canada case at the CRTC , 2008 could see a boom in seminal regulatory opinions on the use of DPI as a throttling technology .
To see how borders in the region have changed over the years click through the maps below : Palestine was among several former Ottoman territories placed under British control by the League of Nations .
The mandate lasted from 1920 to 1948 .
In 1923 , Britain granted limited autonomy to Transjordan , now known as Jordan .
The United Nations General Assembly proposed dividing Palestine into Jewish and Arab states , with Jerusalem as an international city .
The plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arabs and never implemented .
After Britain withdrew and the Jews declared the state of Israel , war broke out with neighbouring Arab nations .
Eight months later an armistice line was agreed , establishing the West Bank and Gaza Strip under the control of Jordan and Egypt .
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven out of what became Israel .
Israel made huge territorial gains in the Six - Day War .
It captured the West Bank - including East Jerusalem - Gaza Strip , Golan Heights and the whole Sinai Peninsula .
The Sinai was handed back to Egypt in the 1979 peace deal .
Since 1993 there have been several handovers of land to differing degrees of Palestinian control .
Jewish settlers in Gaza were withdrawn in 2005 but the West Bank is still dotted with settlements and a controversial barrier is being built there .

Henry is a burly man who speaks with a cultured British accent , a consequence of his upper class upbringing and his education in Nigeria 's private school system .
His mind is another interesting combination : the discipline of engineering , gained through his experience as an engineer in Nigeria 's merchant marine , and the believability of a successful salesman that used to sell handguns for personal protection door to door .
In short , it is a combination of attributes that made him the perfect guerrilla entrepreneur .
Since he moved with his family to the relative safety of South Africa in 2003 , Henry was able to accomplish the following .
He :
amassed a personal fortune through arms sales and oil bunkering in the Niger delta .
was able to orchestrate the shutdown of over a half a million barrels a day of Nigerian / Shell oil production for over two years , with a total market value of $ 29 billion -- a major reason why the global price of oil is currently over $ 100 a barrel today .
pioneered aspects of a system of warfare that will plague nation - states and their corporate allies for decades .
A Bazaar of Violence
Mercenary talent .
The evolution of local Delta politics took a turn for the worse at the turn of the century .
In order to stay in office , politicians began to employ young cult ( gang ) members as mercenary thugs to intimidate voters and opposition politicians .
However , when the politicians regained office , they threw the gang members back onto the street , forming a large pool of young mercenaries hungry for more easy income from violence .
The market that developed was fluid -- young violent men routinely hired themselves out to a cult on Saturday , to another gang on Monday and to a politician or wealthy individual on Thursday .
It was a mess , but Henry saw this pool of mercenary talent as an opportunity .
He hired them too , on an individual or group basis often through cell phone calls ( there is a weak cell phone signal across the entire Delta swamp ) , to assemble ad hoc guerrilla forces that could do his work in the Delta .
Since these gang members were only hired on an ad hoc basis , there was n't any organization for the government 's military and police forces to target .

Since these gang members were only hired on an ad hoc basis , there was n't any organization for the government 's military and police forces to target .
An Economic Engine .
To fund his guerrilla forces , Henry connected the Delta to a global marketplace .
To accomplish this , he set up a ecosystem of private entrepreneurs , many of whom were local politicians , to steal oil ( aka " bunker " ) from the pipelines of the major oil companies operating in the Delta .
Groups would siphon off barge loads of oil and ferry them out to Henry 's leased freighters waiting offshore ( which leveraged his experience with Nigeria 's merchant marine ) .
In return , the groups were given cash , top of the line western consumer products , and a huge number of weapons ( which leveraged Henry 's experience as an arms salesman ) from the best global manufacturers .
Billions of dollars in merchandise were exchanged through this simple system over the last few years .
The Delta is now awash in high end weaponry .

The Delta is now awash in high end weaponry .
A Popular Front .
With both the manpower and the economics in place , Henry was now able to fight a war .
However , to accomplish this he needed a front , an organizational facade for his virtual organization .
The result was the establishment of the MEND ( Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta ) .
Henry was able to establish this organizational front through e-mails , from the safety of his home in South Africa and under the pseudonym of Jomo Gbomo , to global news organizations that set claims against the government and its corporate allies ( global oil companies , particularly Shell , which had been accused of massive pollution ) and actions ( through the public announcement of attacks minutes after they occurred ) .
QUICK NOTE : it 's likely that he saved the life of the journalist Sebastian Junger through timely cell phone call to the violent group that was holding him , during Sebastian 's ill advised field trip to the Delta .
His main method of attack was pure systems disruption .
Oil pipelines were sabotaged on a routine basis , through attacks on pumping stations and oil platforms .
Western expat oil workers were taken hostage to drive the global oil companies permanently out of contested areas .
The result was an average of 400,000 to 600,000 barrels a day of lost production for the Nigerian government ( primarily Shell ) -- nearly a quarter of all Nigerian production .
The intent of this activity was to hollow out the Nigerian state by depriving it of income , driving away its corporate allies , and creating a temporary autonomous zone ( aka chaos ) in the Delta ( due to a proliferation of violence and copycat attacks by other groups ) .
Nigeria is a mess , due to the combination of legions of legendarily corrupt politicians , buckets of oil money , and vast pools of neglected citizens .
The Niger Delta , the wellspring of Nigeria 's oil wealth , is particularly messy .
It 's where people , abandoned by their government , are living at a minimal subsistence level just outside the fences of the major oil company compounds , which sport European levels of convenience and lifestyle for their expatriate employees .
As a result , it 's little wonder that the Delta 's political environment is a swirling maelstrom of local actors -- from tribal chiefs to gangs ( " cults " in the local parlance of the Delta ) to politicians -- all competing for a tiny slice of the Delta 's abundant oil wealth , most of which flows into the hands of corrupt politicians / military leaders in Lagos and the coffers of global oil companies .
Henry , energized by the grinding poverty he saw when he visited his family 's ancestral village in the Delta , sought to reverse this flow : away from the capital and the oil companies and into the hands of the people of the Delta .
However , in order to do this , Henry had to innovate with warfare .
Here 's how he did it :
What this Means
Superempowerment .
Henry is a global demonstration of what a superempowered individual can do in warfare : from creating a global criminal economic ecosystem to coordinating guerrilla attacks via cell phone to building a global brand ( MEND ) via e-mail .
.

Emergence .
Henry established a funded open source war , populated by a host of violent groups and independent contractors , against the Nigerian government and the global oil companies operating in the region .
Given the fluidity of this networked organizational form , it is likely a replacement ( or replacements ) for Henry will emerge soon .

Systems Disruption
It proves that the disruption of systems , rather than mass casualty attacks , can create a global brand for a militant organization .
Also , given the demonstration of the leverage involved ( attacks costing hundreds of thousands generated nearly $ 30 billion in disruption ) that a low cost expansion of the technique could destroy the economic foundation of an entire state .
Henry was arrested in February 2008 while in Angola to purchase arms and equipment .
He has since been extradited to Nigeria where he is being held by authorities under the charge that he is Jomo Gbomo .
However , despite his capture , the innovations he pioneered will live on in the following ways : Legal Note : if Henry is n't Jomo as the government claims , please disregard the use of Henry 's name throughout this entire brief ( although this is unlikely since MEND released the promotional photo of Henry featured above and has started a global media campaign for his release ) ;->
The information has families like the Wylers talking about some of polygamy ’s best - kept secrets .
Who would have guessed , for instance , that Wendell Nielsen , a high - ranking sect official with family here , had 21 wives in Texas , too ?
Or that he has 35 children on top of those here ?
As law enforcement officials from Utah and Arizona prepare for what they expect to be a capacity crowd town - hall - style meeting on polygamy on Thursday  planned north of here in St. George , Utah , before the Texas raid but now proceeding with an added urgency  polygamist gossip is only one of the many consequences of the raid that they are encountering .
Rumors of an imminent Texas - style police crackdown  the authorities say none is contemplated  are among the new constants of life here , the historic heartland of the F.L.D.S.
Some polygamists , who had considered moving to Texas , are putting down roots again here , even cooperating with the authorities .
Others are speaking out publicly , trying to distinguish their forms of plural marriage ( no under - age brides ) from what the authorities say was practiced by the sect in Texas .
“ Polygamy is not the problem , ” said Marlyne Hammon , who belongs to a group called The Work of Jesus Christ , which practices polygamy in a town just a few miles from here .
Ms. Hammon , of Centennial Park , Ariz. , said child brides had no place in her group ’s faith or practice .
“ This is about human error , not polygamy , ” she said .
Fierce winds of change  from national political attitudes about polygamy to new economic stress and even down to the personal decisions about where to live in a post - Eldorado world  are buffeting the polygamist faithful .
Quirks mode and strict mode
Quirks mode and strict mode are the two ’ modes ’ modern browsers can use to interpret your CSS .
This page gives a short overview of the reasons for and the differences between these two modes .
The problem
When Netscape 4 and IE 4 implemented CSS , their support did not match the W3C standard ( or , indeed , each other ) .
Netscape 4 had horribly broken support .
IE 4 came far closer to the standard , but did n’t implement it with complete correctness either .
Although IE 5 Windows mended quite a lot of IE 4 bugs , it perpetuated other glitches in CSS ( mainly the box model ) .
To make sure that their websites rendered correctly in the various browsers , web developers had to implement CSS according to the wishes of these browsers .
Thus , most websites used CSS in ways that did n’t quite match the specifications .
Therefore , when standards compliancy became important browser vendors faced a tough choice .
Moving closer to the W3C specifications was the way to go , but if they ’d just change the CSS implementations to match the standards perfectly , many websites would break to a greater or lesser extent .
Existing CSS would start to show odd side effects if it were suddenly interpreted in the correct way .
So moving closer to standards compliance would cause problems .
On the other hand , not moving closer to standards compliance would perpetuate the general confusion of the Browser Wars Era .
The solution
Therefore any solution to this problem had to
allow web developers who knew their standards to choose which mode to use .
continue displaying old pages according to the old ( quirks ) rules .
In other words , all browsers needed two modes : quirks mode for the old rules , strict mode for the standard .
IE Mac was the first browser to implement the two modes , and IE Windows 6 , Mozilla , Safari , and Opera followed suit .
IE 5 Windows , as well as older browsers like Netscape 4 , are permanently locked in quirks mode .
Choosing which mode to use requires a trigger , and this trigger was found in ’ doctype switching ’ .
According to the standards , any ( X) HTML document should have a doctype which tells the world at large which flavour of ( X ) HTML the document is using .
Old pages written before ( or in spite of ) the standardization wave do n’t have a doctype .
Therefore ’ no doctype ’ would mean quirks mode : show according to old rules .
Contrarily , if the web developer was savvy enough to include a doctype , he probably knew what he was doing .
Therefore most doctypes trigger strict mode : show according to pure standards .
Any new or unknown doctype triggers strict mode .
The problem was that some pages written in quirks mode did have doctypes .
Therefore each browser has its own list with doctypes that trigger quirks mode .
See this browser comparison chart for an overview of these lists .
Note that your page does not have to validate according to the chosen doctype , the mere presence of the doctype tag is enough to trigger strict mode .
On this site I use this doctype in most pages .
In addition to declaring my pages XHTML 1.0 Transitional , it also triggers almost strict mode in all browsers .
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd " >
Good solution ?
Personally I ’m not terribly happy with doctype switching .
A doctype carries information about the flavour of ( X) HTML you ’re using , in other words , about document structure .
In my opinion it should n’t carry any information about document presentation , because that violates the separation of structure and presentation that CSS is all about .
But the browser vendors were not to be denied : browser after browser implemented doctype switching , and nowadays all modern browsers support it .
Complication : almost strict mode
In the early days , experiments with strict mode invariably raised the comment that images suddenly got an odd bottom margin that could n’t be removed .
The cause was that in strict mode < img /> is an inline element , which means that some space should be reserved for possible descender characters like g , j , or q .
Of course an image does n’t have descender characters , so the space was never used , but it still had to be reserved .
The solution was to explicitly declare images block level elements : img {display : block} .
Nonetheless browser vendors , Mozilla especially , thought this was such a confusing situation that they introduced " almost strict mode " .
This was defined as strict mode , but with images continuing to be blocks , and not inline elements .
Most common doctypes , including the one I use , trigger almost strict mode .
The treatment of images is by far the most important difference between almost strict mode and really strict mode .
IE Windows special : the xml prolog
In IE 6 Windows , Microsoft implemented one extra rule : if a doctype that triggers strict mode is preceded by an xml prolog , the page shows in quirks mode .
This was done to allow web developers to achieve valid pages ( which require a doctype ) but nonetheless stay in quirks mode .
This is the xml prolog .
You should put it on the very first line of your document , before the doctype .
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " iso -8859 -1 " ?>
Note that this behaviour has been removed from IE 7 .
The differences
What , exactly , are the differences between the two modes ?
There are a few more differences that can trip up the unwary web developer .
The table below summarizes a few of the most important ones .
IE Quirks Mode is IE5.5 , by the way .
IE6 , 7 and 8 all switch back to 5.5 when they encounter a Quirks Mode page .
Always Always supports standard Never Never supports standard Depends Standards support depends on rendering mode ; see text for details

Print this article Surveying and geometry Tradition has it that geometry ( literally , earth - measurement ) began when the ancient Egyptians had to re-establish boundary lines between fields after the annual floods of the Nile ; the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization still recommends using a ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) triangle to set out right angles in survey work , a procedure that may well go back to the pharaohs .
Today , surveyors continue to make explicit use of plane geometry and trigonometry on a day - to - day basis .
Along with their seafaring cousins , the navigators , they may be the most geometrical of all professions .
My plan in this column is to sample some of the more elementary current surveying procedures from a mathematical point of view , using The Surveying Handbook ( edited by Russel Brinker and Roy Minnick , Van Nostrand Reinhold , New York , 1987 ) as my source .
It must be noted that at least one mathematician was a world - class surveyor .
Laplace had advised the Académie des Sciences in 1791 on a new survey of the Paris meridian from Dunkerque to Barcelona ( in order to establish the exact size of the earth and hence the length of the meter ; the French Revolution had washed away , along with the traditional divisions of land , the units that had measured them ) .
But Gauss himself conducted a survey of the state of Hanover between 1821 and 1825 , and continued to direct work on refinements of the grid .
One of the nine volumes of his collected works is entirely devoted to geodesy .
A detail of the triangulation of Hanover carried out under Gauss 's supervision between 1820 and 1850 .
The pink lines are part of the Hauptsystem ( main system ) laid out by Gauss himself in 1821 - 1825 .
Collected Works , Volume 9 , p. 347 .
What is surveying ?
According to the American Society of Civil Engineers , surveying is ( in part ) " The science and art of making all essential measurements in space to determine the relative positions of points and / or physical and cultural details above , on or beneath the earth 's surface and to depict them in usable form . "
The words " in space " are significant : surveying is an outdoor activity .
Surveyors can work on a small scale ( accurately siting the corners of a building on its plot ) or a very large one ( charting the path of a proposed highway ) but their work always involves measurements in the field .
Some theorems in plane geometry
One essential surveying task is " to prolong a straight line forward from an existing point . "
This is part of marking out on the terrain what will be a straight line on the map .
If all points are visible from the starting point , line of sight may be used .
But suppose a line has been drawn from point A to point B ( in sight ) , and must be extended beyond B to a point visible from B but out of sight of A .
Here is the procedure : move the transit ( the surveyor 's telescope ) to B , backsight on A , " plunge " the transit ( rotate it forwards in a vertical plane ) and sight a new point C .
This procedure requires two surveyors , one to look through the telescope and one to move a marker until it lines up with the telescope 's axis ; once executed it can be repeated to extend a line over hill and dale .
Extending a line over irregular terrain .
To extend the line AB to a point out of sight of A : 1 .
Transit is positioned at B and back - sighted at A. 2 . Transit is " plunged " ( rotated in vertical plane ) to point forwards in terrain .
3 . Point C is established in new transit line of sight .
The plunging , although described in the Handbook only as " more accurate " than turning 180o horizontally is in fact fundamental , since a straight line on the earth 's surface is the intersection of that surface with a vertical plane ( i.e. a plane passing through the center of the earth ) , in other words a segment of a great circle .
When the line needs extending through an obstruction , some more geometry comes into play .
From the Handbook : " The transit is set up at B and deflection angle α , no larger than needed to clear the obstruction , is turned to locate C. Point C is occupied and an angle 2α is turned in the opposite direction from the first angle .
D is established on the resulting prolongation of AB at the same distance as BC .
Occupying D and turning a deflection angle α in the same direction as angle B produces line ABD ahead to E. "
To extend line AB beyond an obstruction : 1 . Find appropriate point C at angle α from AB direction .
2 . Turn angle - 2α at C and locate point D such that CD = BC .
3 . Turn angle α at D to locate E and extension of original line .
The collinearity of A , B , D and E follows from two theorems in plane geometry .
The first ( equivalent in fact to the parallel postulate ) states that in a triangle each exterior angle is equal to the sum of the other two interior angles .
The line AB extended through B must meet CD ( since they make different angles with BC , they are not parallel ) , say at some point D ' .
The theorem guarantees that triangle BCD ' has equal base angles ; therefore , by a second theorem , the two opposite sides are also equal , so CD ' = BC = CD and D' = D , so A , B , D are collinear .
The mirror - image argument shows that B , D , E are collinear , and so all four points are .
The Handbook goes on to say that distance BD may be calculated as 2 BC cos α. Lengths and angles A typical survey results in a map ( also called " a survey " ) : a 2 - dimensional representation of part of the earth 's surface .
A map being flat shows all points on the same level ; but the surface of the earth is rarely flat .
I am not referring here to the curvature of the earth -- which large - scale surveys must take into account -- but to the local ups and downs that every cyclist is aware of .
One of the jobs of the surveyor is to convert measurements taken on the undulating actual surface of the planet into data that represent positions on the ideal , perfectly level plane of the survey .
As the Handbook remarks , " Considerable practice is required for field personnel to do accurate taping in hilly or rolling terrain . "
This is the first place where trigonometry is mentioned in the Handbook .
" In reducing slope measurements to their horizontal lengths , ... , a correction must be applied to the measured distance equal to the difference between the hypotenuse l and side d of a right triangle having its vertical side h . "
Sometimes the height difference h between two points can be measured directly .
In that case the correction is given as C h = h2/2l + h4/8l3 .
At other times the only possible measurement is the inclination from the horizontal of the line between the points ; in terms of this angle α ( the " vertical angle " ) the correction is C h = l ( 1 - cos α ) .
Correction for slope : the tape measurement l of the distance from A to B is corrected to give the horizontal distance d between them by subtracting a correction term C h given either in terms of the height difference h between the two points or in terms of the angle α between the tape and the horizontal .
The first expression for C h = l - d uses the Pythagorean Theorem : l - d = l - ( l2 - h2)1/2 = l - l( 1 - ( h / l ) 2) 1/2 and Newton 's binomial expansion ( 1 - x ) 1/2 = 1 - x/2 - x2/8 + ... with x = ( h / l ) 2 to yield C h = h2/2l + h4/8l3 .
The second uses the right - triangle definition of cosine : cos α = d/l , so d=l cos α.
Trigonometry also enters into the measurement of distances when the operation is carried out optically , using stadia lines .
This procedure is called stadia tacheometry ( or tachymetry ) , referring to the speed with which it can be carried out .
To measure the distance from point A to point B , the surveyor at A focuses a telescope equipped with stadia lines on a graduated vertical rule held by the surveyor at B .
The stadia lines are two short horizontal lines drawn above and below a central horizontal line in the focal plane of the telescope ; these lines appear superimposed on the image and intersect a length S ( " the stadia intercept " ) on the rule held at B , which can be read off by the observer .
The distance between the stadia lines is such that if the observation is made horizontally , the distance D between A and B is 100 times the stadia intercept : D = 100 S. Similar triangles give the geometrical basis for this procedure : the stadia lines are mounted in the telescope so that the distance s between them is 1/100 of their distance d to the eyepiece .
The similar triangles in the diagram yield that the ratio D/S between the distance D to the measuring rod and the observed stadia distance S must equal the ratio d/s = 100 .
Hence D = 100S .
Now suppose stadia tacheometry is carried out on a slope .
The angle α of the slope between points A and B will affect the stadia intercept .
In the slanted perspective , points on the rule seem closer to each other than they are , so the apparent stadia intercept is too large ; multiplying it by a factor of cos α has the same effect as turning the rule to be perpendicular to the line of sight , and corrects the distortion due to the angle .
The straight - line distance from A to B is then D =100 S cos α.
The horizontal distance from A to B will require an additional factor of cos α , as above , while the vertical distance is given by h = 100 S cos α sin α = 100 S ( 1/2 ) sin 2α , as recorded in the Handbook .
Areas From the Handbook : " Land is ordinarily bought and sold on a basis of cost per unit area .
For this reason as well as many others , an accurate determination of tract area is often necessary . "
The surveyor measures angles and distances .
Once a " closed traverse " has been accomplished , i.e. a series of line segments that comes back to its initial point , the enclosed area ( the " traverse area " ) may be computed .
The Handbook explains three methods : the DMD method ( for Double Meridian Distance ) , the coordinate method ( both of these require a rectangular coordinate system ) , and the measurement of area by planimeter .
The DMD method .
First some terminology :
The latitude of a line segment is " its orthographic projection onto the north - south axis of the survey .
North latitudes are considered positive , south latitudes negative " its departure makes analogous use of the east - west axis .
In the DMD method we associate to each segment of the traverse its meridian distance : the perpendicular distance from its midpoint to the north - south axis .
The DMD method calculates the traverse area by mutliplying the latitude and meridian distance of each line in the traverse , summing those products , and taking the absolute value of the sum .
( The Handbook uses the double meridian distance , somewhat handier to calculate from the departures of consecutive lines , and then divides by 2 at the end ; hence the name DMD ) .
The latitude of line AB is minus the length of ab , since the line runs south .
Hence the product of its latitude and its meridian distance is minus the area of the trapezoid ABba .
On the other hand line EF runs north , so its latitude is ( plus ) the length of ef , and the product : latitude times meridian distance is equal to the area of the trapezoid EFfe .
When the trapezoid areas are added with their signs , the total gives exactly the area enclosed by the traverse .
If the computation had proceded clockwise ( e.g. AFEDCBA ) , or if the traverse had been west of the north - south axis of the survey , the total would have given minus the area .
The absolute value built into the procedure takes care of that minus sign .
The coordinate method .
This method uses ( x , y ) coordinates for all the corners in the traverse .
The procedure is " to multiply the x-coordinate of each corner by the difference between adjacent y- coordinates , add the resulting products , and take half the absolute value of the sum . "
The Handbook gives the formula : A = [ x 1 ( y 2 - y n ) + x 2 ( y 3 - y 1 ) + ... + x n (y 1 - y n - 1 ) ] / 2 . The expression for A may be rewritten , by rearranging the terms , A = ( x 1 y 2 - x 2 y 1 ) /2 + ( x 2 y 3 - x 3 y 2 ) /2 + ... + ( x n y 1 - x 1 y n ) / 2 . Suppose the corners of the traverse are A = ( x 1 , y 1 ) , B = ( x 2 , y 2 ) , etc .
Then the expression x 1 y 2 - x 2 y 1 is the vector cross - product A x B ; the cross- product is twice the area of the triangle OAB , and is positive if the smallest turning from A to B is counter - clockwise .
Our rewritten expression for A is ( A x B ) / 2 + ( B x C ) / 2 + ... ( F x A ) / 2 in this example .
The contribution from AB is positive , since B is counter - clockwise from A ; but the contribution from DE will be negative , since E is clockwise from D .
When the triangle areas are added with their signs , the total gives the area enclosed by the traverse .
The Handbook recommends writing all the corner coordinates in a rectangular array thus : x 1 x 2 x 3 ... x n- 1 x n
y 1 y 2 y 3 ... y n- 1 y n
taking the sum determinantwise of all the downward diagonal products ( including x n y 1 ) , subtracting the sum of all the upward diagonal products ( including y n x 1 ) , and dividing by 2 .
The planimeter method .
This method will be discussed more in detail in next month 's column .
Here let me remark that the underlying mathematics is directly related to the coordinate method .
Suppose we want to evaluate the area enclosed by a traverse given parametrically as x = f ( t ) , y = g(t ) , for t running from a to b , with f( a ) = f( b ) and g( a ) = g( b ) .
We can approximate the curve with an n-segment polygonal line by taking Δt = ( b - a ) /n , setting t 0 = a , t 1 = a +
Δt , t 2 = a + 2 Δt , ... t n = a +n
Δt = b , and considering the traverse with corners at ( f( t i ) , g(t i ) ) , i = 1 ... n ( note that 0 and n give the same corner ) and with enclosed area A n .
The Handbook 's formula for the polygonal area gives ( distributing the 1/2 ) A n = [ f (t 1 ) [ g(t 2 ) - g(t n ) ] / 2 + [ f (t 2 ) [ g(t 3 ) - g(t 1 ) ] / 2 + ... + [ f (t n ) [ g(t 1 ) - g(t n - 1 ) ] / 2 . In the i-th term , the factor [ g(t i+1 ) - g(t i - 1 ) ] / 2 can be written , as a first order approximation , as [ g '(t i ) ( 2 Δt ) ] / 2 , giving A n approximately as f(t 1 ) g'(t 1 ) Δt + ... + f(t n ) g '( t n ) Δt .
In the limit as n goes to infinity these sums converge to the integral which planimeters are designed to compute .
Volumes
Often in construction projects large quantities of material must be excavated at one place ( a " borrow pit " ) to be filled in at another .
The Handbook gives a procedure for estimating the amount of material that has been removed :
The surveyors set up a horizontal grid over the area to be excavated ( grid lines lines are typically 30 or 40 feet apart ) .
Height measurements in feet are made at all the grid points before and after the excavation .
The points are labelled 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 according to the number of grid rectangles they abut , and the volume estimate is given schematically by the formula V = ( A/4 ) ( Σ h 1 + 2Σ h 2 + 3Σ h 3 + 4Σ h 4 ) where A is the area of a grid rectangle , and Σ h 1 represents the sum of all the height differences coming from grid points abutting only 1 square , Σ h 2 is the sum coming from points abutting 2 squares , etc .
The Handbook 's formula has an extra 27 in the denominator to give a result in cubic yards .
The volume over the grid is estimated as a sum of " prisms " obtained by linear interpolation between the four heights given at the corners of each grid square .
The use of these prisms is a 3 - dimensional analogue of the trapezoid rule for estimating integrals of functions of one variable .
Each one has volume V = A(z 1 + z 2 + z 3 + z 4 ) / 4 , where A is the area of the base and z 1 , z 2 , z 3 , z 4 are the heights at the four corners .
When the volumes of all the prisms are summed up , each corner height z i will occur once for each prism that its edge abuts , so 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 times according to the position of its base point in the grid , leading to the formula in the Handbook .
Next month , Bill Casselman will have Part II of the mathematics of surveying .

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has threatened to stop selling oil to European countries if they apply a new ruling on illegal immigrants that has been condemned by human rights groups .
European Union lawmakers ruled on Wednesday ( local time ) that illegal immigrants can be detained for up to 18 months and face a re-entry ban of up to five years .
" We ca n't just stand by with our arms crossed , " Mr Chavez said at an event to celebrate his OPEC country 's oil supplies to South America .
The socialist ally of Cuba also warned he could review the investment of European Union nations that apply the measure .
He did not elaborate .
Mr Chavez has regularly issued conditional threats to halt crude shipments from Venezuela , one of the world 's largest exporters of oil , although he has never followed through on a move that would hurt supplies at a time of record prices .

Upgrade issues
This section lists ( potential ) upgrade issues that may need to be documented .
[ sparc ] 2.6.26 kernel does not work with X. Org 7.0/7.1 , but should work with 7.3 ; see lkml
On system with nfs , nfs - common MUST be upgraded before mount see # 493095
As of 2.6.25 ( and still in 2.6.26 in lenny ) , megraid_mbox kernel panics if you have non-RAID devices on the PERC3 / DC RAID controller and possibly other Dell PERC3 models , see # 490903
Upgrading over ssh when the connection is managed by NetworkManager can lead the upgrade failing / hanging when the NetworkManager service is restarted .
If you are lucky , the ssh connection will not drop out ; if you are unlucky , the ssh connection will drop out and at the next interactive point in the upgrade ( e.g. dpkg " replace this file " or debconf ) the entire upgrade is left in a horrible state .
bind9 no longer allows recursive queries by default ; you may need to add allow - query { any ; } ; to named .
conf to get the previous behavior .
There are also many configuration file changes ; see LennyBind9 for details .
lprng no longer listens on a TCP socket by default ; you may need to add lpd_listen_port=515 to lpd.conf to get the previous behavior .
For certain network interfaces , the means of specifying speed / duplex settings may change .
You may need to install the ethtool package and use it in place of mii-tool in some setups .
courier - imap logins may fail with the ( incorrect ) error message " Account 's mailbox directory is not owned by the correct uid or gid " , which can be prevented by setting IMAP_MAILBOX_SANITY_CHECK to 0 in /etc / courier / imapd .
Notes
a good start would be to review the programs in default tasks + the most installed programs not in tasks .
New hardware support ; new modules ?
The layout for this page can have two axes .
We 'll have to figure out how to write it down at some point :
New vs dropped feature :
New stuffs ( especially those with high popcon count !)
Improved stuff since Etch .
Dropped stuffs Deprecated stuffs Changes in DFSGfreeness - alpine , openjdk , djbdns , ttf - liberation in main
Categories Infrastructure , Organization , etc. Architectures .
Software Theoretically , we should focus on user features ( i.e sysadmin feature ) .
However , considering our audience , we should include a few word on technologies Common software ( kernel ) Server oriented software .
Desktop oriented software .
Developer features ( esp. DD ? ) .
Other features ( embedded , etc. ) Miscellaneous ( the last but not the least ) : Debian Installer , Debian Live , LSB , CDD

A nuclear device detonated near the White House would kill roughly 100,000 people and flatten downtown federal buildings , while the radioactive plume from the explosion would likely spread toward the Capitol and into Southeast D.C. , contaminating thousands more .
The blast from the 10 - kiloton bomb — similar to the bomb dropped over Hiroshima during World War II — would kill up to one in 10 tourists visiting the Washington Monument and send shards of glass flying the length of the National Mall , in a scenario that has become increasingly likely to occur in a major U.S. city in recent years , panel members told a Senate committee yesterday .
“ It ’s inevitable , ” said Cham E. Dallas , director of the Institute for Health Management and Mass Destruction Defense at the University of Georgia , who has charted the potential explosion ’s effect in the District and testified before a hearing of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs .
“ I think it ’s wistful to think that it wo n’t happen by 20 years . ”
The Senate committee has convened a series of hearings to examine the threat and effects of a terrorist nuclear attack on a U.S. city , as well as the needed response .
Yesterday ’s panel stressed the importance of state and local cooperation with federal authorities in the wake of an attack , assistance from the private business sector to aid recovery and the dire need to boost the capabilities of area hospitals .
They recommended expanding emergency personnel by training physicians like pharmacists and dentists to aid in all - hazards care , monitoring the exposure of first responders to radiation and clearly disseminating information to the public .
“ The scenarios we discuss today are very hard for us to contemplate , and so emotionally traumatic and unsettling that it is tempting to push them aside , ” said Sen .
Joe Lieberman , Connecticut independent and committee chairman .
“ However , now is the time to have this difficult conversation , to ask the tough questions , and then to get answers as best we can and take preparatory and preventive action . ”
Ashton B. Carter , co-director of the Preventive Defense Project at Harvard University , said the likelihood of a nuclear attack on U.S. soil is undetermined , but it has increased with the proliferation of weapons by Iran and North Korea and the failure to secure Russia ’s nuclear arsenal following the Cold War .
“ For while the probability of a nuclear weapon one day going off in a U.S. city cannot be calculated , it is almost surely larger than it was five years ago , ” Mr. Carter said .
Mr. Carter described a more destructive blast effect .
He said the ground - based detonation of a 10 - kiloton bomb would result in near - total devastation within a circle about two miles in diameter , or the length of the Mall .
The zone of destruction is projected to be less than that of Hiroshima , where the bomb was dropped from an airplane and detonated above the city .
A similar blast in a more densely populated city than the District , such as Chicago or New York , would result in an injury toll up to eight times higher .
A plume a few miles long could also dole out lethal doses of radiation , Mr. Carter said .
However , the experts emphasized that the explosion would not impact most of a major city and that in many cases , residents could remain safe by not evacuating immediately and clogging area roadways .
“ It is also expected that , due to lack of information getting to the public , many people will try to flee by car or on foot , often in the wrong direction , again exposing themselves to high levels of radiation , as vehicles provide virtually no protection , ” Mr. Carter said .
Mr. Dallas said a major problem facing most cities is a lack of available hospital beds for victims of burns that would result from a nuclear blast .
He said up to 95 percent of such victims would not receive potentially life - saving care .
“ We ’re completely underprepared , ” he said .
“ Most of them will die . ”
Mr. Dallas said the District also faces a unique challenge because of the way the city is configured geographically : A wind blowing west to east would gradually spread radiation from the explosion into the low - income neighborhoods of Southeast , where there are limited health care options available and only one hospital .
Area officials have spent millions of dollars in recent years to develop evacuation plans and stockpile emergency supplies after a 2006 study by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said local preparation for a disaster was “ not sufficient . ”
Darrell L. Darnell , director of the District ’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency , said the city is continuing to develop its “ emergency preparedness capabilities ” and has numerous methods of informing residents of actions they should take , including through text messages , voice alerts and Web sites like www.dc.gov and https://72hours.dc.gov.
“ We are confident that the District is prepared to respond to a catastrophic incident affecting the District , ” Mr. Darnell said .
Still , Mr. Dallas said the majority of victims in a nuclear explosion will likely have to fend for themselves in the first hours after an attack .
“ These people are going to be on their own , ” he said after the hearing .
“ There ’s no white horse to ride to the rescue . ”

He noted , however , that he had not worked on his idea for several decades and that he was taken by surprise when he was contacted by the Hewlett - Packard researchers several months ago .
The advance clearly points the way to a prediction made in 1959 by the physicist Richard Feynman that “ there ’s plenty of room at the bottom , ” referring to the possibility of building atomic - scale systems .
“ I can see all kinds of new technologies , and I ’m thrilled , ” he said .
The original theoretical work done by Mr. Chua was laid out in a paper , “ Memristor  The Missing Circuit Element . ”
The paper argued that basic electronic theory required that in addition to the three basic circuit elements  resistors , capacitors and inductors  a fourth element should exist .
The Hewlett - Packard research team titled their paper , “ The Missing Memristor Found . ”
The Hewlett - Packard researchers said that the discovery of the memory properties in tiny , extremely thin spots of titanium dioxide came from a frustrating decade - long hunt for a new class of organic molecules to serve as nano - sized switches .
Researchers in both industry and academia have hoped they would be able to fashion switches as small as the size of a single molecule to someday replace transistors once the semiconductor industry ’s shrinking of electronic circuits made with photolithographic techniques reached a technological limit .
The memristor is a radically different approach from another type of solid state storage called phase - change memory that is being pursued by I.B.M. , Intel and other companies .
In phase - change memory , heat is used to shift a glassy material from an amorphous to a crystalline state and back again .
The switching speed of these systems is both slower and requires more power , according to the Hewlett - Packard scientists .
The Hewlett - Packard team has successfully created working circuits based on memristors that are as small as 15 nanometers ( the diameter of an atom is roughly about a tenth of a nanometer . )
Ultimately , it will be possible to make memristors as small as about four nanometers , Mr. Williams said .
In contrast the smallest components in today ’s semiconductors are 45 nanometers , and the industry currently does not see a way to shrink those devices below about 20 nanometers .
Because the concept of a memristor was developed almost 40 years ago by Mr. Chua , it is in the public domain .
The Hewlett - Packard scientists , however , have applied for patents covering their working version of the device .
The most significant limitation that the Hewlett - Packard researchers said the new technology faces is that the memristors function at about one - tenth the speed of today ’s DRAM memory cells .
They can be made in the same kinds of semiconductor factories that the chip industry now uses , however .
Extraterrestrials will probably never ‘ phone ’
Earth in a way we ’d understand as they ’re unlikely to have evolved human - like intelligence – but that does n’t mean we should give up the search for life beyond our planet , an ANU expert will argue today .
In an address at The Australian National University , planetary astronomer Dr Charley Lineweaver will review the major patterns of the evolution of life on Earth .
He ’ll make the case that as no other organism on the planet has evolved intelligence closely matching that of humans , it ’s highly improbable that an extraterrestrial life form would think like we do or have developed technologies similar to ours .
“ If human - like intelligence were so useful , we should see many independent examples of it in biology , and we could cite many creatures who had involved on independent continents to inhabit the ‘ intelligence niche ' .
But we can ’t .
Human - like intelligence seems to be what its name implies – species specific , ” says Dr Lineweaver , who works at the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at ANU .
Dr Lineweaver will dispute the argument that a general trend towards larger brains in some animals is evidence that there is a natural evolutionary tendency towards being smart , as we human understand the concept .
“ The fossil record on Earth strongly suggests that human - like intelligence is not a convergent feature of evolution – something that all forms of life would attain given enough time .
Instead humans are unique , just like every other species . . ”
Despite doubting that human - like intelligence could evolve on other planets , Dr Lineweaver believes that humans should continue the search for extraterrestrial life .
“ I am a strong supporter of SETI [ search for extraterrestrial intelligence ] – because I may be wrong about how the evidence is best interpreted , and because SETI is relatively cheap science .
SETI is the exploration of new parameter space with new instruments – a proven recipe for scientific discovery .
However , we do not need to misinterpret the fossil record to justify this inspiring research . ”

A coroner has charged an American tourist with murdering his newly wed wife while diving at the Great Barrier Reef .
Christina Mae Watson , a 26 - year - old novice diver from Alabama , drowned while diving near a shipwreck in October 2003 with her husband of 11 days , David Gabriel Watson , known as Gabe .
Final submissions to the long - running inquest were heard in a Townsville court yesterday , with police alleging there was enough evidence to charge Mr Watson with murder .
An artist concept of the solar sail .
The center package contains the solar panels powering an electron gun that keeps the many tethers charged .
This story was updated at 4:51 p.m. EDT .
An electrically - charged solar sail with a possible " turbo " option may be ready for its first space trials in three yearsif scientists in Finland have their way .
The Finnish invention would use long , positively - chargedtethers to ride the solar wind , without the need for any sort of fuel orpropellant .
" A flight out of the solar system to measure the gas , dust , plasma and magnetic field in the undisturbed interstellar space wouldperhaps be the ' flagship ' thing to do , " said PekkaJanhunen , a researcher developing the sail at the Finnish Meteorological Institute .
The solar sail 's debut would involve a smaller model with 5 - mile ( 8 - km ) long tethers riding in a high elliptical Earth orbit .
That would allowJanhunen and others to gauge the force of the solar wind on the spacecraft withan accelerometer .
" The mission would validate and calibrate our theoryand enable us to design full - scale missions with accurate and experimentallyverified numbers for predicted thrust , " Janhunen added .
Two solar panels would power an electron gun that keeps thespacecraft tethers charged , creating propulsion from the similarly chargedsolar wind pushing against the sail .
Researchers are looking into aluminum orcopper alloy wires for the tethers .
The maiden mission would also test a concept to increase thethrust from the solar wind , called radio frequency electron heating .
The subscale mission would also test a " turbo " charge for the solar sail .
Radio - frequency waves could excite the solar windparticles through electron heating , which might boost the thrust created .
Theconcept is difficult to simulate or analyze in theory , but should be easy totest in space , according to Janhunen .
Whether the first test gets off the ground depends onsecuring almost $ 8 million USD ( 5 million euros ) .
Researchers from Finland , Germany , Sweden , Russia , and Italy are currently developing various componentsof the solar sail .
Previous efforts to deploy and test solar sails foundereddue to launch failures and mishaps .
A joint Russian - U.S.effort in 2005 was doomed by rocketbooster failure less than two minutes after launch .
Two previous Russianefforts in 2001 and 1999 also failed , though Japan successfully deployed asmall solar sail prototype in 2004 .
Other sail concepts have suggested using microwavesbeamed from Earth to push spacecraft up to record speeds , instead of ridingthe solar wind .
However , a successful solar sail could have big payoffs bymaking deep space missions cheaper without fuel requirements .
A fleet of solarsail spacecraft could also significantly lower the cost of transportingmaterial within the solar system .
" Fetching water ice from asteroids to produce rocketpropellant on Earth orbit would probably be one sensible application of thatcapability , " Janhunen told SPACE.com .
" Producing rocket fuelon orbit means that one does n't have to lift it from Earth , which could makeall space activities cheaper - except for those in low - Earth orbit . "
Solar sails alone will not pave the way for further spaceexploration ?
other developments such as cheaper and more reusable launchvehicles are necessary .
But proving solar sail technology would help extendmankind 's reach into the solar system .
" Starting the long - awaited asteroid resource utilizationcould be significant for the longer - term well - being and survival of our civilizationon this planet , " Janhunen said .

Amici , un piccolo messaggio per dirvi che sto attraversando un periodo lavorativo tostissimo , al punto tale dal non riuscire a dedicare un attimo al blog ...
Ho finalmente iniziato a lavorare alla prima pagina del progetto del post precedente anche se lo faccio sempre nei ritagli di tempo cioè a notte inoltrata , dopo che ho terminato il lavoro urgente .
Sarò sincero , il blog mi manca molto anche perché , visto che ho trovato un editore che mi pubblicherà i Supereroi Decadence ( evviva ! ) , vorrei tanto portarli avanti , ma il tempo mi è veramente tirannissimo !
L'impegno settimanale con Disney mi assorbe molto , due / tre strip e alcuni disegni per i redazionali in una settimana non mi lasciano tanto tempo per fare altro .
Una cosa .
Al Cartoomics 2008 di Milano ci sarà una mia piccola mostra personale , se potete dargli un occhiata mi farà piacere .
Avrei tante altre cose che vorrei dirvi ma purtroppo non è il momento ... A breve però posterò una cosa nuova così ve ne parlerò .
Quando dico a breve intendo tra una settimana circa .
Risponderò ai vostri commenti nel post precedente , sappiate che il fatto che non rispoda non vuol dire che io non apprezzi quello che mi scrivete , ANZI !!!
Di questo non finirò mai di ringraziarvi !
A presto! Donald
The intensity of the violence added to the sense that insurgent and sectarian attacks had been on the rise in recent weeks .
Bush administration officials have said repeatedly that an increase in troop levels has reduced violence to the point that political and sectarian reconciliation is becoming a reality .
The administration has withdrawn some of the reinforcements and is assessing the effect of that reduction before withdrawing additional troops , a decision expected in the next week .
Recent statistics compiled by the Pentagon suggest that after dropping significantly last fall , the number of daily attacks remained static from November through January , the last month for which official figures were available .
And the relative calm has been pierced by a flare - up of violence in recent weeks .
No Americans were killed in the shelling on Sunday , officials said , but mortar shells that fell short of their target killed 13 Iraqis in neighborhoods east of the Green Zone .
The first attack , about 6 a.m. , sent thunderous booms echoing across the city , shaking buildings and rattling windows .

Although the source of the attacks could not be determined conclusively , two witnesses said the early - morning rounds were fired across the river from the Shiite - dominated Baladiyat neighborhood by militia men who the witnesses believed belonged to the Mahdi Army of the Shiite cleric Moktada al - Sadr .
Report : US continuing rendition secretly holding terror detainees in ' floating prisons '
Nick Juliano
Published : Monday June 2 , 2008

Print This Email This The United States has engaged in more than 200 new cases of extraordinary rendition since President Bush vowed to end the practice in 2006 and has operated more than a dozen secretive " floating prisons " aboard military ships at sea , according to a soon - to - be released report from an international human rights organization .
The secret capture , transportation and detention of suspected terrorists in foreign prisons has not abated , despite the uproar over its probable violation of international law , according to the report from human rights group Reprieve , which was noted in The Guardian Monday .
The detention of prisoners aboard military ships " is raising fresh concern and demand for inquiries " in the US and Great Britain , according to the paper .
Ships that are understood to have held prisoners include the USS Bataan and USS Peleliu .
A further 15 ships are suspected of having operated around the British territory of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean , which has been used as a military base by the UK and the Americans .
Reprieve will raise particular concerns over the activities of the USS Ashland and the time it spent off Somalia in early 2007 conducting maritime security operations in an effort to capture al - Qaida terrorists .
At this time many people were abducted by Somali , Kenyan and Ethiopian forces in a systematic operation involving regular interrogations by individuals believed to be members of the FBI and CIA .
Ultimately more than 100 individuals were " disappeared " to prisons in locations including Kenya , Somalia , Ethiopia , Djibouti and Guantánamo Bay .
The use of US military ships as prisons has been reported before , but never in as much detail .
The Washington Post 's Dana Priest reported in December 2004 that CIA detention facilities " on ships at sea , " but a year later , in her comprehensive report revealing the CIA 's rendition program , she reported that the idea of secretly holding prisoners aboard ships in international waters " was discarded for security and logistics reasons . "
A June 2004 report from the organization Human Rights First revealed suspicions that prisoners were being held aboard the USS Bataan and USS Peleliu .
Reprieve 's newest report shows that the use of floating prisons is far more widespread that previously believed .
As many as 17 ships were used to house detainees since 2001 , according to the report , which claims the suspects are interrogated aboard the ships before being rendered to other secret prisons .
The Reprieve study includes the account of a prisoner released from Guantánamo Bay , who described a fellow inmate 's story of detention on an amphibious assault ship .
" One of my fellow prisoners in Guantánamo was at sea on an American ship with about 50 others before coming to Guantánamo ... he was in the cage next to me .
He told me that there were about 50 other people on the ship .
They were all closed off in the bottom of the ship .
The prisoner commented to me that it was like something you see on TV .
The people held on the ship were beaten even more severely than in Guantánamo . "
The legal director of the human rights group tells the Guardian that the use of these floating prisons raises serious concerns about whether the military is complying with international law and the extent to which it seems to be going to hide from oversight of its activities .
" They choose ships to try to keep their misconduct as far as possible from the prying eyes of the media and lawyers .
We will eventually reunite these ghost prisoners with their legal rights , " Reprieve 's Clive Stafford Smith tells the paper .
" By its own admission , the US government is currently detaining at least 26,000 people without trial in secret prisons , and information suggests up to 80,000 have been ' through the system ' since 2001 .
The US government must show a commitment to rights and basic humanity by immediately revealing who these people are , where they are , and what has been done to them . "
Researchers find Antarctic ice is thickening WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
New measurements show the ice in West Antarctica is thickening , reversing some earlier estimates that the sheet was melting .
Jack Williams , USATODAY.com
Looking across the ice from an ice - core drilling tower at the Siple Dome field camp in 1999 .
Scientists drilled into the ice here to study the history of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet .
Scientists concerned about global warming have worried that higher temperatures could melt the massive ice sheet , causing a rise in sea levels worldwide .
But new flow measurements for the Ross ice streams , using special satellite - based radars , indicate that movement of some of the ice streams has slowed or halted , allowing the ice to thicken , according to a paper in the Jan. 18 issue of the journal Science .
If the thickening is not merely part of some short - term fluctuation , it represents a reversal of the long retreat of the ice , say researchers Ian Joughin of the California Institute of Technology and Slawek Tulaczyk of the University of California , Santa Cruz .
Their finding comes less than a week after a separate paper in Nature reported that Antarctica 's harsh desert valleys  long considered a bellwether for global climate change  have grown noticeably cooler since the mid-1980s .
Air temperatures recorded continuously over a 14 - year period ending in 1999 declined by about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the polar deserts and across the White Continent , that paper said .

Answers to sea level rise locked in ice .
Polar sciences news and resources
The cooling defies a trend spanning more than 100 years in which average land surface temperatures have increased worldwide by about 1 degree Fahrenheit .
The scientists said Antarctica is the only continent that is cooling .
They can not say why .
In their paper , Joughin and Tulaczyk suggest the West Antarctic ice streams may be undergoing the same transition from shrinking to growing that appears to have occurred on a neighboring stream 150 years ago .
The results , they add , suggest a reduced possibility of the feared massive collapse of the ice field .
" Perhaps , after 10,000 years of retreat from the ice - age maximum , researchers turned on their instruments just in time to catch the stabilization or re-advance of the ice sheet , " Richard B. Alley of Pennsylvania State University , wrote in a commentary accompanying the Science paper .
But he warned that coastal property owners should not become too optimistic about the findings , since the instrumental record is short and coastal ice streams have changed periodically over the centuries .

SAN ANTONIO ( Reuters ) - A
Texas man is facing charges for selling liquor without a license after he was found peddling bottles of vodka containing dead baby rattlesnakes .
Bob Popplewell , who runs “ Bayou Bob ’s Brazos River Rattlesnake Ranch ” tourist attraction west of Fort Worth , was believed to be selling the vodka in the Asian community , where snakes are seen having aphrodisiac properties , state authorities said .
Popplewell faces misdemeanor charges for not having a liquor license but will not be charged over the 10 - inch ( 25 - cm ) baby snakes in the bottles .
“ I ’ve been with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission for 20 years , ” Sergeant Charlie Cloud said .
“ This is the most bizarre thing I ’ve been involved in . ”
In some of East Asia , parts of snakes and other animals are thought to have medicinal qualities and are used to make soups , powders and other preparations .
In Vietnam , for example , the serpents are added to bottles of rice whisky and wine .
Authorities confiscated 411 bottles of the vodka , which Popplewell was selling for $ 23 each .
Popplewell , also the state ’s largest exporter of live turtles to Asia , declined to comment .

REUTERS / Kham
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wal - Mart Stores Inc ’s Sam’s Club warehouse division said on Wednesday that it is limiting sales of Jasmine , Basmati and long grain white rices “ due to recent supply and demand trends . ”
The news comes a day after Costco Wholesale Corp , the largest U.S. warehouse club operator , said it had seen increased demand for items like rice and flour as customers , worried about global food shortages , stock up .
Sam ’s Club said it is limiting sales of the rices to four bags per customer per visit , and it is working with its suppliers to ensure the products remain in stock .
Sam ’s Club , the No. 2 U.S. warehouse club operator , said it is not limiting sales of flour or cooking oil at this time .
Costco said some of its stores had put limits on sales of items such as rice and flour , but it was trying to modify those restrictions to meet customer demand .
Food costs have soared worldwide , spurred by increased demand in emerging markets like China and India , competition with biofuels , high oil prices and market speculation .
Rice prices in the United States and around the world have more than doubled in the last year , and U.S. rice futures rose to a fresh all - time high Wednesday on worries about supply shortages .
Trade bans have been put in place by India , the world ’s second largest rice exporter in 2007 , and Vietnam , the third biggest , in the hopes of cooling domestic prices of the staple .
Thailand is the largest rice exporter .

The spirit's weapons were antique chairs , silverware and a tasteful art deco tapestry ( the monsters of Splatterhouse apparently shopped at Pottery Barn ) .
Once you beat this evil bric - a - brac , the poltergeist retreated and , as a Hail - Mary " get bent , " dropped the goddamn chandelier on you .
Getting killed by that chandelier is an embarrassing experience you 'll never forget , just like the day you lost your virginity .

Q&A : What is the Bank of England doing ?
What is the Bank of England doing ?
After intense lobbying by the banking industry , the Bank has drawn up a plan that is intended to make it easier for mortgage lenders to raise money .
Why ?
The authorities have realised that the credit crunch is having an impact on the mortgage market , where loans are being withdrawn or offered at higher rates despite cuts to the official base rate .
It is also affecting the amount of lending to small and large businesses which could exacerbate any slowdown in the economy .
How does the Bank of England scheme work ?
Banks would be able to lodge bonds backed by mortgages as security at the Bank .
The Bank would then exchange the mortgage bonds for government bonds or bills which the banks can then use in the markets to trade for cash .
Does this mean the Bank of England may end up owning people 's homes ?
Unlikely .
Only in the unlikely event of the mortgage lender going bust would this happen .
What does it mean for my mortgage ?
Not much really .
Many mortgage lenders have already packaged up home loans into bond issues and this proposed system with the Bank of England will be similar .
Lenders , though , will need to know which customers ' mortgages are being handed over as collateral .
So what 's the geeky detail ?
The idea is to keep the risk with the mortgage lenders rather than the taxpayer .
This will be done by ensuring the mortgage bonds are not exchanged at face value but at a discount - known in the trade as a haircut .
The Bank will only allow mortgage bonds with a high credit rating - AAA - to be lodged as security .
So , if a bank were to provide £ 100 of AAA - rated mortgage backed securities it would receive between £ 70 and £ 90 of treasury bills .
What if the value of the banks ' assets fall ?
If the bonds are downgraded by the credit rating agencies , they will need to be substituted by better rated bonds .
Does n't the Bank do something like this already ?
This would be a change from the current situation .
The Bank of England already accepts some mortgage bonds as collateral .
They have to be AAA rated and can only be used for three - month funding rather than shorter - term funds of a week or so .
How much money will be become available to the lenders ?
A figure of £ 50bn will be made available initially but this could be doubled if it fails to rescue the £ 300 bn mortgage market .
Does this mean the credit crunch is over ?
Certainly not .
The mortgage lenders are privately making it known that the extra funds they get access to will merely allow them to maintain the current reduced level of lending , not return to the situation of a year ago when mortgages were freely available .
Deep in the bowels of the earth -- 100 metres below ground in Geneva , Switzerland -- lies a supermachine of 27 km circumference called the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) that has been built to unlock the mysteries of the universe .
Claude Leroy , a Université de Montréal physics professor , was among the 2,500 scientists from 37 countries recruited to help design , test and build the ATLAS detector at the supermachine that will provide a new perspective into what occurred at the time of the Big Bang and immediately after .
Designed for CERN , the European Organization for Nuclear Research , the ATLAS detector , the largest among the four detectors operating at the supermachine in question , is 46 metres in length , 25 metres in height and 7000 tonnes in weight -- or the size of three football fields .
Prof .
Leroy was responsible for the radiation and irradiation studies conducted to ensure the ATLAS detector will run smoothly .
His investigations also led to the creation of MPX , a small device attached throughout the supermachine and ATLAS that uses pixel silicon detectors to perform real - time measurements of the spectral characteristics and composition of radiation inside and around the ATLAS detector .
The small devices essentially capture images of what 's inside the detector and its environment , such neutrons and photons , a world - first .
He also participated in physics studies that targeted the production of heavy leptons , excited leptons , quarks and supersymmetry , in particular the study of neutralinos as dark matter candidates .
Prof.
Leroy 's experiments were critical in ensuring the viability of the ATLAS detector at the core of the supermachine , which is the world 's biggest particles physics detector .
Indeed , before the LHC can be started up , some 38,000 tons of equipment of the supermachine must be cooled down to minus 456 degrees Fahrenheit for the magnets to operate in a superconducting state .
This will be achieved by using liquid helium for magnet .
Parts of the ATLAS calorimeters use liquid argon cooled at minus 312 degrees Fahrenheit .
" The radiation field produced by the operation of the machine and ATLAS is stronger than a nuclear reactor , so it is vital that its design master all aspects of physics , " said Prof.
Leroy .
Supermachine 's Big Bang
The LHC will recreate conditions akin to the Big Bang -- which many scientists believe gave birth to the universe -- by colliding two beams of particles at close to the speed of light .
Since it is estimated that only 4 percent of the universe has been charted , the supermachine will help answer the following questions in physics when it is turned on in summer 2008 :
EVERYTHING in the Democratic Republic of Congo , a country almost the size of western Europe , is on a scarcely imaginable scale — including the violence .
Among the beautiful mountain vistas , terraced hillsides and lush tropical greens of eastern Congo , a bitter , decade - long civil war that officially ended in the rest of the country in 2003 , and that has claimed several million lives as a result of fighting and disease , burns on in the eastern border provinces of Ituri , North Kivu and South Kivu .
A ceasefire signed in the town of Goma in January between the government and more than a score of militias has so far done little to ease the plight of civilians in the east .
All sides — government troops , says the United Nations , as well as the militias — continue to use rape as a weapon of war on a barbarous scale .
Most victims , as ever , are women and girls , some no more than toddlers , though men and boys have sometimes been targeted too .
Local aid workers and UN reports tell of gang rapes , leaving victims with appalling physical and psychological injuries ; rapes committed in front of families or whole communities ; male relatives forced at gunpoint to rape their own daughters , mothers or sisters ; women used as sex slaves forced to eat excrement or the flesh of murdered relatives .
Some women victims have themselves been murdered by bullets fired from a gun barrel shoved into their vagina .
Some men , says a worker for the UN's Children 's Fund ( Unicef ) , have been forced to simulate having sex in holes dug in the ground , with razor blades stuck inside .
Sometimes the motive is revenge for attacks by rival militias , sometimes it is ethnic cleansing and on other occasions an effort to undermine the morale of the enemy by spreading shame , injury and disease .
The trauma and appalling injury suffered by women and men who survive such assaults cripple families and whole villages .
In eastern Congo up to 80 % of reported fistula cases in women are thought to result from rape attacks .
The epidemic of violence also spreads HIV / AIDS .
According to a report published in October by the UN secretary - general in an effort to get governments to do more to protect civilians caught up in this and other conflicts , in the first six months of 2007 there were 4,500 cases of sexual violence reported in South Kivu alone .
As a rule of thumb in such situations , says the UN , for every rape that is reported , as many as ten or 20 cases may go unreported .
Rape in warfare is nothing new .
Congo has long had a culture of violence and an almost non-existent judicial system .
Though rape is supposedly illegal , often it is the victim who is shunned .
Neither army nor militia commanders seem to see rape as a serious offence and so take no action against their marauding soldiers .
Some fighters are said to believe that the rape of a virgin bestows invincibility in combat .
But these are not random acts by misguided or crazed individuals , says the UN ; they are a “ deliberate attempt to dehumanise and destroy entire communities . ”
Kate Eshelby
But the men with guns do n't listen
That process is proceeding apace .
Since early last year an upsurge in violence has displaced some 550,000 people from their homes and villages in eastern Congo .
The sprawling , hellish camps for displaced people that dot the road from Goma north to Rutshuru , their shelters made from branches lashed together , leaves and plastic sheeting , offer little protection .
Not even the UN's more than 17,000 blue helmets and military observers , and close to 1,000 police ( together its largest peacekeeping operation in the world ) , can hope to put an end to violence in so vast a region that is barely accessible by road or air .
And the Goma ceasefire ?
Pressure to observe it would be a start , even though not all armed groups signed up .
Among those that did not are Hutu rebels from over the border in Rwanda who helped perpetrate the genocide there in 1994 and caused it to spill over the border into Congo .
On April 23rd , 63 international and Congolese NGOs signed an appeal urging the UN to appoint a high - level special adviser on human rights for eastern Congo .
The idea is to help draw world attention to the plight of civilians , whose suffering is at least as extreme as anything witnessed in the better - publicised conflict in Sudan 's western region of Darfur .
The hope is that outside governments , the African Union , the European Union and the United States may offer political and financial support .
Since all UN members have promised to observe a fundamental “ responsibility to protect ” their citizens from war crimes and crimes against humanity , focusing world attention on such crimes in eastern Congo is perhaps the least outsiders can do .
When governments want to expand power over the monetary system , they invoke the need to clamp down on money laundering by criminals .
There is a problem here .
After these laws and new rules are passed , crime never goes down , but our privacy does .
That is a problem for us .
It is not a problem for governments .
The Toronto Globe and Mail ran a story on money laundering and new Web - based businesses that allow people to buy small amounts of gold and then spend this gold as money .
The development of these businesses is the preliminary step to the restoration of private money .
This is regarded with great hostility by national governments and central banks .
National governments ever since 1914 have worked with central banks to remove gold from circulation as money .
This began with the outbreak of World War I .
It has never ceased .
The development of the credit card was the culmination of a dream of every fractional reserve banker .
Bankers in a fractional reserve system have always feared the withdrawal of currency by depositors .
This reverses the fractional reserve process .
It shrinks the money supply .
By substituting digits for currency , bankers have solved this problem .
A depositor can move digital money out of his account , but it is transferred to another digital account .
The system does not lose deposits .
When someone withdraws currency and does not redeposit it , the money supply declines .
So , credit cards are a banker ’s dream come true .
The threat of bank runs by depositors has ended .
But now a handful of small companies have offered depositors a way to substitute digital money for gold stored in a vault .
This gold can now be spent digitally .
This creates the threat of a rival form of money .
Hardly anyone accepts gold for transactions .
So , the threat to banks is remote today .
It is merely the first hesitant step in the creation of an alternative monetary system .
Yet this threat has aroused the hostility of some government organizations : those that monitor money .
This alternative money avenue is tiny .
Hardly anyone knows of these firms .
Fewer still have signed up .
Nevertheless , some government agencies are preparing to make war on these tiny firms .
“ This thing must be nipped in the bud . ”
The Globe and Mail reports on this new pressure by governments .
Canada ’s financial intelligence agency warns that criminals may be exploiting Internet - based companies that convert cash into electronic gold , exposing a new front in the international effort to restrict terrorist financing and money laundering .
While other channels of money laundering are successfully being shut down , authorities are increasingly worried about a proliferation of “ digital precious metals operators ” websites that offer clients a chance to conduct Internet business in units backed by gold and silver rather than paper currencies .
The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada , or FINTRAC , has produced a report on this supposed threat to the public .
It ’s bad , the report says .
It ’s huge .
It ’s everywhere .
The reporter summarized this report .
These companies are “ facilitating millions of transactions on the fringe of the international financial system — the equivalent of a Wild West where legitimate businesses , privacy - seeking individuals and criminals can mingle just out of reach of the law . ”
We know what the Wild West was .
It was where the U.S. government had not sent a marshal to police everything .
The Wild West was just out of reach of the law , meaning Federal law .
At stake is the effectiveness of the financial reporting rules that countries such as the United States , Britain and Canada enacted in response to the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
A network that allows individuals to move money around the world means criminals can avoid commercial banks and other financial institutions required to turn over their records to the government .
You can see where this is headed .
Legitimate businesses and privacy - seeking individuals are going to be told to surrender to the Greater Good of the Government in its program of stamping out criminals and terrorists .
We all know how successful these government efforts have been so far .
We are therefore supposed to accept more of the same .
“ As financial institutions and non-financial businesses increasingly deter money laundering and terrorism financing , adaptable and technology - savvy criminals and terrorist financiers will likely see other unregulated , exploitable avenues to further their nefarious purposes , ” concludes the report , which was made available under the Access to Information Act .
“ Digital precious metals may become one of them . ”
The horror !
One firm that offers these services is Goldmoney .
( www.goldmoney.com)
Its vault is located in London .
The company is outside the jurisdiction of Canada and the United States .
It has done a great deal to restrict access by criminals .
But none of this matters to governments .
The firm ’s offense is that it offers a way for individuals to escape mass price inflation , which is always the creation of central banks .
This escape hatch is considered criminal by governments .
WHY GOVERNMENTS HATE GOLD
When a society ’s monetary system is based exclusively on private contracts and voluntary exchange , civil governments find it difficult to make money by counterfeiting .
They cannot directly control the monetary system .
They can influence it through legislation and the courts by altering what constitutes a legally enforceable contract .
The main interference here is a government ’s decision to allow banks and private storage facilities to issue receipts — IOUs — for gold or silver that are not covered 100 % by the quantity and fineness of the metal promised on the receipt .
This violates private contract law .
It authorizes fraud .
It legalizes counterfeiting .
But the government is not helped much by this interpretation of contracts .
Banks and warehouse storage facilities are the main beneficiaries .
The history of civil government has been a history of the governments ’ assertion of sovereignty over money .
They do not prove the case for such sovereignty as an inherent attribute of civil government .
They do not even mention this theoretical problem .
There merely enforce the principle by law .
There is a reason for this .
All civil governments , with the lone exception of Byzantium from 325 to 1453 , have deliberately tampered with the metal content of the monetary unit .
They have practiced counterfeiting .
They have added less expensive metal to the silver or gold and have then spent the new money into circulation at the older , higher value .
This is theft .
Governments steal from naïve , trusting individuals who sell at yesterday ’s prices on the assumption that the nation ’s official counterfeiter has not , coin by coin , stolen silver or gold and replaced it with tin or some other base metal .
The skeptics see what has happened and raise prices , or they borrow with the intention of repaying the loan with money of reduced purchasing power .
Counterfeiting , when practiced by a private agency not licensed by the government , is denounced as theft and is prosecuted by the government .
On the other hand , whenever counterfeiting is practiced by a national government or a government - licensed central bank and fractionally reserved commercial banks , this is referred to as scientific monetary policy .
It is heralded by free market economists as being in the public interest .
Central banks are charged with the responsibility of carrying out monetary policy .
The major purpose of the Federal Reserve System ( and other central banks ) is to regulate the money supply and provide a monetary climate that is in the interest of the entire economy .
( Gwartney & Stroup , Economics , 4th edition , p. 281 ) .
A MORAL ISSUE
Sometime around 750 B.C. , the prophet Isaiah identified the practice of monetary debasement as one of a series of government acts against the public interest .
Thy silver is become dross , thy wine mixed with water ( Isa. 1:22 ) .
The process of debasement , he argued , was initially moral debasement .
It affected the entire nation .
“ Wash you , make you clean ; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes ; cease to do evil ” ( Isaiah 1:16 ) .
Then it became judicial debasement .
“ Thy princes are rebellious , and companions of thieves : every one loveth gifts , and followeth after rewards : they judge not the fatherless , neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them ” ( Isaiah 1:23 ) .
But its most visible mark was monetary debasement .
This led to the debasement of wine , i.e. , product quality debasement .
He warned of God ’s wrath to come .
Therefore saith the Lord , the LORD of hosts , the mighty One of Israel , Ah , I will ease me of mine adversaries , and avenge me of mine enemies :
And I will turn my hand upon thee , and purely purge away thy dross , and take away all thy tin ( Isaiah 1:24 — 25 ) .
Academic economists refuse to identify monetary debasement as a moral issue .
Economics textbooks at every level discuss fractional reserve banking in terms of technical issues , never moral issues .
The only exception is Murray Rothbard ’s little - known textbook on money and banking , The Mystery of Banking .
He identified fractional reserve banking as immoral .
It involves theft .
The book was never adopted by any economics department .
It soon went out of print .
You can download it for free here .
There is moral cause and effect in society .
Because counterfeiting by any agency is immoral , because it deliberately forces the redistribution of wealth from those who spend the money late in the process , after prices have risen , society suffers .
An assault on the integrity of contracts undermines cooperative ventures .
Whenever the government or its licensed monopoly , the national central bank , spearheads this assault , the public is unable to defend itself .
It does not even suspect there is a problem until the rate of price inflation is widespread .
Even then , the government and its spokesmen blame speculators for rising prices .
RIGHT HAND VS .
LEFT HAND
Jesus said , “ But when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth ” ( Matthew 6:3 ) .
His point was that we are not to seek fame from our giving .
Take heed that ye do not your alms before men , to be seen of them : otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven .
Therefore when thou doest thine alms , do not sound a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may have glory of men .
Verily I say unto you ,
They have their reward ( Matthew 6:1 — 2 ) .
That thine alms may be in secret : and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly ( Matthew 6:4 ) .
In the field of civil government , the right hand ought to know what the left hand is doing .
Otherwise , policy may be at cross-purposes .
This is what monetary policy is in the United States and Canada .
Both nations produce gold coins .
They are not really coins .
They are not counted in the money supply .
But they look like coins .
People can buy them .
Problem : evil criminals and terrorists can use these non-coins in their nefarious plans .
These non-coins leave no paper trail of digits .
My advice is that we should take advantage of the governments ’ schizophrenia .
If we can legally buy a little future freedom , we should .
I recommend using digital gold storage facilities that are legally incorporated outside the United States , and whose vaults are also outside .
But the little guy should first buy gold coins issued by his nation ’s mint .
Maybe after the first $ 10,000 , he should consider an off - shore vault program .
CONCLUSION
The war on gold will continue .

The major ( and as yet unanswered ) question , of course , is how Google intends to police against malicious editors .
So far , they 're displaying the history of all edits made to a particular point to keep pertinent information from disappearing .
What happens when a location has dozens of edits ?
Are users expected to sort through the chaff to find the wheat ?
It sound like a temporary solution to a problem that has not yet been well thought out ; but if successful , the wikified version would be a major boon .
Linux mmap ( ) call is full of surprises .
Take for example the MAP_PRIVATE option .
According to the man page , mmap ( ) with this option makes copy - on - write pages , meaning that any changes the process makes to the mmaped region will not be propagated to the underlying file .
This is of course works as advertised , but there is a catch .
What if some other process modifies the file ?
Take for example this simple program :
#include < stdio.h > # include < fcntl.h > # include < sys / mman.h > int main ( ) { int fd = open ( " file " , O_RDRW ) ; char *p = mmap( NULL , 1 , PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE , MAP_PRIVATE , fd , 0 ) ; while ( 1 ) { printf ( " %
c
" , * p ) ; sleep ( 2 ) ; } close ( fd ) ; }
If file contains a character " A " , this program will print a string of As to the console .
Now while the program is running you change the contents of the file .
Does the output of the program change ?
It turns out it does !
However only if the program did n't change something in the mmaped region .
If you modify the program above so that it writes something , the stream of characters on the console will not change when you modify the contents of the file .
Why is this significant ( and why I spent a couple of hours exploring it ) ?
It turns out that the dlopen ( ) call in Linux loads shared objects by simply mmaping them ( look at the strace output if you do n't believe me ) .
So if you change a . so file on the disk while some application is using it , you 'll get a nice segmentation fault .
Now , / proc /*/ maps file reveals that the executable itself is also mmaped .
However a program does n't crash when you modify the executable file , so either something gets changed in the program 's image after it gets mmaped or I still do n't understand everything that 's going on here .
The “ CREEPS ” are at it again .
The Watergate dirty tricksterism of the Committee to Re-Elect the President ( Nixon ) is back in business , if it ever went out of it .
Once the nominee of the party ( McCain ) was determined , GOP operatives have focussed their campaigning on trying to manipulate the Democratic primaries to their benefit .
By all present indications , their operations are succeeding quite nicely , thank you .
Like all shady “ operations , ” this one needed to operate in the shadow of public awareness ; but the bean - spiller Russ Limbaugh spilled a bowl of them just after the March 4 Democratic primaries in Texas and Ohio when he “ bragged ” on the air that he had urged his friends in the Republican Party to vote for Clinton , since she was on the ropes after Super Tuesday and it was to the Republicans ’ advantage to prolong the Democratic primary race to allow Obama and Clinton to clobber one another to help do the party ’s dirty work for it .
Of course the “ dirty ” Clinton campaign obliged and Republican bottom - suckers aided the clobbering process by going back through Jeremiah Wright ’s old sermons and putting together a hair - raising montage of utterances designed to embarrass Obama which is , of course , exactly what happened .
The loud - mouthed Limbaugh labeled all this muddy business Operation Chaos .
After the Pennsylvania primary on April 22 , John Nichols wrote an article for Nation claiming that Chaos had little or no influence on the outcome of the PA race .
I ’ve done the math and some educated guesses on the election results ( which I will be glad to furnish as a paste to this site if requested ) to show quite the contrary : that of the 215,000 vote margin of Clinton ’s win in PA , about 100,000 of them could be attributed to Republicans who , in PA ’s “ closed ” primary , re-registered as Democrats and voted for Clinton ; without that Chaos boost , she would have won by 5 - 6 % rather than the 10 % that was the agreed - upon “ magic number ” of the margin by which she had to win to stay in the race .
After her “ big victory , ” the campaign contributions rolled in and she stayed in the race … at least until after May 6 .
Operation Chaos , Mission Accomplished !
Like other accomplished missions , this one is still a bit incomplete , especially after the semi-melt down suffered by Obama by virtue of his handling of the Jeremiah Wright “ affair . ”
Next to the plate step the May 6 twin primaries in Indiana and North Carolina and it remains to be seen whether Operation Chaos will still be operating .
For reasons mentioned below , I rather doubt it .
To consider Indiana first , it is the first totally “ open ” primary since Limbaugh described the operation , one in which any voter can vote in either party ’s primary .
This might seem tailor - made for Chaos except for a couple of things .
( 1 ) There are other primary races , Congress for example , in which Republicans may feel that they have a stake , even if the presidential “ stake ” has been removed by McCain clinching the nomination .
Some may feel , as I tend to agree , that the mission has indeed been accomplished and they can safely “ stay home ” and vote in their own party ’s primary .
( 2 ) Although I called Indiana a “ totally open ” primary state , it is not quite that .
True , Indiana does not even record party registration on voting records but when a voter asks for a ballot , he / she is expected to request the ballot of his / her “ party affiliation : ” that party in whose primary he / she has been voting in the recent past .
If his / her indication of this affiliation ( records of which are maintained by the state ) is “ challenged ” ( by whom ? ) , the “ challengee ” will be required to execute an affidavit indicating his / her intention of voting for the “ majority ” of that party ’s nominees at the next general election .
But , as the “ green pages ” for Indiana elections point out , officials at the polling place do not have access tp a voter ’s affiliation records and his / her actual voting at the general election is secret , so the truthfulness of the affidavits is seldom , if ever , challenged .
So Chaos - bent persons could presumably violate their “ affiliation ” even after a sworn affidavit to the contrary , but would I ( for example ) want to risk the possibility of being prosecuted ( in ignorance of the inefficacy of the “ challenge ” threat ) because some hot shot “ voter abuse ” prosecutor wanted to make a test case of me … all because I was so Republican - or Russ Limbaugh oriented that I was willing to go to jail for a “ cause ” that had perhaps already been accomplished ?
No way .
Bottom line : in contrast with PA , I do n’t expect Operation Chaos will make much difference in IN .
Then there ’s North Carolina which , like PA , is a “ closed primary ” state but , again , it was possible for people to change their registrations before the change deadline of April 11 , in plenty of time to implement Chaos directives from the party .
Did this happen ?
Current registration numbers show that , since the beginning of the year , approximately 105,000 have been newly registered as Democrats , about 14,000 as Republicans , suggesting some Chaos potential .
With a state with a large black population so decisively leaning toward Obama , one might wonder how many of these 105,000 new “ Democrats ” are Chaos operatives who will vote for Clinton to “ prolong ” the race ; and how many are respondents to Obama ’s campaign to enlist those Republicans , mostly I should think , white males who are in fact attracted to a “ black ” candidate who is the closet racist ’s dream of a black politician who would tell Jeremiah Wright , in effect , to go the back of the bus and New York City blacks , incensed by the exoneration of police who killed Sean Bell , to “ accept the verdict ” and to avoid “ violent ” reactions .
So again , bottom line , I doubt that Chaos will have much effect in NC .
This brings me to a final observation on these Republican efforts to manipulate the Democratic primaries .
Here I ’m going to offer a guess at what the “ operation ” is all about ; how I wish I had a “ mole ” who sits with these creeps and plots strategies .
Failing that , I have to guess .
I ’m thinking that , all along , the Republican preference as a November opponent was Obama , who is vulnerable to the same kind of “ swift - boating ” operations that were the undoing of John Kerry in 2004 .
Whether it was his not wearing a flag pin , his suggestion of “ negotiating ” with Hamas , his association with Reverend Wright or maybe their ace in the hole , the real possibility of a criminal indictment in connection with the public housing scandal in Chicago , they would have a candidate who could be smeared far beyond the rather vague “ Hillary hatred ” that would make her as well a relatively easy November election opponent .
In the several “ open primary ” election states leading through Super Tuesday , it is my impression ( I have n’t done “ the math ” on these ) that Obama won most of these states , perhaps with a boost from Republican voters –provided these occurred in primaries after the Republican primary contest was effectively decided .
When it appeared after Super Tuesday that the “ operation ” did such an over - kill that it threatened to foreshorten the Democratic race and deprive the party of “ dirty work ” done within the Democratic Party , then Operation Chaos was born : an operation whose mission may indeed be accomplished so that Republicans can vote in what remains of “ their own ” primary contests and let happen what was originally intended : that a “ flawed ” Obama would be nominated .
One more thing I hope to accomplish by this article : to keep open a discussion , while the “ pain ” of the present election mess is still fresh with us , of needed structural changes in the way we “ do business ” in American democracy .
Primary elections should , in my view , be reserved for participation to whose people who are genuinely committed to advance the causes of a party : “ open ” primaries are practically oxymorons .
To prevent changes in party registration for the specific purpose of doing mischief with other peoples ’ elections ( a la Operation Chaos ) , states could enforce earlier deadlines for registration changes , perhaps to the beginning of an election season , before parties could calculate who was winning or losing in the other parties ’ primaries .
( Kentucky now does this , as registration changes for its May 20 primary closed on December 31 , 2007 ) .
Finally , and this one is debatable for several reasons : the institution of a single “ Primary Day ” in say June or July could avert not only the situation in which parties with “ already settled ” races of their own would feel free to enter their rivals ’ party primaries , but also perhaps obviate the bandwagon effect of earlier on later primaries .
All these reforms are open to discussion and critique , but would n’t it be good strategy to begin the debates now while the problems with the present system are laid out before us ?

The new research suggests China 's emissions were underestimated China has already overtaken the US as the world 's " biggest polluter " , a report to be published next month says .
The research suggests the country 's greenhouse gas emissions have been underestimated , and probably passed those of the US in 2006 - 2007 .
The University of California team will report their work in the Journal of Environment Economics and Management .
They warn that unchecked future growth will dwarf any emissions cuts made by rich nations under the Kyoto Protocol .
The team admit there is some uncertainty over the date when China may have become the biggest emitter of CO2 , as their analysis is based on 2004 data .
Until now it has been generally believed that the US remains " Polluter Number One " .
Next month 's University of California report warns that unless China radically changes its energy policies , its increases in greenhouse gases will be several times larger than the cuts in emissions being made by rich nations under the Kyoto Protocol .
The researchers say their figures are based on provincial - level data from the Chinese Environmental Protection Agency .

They say analysis of the 30 data points is more informative about likely future emissions than national figures in wider use because it allows errors to be tracked more closely .
They believe current computer models substantially underestimate future emissions growth in China .
We are awaiting a formal comment from the UK Chinese Embassy , but Dr Max Auffhammer , the lead researcher , said his projections had been presented widely and no - one had raised a serious complaint .
All those concerned about climate change agree that China 's emissions are a problem - including China itself .
CARBON EMISSIONS
Global carbon emissions statistics were last published in 2004 .
They show Chinese emissions began rising rapidly in 2002 .
University of California research suggests China overtook the US as the worst producer of carbon emissions in 2006 But China and many other developing countries struggling to tackle poverty are adamant that any negotiated emissions reductions should not be absolute , but relative to a " business - as - usual " scenario of projected growth .
That is why this study is of more than academic interest .
If it becomes widely accepted that China 's future emissions are likely to be much higher than previously estimated , that will have to factored into any future global climate agreement if the Chinese are to be persuaded to take part .
In brief , although this study looks bad for China 's reputation , it may be good for China 's negotiating position .
The Chinese - and the UN - insist that rich countries with high per capita levels of pollution must cut emissions first , and help poorer countries to invest in clean technology .
America 's per capita emissions are five to six times higher than China 's , even though China has become the top manufacturing economy .
US emissions are still growing too , though much more slowly .
Dr Auffhammer told BBC
News that his projections had made an assumption that the Chinese government 's recent aggressive energy efficiency programme would fail , as the previous one had failed badly .
" Our figures for emissions growth are truly shocking , " he said .
" But there is no sense pointing a finger at the Chinese .
They are trying to pull people out of poverty and they clearly need help .
" The only solution is for a massive transfer of technology and wealth from the West . "
He acknowledged that this eventuality was unlikely .
Those scientists aspiring to stabilise global emissions growth before 2020 to prevent what they believe may be irreversible damage to the climate may be wondering how this can possibly be achieved .

Brazil 's Petrobras has discovered the largest light crude Oil Field since the Mexican Cantarell Field in 1976 .
T he massive find is in the same area off the coast of Brazil as the restly discovered Tupi field which is beleived to hold 8 billion barrels of extractable crude .
The new Sugar Loaf Field discovery is 5 times larger than Tupi and could signal an end to declining oil production around the World .
According to officials at Petrobras , Brazil 's state - run oil and gas company , the Sugar Loaf field may produce up to 40 billion barrels of oil .
Several multinational petroleum companies are already lining up to explore the region , including Petrobras , Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil .
The basin is believed to contain light crude , an added bonus for Brazil considering it still depends on other countries to refine oil for its domestic needs .
" To discovery oil is one thing , but to discover light crude is a real commodity , " said one analyst .
Preliminary exploration of the area has determined that the Sugar Loaf field is five times the size of the Tupi field , already considered a major boon for South America 's largest economy .
Last month Petrobras officials said the discovery in the Tupi oil field could launch Brazil into the top 10 oil producers in the world .
The oil field 's potential yield would provide Brazil with the world 's eighth - largest oil and gas reserves , Petrobras President Sergio Gabrielli said .
Elated by the discovery , President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva quipped , " God must be Brazilian . "
News of the discovery prompted Petrobras shares to jump more than $ 24 on the New York Stock Exchange to $ 116.77 , a 52 - week high at the time .
The find follows last year 's announcement that Brazil has become a net exporter of oil after decades of dependence on other countries .
However , Brazil still imports light crude for use domestically .
Brazil experienced a record year in petroleum production in 2006 with Petrobras reporting record - high oil processing levels in its refineries .
The company reported that a total of 1.784 million barrels per day were processed in Brazilian refineries in 2006 , a 1.5 percent increase from 2005 production levels .
The state firm said the increase in production was the result of improved production and supply chain management , ranging from raw material flow to the delivery of oil derivatives to customers .
Petrobras also noted earlier this year it was in the final stage of construction and installation of its $ 900 million P - 54 platform , one of the world 's largest , with a production capacity of 180,000 bpd and capable of compressing 6 million cubic meters of natural gas per day .
The P - 54 will be installed in the Roncador field , in Campos Basin , Rio de Janeiro , not far from the Tupi and Sugar Loaf basins .
Brazil 's recent good fortune in the oil business could mean a much higher profile for a country that considers itself the de facto leader in the region .
In politics , Bill Clinton once said , it 's better to be " strong and wrong " than weak and right , which is why Hillary Clinton has joined John McCain in shamelessly pandering for votes by calling for a suspension of the federal gasoline tax .
Both of them have to know it 's a terrible idea - just try to find a halfway intelligent economist or environmentalist who says otherwise - that will mean peanuts for you but millions for oil companies .
It wo n't do a thing to make gas any cheaper or more plentiful , but clearly they do n't care .
It 's more important to win votes - no matter how cheaply or crassly - than to be honest with us , and they 're criticizing Barack Obamafor having the audacity to call them on it .
" This is n't an idea designed to get you through the summer , " Obama said .
" It 's an idea designed to get them through an election . "
He 's right .
" Score one for Obama , " Greg Mankiw , a former chairman of President Bush 's Council of Economic Advisers who also advised the Romney campaign , says , according to Reuters .
" In light of the side effects associated with driving ... gasoline taxes should be higher than they are , not lower . "
Yes , a Republican adviser to a Republican president says the gas tax should be higher - $ 1 higher , according to an op - ed piece he wrote almost two years ago .
But Clinton and McCain want to suspend the tax - 18.4 cents a gallon on gasoline and 24.4 cents a gallon on diesel - for the summer .
Both say it will ease the pain of soaring gas prices , which averaged $ 3.61 a gallon Wednesday .
And just how much relief will you get ?
About $ 30 , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
That 's 33 cents a day .
There 's a good chance you 'll never see that 30 bucks because oil companies are " just going to push up the price of the gas by almost the size of the tax cut , " Eric Toder of the non-partisan Urban Institute told Reuters .
Clinton 's proposal to make up for that sleight of hand with a windfall tax on oil companies wo n't fly , and she knows it .
As Jonathan Alter of Newsweek notes , the Senate blocked just such a tax in December .
As we noted when McCain floated his tax holiday proposal two weeks ago , the federal gas tax funds the federal Highway Trust Fund , which finances road projects nationwide and is already facing a $ 3.4 billion shortfall .
And the federal transportation department says every $ 1 billion in highway spending creates 34,779 jobs , which means the a gas tax holiday could cost 300,000 construction jobs .
But perhaps worst of all , eliminating the tax will lead to increased consumption .
Make something cheaper and people will use more of it .
It 's basic economics .
That 's the wrong signal to send when the head of OPEC says oil could hit $ 200 a barrel before the end of the year and scientists increasingly agree we 've got about 40 years to cut emissions by 80 percent if we 're to get a handle on global warming .
" I think it 's a very bad idea , " says Gilbert Metclaf , an economics professor at Tufts University .
" If we want people to invest in energy - saving cars , we need some assurance that the higher price paid for these cars is going to pay off through fuel savings .
It 's a very short - sighted , counterproductive proposal . "
If anything , the candidates should be bold and call for an increase in the federal gas tax .
It has n't been raised in 15 years , and would have to be increased to 27 cents just to keep up with inflation .
Raising the gasoline tax by 10 cents a year for five years would raise $ 65 billion , says David Sandalow , author of " Freedom from Oil " .
We 'd still be paying far less for gasoline than Europe and investing in our future .
Think what we could accomplish if that money were dedicated to developing alternatives to a resource that is only growing scarcer - and more expensive .
Do n't count on that to happen .
It would require leadership , and it 's easier to pander than lead .
RACIAL PROFILING ON TENNESSEE VOTER REG CARDS
Category : News and Politics
The state of Tennessee places a box on its voter registration form for " RACE " -- this is marked " optional " , but on some county Web sites , like Tipton County , http://tiptonco.com/dept_election.htm
they add pressure to complete every item by printing , and highlighting , the words " omitting information produces rejected application " right under the form .
That statement would not be a problem if the " race " box was not on the card , and if the felony indicator blank was correctly designed .
Here 's a copy of the Tennessee voter registration card as of this posting :
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
The felony indicator blank is incorrectly designed because it comes at the end of a string of blanks on which the voter says " yes " , but then requires a " no " answer .
This design is likely to produce false " yes " responses .
Inclusion of racial profiling characteristics , whether optional or not , is highly inappropriate because it enables more precise targeting of ethnic groups for vote suppression , and even targeted voting machine programming fraud .
In Florida , another state that has had racial profiling information on its voter registration cards , over 90,000 voters were purged from the rolls in 2000 , and these purges were disproportionately Black citizens .
Tennessee is obstructive with Freedom of Information records .
Unlike most states , which recognize the right of " any person " and " the public " to review documents , Tennessee requires residency in the state to obtain or inspect its records .
Citizens will need to apply pressure to get the racial profile information off the voter registration card forms , but even if they do , racial profiling is highly likely to have crept into the statewide voter registration database .
Residents of Tennessee who are concerned about this can seek to inspect documents and should request the field codes and data input training manuals to determine the extent to which :
1 ) Racial profiling has been inserted into the Tennessee statewide voter registration database
and
2 ) Whether there are any indications that voters have been targeted for purges , changes in polling location , or any other actions that correlate with racial profiling information in Tennessee 's voter list .
OTHER ACTIONS TO PROTECT YOUR VOTES
Over the past eight years we have documented a steady stream of problems with voters who somehow do n't show up as registered .
Federal law now requires elections workers to provide " provisional ballots " to voters not recognized as registered voters , but these are second - class ballots , because they are not counted on Election Night , they are never considered by the media when " calling the race " , and they are often rejected several days later ( when they finally are looked at ) due to reasons beyond the voter 's control .
For example , in Volusia County , Florida a citizen had to fight like crazy to get a set of ballots counted -- officials were trying to reject them because a poll worker had not written the reason they were provisional on the envelope .
And Pennsylvania , another swing state , allows its elections officials to add an impediment to giving out provisional ballots at all .
Several counties in the state of Pennsylvania were documented , during the primary , saying they had to " call for permission " before giving out provisional ballots , and of course when they called , the lines were always busy .

Jurassic - era coprolite , or fossilised dinosaur dung
Two pieces of dinosaur dung have been sold at auction for $ 960 ( £ 486 ) at an auction house in New York .
The fossilised dung , which resembles rock on the outside , and a colourful mineral inside , is 130 million years old , from the Jurassic period .
Auctioneers Bonhams of New York said it sold for twice the expected price .
The buyer is reported to be Steve Tsengas , the 71 - year - old owner of a company that sells products to treat pet animal waste in Ohio .
Marketing tool
Mr Tsengas told Associated Press that he would use the dung as a marketing tool , by displaying it at the company 's stall at trade shows .
" Poop is big business in the pet industry , " he is quoted as saying by AP .
A 4.5 billion - year - old meteorite , which was expected to top the bidding , failed to sell .
The meteorite 's owner , Marvin Kilgore , of the University of Arizona 's Southwest Meteorite Center , said he was mystified that the fossilised dung had sold , but his meteorite - which is much more rare - had not .
" Some people want it on their shelves , I guess , " he said .
Did you like my previous CSS tutorial on how to create gradient text effects ?
I ’m using the same trick to show you how to decorate your images and photo galleries without editing the source images .
The trick is very simple .
All you need is an extra < span > tag and apply a background image to create the overlaying effect .
It is very easy and flexible — see my demos with over 20 styles , from a simple image icon to a rounded corner to a masked layer ( both decorative and complex ) .

Cross - Browser CompatIble —
It has passed the test on most browsers ( Firefox , Safari , Opera , and even the " buggy IE6 " ) .
Basic Concept ( see demo )
You need to insert an extra < span > tag within the < div > tag , with which we ’ll apply a background image to create the overlaying effect .
If you do n’t like to have an empty span tag , you can append the span tag by Javascript ( I ’ll show you how later in this tutorial ) .
Here is how it works :
Then in the CSS , the key point you have to remember is : specify the div element to position : relative and the span element to position : absolute .
You can position the span element anywhere you want by using the top and left property .
IE PNG Hack
To make the transparent PNG image work on IE6 , I use this wonderful iepngfix.htc hack .
Download a copy of iepngfix.htc and insert the following code in between the < head > tag :
<!--[ if lt IE 7 ] > < style type =" text/css " > . photo span { behavior : url( iepngfix.htc ) ; } </style > <![ endif ] -->
Look and Feel
To change the look and feel , simply edit the CSS specifications of the span element .

To show you how flexible it is , I ’ve created 15 different styles ( notice the HTML markup is same ) .
The jQuery Solution ( see demo )
I know some of you ( particularly the web accessibility fans ) do n’t like to have an empty span tag in the markup .
Well , I ’ve solved this issue by using jQuery to append the span tag to the source code .
Insert the following code in between the < head > tag :
< script type =" text / javascript " src=" jquery.js " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " > $ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { // prepend span tag $ ( " . photo a " ) . prepend ( " < span ></span > " ) ; } ) ; </ script >

Let ’s take the technique from the previous step and apply it to create a photo gallery .
# 1b. Mini Icons ( see demo )
This example shows you how to position different icons on top of each photo ( note : an extra CSS class name is required in the span tag ) .
# 2. Photo With Text ( see demo )
This example shows you how to create a gallery with linking text ( em tag ) .

( Natural News )
The use of depleted uranium ( DU ) munitions by the U.S. military may lead to a death toll far higher than that from the nuclear bombs dropped at the end of World War II .DU is a waste product of uranium enrichment , containing approximately one - third the radioactive isotopes of naturally occurring uranium .
Because of its high density , it is used in armor - or tank - piercing ammunition .
It has been fired by the U.S. and British militaries in the two Iraq wars and in Afghanistan , as well as by NATO forces in Kosovo and the Israeli military in Lebanon and Palestine .
Inhaled or ingested DU particles are highly toxic , and DU has been classified as an illegal weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations .
The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority has estimated that 50 tons of DU dust from the first Gulf War could lead to 500,000 cancer deaths by the year 2000 .
To date , a total of 2,000 tons have been generated in the Middle East .
In contrast , approximately 250,000 lives were claimed by the explosions and radiation released by the nuclear weapons dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
" More than ten times the amount of radiation released during atmospheric testing [ of nuclear bombs ] has been released from DU weaponry since 1991 , " said Leuren Moret , a U.S. nuclear scientist .
" The genetic future of the Iraqi people , for the most part , is destroyed .
The environment now is completely radioactive .
" Because DU has a half - life of 4.5 billion years , the Middle East will , for all practical purposes , be radioactive forever .
The two U.S. wars in Iraq " have been nuclear wars because they have scattered nuclear material across the land , and people , particularly children , are condemned to die of malignancy and congenital disease essentially for eternity , " said anti-nuclear activist Helen Caldicott .
Since the first Gulf War , the rate of birth defects and childhood cancer in Iraq has increased by seven times .
More than 35 percent ( 251,000 ) of U.S. Gulf
War veterans are dead or on permanent medical disability , compared with only 400 who were killed during the conflict .
The two men are to appear on Capitol Hill again on April 8 and 9 .
These more frequent reviews are advocated , officials said , by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and by the military ’s Central Command , which is responsible for operations across the region , including those in Afghanistan .
The reviews would determine how many more brigades , if any , could be ordered out of Iraq in the final months of the Bush presidency .
Reducing the troops in Iraq as much as is feasible has been a priority of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who are to brief Mr. Bush this week .
The Joint Chiefs have argued in favor of finding ways to ease the strain of the war in Iraq on military training and morale and to balance General Petraeus ’s plans for Iraq with the need to prepare for other potential conflicts .
A decision to suspend further reductions has already prompted criticism from Democrats in Congress , especially as the presidential primary campaign has intensified .
The two Democratic candidates , Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama , have proposed more rapid withdrawals of troops , though on different timelines .
The Republican candidate , Senator John McCain , has advocated following a policy close to that of President Bush’s .
Mr. Bush on Monday addressed the milestone of the 4,000th death during a brief statement at the State Department , where he met with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other senior aides .
In a statement that began haltingly , he expressed his sympathies for the families of those killed , both soldiers and diplomats , and sought to put their deaths in historical context .
“ I have vowed in the past , and I will vow so long as I ’m president , to make sure that those lives were not lost in vain ; that , in fact , there is a outcome that will merit the sacrifice that civilian and military alike have made ; that our strategy going forward will be aimed at making sure that we achieve victory , ” he said .
By many accounts , the addition of five combat brigades last year , which raised the American troop level to a peak of nearly 170,000 from 132,000 , was a factor in helping reduce violence in Iraq .
But Mr. Bush and his aides are described as wary of risking the gains .
Mr. Bush , according to officials , could decide to make no further reductions in troops after the departure this summer of the last of the additional troops , leaving roughly 140,000 .
That number includes the 15 combat brigades in Iraq before the troop increase , as well as additional support , training and other units that are expected to stay .

PSLV -C9 blasts off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota
( AP Photo )
SRIHARIKOTA : Setting a world record , India 's Polar rocket on Monday successfully placed ten satellites , including the country 's remote sensing satellite , into orbit in a single mission . (
)
The ten pack launch of the Indian Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) saw the 230 - tonne Polar Satellite launch Vehicle ( PSLV - C9 ) carry the heaviest luggage -- 824 kgs -- and put into orbit an Indian Mini Satellite and eight foreign nano satellites besides the Cartosat - 2A remote sensing satellite .
At the end of the 52 - hour countdown , the PSLV - C9 , with a lift - off mass of 230 tonne , blasted off from the launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre and soared into the clear sky in a textbook launch .
Fourteen minutes after lift off , the fourth stage of the ISRO 's workhorse launch vehicle , in its 13th flight , injected the ten satellites , into the 635 km polar Sun Synchronous Orbit ( SSO ) .
This is for the first time that ISRO has put ten satellites in orbit in a single launch .
This is also PSLV 's twelfth successful flight .
It is for the first time in the world that ten satellites were launched in a single mission .
Russia had earlier launched eight satellites together .
Besides the 690 kg Indian remote sensing satellite CARTOSAT - 2A and the 83 kg Indian Mini Satellite ( IMS - 1 ) , the rest eight Nano Satellites were from abroad .
This is the third time , the PSLV has been launched in the core alone version , without the six solid propellant first stage strap - on motors .
Terming the launch " satisfactory " , ISRO Chairman G Madhavan Nair said " all parameters worked wonderfully well . "
for successfully placing ten satellites into orbit in a single mission .

Why Do the Percentages Vary from Group to Group ?
The U.S. Government says that military spending amounts to 20 % of the budget , the Center for Defense Information ( CDI ) reports 51 % , the Friends Committee on National Legislation ( FCNL ) reports 43 % , and the War Resisters League claims 54 % .
Why the variation ?
Different groups have different purposes in how they present the budget figures .
WRLs goal has been to show the percentage of money that goes to the military ( current and past ) so that people paying  or not paying  their federal taxes would know what portion of their payments are military - oriented .
Also , some of the numbers are for different fiscal years .
There are at least five different factors to consider when analyzing the U.S. budget : discretionary spending vs. total spending
budget authority vs. outlays
function vs. agency / department
federal funds vs. unified budget
time period Discretionary Spending .
The Center for Defense Information ( CDI ) has used " discretionary " spending  budget items that Congress is allowed to tinker with  which excludes so - called " mandatory " spending items ( such as interest on the national debt and retirement pay ) .
WRL does not make such distinctions and lumps them together .
Past Military Spending .
If the government does not have enough money to finance a war ( or spending for its hefty military budgets ) , they borrow through loans , savings bonds , and so forth .
This borrowing ( done heavily during World War II and the Vietnam War ) comes back in later years as " hidden " military spending through interest payments on the national debt .
How much of the debt is considered military  varies from group .
As mentioned above , WRL uses 80 % whereas FCNL uses 48 % .
Consequently , FCNL reports that 43 % of the FY2007 budget is military ( 29 % current military and 14 % past military ) .
WRL 's figures are 54 % of the FY2009 budget ( 36 % current — which includes 7 % for Iraq & Afghanistan wars — and 18 % past ) .
Outlays vs. Budget Authority .
WRL uses " outlays " rather than " budget authority , " which is often preferred by the government , news media , and groups such as CDI .
Outlays refer to spending done in a particular fiscal year , whereas budget authority refers to new spending authorized over a period of several future years .
Consequently , CDI reported $ 421 billion in FY2005 budget authority for the military and $ 2,200 billion " over the next five years . "
While WRL reports outlays of $ 803 billion , plus an anticipated $ 162 billion in supplemental spending requests for Iraq and Afghanistan wars , plus $ 484 billion in past military spending  totaling $ 1,449 billion  just for FY2009 .
Function vs. Agency / Department .
Not all military spending is done by the Department of Defense .
For example , the Department of Energy is responsible for nuclear weapons .
Consequently , calculations of military spending should consider the function of the budget item regardless of the department or agency in charge of it .
However , not everyone agrees what constitutes a military function .
For example , WRL includes the 70 % of Homeland Security ( which includes the Coast Guard ) , and half of NASA in military spending , while other groups do not .
Federal Funds vs. Unified Budget .
WRL uses " federal funds " rather than the " unified budget " figures that the government prefers .
Federal funds exclude trust fund money ( e.g. , social security ) , which is raised separately ( e.g. , the FICA and Medicare deductions in paychecks ) and is specifically ear - marked for particular programs .
By combining trust funds with federal funds , the percentage of spending on the military appears smaller , a deceptive practice first used by the government in the late 1960s as the Vietnam War became more and more unpopular .
What period are we talking about ?
Finally , there is some variation in figures because different fiscal years are used .
WRLs figures ( above ) are for FY2009 ( Oct. 1 , 2008 to Sep. 30 , 2009 ) as are the most recent U.S. government figures .
FCNL sometimes does their analysis for the most recent completed year or FY2007 ( Oct. 1 , 2006 to Sep. 30 , 2007 ) .
That change does not reflect a selling of dollars , the monetary fund reports .
Rather , it captures how the dollar has fallen in value against many currencies , making the total value of dollars a smaller percentage of all money .
“ It has n’t been an active diversification , ” said John Lipsky , first deputy managing director at the fund .
“ Central bankers tend to be the most conservative investors .
Whatever they do is going to be done with exceeding caution . ”
Now , however , people in international financial circles detect a subtle shifting of the ground in confidence about the dollar .
A few years ago , the suggestion that another currency could rival the dollar would have been ridiculed .
Today , some economists say the dollar could begin surrendering some of the advantages of dominance to the euro over the next decade or two .
Longer term , the dollar could find itself eclipsed by China ’s yuan as the primary money in usage in the world .
For Americans , losing that status could be painful , sending interest rates higher and raising the costs of buying homes and cars .
A country that has been operating with essentially unlimited credit might have learn to live within a budget .
But many economists say that chatter about the demise of the dollar is overblown .
The United States , despite its problems , has been a remarkably solid place to put money , making it singularly able to attract savings , they point out .
The dollar is likely to continue to shed value , and the American economy will grow far slower than India ’s and China ’s , they acknowledge .
Yet the dollar , they argue , remains one of the few entities that seem to have fundamental staying power in an age of risk and obsolescence .
The size of the United States military alone reinforces confidence that America will endure to honor its debts .
Yes , foreigners have been lending alarming amounts of money to Americans , who have spent extravagantly in excess of their means , economists say .
One day , balance will be restored in line with the basic laws of economics  perhaps chaotically , and probably via a substantial fall in the dollar ’s value .
But “ one day ” could well get pushed into the future for a long time to come , for the simple reason that codependence governs the global economy :
The current flows of capital lubricate world commerce , giving the American consumer the wherewithal to keep buying ; those purchases , in turn , generate business and employment from Asia to Latin America .
When Americans head to the mall , backed by foreign largesse , they drive there burning gasoline made from oil pumped abroad , notably the Middle East .
They drive home carrying electronics and clothing churned out in Chinese and Japanese factories .
Making these goods absorbs commodities  energy from Australia and Africa ; cotton from Texas and California ; iron ore from Brazil and India .

According to the astronomers the message is expected to arrive in 2015 from live forms from the Altair solar system .
They say that the message will be the response to a radio - wave signal , which had been sent to Altair a quarter century ago by Hisashi Hirabayashi , a Japanese astronomer .
According to Mr. Hirabayashi the response is likely to arrive in 2015 .
This is in case the intelligent beings received the message decoded it and sent an instant response .
It is worth mentioning that Altair is located 16 light - years from our planet .
Hisashi Hirabayashi worked as a scientist at the University of Tokyo Astronomical Observatory .
Currently this institution is called National Astronomical Observatory of Japan .
In 1983 , together with his colleague Masaki Morimoto , he sent the message using a US radio telescope .
It was the period when the Japanese celebrated the Tanabata holiday , which is a traditional festival that marks the meeting in the night sky of Vega and Altair , two stars symbolizing goddess Orihime and god Hikoboshi respectively .
Astronomers consider that their message has reached Altair in 1999 .
It included 13 binary - encoded images , each image measuring 71 x 71 pixels and illustrating the features of our solar system , the position of our planet , known chemical elements , whole numbers and the basis structure of human DNA .
Scientists also tried to explain the way life forms biologically evolved on Earth .
According to the theories provided by Mr. Hirabayashi in case the level of aliens ' intelligence is high enough to receive and decode the message , they will be able to send a reply .
However , he is still skeptical about the actual response from aliens .
" I believe aliens exist , but they are difficult to find .
We have n't even observed any planets around Altair , so it is highly unlikely we will receive a response , " he said .
Recently the images sent by the astronomer have been revealed , being missed for many years .
Morimoto , working at the , discovered that among other images sent to Altair there was one that included the molecular formula for ethanol , featuring the kanji characters referring to kanpai , which is a Japanese toast of " cheers ! " along with the English word " toast . "
According to Hirabayashi , he came up with the idea when having a drink and jokes that there 's little chance that aliens will get that part of the message .

CAPE TOWN , South Africa
South Africa is taking stock after two weeks of xenophobic riots .
By the latest count , 50 people have been killed and thousands injured .
Over 600 rioters have been arrested as the violence spread through all nine of the country 's provinces .
The images are shocking .
Large , well - armed mobs of black people rampage through the townships , even the center of the commercial capital , Johannesburg .
The necklace ( burning tire ) style of killing , so familiar from the civil strife that swept the country in the early 1990s , has made a horrific return .
The plight of the foreign Africans has been desperate , with some 30,000 displaced and many of their shops and shacks ransacked or destroyed ; unknown thousands have gone back home .
The damage to South Africa 's image both within Africa and beyond is very large .
Perhaps worst of all , the riots have raised the question of whether the country really made a miraculously peaceful transition from apartheid to multiracial democracy , as so widely trumpeted , 14 years ago .
In a ghostly reversal of history , mobs are once more in the streets , and as in apartheid days , the military has been called out to control them .
The ruling African National Congress is used to thinking of large , politically mobilized township mobs as masses demanding democracy , and the soldiers out to bring them into submission the instrument of apartheid oppression .
Now the roles are reversed , posing some disturbing thoughts about whether one has viewed the past correctly .
Certainly the sight of workers attacking workers is a nightmare for the left .
The greater fear is that this could all easily spill over into intra-South African tribal conflict .
Nobody knows how many illegal immigrants there are in South Africa .
Most estimates suggest that up to four million Zimbabweans have fled here from Robert Mugabe 's rule of brutality and enforced poverty .
Mozambicans make up the second - largest group .
But South Africa 's borders are porous and there are also large numbers of people from Malawi , Nigeria , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Somalia and elsewhere in Africa .
At a bare minimum there must be five million such illegals , though some think there are twice that number .
Xenophobia is not new -- over 30 Somali shopkeepers were murdered in Cape Town in the last two years -- but the country has not witnessed civil strife on anything like this scale before .
The causes are obvious .
A Markinor survey earlier this month found that only 42 % of South Africans had jobs .
Millions are housed in shacks lacking many basic amenities .
It is now winter here and at night on the Gold Reef , on which Johannesburg was built , temperatures can fall below freezing , so the homeless can no longer live on the streets .
In addition , soaring food prices and shortages of maize , the African staple , have left many hungry .
Tempers have frayed and many point to foreigners as a major source of crime .

The WFP helps feed 70 million people " A silent tsunami which knows no borders sweeping the world " .
That is how the head of the UN World Food Programme ( WFP ) summed up the global food shortages .
It is certainly a storm that has hit with little warning and has plunged an extra 100 million people into poverty .
The crisis has triggered riots in Haiti , Cameroon , Indonesia and Egypt and is deemed a dangerous threat to stability .
It is not so much famine that is the worry , it is widespread misery and malnutrition .
The WFP 's biggest concern is for the people living on 50 cents a day who have nothing to fall back on .
Budget shortfall Amongst these are the 70 million people the organisation helps with food aid .
The costs of that aid have risen so sharply the WFP is now facing a $ 750 m ( £ 377 m ) shortfall in its budget .
It means some of their programmes may have to be cut and rations reduced .
So why have food prices soared ?
The rises are due to a lethal combination of high fuel costs , bad weather in key food producing countries , the increase in land allocated to bio-fuels , and a surge in demand - much of it from the rising middle classes of China and India .
Agriculture stopped being sexy , it was all about unglamorous logistics
Amy Barry
Oxfam
The problem is that once the price of rice or wheat has risen , other factors kick in which make things worse .
There is panic and people start hoarding , speculators buy up supply , and food producing countries impose export controls to try and preserve food for their own people .
This then means less is available to be exported to countries which rely on food imports .
What can be done to solve the crisis ?
On an optimistic note , WFP head Josette Sheeran said she was confident the world could produce the food it needed , it was just a question of riding this difficult period and getting enough resources to invest .
Planting less
But it is not going to be a quick fix .
She used the example of Kenya 's Rift Valley where farmers even now are planting a third less of the land than last year .
This is because fertiliser has more than doubled in price .
" Soaring food prices should be a wake - up call for the world to make long term investment in the food supply chain , " she said .
Small farmers are unable to deliver more food without that investment .
Rising food prices have caused turmoil in many countries
It is their plight , struggling with poor land , inadequate tools and lack of transport , that has made it so difficult for them to come out of poverty .
Amy Barry from Oxfam feels agriculture has been badly neglected .
" Agriculture stopped being sexy , it was all about unglamorous logistics , " she said .
" The focus was more on delivering health and education services .
That has to change . "
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has long put a high priority on helping the poor in developing countries .
In London on Tuesday he convened a meeting of food experts to try to come up with solutions .
He has called for a global review of bio-fuels policy and offered $ 900 million in extra aid .
Mr Brown said rising food prices posed as great a threat to world prosperity as the global credit crisis and warned that they threatened to reverse progress made to alleviate poverty .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks surged Tuesday , with the Dow jumping close to 400 points on the first day of the new quarter , as investors cheered signs that the companies hit hardest by the credit market crisis seem to be working through the problems .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) rose 391 points or 3.2 % .
It was the Dow 's third best day of the year on a point and percentage basis .
The broader Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index gained 47 points or 3.6 % .
It was the S&P 500's second best day of the year on a point basis and the third best day on a percentage basis .
The Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) jumped 84 points or 3.7 % and saw its third best day of the year on both a point and percentage basis .
Wall Street reacted Tuesday to a bevy of positive developments , including a stronger U.S. dollar , better - than - expected readings on manufacturing and construction , and signs that the hard - hit financial sector is starting to recover .
" I think there 's a sense that more of the pieces are being put in place that will repair our financial system , " said J. Stephen Lauck , president and CEO at Ashfield Capital Partners .
" It 's a lengthy process , but I think the market is starting to see that it is underway . "
Since the start of the year , one of the big issues has been the uncertainty about how hard the banks will be hit by the credit crisis and when they will start to move beyond it , said Art Hogan , chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co .
He said that one of the hopes has been that " we 'll get through the first - quarter earnings and see a light at the end of the tunnel . "
Some of the developments Tuesday seemed to support such hopes , including news that Lehman Brothers is raising cash and the fact that both UBS and Deutsche Bank announced writedowns .
UBS and Deutsche Bank are European banks and Hogan said that psychologically that 's important for investors .
" A lot of what has been going on in the credit derivatives market has been laid on the back of the U.S. and the U.S. dollar , " Hogan said .
" Today we 're getting a sense that it 's broader and we 're seeing a recovery in the dollar and in the financial stocks . "
Whether the stock advance can continue over the next few weeks will depend on a few factors .
In the next two weeks , companies will continue to " pre-announce " earnings that are notably stronger or notably weaker than forecast .
A lot of critical economic reports are due , including Friday 's March jobs report .
Stocks rose Monday on falling oil prices and the Bush administration 's proposed financial regulation overhaul .
Monday was the last day of a brutal first quarter in which recession fears sent the Dow down 7.6 % , the S&P 500 down almost 10 % and the Nasdaq down just over 14 % .
Banks and mortgage lenders .
Lehman Brothers ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) said it will raise a higher - than - expected $ 4 billion in preferred stock , due to stronger - than - expected demand , sending shares almost 18 % higher .
UBS ( UBS ) said that it will seek $ 15.1 billion in new capital .
The Swiss bank also warned that it will take a steep first - quarter loss , write down $ 19 billion related to bad mortgage bets and said that its chairman is stepping down .
UBS jumped 14.6 % .
Deutsche Bank ( DB ) said it would write down about $ 4 billion in the quarter , related to bad mortgage bets , sending shares about 3 % higher .
Thornburg Mortgage ( TMA ) said it raised $ 1.35 billion in an offering , sending its stock 13 % higher .
Other big bank stocks jumped as well .
Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) rose rose over 11 % , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) rose close to 8 % , JP Morgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) rose over 9 % .
But gains were broader based , with all 30 Dow components rising .
Tech gainers Tuesday included Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) , Intel ( INTC , Fortune 500 ) , Hewlett - Packard ( HPQ , Fortune 500 ) , Oracle ( ORCL , Fortune 500 ) , Cisco Systems ( CSCO , Fortune 500 ) and eBay ( EBAY , Fortune 500 ) .
On the downside , reports showed that U.S. auto sales continued to slide in March , including Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) , which saw its U.S. sales slump 14 % .
( Full story ) .
Market breadth was positive .
On the New York Stock Exchange , winners topped losers by over 5 to 1 on volume of around 1.70 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , advancers topped decliners by almost 3 to 1 on volume of around 2.16 billion shares .
Economic news .
The ISM 's manufacturing index rose to 48.6 in March , from 48.3 in February , surprising economists who thought it would fall to 47.5 , on average .
Nonetheless , any reading below 50 indicates weakness in the sector .
Another report showed that construction spending fell 0.3 % in February , after falling 1 % in January .
Economists thought spending would fall 0.9 % in February .
Commodity prices .
A rising dollar sent oil and metal prices lower , providing investors with some relief on the inflation front .
U.S. light , crude oil for May delivery fell 60 cents to settle at $ 100.98 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
COMEX gold for April delivery fell $ 33.30 to settle at $ 882.90 an ounce .
Other markets .
The dollar rose versus the euro and the yen .
Treasury prices tanked , raising the yield on the benchmark 10 - year note to 3.56 % from 3.41 % late Monday .
Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions .
Selected for the 2004 National Film Registry of " culturally , historically and aesthetically significant " motion pictures .

It was all a mess becaus of the former economical crisis .
2. Nukes on Cuba .
Yeah , but you were not told , that there were nukes in turkey first .
Your nukes aimed at UDSSR .
Thats how propaganda works and if you still don´t get it in times when information is accessable for all , it will lead to point 3 .

Why does society continually experience threats whether actual or just perceived ?
I 've seen this film at times over the years and the obvious question is why does society have to be continually scared of something .
Back then it was the atomic bomb , earlier still it was war with Germany and Japan , still later it was the domino theory and the Vietnam war now it 's terrorism in all its various guises .
Today , you can't travel anywhere , especially overseas or across borders without ordinary citizens encountering security infrastructure that 's befitting of a prison .
Then there is the Web / Internet , it 's monitored and continually under surveillance .
Surveillance is becoming all - pervasive and it's getting worse .
Surely , these are not the actions of a free society at ease with itself .
This 60 - year film old shows us that the fundamental underlying issue is not new , and today there is still no sign of it abating .
What is it that we are continually doing wrong in that we 've always enemies or some perceived threat against us ?
What does society have to do to rid itself of these big bogeymen once and for all ?
Maybe -- just perhaps -- it 's never possible .

I had studied a little about the atomic bomb and refused to drop .
My teacher pointed at me and said , " You 're dead . "
I replied , " If this were an atomic bomb attack , we 're all dead ! "

Subject : Threat , enemy , fear , heroes ...
Four keys to the American mind ?
In first : English is not my mother tongue .
In second : I 'm French .
In third : the following will certainly hurt
some American inmates .
My goal is certainly not
to do that : I only want to point out what
seems to be " a bit strange " to /a/ foreigner ,
regarding your point of view on " foreign enemy " .
So , I just red the whole reviews .
Most of focuses
on the effectiveness of " duck and cover " .
I will
respond on that the gesture is good enough to protect against alpha radiations and most of
projectiles ( provided you are away enough from
" point zero " ) .
What I think a more important point is that
American people needs scary .
For eras .
He needs
also enemy , and it 's threat .
And needs heroes too .
Look at the movie we speak on , try to focus on
these four points .
Go back to this review .
Good ...
In the fifties , the enemy was USSR , and , more ,
communism .
He was far from America ( but also
/ in/ America , and I cannot understand why
* a politic opinion * , especially regarding the US
Constitution , has been criminal ) .
But the
atomic bomb threat : what a good occasion to
give nightmares to the people .
Enemy is here ,
just next door : sleep in fear , people ... that 's
why we fight against him , bringing your
young mens so far from home , bringing back them
with medals ( back to heroes ) .
Sometimes in bags .
The nightmare today is terrorism .
It is a
nightmare all around the world , I have too
agree with that .
Is French people scary on ?
Maybe a
few of them , as so as few of them , second or
third generation of immigrants , disappointed by their " no future life " , and manipulated by
little groups of Salafis extremists , ARE
terrorists , even they go to Iraq or Afghanistan
to export the fear abroad , and , more , kill
( American soldiers , French soldiers , and even
natives , if they do n't agree with their
point of view ) .
That 's the sad truth .
So .
Do French people worry about Islamic terrorists attacks ?
Certainly : there were a
set of around the end of the nineties in Paris ,
notably in the subway .
We loosed also about 90 soldiers at once in the " Drakkar " attack , in Lebanon .
OK , true : nothing to do with 3,000 persons
killed in the NYC towers and Pentagon .
I condole
to the kinfolks .
But remember the four points
raised by the media , and later by government :
threat , scary , enemies , heroes .
On the other way , both France and America has
caused tens of thousands deaths by their abroad
politic .
By paternalism ( Africa ) and economical
interest ( North Africa ; south east Asia ... )
for the first , by ideology ( south America ; south east Asia , central Asia as a war against Russia
in the ' 80s ) and economical interest ( Iraq , ... ) ,
too , for the second .
We pay through the nose .
So :
[ " we " stands for " I , French " ]
Do we worry day - to - day about an attack ?
No .
Do we think that Islam _fundamentalism_ has to
be dropped out from the face of the world ?
Opinions are divided , but generally : yes .
Do we think terrorism has to be kicked - off ?
Obviously yes , while direct confrontation
generates escalation , and population ,
caught in the crossfire , fatally elects the
stranger as the enemy ( so , _we_ are the enemy )
Do we think we have enemies ?
All that I know is
I 'm my better one .
Do we need heroes ?
The less possible ...
If perchance I go to Afghanistan , anyone will be
my enemy ?
Potentially , yes .
In short , for a French , to speak generally :
* to be killed or injured is a question of
statistics and risk taken , and
NEVER a collective fear .
* there is no Universal Enemy .
* there are no heroes , just circumstances .
* kick - off the threat as needed .
Just as needed .
And for you , American ? - July 1 , 2009

We practised this everyday in the classroom and out on the playground .
I attended Natural Bridge School then and I remember a tree in the middle of the playground .
My whole class would be ' hugged ' around that tree many times .
Now that I have children , it is frightening to realize how very little the government , that is JFK , thought of the everyday Joe .
I remember having nightmares of being burned alive and even now have made note in my will that I do not want to be cremated .
To watch my children grow up and see their innocence , knowing that the information in this film would have been taken as gospel because it came from the Almighty Government really brings it home .
Also knowing that ' duck and cover ' should have read ' kiss your a -- goodbye ' .
The threat now is even greater than during the 50's and 60's , what with quick global travel , terrorists h--- bent on destroying everyone but themselves and governments too soft to take the hard - nosed approach civil safety .
But the world today , have more choices , and in most cases can make those choices as they wish .
With instant CNN news feeds , Internet blogs , text messaging , etc. troubling events can be quickly disseminated giving time to react safely .
On a sad note , for the government of that era , it gave the people something to do in the event of Atomic War , hence no panicked crowds for the government to deal with .
It also made them feel grateful that the government really cared about the welfare of their country 's populace .

The main point to get from this , it seems to me , is that one of of creating a sense of community is by dramatising ( and exaggerating ) external threats .
Don Delillo , in Underworld , remembers the dog - tags that some children were given so that in the case of nuclear holocaust , their little charred bodies would be identifiable .
At this point , surely , we must agree that the propagandists ' objective is not to educate and save lives , but to drive the image into parents ' heads of their child , killed by a Soviet bomb ; a political objective by the govt , achieved through fear , even the mental torture of its own citizens .

I remember being in the third grade when this film was made in 1951 .
We use to practice the drill in school on a regular bases .
We were also given army type " dog " ( I.D. ) tags which hung from a neck chain around our neck .
This film tried to help the children of that era .
It was effective for its time .

Subject : Duck and cover First and foremost , I would like to state that there is scientific basis in this film .
The pressure wave from a 20 kt nuclear bomb ( hiroshima sized ) will go out to approximately 5 km on a clear day with flat terrain , while the radiation and heat will cause harm at approximately 2 km .
Thus ducking and covering will protect the majority of those affected by a nuclear blast .
As ducking and covering will reduce the harm caused by flying debris .
It is still advocated for that reason today in tornado and earthquake prone areas .
Secondly this film takes us back to the day when threat that faced America menacing in the backdrop .
The Korean war was in progress and the nuclear armed communists had invaded South Korea .
Here we have a film that tries to explain to the children how we as the adults have opened the pandoras box .
It is a film that brings the message to the children that we as humans , both young and old , are capable of doing the most utterly horrendous things to each other .
The message in this film comes across simply and others may mock it .
But it is a fil with a pained and difficult message .
As I watch this now in the wake of the islamist horrorshow in London .
It reminds some types people have not learnt the lesson of the past .
If we as a species love out children , and never want to be forced to bring them the same message we have brought them for each and every generation , by film , by word , or cnn , we must forever learn ; never again .

Subject : Wow .
This film really showed a lot of hard times and good points .
Though it might seem useless to " DUCK and COVER , " a lot of people who were killed by the bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were due to flying debris and infections from debris wounds ( such as glass flying through the air , etc ) .
Also , these bombs were made to explode before they hit the ground so there would be more destruction .
The shockwave would easily be enough to knock someone down , if not more , but if they were near low ground and away from windows and things that can fall , ducking and covering would actually increase their chance of survival by a lot .
Also , there is no real protection against an atomic bomb ; if you have read Hiroshima , you know that some people that were barely inside the bombs ' radius died instantly , despite good health , while some people that were less healthy and close to the blast survived .
If there were an atomic blast in America around the time this film was show to students , those who followed its advice would have most likely increased their chances of survival by quite a bit .

Subject : Totally unrealistic , but entertaining .
This film always cracks me up when I 'm watching it .
The animation is pretty good for an early 50s film , slightly resembling the animation of the old Warner Bros. cartoons .
I also think that today , the " Duck and Cover " bit would n't work during a bomb blast .
However , this was 1951 , before the first perfect hydrogen bomb was produced , WAY more powerful than the atomic bomb !
The simulated " blasts " are corny .
It 's mostly just a quick , harmless - looking blinding flash .
In reality , there WOULD be the flash , but it could burn people .
We 'd also hear the " KABOOM ! " of the bomb exploding , and , we might be able to see the mushroom cloud .
Then there 's the radioactivity and heat , which the producers left out describing !
THAT is a serious problem , you know .
You 'll also notice that people in the background do n't even CARE about the blasts and such .
Now , a newspaper or thin cloth may not protect you , but at least this film is a definite must - see !

The year is 1951 .
Not a year earlier , and not a year later .
1951 .
In 1951 , the Soviets had but a handful of nuclear weapons ( all fission devices ) and the most probably delivery system was the TU - 4 Bull , a knockoff of the Boeing B - 29 .
Crawling over the north pole at 300 miles an hour , it would have taken aeons to get to US airspace .
There would have been no full - blown Armageddon in 1951 .
Cities would have been destroyed and several million people killed , but for most people , life would have carried on very nicely .
A far cry from the situation as of the early 1970s , when thousands of ICBMs were on constant alert and mass extermination was in the offing with less than an hours notice .
And even then , the basic advice in this film could have significantly improved your chance of survival ( in the short term ... you need to DL a film on fallout shelters to realy stand a chance :)

Subject : Duck and Cover I also recall seeing this film while a student in Brooklyn in the 1960's .
The dread of the atomic bomb was the equivalent of Antrax and chemical weapons or dirty bombs now .
Then as now , there was a need to feel a sense of control and understanding to make life tolerable .
One can look at the price of gasmasks and filter on eBay and correlate them with 9 - 11 or subsequent threats .
We all need something to make us feel secure .
And how many people made a run for duct tape and plastic wrap so that they could " duct and cover " their attics ?
Incidentally , I do n't think that all of the information is ridiculous in the film .
Although it is obvious laughable to think newspaper can prevent radiation burns , if a bomb explodes some distance away , you had better be prepared to get next to a wall or under a desk and away from windows .
Would we survive an atomic bomb ?
Certainly there were survivors in Hiroshima , but also there were shadows left on walls and pavement .
That 's not the point .
The point is that we have become largely complacent in America feeling either that we are protected by oceans or military might or because we are battling the terrorists " over there . "
We do n't often give thought to the idea that we might have to take some kind of practical action .
I hope that we will always be able to afford to look at films such as Duck and Cover as silly and naive and that we never are forced to think about how we handle air raids or strafing runs or the aftermath of catastrophe practically .

The threat of global nuclear war was closer than ever , and thinking that this little film was part of some campaign to promote consumerism is complete nonsense .

It I am haunted by the little jingle of the movie .
I still sing it in my head .
My initial encounter with " Duck & Cover " occurred years ago while watching an amazingly insightful film " The Atomic Cafe " .
Perhaps one of the best film documentaries to date on World War II propoganda related to the Atomic Bomb .
In TAC , clips of D&C were interspersed with actual footage of atomic blasts laying waste to cities .
You do n't know whether you should laugh or cry at the disparities between the two .
I had wondered if those old war training films had been manipulated in any way .
I guess they were n't .
Most importantly , D&C definitely serves as a reminder to question , even now , the validity of information we are presented for public consumption .

It is sad to read some of the myopic review that have no sense of historical context for the material they are so quick to dismiss .
As we took Civil defense class in grammer school and watched this and other films , we knew and were told how bleak the prospects were for survival in the advent of a nuclear war .
But with the same instinct for survival in the face of the worst obsticles that drove creatures to climb out of the primordial slime and yes , even build the bombs we lived in constant fear of , we learned how to fortify out basements as fallout shelters , use household bleach to purify the water from toilet tanks and even treat the symptoms of the radiation sickness that would inevatibly kill us .
The people who made these films were n't selling anything that is n't sold in the Hospices across the world every day ; a way to keep going with pride and dignity even when hope cannot rationally be measured beyond your next breath .

Its easy to say how horrible the U.S. government is , especially today as its very politically correct to spout this garbage .
I grew up in a country that won the cold war by being strong and out - spending the enemy to the point that the wall fell and the iron fist of the Soviet Union is gone .
Hmmm I guess it would have been better to let them do their own thing and mind our own business .
How often do you worry about the nuclear threat now ?
This movie was designed to help children deal with what was in the papers every day , the threat of nuclear war .
Given something to do , as minimal as survival would be , helped ease the fears of children who regularly heard that the bomb could drop any minute .
Ours is not a perfect country or government .
But , name a better one .
Name one that has helped preserve freedom and liberty for hundreds of other nations as well as for itself .
Name one other country that has so many races , cultures and religions and lives in relative peace with eachother .
If you are from another country and love to criticise the United states of America , let me ask you , " Has the USA ever helped your country in time of war , natural disaster or financial trouble ?

I found the innacuraccy with which the effects of the atom bomb were portrayed to be quite amusing .
They talk about how the bomb can rip through buildings and collapse them , although they seem to have given no thought to the the intensity of the radiation in the blast radius .
' Duck and Cover ' would do nothing for you when the supercharged electron and gamma radiation penetrates through your clothes .
Where did they get this information , anyway ?
Did they test the atom bomb on humans or animals to see what would protect them and what would n't ?
I suppose they were anticipating that the Americans would be gullible enough to believe that they were ' protected ' .
After all , look how quickly stores ran out of duct tape when Bush told them to wrap a room of their house in duct tape to protect from terrorist bombs .
I mean , who would actually believe that ( please take no offense at the last sentence if you happen to be one of those who followed his advice . )

Subject : Film Relevant Today , Shows Corruption of the Government The ' Duck and Cover ' US Civil Defense film from the 1950's shows the US government was as corrupt then as it is now .
The point of the film was to prepare the citizens of the USA for nuclear war with the Soviet Union , which Curtis LeMay and other military leaders of that time actively supported as a winning strategy .
It is wonderful how ' nuclear bombs ' are framed in the film as just another natural hazard of life that the citizens of the USA must ' get used to ' , like fires or car accidents .
This removes the responsibility of the politicians to do anything about avoiding nuclear war .
Similar to ' terrorism ' today , the threats of nuclear war were largely a creation of US government actions .
Gore Vidal has written on the subject of the ' Cold War ' and says it was largely a creation of US policy and a means to US global empire .
Similarly today , the US government puts it 's citizens at risk due to it 's aggression in other parts of the world , and the inevitable asymmetric response of ' terror ' attacks by those on the receiving end of empire .
It would have been much less expensive , in lives and money , and probably just as effective if the Bush administration had re-released an updated film like ' Duck and Cover ' to ' protect ' us from the ' terrorists ' .
Skip the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , and the Homeland Security Department .
The safest solution for the citizens of the US would be to elect a government that did not endanger it 's citizens with nuclear wars , or ' perpetual war ' for oil .

BBC News , Kabul
There are different soldiers behind the gun , but the task ahead of them is just as daunting
Enlarge Image
Twenty years ago today the tanks and armoured cars started to rumble north out of Kabul as the Soviet Union began its withdrawal from Afghanistan after eight - and - a - half years of war .
The mujahideen , backed by money and weapons from an alliance of the United States , Britain , Pakistan and Saudi Arabia , had beaten a world superpower .
Today the country is scattered with reminders of the Soviet occupation - you do n't have to go far even in Kabul to stumble across the rusting wrecks they left behind .
The aptly named Zamir Kabulov first arrived in Afghanistan as a young Soviet diplomat in 1977 and has lived through the last turbulent 30 years of this country 's misfortunes .
Same mistakes
Now he is Russian ambassador in Kabul and his voice of experience will ring in the ears of today 's Nato - and US - led forces .
" There is no mistake made by the Soviet Union that was not repeated by the international community here in Afghanistan , " Mr Kabulov said , listing the problems .
A British flag flies over a former Soviet outpost in Helmand province " Underestimation of the Afghan nation , the belief that we have superiority over Afghans and that they are inferior and they can not be trusted to run affairs in this country . "
His list goes on .
" A lack of knowledge of the social and ethnic structure of this country ; a lack of sufficient understanding of traditions and religion . "
Not only that , but he says the country 's new patrons are making their own new mistakes as well .
" Nato soldiers and officers alienate themselves from Afghans - they are not in touch in an everyday manner .
They communicate with them from the barrels of guns in their bullet - proof Humvees . "
And he admits to some satisfaction , watching those who once backed the mujahideen now suffering in the same way .
" To some extent , yes , I would not hide that .
But I am even more satisfied by not having Russian soldiers among Isaf [ Nato 's International Security Assistance Force ] because I do n't want them to suffer the same results , implications your soldiers are suffering . "
After the Soviet withdrawal the mujahideen turned on each other and tore Afghanistan apart .
Kabul crumbled in the civil war as the various factions rocketed at each other across the city , killing thousands of civilians .
' Killing innocents ' Ahmad Shah Ahmadzai , a mujahideen leader and prime minister in exile during the 1990s , admits they failed in the years following the Soviet withdrawal .
He is now an opponent of the government who stood against President Hamid Karzai in the last election and also draws parallels between the 1980s and the current international mission .
They were wrong then and the present Nato forces are doing wrong now
Ahmad Shah Ahmadzai
Former mujahideen leader " The Russians were beaten because they invaded our country .
They were the transgressors , not us , " he said .
And asked how the Soviet occupation compared to today 's mission : " To my opinion the ground situation is no different because the Soviets were imposing their Communist regime on us .
The present forces - they are imposing their so - called democracy on us .
" They were wrong then and the present Nato forces are doing wrong now by killing innocent people - men , women and children . "
Nato commanders object to this and say they are doing everything they can to stop civilian casualties , arguing they are making military progress against the insurgents .
" They are winning the battles but losing the war , " ambassador Kabulov said , explaining that things are even harder now than they were in the 1980s .
" The structures of government then were very much there and our task was very much was to support and to win loyalty - or , if you will , hearts and minds - but we had a working administration . "
Fresh wrecks ?
In Helmand province British forces in Kajaki are fighting from positions originally built by the Soviets .
Uncomfortable reminders of wars gone by in this tank graveyard
There are wrecks of armoured vehicles rusting in irrigation ditches in the same places they are now fighting the Taleban .
They are fighting over the same patches of land .
" We did n't bother to collect the wrecks of our burned tanks and other vehicles but you do - you are more resourceful perhaps , or maybe you have fewer losses , " the ambassador said .
" But if things continue going the wrong way , as they are now , come back in two years and you will find plenty of your own wrecks . "
A negative , sobering but very well - informed opinion - and the kind that is often ignored .

But it was not to be .
Indeed , the Biden campaign was covered more for its missteps than anything else .
Chris Dodd , also a serious candidate with a distinguished record , received much the same treatment .
I suspect that there was more coverage of the burglary at his campaign office in Hartford than of any other single event during his run other than his entering and leaving the campaign .
Who is responsible for the veil of silence over Senator Biden ?
Or Senator Dodd ?
Or Gov. Tom Vilsack ?
Or Senator Sam Brownback on the Republican side ?
The decision was probably made by the same people who decided that Fred Thompson was a serious candidate .
Articles purporting to be news spent thousands upon thousands of words contemplating whether he would enter the race , to the point that before he even entered , he was running second in the national polls for the Republican nomination .
Second place !
And he had not done or said anything that would allow anyone to conclude he was a serious candidate .
A major weekly news magazine put Mr. Thompson on its cover , asking — honestly ! — whether the absence of a serious campaign and commitment to raising money or getting his policies out was itself a strategy .
I ’m not the only one who noticed this shallow news coverage .
A report by the Project for Excellence in Journalism and the Shorenstein Center on the Press , Politics and Public Policy found that during the early months of the 2008 presidential campaign , 63 percent of the campaign stories focused on political strategy while only 15 percent discussed the candidates ’ ideas and proposals .
Watching the campaign unfold , I saw how the press gravitated toward a narrative template for the campaign , searching out characters as if for a novel : on one side , a self - described 9/11 hero with a colorful personal life , a former senator who had played a president in the movies , a genuine war hero with a stunning wife and an intriguing temperament , and a handsome governor with a beautiful family and a high school sweetheart as his bride .
And on the other side , a senator who had been first lady , a young African - American senator with an Ivy League diploma , a Hispanic governor with a self - deprecating sense of humor and even a former senator from the South standing loyally beside his ill wife .
Issues that could make a difference in the lives of Americans did n’t fit into the narrative template and , therefore , took a back seat to these superficialities .
News is different from other programming on television or other content in print .
It is essential to an informed electorate .
And an informed electorate is essential to freedom itself .
But as long as corporations to which news gathering is not the primary source of income or expertise get to decide what information about the candidates “ sells , ” we are not functioning as well as we could if we had the engaged , skeptical press we deserve .
Egypt : Climbing the Pyramids
13th October 1992 , Cairo Finally !
It 's begun !
I flew into Cairo on October 12th and met Rich , who 's been traveling on the Continent for the last six weeks , at the Nile Hilton at midnight .
Sat there and caught up with Rich until 3:45 A.M. when Sarah , our flatmate from New Zealand , arrived .
I booked her her ticket , but did n't get a chance to fully investigate her ticket as much as I should have .
It turns out her flight left London and flew to Bucharest ( Romania ) then after a layover she boarded a second flight Bucharest to Cairo - Whoops !
Sarah 's been a good sport about my mix up - we have been flatting in London together for the last year so we 've grown close enough to overlook things like my not really knowing what I was talking about when I told her to pay for her Air Romania flight before I had my ticket .
Sarah had evidently had a few bottles of rum to drink with a couple of Australians during the two hour lay over in Romania and she was definitely showing the effects of a binge .
She sat and chatted with us in the Hilton for a few minutes before excusing herself to go to the women 's loo to be sick .
Once she was finished we got a cab outside , complete with a driver who did n't speak much English and absolutely refused to take us to the hotel we 'd requested .
We ended up driving all over Cairo with our driver depositing us at various hotels that belonged to his brother or cousin or someone .
They all wanted insane prices like US $ 30 per night , so we were n't going to have anything to do with them whatsoever .
He finally dropped us off at a hotel we 'd requested only after all three of us were screaming as loudly as possible at our driver .
( Welcome to the Third World . )
He dropped us off outside this backpacker 's place where we were met by yet another Egyptian dude .
He led us into the elevator , sans door , and complete with skull and crossbones over the door stating that it would be detrimental to one 's health if more than three people got into the elevator at one time .
I guess the Egyptian guy could n't decipher the 1 X 1 foot death symbol because he climbed into the elevator with us and tried to grope Sarah the entire ride up to the Fourth floor of the building .
We got our room and laid down to sleep just as the first set of Islamic mosques was firing up their loud speakers to chant the day 's first prayer .
Our room was n't bad - three beds , a fan and a balcony overlooking the street .
Of course it was 5:00 o'clock in the morning so all I could spot was the rooster in the next building over .
He looked as though he was ready to start a crowing .
14th October 1992 , Cairo
Our first day in Cairo we headed over to the grand bazaar for the day , and the first thing that I noticed was that it exemplified everything I 'd ever imagined about Egypt ; the hustle and bustle , small back alleys full of spices and materials , the people selling their wares , and the tea boys making their way through the crowd delivering the merchant 's their afternoon tea .
I 'd heard about the main market from Melinda , and now that I was there I was seeing the images she 'd described to me during the months previous .
We wandered through the throngs of people - gawking at the women dressed in their robes ( head to toe , showing only the eyes ) while balancing a huge basket of vegetables or other items on their heads .
We made our way into a small back alley which was solely full of spice sellers .
The smell wafted down the narrow corridor and my nose could n't distinguish one smell out of the fifty or so that I was inhaling .
The Egyptian sellers kept putting small amounts of the spices in our hands to [ MISSING TEXT HERE ] smell .
As Westerners here everyone knows we 're not locals ( obviously , nor could we even pretend to pass for one ) so they 'd call out to us as we walked by their stalls .
Buy this , try that - it was coming from every direction .
I can't say I was particularly disturbed by any of it , it was just so different from anything I 'd ever experienced before .
While we were walking around the city I noticed all the Egyptian men were staring at Sarah .
Granted she 's a 6 foot tall , beautiful Western woman walking down the street , and she turned a lot of heads .
She was rather content to know that Rich and I were usually on either side of her so no Egyptian men could alter their paths of walking and " accidentally " bump into her and rub her chest .
We did meet other women who'd had that type of problem , but not Sarah - she was in good hands .
The Egyptians were all generally very friendly .
When we were looking for a monument or a certain street there 's always be some man who'd come up to us and help us with the directions .
The funny thing was that they 'd always give us the directions , then , after they 'd helped us , ask us to come visit their perfume shop " just down the street " .
It was always the same .
The children there all wanted to practice their English , so sometimes when we would be walking down the street the kids nearby would scream " Hello ! " at the top of their lungs .
We 'd just appease them and call Hi back to them .
I know now as I write this that I was a bit nervous being there and was n't going to be holding any conversations with anyone without a reason .
As I traveled more and more and got used to being stared at I would talk to whoever was nearby ; they would always be delighted to be able to practice their English .
15th October 1992 , Cairo
We were all exhausted from going to bed at 4 : 00 a.m. yesterday morning and from walking miles all over the Market that we crashed out at 9:00 p.m. last night to the incessant honking of the traffic on the street .
Egyptian drivers love their horns , and I finally figured out that they use their horns instead of a turning signal .
You see , if they 're going to change lanes they 'll just hold down the horn to inform the drivers in the lane to be merged into to tell them he's on the way and if you do n't want a dent in your car you should make way .
We had planned to wake up rather early this morning - big plans - so when 4:30 a.m. rolled around Rich got up and tried to wake Sarah and I up .
His nudging did n't get us out of bed , although both Sarah and I were awake , so he walked over to our balcony doors and fully opened them up to the world .
I looked outside and could see the stars above , and the one thing that struck me was that we could now hear the mellow chanting / singing of the morning prayer .
Both Sarah and I were awe struck , for we'd been unable to hear the prayer before the doors were opened , but once they were opened we could hear the singing .
It was so moving and so peaceful .
It was really pleasant to hear this man singing , for they usually give the mic to the one who 's usually tone deaf .
Sarah and I listened to the prayer for five minutes or so , then we rousted ourselves out of the bed , for we had a date with a pyramid that morning .
Ever since I met Melinda , our Californian friend who has traveled the world over , I remember her telling me a story about her traveling with her family and actually getting the chance to climb the pyramids outside Cairo .
I 'd asked her to tell me the story a few times , so with that information files up in my brain , my group of three decided to go out there and see if we could climb the pyramids as well .
Technically it 's forbidden to climb the pyramids , but if you pay the right guy you might get away with it - we were out to try our damnedest .
Down to the street and got a cab out to Giza where the pyramids sit .
As we approached the main gate these two young boys , about 10 and 12 years respectively , came out of an alley and flagged the taxi down and told us the pyramids were closed .
Rich asked if they could guide us to the pyramids and the boys said it was possible .
We got out and followed the boys down the alley into this courtyard where one of the boys ran to retrieve his father .
The father appeared and explained to us that we had to rent his horses to ride over to the pyramids because they were too far to walk to on foot .
He said he'd lead us there through the locals ' village - the back way - then he'd take care of the guards while we climbed to the top of Cheops , the largest pyramid of the three .
We mounted his horses and started riding through the local village .
The sun was just beginning to come up , so when we ascended this hill and started down the road behind the village I could see the Sphinx sitting mysteriously through the haze across the valley .
We were almost to the base of the pyramid when Sarah 's horse lost its footing and fell down .
I turned around to see Sarah picking herself up off the asphalt , rubbing her bum .
She was a bit startled , and suffered a bruise on her thigh but lived through it .
Luckily we were there , at the base of the largest pyramid , Cheops , so the rest of us dismounted and we haggled with the father regarding how much we 'd pay him to bribe the guards .
We agreed on E£ 50 ( US$ 15 ) , paid the dude then as we walked towards the pyramid's base the father explained to us that we had to leave our small packs on a stone about a quarter of the way up .
He said it was dangerous for us to climb up with our packs down because they might cause us to fall off when we were coming down .
Good reason .
Off we went , each climbing up the first base stone , each which was a little taller than my waist .
Yes , we were really climbing one of the seven wonders of the ancient world .
We climbed up an eight of the way up and I could hear the guards screaming " Hello " " Hello " .
I looked down and could see the guards running towards the corner of the pyramid where we 'd started our climb .
I watched the father figure we'd paid the money to run over to the guard and give him some cash then walk away .
When the second guard started screaming I saw our man run over and slip him some cash to be quiet .
Evidently it worked - they did n't bother us again .
Climbing to the top was n't particularly hard , just nerve racking because if you took one wrong step you were history .
It was incredibly foggy that morning so I could n't see the ground after a point , but every once in a while the clouds would part and I could see the ground .
having a mild fear of heights did n't help , for once I could see how high up we really were I just made me more nervous .
When we were a quarter of the way up we could n't see the ground .
The sun was coming up as we were climbing to the top so I stopped and took photos of the sun while clinging to the side of the structure .
Amazing experience - where I was , what I was doing , everything .
Rich had climbed above and was soon out of sight .
Sarah and I were climbing together and about three fourths of the way up we rested and as we were both a bit nervous about climbing we actually discussed whether or not we should climb the entire way to the top .
We were nervous from the height and were beginning to wonder about our climb back down - more like whether or not we were going to make it at all .
I assumes Rich was already at the top , the sun was coming up , it looked stunning , so Sarah and I persevered and climbed the last bit to the top .
Plus if I did n't go all the way I would never have heard the end of it from Rich - not for the rest of my life .
( He did mention that later ) .
Just as we arrived at the top the sun rose up above the cloud layer in the valley so all we could see was our pyramid , the sun & white clouds .
It looked like Heaven itself .
We sat at the top for a while , discussed whether we were going to die climbing back down , and took pictures with the other pyramid in the background .
The clouds parted just enough so we could see the tip of the next pyramid over with a sea of clouds surrounding .
After a cigarette and more photos we started our descent down .
Our guide , who did n't seem to have it in him to guide us up the pyramid , had explained to us in intricate detail how to climb down without killing ourselves .
He said we had to sit down on each stone and slide off it to the next stone below .
The reason we could n't take our packs was because on the way down the pack would have rubbed on the stone as we lowered ourselves and knocked us off balance and down to our deaths .
The climb back down was actually almost easier than the climb up .
We found out later that we 'd climbed the equivalent of a 48 story building ( 450 feet high ) - on the outside .
It was an incredible experience ; a photo of the " Climbing is forbidden " sign was of course mandatory .
We wandered around to the other pyramids and over to the Sphinx waiting for the morning haze to burn off so we could get some pictures of the monstrosity we 'd just conquered .
While waiting , and being the only tourists out there at 7:00 a.m. , we had to beat off the camel jockeys with a stick .
There was one jockey in particular who kept trying to convince us to go for a ride on " Daisy & Moses " , Mrs. camel and Mr. mule .
The haze finally lifted enough for us to take photos , then we walked to the main gates to get a cab back to Cairo .
We 'd been at the pyramids since 5:30 that morning and all had had enough of them for one day .
The main gates were crawling with Western tourists , a majority who appeared to be Americans - each mounted atop one of those camels .
The place was crawling with tourists and touts - utter chaos .
it was a definite change from the serenity we 'd experienced all morning when we had the pyramids all to ourselves .
We made it back to our hotel for a sleep then wandered around the city for a while , eventually making it to the top of Cairo tower for a birds eye view of the city .
Boring .
It was getting hot so we headed beck to the hotel to sit out of the heat of the day and that 's when we had our next adventure in Third World accommodation .
Our hotel was on the fifth floor and we had to use this elevator that technically should n't have been operational in the first place .
Posted outside the elevator door is a big sign with a skull and crossbones painted on it stating " Danger .
No more than 3 persons max " .
O.K. so we were taking our lives in to our own hands every time we entered this elevator , but when your legs are aching from climbing a pyramid and it's hotter than hell you are n't going to concern yourself with a rickety elevator .
There was already someone waiting for the elevator so Rich said he'd stay behind while Sarah , I and the German , who 'd been waiting went up first .
We climbed in and hit the ' 5 ' button and the elevator creaked and groaned before beginning its descent .
Due to the non-existent standards of Egyptian building safety codes the elevator had no internal door so as we were going up we'd look out this open space onto each floor .
If I 'd so chosen I could have touched each of the floors as they went past the open door .
The only time there was any sort of safety feature to keep the passengers in the ascending box was right when we 'd come upon each floor .
There was a free standing door ( not attached to anything mounted on the floor ) that the elevator would line up with once one had reached their destination .
I gathered the door was more for keeping people waiting on the floors out of the elevator shaft than keeping the passengers in the elevator .
These doors on each floor were self locking and only unlocked when the elevator lined up perfectly so the passengers could exit .
These elevator doors are only about 6 feet high , and above that there 's just open space where the elevator shaft is , leaving about 8 feet open space up to the ceiling .
On our way up the elevator grunted once again then got stuck on the 4th floor just above one of those locked elevator doors .
Wonderful .
We pushed all the buttons on the panel ( including the alarm button which did n't work ) trying to get the thing started again , but no dice .
There were two switches on the panel , but we did n't rush to try them - we'd talked about them earlier and came to a conclusion like if we switched that the cable in the ceiling holding the elevator up would disengage and we'd go plummeting down to our deaths .
I suppose it was kind of ironic that now I needed to use the switch .
Both switches did n't work so now Sarah , the German and I stood there trying to figure out what to do .
Of course the elevator had to stop behind one of the protective doors ( locked because we were about three feet to high to engage the unlock mechanism ) but not high enough to make it easy for us to climb out ( easy being the operative word ) .
Virtually anywhere else on the way up there would have been no problem getting out but now we were boxed in behind the bloody door .

On May 8th , after a week of rumours and speculation , Barca president , Joan Laporta , announced that come the end of the season , coach Frank Rijkaard would be replaced in the Barca hot seat by Josep Guardiola , ex-Barca hero , Spanish international and current coach of Barcelona ’s B side .
It was n’t a particular surprise , in fairness – the Catalan giants expect great things from their managers and 2 seasons without any silverware would get any coach sacked at Camp Nou .
The announcement , on the back of a 4 - 1 drubbing at the hands of the newly crowned Champions , Real Madrid , no doubt sped up the decision making and press conference .
Guardiola is untried at La Liga level as a manager , but has done great things with the Barca ‘ B ’ side , helping them into a promotion position this season .
At 37 , he ’s also young for the job , but as a hero for Barca in his playing days , he will no doubt be a great choice .
He has great respect for Rijkaard , saying “ He has been extraordinary in everything he has done .
He is an example to us all ” .
He also refused to comment on any team ideas , simply letting it be known that Rijkaard is still coach until the final game of the season has been played , and that he himself , still has a job to complete in helping Barca B gain promotion .
So , has Frank been a success or a failure as Barca coach ?
Well , that ’s a tough call , we ’ll leave the judgement for the time being , let ’s see where it all began .
Rijkaard began his coaching career back in 1998 , when he took over the reigns of the Dutch national side , where he took his nation to the semi-finals of the 2000 European Championships .
That was followed by a pretty dismal season at Sparta Rotterdam ( 01-02 ) , when the club were relegated from the Dutch 1st Division for the first time in their history .
Rijkaard was unsurprisingly sacked at the end of the season .
After a break of almost a year , he got the job at Barca , appointed by the then newly elected president , Laporta .
The first season ( 2003 - 4 ) did not start well , with the side finding themselves in the relegation zone early on .
But Rijkaard worked with his inherited team ( along with a new face , Ronaldinho ) and turned things around nicely , with Barca finishing the season in 2nd position in the league .
In Europe , Barca made the 4th round of the UEFA Cup , being knocked out by Celtic .
Season 04-05 brought with it new hope , and many new faces .
Rijkaard ’s dream team was assembled .
He reaped the rewards , with Barcelona winning the league for the first time since 1999 .
In the Champions League , they made it through the group stage , being knocked out in the 1st knockout round by Chelsea .
A successful season , the Catalan giants were back !
A comment made by Rijkaard regarding his team and the style of play he chose was answered thus : “ I strongly believe that you cannot copy anyone ” .
2005 - 2006 brought continued success , with Barca retaining their La Liga crown , and also defeating Arsenal 2 - 1 to become Champions League winners .
The side , virtually the same as the previous seasons , were by now a real team unit and it showed in their play .
By now , Frank was a legend .
The problem with becoming the holders of La Liga , and Champions League winners too , is that for many other teams , the match against you becomes their very own ‘ cup final ’ and that extra bit of passion always comes to the top in matches against the ‘ Title Holders ’ .
Add to the fact that the team in question are Barcelona , and you soon realise that every game is tough , every player has something to prove and there are no easy matches .
Welcome to 2006 - 2007 .
This is how the season would be for Barca .
The league crown was wrested from their grasp and they got dumped out of the Champions League by Liverpool after the group stages ( notice the way it ’s always a British team puts Barca out ? ) .
La Liga went down to the wire , with Real Madrid eventual winners only due to a better head - to - head against Barca , after the 2 sides finished the season equal on points .
But , history does n’t remember the losers , Barca ’s fiercest rivals had won the title .
The season ended with no silverware ( other than the Spanish Super Cup , where the winners of the league play the winners of the Copa de Rey ) .
In Barcelona , that is not a good season .
This season , 2007 - 08 promised much , but produced nothing .
An exit from the Champions League at the semi-final stage , the same too the Spanish Copa del Rey ( to eventual winners , Valencia ) and another league title lost – again , to Real Madrid .
Barca have even lost their season long grasp of 2nd place to Villareal , who , with just one game left , cannot be caught and therefore have an automatic Champions League spot .
Barca are not even guaranteed 3rd yet , as Atletico Madrid have the same points going into the final week – so they ’re going to have to go through unfamiliar Champions League qualifying to make it .
With another trophy - less season , there would not have been a bookies taking money on the outcome .
Frank would be on his way .
What went wrong ?
In the mind set of Spanish football , and its ever changing footballing politics , success is the only answer .
Ask Fabio Capello – he took Madrid to the title , but still , amazingly , found himself out of a job because of Spanish football politics .
That ’s exactly what happened to Rijkaard – no trophies = no job .
Simpleo facto .
Barcelona are a behemoth of world football , a team we all remember as kids .
They win .
Everyone wants to be like Barca .
No -one could be more stylish .
If they do n’t , there is only one solution , bring in a new man and start again .
Season 08-09 will be the new Barca , and I think we will see a seriously different Barcelona with a lot of new players , as Guardiola starts to construct his own dream team .
So , a success or a failure ?
Take your pick .
Rijkaard certainly had a hugely successful first 3 seasons , but he also had ( in a Barca view ) a disappointing final 2 seasons .
One thing is for sure , though , Frank Rijkaard will leave his job with the respect he deserves from the whole Barcelona set - up – the fans , the players and the people ‘ upstairs ’ .

New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin endorsed Barack Obama this morning .
In his statement , he made it clear that his top priority is rebuilding his city , “ In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , Senator Obama worked to help address the needs of our Gulf Coast communities .
As the Gulf Coast continues to rebuild , other cities have faced tragic disasters across this country . ”
He continued , “ Therefore , it is critical that this country ’s infrastructure and emergency response systems are evaluated and rebuilt to sustain our cities and protect our families .
What happened in Louisiana should never happen again . ”
Nagin stressed that Obama is a new generation of leadership , “ I have learned firsthand that a unified constituency can make what seems impossible , possible .
Senator Obama represents a new generation of leadership , one that can help heal the divisions of the past and unify this country so that together we can build a stronger future . ”
The Mayor talked about his first hand experience with the Washington system , “ Since the immediate days following the storm , I have been travelling to our nation ’s capitol to advocate for policies that aid our rebuilding effort .
I know firsthand , we desperately need the leadership of someone committed to changing the system in Washington that can hold us back from moving forward .
For these reasons , I endorse Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nominee . ”

Nagin has done a fantastic job leading New Orleans , but he has a habit of speaking off the cuff .
I think everyone remembers this comment .
MSNBC has been reporting that Obama has picked up four superdelegates today , but his official website lists only two , Nagin and Rep. Joe Donnelly , so we ’ll go with the total needed being 148 for now .
Nagin ’s Endorsement :

The states need to form a union .
2003-02-07 ; revised 2018-06-18
Corporations play one state or city against another to extract tax breaks .
They threaten to move the plant here or there , and get different localities to bid against each other with tax reductions .
The burden falls on the rest of us .
I think the states should bargain collectively with these companies .
That means they need to form a union .
We could call it the " United States of America . "
Here 's how it would work .
All the states would agree to be bound by a rule that when a company considers locating a facility in more than one place , none of those jurisdictions can offer it a tax break without the consent of all the others .
Any jurisdiction that believes a company is considering another location could make a complaint under this requirement .
If the company then chose a different location , and got a tax break there , it would be fined twice the amount of the tax break .
The fine could go to the jurisdiction that made the complaint .
Of course , the states already have a so - called union , and it could implement this policy simply by passing a federal law .
It fails to do fulfill its mission because it has sold out to the companies .
The problem of business - supremacy treaties relates to this , because their basic wrong is to make countries compete with each other for which one will let businesses mistreat workers and the public the most .
Face it , that box you live in ain't no palace .
When you can pee in the toilet from the living room , it 's time to start finding ways to maximize your precious square footage .
I may not be able to convince you to throw out your old , ratty chairs or your college textbooks that refer to the US as having 48 states , but in this week 's Thank Giz It 's Friday roundup , I can offer you some insanely clever space - saving ideas that will help make some sense of the chaos .

They say that the kitchen is the heart of any home , so that is where we will start .
This Circular Kitchen utilizes the same sort of rotating space saving design that you might find in a cabinet or pantry .
It only takes up 18 square feet , but it features the storage capacity of 12 cupboards in a conventional kitchen as well as room for essential appliances like a stove ( burners above the fridge ) , dishwasher , sink , and microwave .
Prices depend on the configuration , but expect to pay upwards of $ 6,000 to put one in your home .

However , when space is tight , this is often the first place we think of when looking for a computer workspace .
The aptly titled " Bedup " can buy you 30 square feet of extra space by sliding the bed up to the ceiling .
Unfortunately , if your ceilings are low , you might be SOL on this one .

If you do n't consider yourself the owner of an actual " bedroom , " maybe we should just talk about your " living space . "
This is the area where you will spend most of your time and do the majority of your entertaining , so optimizing the space is a must .
For this task , there are two similar concept designs that could offer some inspiration for your own projects .
The first is the Matroshka living concept that packs an L - shaped sofa , double bed , dinner table , four stools , total seating for 12 , a home office workspace , wardrobe and storage in only a 43 square foot area .
It is also highly configurable , so you can mess around with the layout on a whim .

The second and more extreme example of this idea comes in the form of the Casulo apartment in a box .
As you can see in the video , the name pretty much says it all .

Remember those textbooks I talked about earlier ?
Maybe you would n't have to chuck them after all if you built yourself one of these now - famous stairwell bookcases .
If your not much of a reader , you could always utilize it for movies and CDs .

If you are planning a big dinner party or a holiday get - together , you may need a dining table that is a little bigger than what you might find in the Matroshika and Casulo concepts .
This inflatable " Grace Table " designed by Philippe Malouin will give you the surface area you need for guests , but when all is said and done you can store it in a duffel bag .
He also demonstrates a chair that doubles as a clothes hanger when not in use .
So you can have a sturdy dining table and seating without taking nearly any space .

If furniture is n't your problem , but clutter is , you may want to invest in some of these Zero Gravity Hangers .
Just clip on a remote , your car keys , pens , etc. and hang them from the ceiling .
It will keep your tables clutter - free and help you keep tabs on stuff that you do n't want to lose .
Available for around $ 28 . [ Ledindon ]

Speaking of clutter , if you tend to be a bit of a pack - rat , much of the junk you collect probably makes its way to the garage or attic .
Installing one of these Heavy Lift Garage Elevators can get up to 250 lbs stuff out of the way with a simple hand crank .
Available for $ 180 . [ Skymall ]

So , we have hit just about every room in the house , and now its time to take the party outdoors .
This BloomFrame concept would actually increase your living space by converting a window into a balcony .
Something like this would undoubtedly prove popular in high - rise urban apartment complexes — at least until your fat cousin steps out there , dislodges the window and sends you both plummeting to an untimely death .

" Wally , I ca n't open that file you e-mailed . "
" Sounds like you need to upgrade your viewer application . "
" Which means you 'll probably have to upgrade your operating system . "
" You 'd better add some ram while you 're at it . "
" But it probably makes no sense to upgrade your old computer .
This is a good time to get a new one . "
" How do I get a new computer ? " " It 's easy .
I 'll send you a file that explains it . "
" Are you sending corrupted files to people again ? " " Only if I think they deserve it . "
There are quite a few operating systems which have moved beyond the simple hobby operating system stage , onto a more lasting plane of existence .
AROS , ReactOS , SkyOS , Syllable , Haiku ; they ’re no longer basement products , coded by a single programer – they are now projects in which a lot of people have invested time , and possibly money too .
They wo n’t go away any time soon .
The last few days have seen news on three of these systems : ReactOS , SkyOS , and Syllable .
Firstly , Syllable .
Ruwen Boehm ported the VLC and MPlayer multimedia players to Syllable Desktop ( VLC screenshot ) .
The behaviour of both is still a bit rough , but watching DVDs on Syllable is possible now .
Some of the needed parts were ported by Rui Caridade , Andrew Kennan , and Kaj de Vos .
Newly ported components include FAAD2 , FLAC , FontConfig , LibA52 , LibCDDB , LibDVDNav , LibDVDRead , LibID3Tag , LibMAD and LibMPEG2 .
These packages do n’t have to be installed separately , as the libraries are included in VLC and MPlayer .
Packages for both are available from the Syllable website .
Robert Szeleney , SkyOS ’ wunderkind , announced a new IDE for SkyOS , coming in the next SkyOS build .
“ The IDE features various editors ( source , datacollection , layouts , etc. ) and allows GUI design using the SkyOS Layout system to design size , resolution and font independent layouts . ”
A video of the new IDE has been put online .
“ In later versions the IDE will also supported an integrated debugging and an image editor to design your icons and images right in the project . ”
Additionally , the first theme using the new theme engine has been released .
Lastly , ReactOS has made some major strides , once again .
The DirectX runtime now loads and works on ReactOS , albeit 3D support is not yet functional .
The installer does n’t work either , so you ’ll need to copy the relevant files over manually ( dxg.sys , dxgthk.sys , dxapi.sys , ddraw.dll , and dciman32.dll ) .
In addition , there have been performance fixes , a new calculator program , as well as a temporary measure for keyboard switching .
Have you ever hit the throttle when a traffic light turns yellow , and then it turns red faster than you thought ?
We know it 's happened to us , and for the most part we thought the problem was our bad timing .
In six cities across these United States , missing a yellow light has less to do with bad timing , and more to do with shorter amber signals .
Six cities have been busted recently for having an amber light that lasted less than the minimum timing at an intersection , and millions of dollars in fines have been collected when drivers went through the premature red and got caught on camera .
Chattanooga , Tennessee ; Dallas , Texas ; Springfield , Missouri ; Lubbock , Texas ; Nashville , Tennessee ; and Union City , California all cut the timing on their lights , and while some have paid back the fines , others have not .
In Dallas , over $ 700,000 was collected in a matter of eight months , and in Tennessee the light timing was changed at only a few intersections , which just so happen to be the areas where local law enforcement set up traps .
While the millions of dollars in fines collected in these six cities is horrible , what 's worse is that shorter amber lights mean more accidents and more injuries on the road .
Hit the link below to read more information regarding the cities that were caught cheating , and if you get pulled over for blowing a red , make sure to time the light .
The problem may not be you after all .
Thanks for the tip , Thunder !

The White House acknowledged in a court filing last night that it no longer has backup tapes of email from between March 1 and May 22 , 2003 , a period that includes the beginning of the Iraq war .
Yesterday ’s filing ( PDF ) is the latest development in the ongoing White House emails lawsuit , in which two non-profits , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) and the National Security Archive ( NSA ) , are suing to force the administration to recover any missing emails and institute a more effective email archiving system .
( For the full story on the missing emails , check out our missing White House emails index . )
The filing comes on the heels of several seemingly contradictory statements by administration officials about whether the allegedly missing emails are available on backup tapes .
The court had asked the administration to clear up the confusion by clearly stating which backup tapes it does and does not have for the period between March 2003 and October 2005 .
In their filing , administration officials claim they have 438 backup tapes for the period between May 23 , 2003 and September 29 , 2003 .
The White House stopped its foolish policy of recycling backup tapes in early October 2003 , so all the backup tapes made after that date are supposedly preserved — some 60,000 of them .
But even the emergency recovery backup tapes the White House does have are far from a fool - proof source for recovering missing emails .
Any email that arrived and was deleted in between backups would n’t be preserved , since backup tapes take a digital “ picture ” of the data on a drive at a given time .
And while that problem applies to all the backups , it ’s especially concerning for the period between May 23 and September 29 , 2003 , for which the White House says it has 438 backup tapes .
That is a low number of backup tapes per day for an entity as large as the Executive Office of the President , so backups may not have been made for all offices in the EOP on all days during that time .
Even if backups were made every day for every component of the EOP , emails could still escape archiving if they were sent , received , and deleted in between backups .
All this does n’t even begin to address the period between March 1 and May 22 , for which we now know for certain that no backup tapes exist .
In an email to the press earlier today , Meredith Fuchs , the general counsel for the National Security Archive , wrote :
It seems clear now that the e-mail backups are spotty and that there is no guarantee that there are backup tapes for all of EOP during the period of concern , March 2003 - October 2005 .
There are no tapes from earlier than May 23 , 2003 .
So , anything deleted from the EOP network prior to May 23 , 2003 ( particularly between March 2003 and may 23 , 2003 ) is missing from the back - up tapes .
The plaintiffs are hoping that the judge will issue a ruling forcing the White House to copy email archive .pst files from all sorts of electronic sources , including hard drives and portable devices , in an attempt to insure no more emails go missing .
The administration ’s admission that its backup tape library is incomplete may be the justification the judge needs to do just that .
A ruling is expected soon , but Fuchs told me she ’s worried it will all be for naught .
“ Here we are two and a half years after they realized there was a problem and they are not in a position to say whether anything is missing or not , ” Fuchs says .
“ I honestly think they are just trying to run out the clock , and then it ’s a huge mess .
Maybe the court ’s going to act quickly and we ’ll get better preservation .
That ’s what we ’ll hope for at this point . ”
The Treasury secretary , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , delivered a guardedly optimistic message to business leaders on Friday , saying that the economy was moving toward a rebound after months of malaise .
“ We are still working through housing and capital markets issues , and expect to be doing so for some time , ” he said in remarks at a conference sponsored by The Washington Post .
“ We also expect to see a faster pace of economic growth before the end of the year . ”
Playing an important role , he said , would be roughly $ 100 billion in stimulus payments to Americans over the next few months .
“ The fiscal stimulus will provide support to the economy as we weather the housing correction , capital markets turmoil , and higher energy and food prices , ” he said .
JUNE 19 -- Meet Christina Szele .
The 35 - year - old New Yorker was charged yesterday with causing a disturbance on a JetBlue flight after she lit up a cigarette at her seat , punched a flight attendant in the jaw , and kicked and screamed when airline personnel tried to restrain her .
Oh , Szele also allegedly threatened to kill one flight attendant and called him a ' dumb mother fucker ' and ' fuckin ' nigger . '
The JetBlue flight from New York to San Francisco made an emergency landing in Denver Tuesday afternoon following Szele 's outburst , which is detailed in an affidavit filed along with a U.S. District Court criminal complaint .
Szele told investigators that she drank two beers prior to going to John F. Kennedy International Airport and downed three vodka drinks while onboard Flight 643 , but noted that she had a ' high tolerance ' for alcohol .
She claimed not to remember lighting up a cigarette or slugging anyone ( since she is not a violent person ) .
But she did cop to cursing frequently and often using the ' F ' word .
A passenger quoted in the affidavit recalled that Szele was ' speaking to herself , ' adding that he ' heard and then smelled a match strike .
I smelled cigarette smoke , leaned forward and saw the lit cigarette in her hand . '
Szele , pictured in a mug shot snapped last year following a disorderly conduct bust in California , was charged with assault and interfering with a flight crew , a felony carrying a maximum of 20 years in prison .
A federal magistrate yesterday ordered Szele held in lieu of a detention hearing scheduled for June 23 .

O ne of the top investigative journalists in the country , Larisa Alexandrovna ( the lead journalist at Raw Story ) , says the following concerning her attempts to determine whether or not the U.S. is still officially in a state of emergency , such as would justify the continuition of Continuity of Government ( COG ) Plans implemented on 9/11 : " Well , I have called around ... believe it or not , no seems to have an answer as to this simple question : ' are we in a state of emergency ? ' " ( see comments following essay ) .
Keep in mind that Alexandrovna has broken many top stories , later picked up by the New York Times and other mainstream publications , and has developed a broad network of contacts .
And yet she could n't find an answer .
Well , according to the White House website ( and confirmed here ) , o the government declared a continuing state of emergency based upon the 9/11/01 attacks , which is continuing into 2008 :
" Consistent with section 202 ( d ) of the National Emergencies Act ( 50 U.S.C. 1622 ( d ) ) , I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency I declared on September 14 , 2001 , in Proclamation 7463 , with respect to the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center , New York , New York , the Pentagon , and aboard United Airlines flight 93 , and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States .
Because the terrorist threat continues , the national emergency declared on September 14 , 2001 , last extended on September 5 , 2006 , and the powers and authorities adopted to deal with that emergency , must continue in effect beyond September 14 , 2007 .
Therefore , I am continuing in effect for an additional year the national emergency I declared on September 14 , 2001 , with respect to the terrorist threat . "
A separate announcement on the White House website states :
" Because the actions of these persons who commit , threaten to commit , or support terrorism continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States , the national emergency declared on September 23 , 2001 , and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency , must continue in effect beyond September 23 , 2007 .
Therefore , in accordance with section 202( d ) of the National Emergencies Act ( 50 U.S.C. 1622 ( d ) ) , I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to persons who commit , threaten to commit , or support terrorism . "
What does this mean ?
We know that Continuity of Government Plans were implemented on 9/11 , based upon a " national emergency " .
The 9/14/01 declaration of a national emergency may have been a way to document that declaration .
The 9/23/01 declaration may have been a make - weight document created by the White House regarding the " War on Terror " in general .
Regardless , the proof is becoming quite strong that the state of emergency declared on 9/11 ( as memorialized in writing thereafter ) is still in effect .
If the state of emergency is still in effect , the Continuity of Government Plans are almost certainly still in effect , since COG plans are meant to take effect in a state of emergency , and because there is very strong circumstantial evidence that they are , in fact , still in effect -- and , indeed , the government has been acting like COG is in effect .
( See this , this , this and this ) .
As the Washington Times wrote on September 18 , 2001 :
" Simply by proclaiming a national emergency on Friday , President Bush activated some 500 dormant legal provisions , including those allowing him to impose censorship and martial law . "
Early fighter planes had no cabin pressurization , much less a cabin .
The Army Air Corps began using the Boeing P - 26 Peashooter in 1933 .
The Allied airmen and women of World War II were certainly brave and skilled in battle , but even they could n't win the war on their own .
Plagued in the early , low - tech years of the war by dangerous afflictions such as altitude and decompression sickness , pilots got some help behind the front lines from a team of American physiologists who studied the effects on the body of flying .
Their research , which involved at least one parachuting dog , and the technology it initiated was a key to the Allied victory in the air , says Jay B. Dean of the University of South Florida College of Medicine .
" [ Pilots ] had two enemies — they had the enemy shooting at them and they had the unseen enemy , which was the environment , " he said .
" The physiologists knew that they had to do something to learn to protect the health of the war fighter . "
Dean presented his research at a recent Experimental Biology conference in San Diego and is working on a book about Allied advances in aviation physiology .
Early flight no cake walk
Aviation in the late 1930s and early 1940s , just under 40 years removed from the Wright brothers ' feat at Kitty Hawk , was nothing like the high - tech industry it is today .
When World War II began , planes were n't heated or even pressurized , even though pilots were forced to climb to very high altitudes to avoid the enemy .
" They were supposed to fly at about 25,000 feet ; well , they were pushing them up to 30,000 and 35,000 feet to try to get above the enemy flak from the ground , " Dean said .
At that height , the airmen were exposed to temperatures of 40 below to 70 below zero Fahrenheit , as well as very low air pressure .
" If there 's less pressure , there 's less oxygen , " Dean said , " and you begin to lose your ability to think clearly .
You can imagine trying to wage warfare and have a sharp mind if you 're slowly becoming hypoxic , " or losing oxygen content in the blood , he said .
Though the Allies had kept up with the Axis powers in aircraft technology , their knowledge about how the body reacted to high altitudes lagged well behind , according to historical accounts .
The tests that began a few years after the War began became crucial to the military effort , Dean said .
" The air war had become a physiological war , " Dean said in a recent interview , noting that the common perception " was that the first power to fly routinely at 40,000 feet would win . "
Dogpaddling at 26,000 feet
Starting out with just one hypobaric chamber , which mimics the conditions of a high altitude environment , an Ohio laboratory set up by World War II physiologists quickly focused on finding solutions to the worst problems pilots faced , Dean said .
About one quarter of the men on bombing missions — which could last up to 10 hours — complained of decompression sickness , the painful blood affliction scuba divers commonly call " the bends . "
The physiologists discovered that the effects of the bends could be minimized by breathing pure oxygen before takeoff .
Blood tests and lung capacity tests were also conducted to figure out the limits of the human lung .
When the simulations were n't sufficient , the physiologists put their bodies on the line , Dean said .
One doctor made a high - altitude jump himself to experience the strain on the body , nearly killing himself , and was able to calculate exactly when an airman 's parachute should be opened to limit the impact of the g- forces , said Dean .
And " Major , " a 145 - pound St. Bernard dog , was also tossed from a plane at 26,000 feet to test parachute straps at a high altitude .
Sporting his own custom oxygen mask , Major dog- paddled all the way down and landed safely , witnesses said .
Relevant to the space program
The research conducted during the War was relevant long after 1945 , Dean said .
" A lot of what we learned about pulmonary mechanics came from the war effort , when they were developing the oxygen - breathing equipment , " he said .
And just like their WWII predecessors , astronauts performing space walks outside the pressurized safety of their shuttle today still breathe pure oxygen for 12 hours to reduce the risk of the decompression sickness .

AND so Yahoo ! survives .
The internet company — which , at the age of 14 , is one of the oldest — appears in the end to have rebuffed Microsoft , the software Goliath that wanted to buy it .
It has done so , in part , by surrendering to Google , the younger internet company that is its main rival .
In a vague deal apparently designed to confuse antitrust regulators , Yahoo ! is letting Google , the biggest force in web - search advertising , place text ads next to some of Yahoo !'s own search results .
Google thus controls some or all of the ads on all the big search engines except Microsoft's .
Yahoo !
lives , but on the web 's equivalent of life support .
Yahoo !'s descent , first gradual then sudden , during this decade marks a surprising reversal of the fates of the only three big internet firms to have survived since the web 's earliest days .
Back in 1994 Jerry Yang and David Filo , truant PhD students at Stanford , started to publish a list , eventually named Yahoo ! , of links to cool destinations on the nascent web .
Around the same time , Jeff Bezos was writing his business plan for a website , soon to be called Amazon , for selling books online .
The following year , Pierre Omidyar , a French - born Iranian - American , put an auction site on the web that would become eBay .
Even as hundreds of other dotcoms fell by the wayside at the turn of the century , these three made it through the great internet crisis and have since prospered , to varying degrees and at different times .
Their fates have reflected the evolution of the web as a whole , and now suggest its future direction .
For many years eBay and Yahoo !
made more money than Amazon , which , as a capital - intensive retailer , struggled longer with losses and then made profits at lower margins ( see chart ) .
And yet , says Pip Coburn of Coburn Ventures , an investment adviser , Yahoo ! is now drifting and eBay is a washed - up quasi- monopoly , whereas Amazon finds itself at the internet 's cutting edge .
Yahoo !
set out to be a new sort of media company .
To that end , it hired a Hollywood mogul , Terry Semel , during the internet depression in 2001 .
He had a backward - looking idea of the media business .
Yahoo !'s site became a tawdry strip mall , with big , flashing advertisements next to users ' e-mail inboxes .
The firm slipped into a mindset of product silos , with the teams for the home - page , e-mail , finance and sports pages competing with each other and for advertisers , and confusing users .
Yahoo !'s bigger mistake was not to see how the web was changing .
Google , also founded by two truant Stanford PhD students , became the leader of a new generation with a vision that web search , rather than Yahoo !'s “ portal ” approach , would guide surfers around the internet .
Google valued simplicity , interactivity and the collective intelligence gleaned from the web and its users .
Yahoo !
belatedly tried to keep up and bought sites such as flickr for photo - sharing and del.icio.us for bookmark - sharing , but it “ put them in the curio cabinet ” without transforming the company , says Jerry Michalski , a technology consultant .
Yahoo ! was “ so bent on being the future ” , he says , that it “ missed the new ” .
Mr Yang replaced Mr Semel last year , but the crisis was so grave that he has now ended up surrendering to Google .
EBay took a different route , recognising that its business — in effect , online yard sales — had potential network effects : in short , that sellers and buyers would flock to whichever site already did the most trading .
The firm became a de facto monopoly , but with that came a culture that left many of its users disenchanted , and growth slowed .
Some measures , such as the number of new listings of items for sale , are even in decline .
Buyers and sellers increasingly rely on Google 's search model , or online social networks , to find things and one another .
EBay 's new boss , John Donahoe , is not facing a crisis like Yahoo !'s — but neither does he appear to have a big idea for the future .
Amazin '
Amazon , by contrast , has found exactly that .
It is the only one of the three that has been led continuously by the same man , its founder Jeff Bezos .
A caricaturist 's dream , Mr Bezos has an outsized neck , striking pate and an infectious guffaw that spreads enthusiasm .
And , unlike his peers at the other two firms , Mr Bezos has stuck to his original vision — while adding two new ideas as they presented themselves .
His original plan , in the 1990s , was to become “ Earth 's biggest river ” of merchandise , from books and toys to electronics and almost anything else that can be shipped .
He tried and failed to become a rival to eBay in auctions .
But then Mr Bezos realised that the same online store - front and logistics system that worked for Amazon itself could also work for others .
So he added an entirely new category of customers : third - party sellers , who account for 30 % of all items sold through Amazon 's site today .
They range from one - man - bands to huge retailers , such as Target .
Then , about four years ago , another , and potentially bigger , idea struck Mr Bezos .
“ We had built this huge infrastructure internally for us , ” says Mr Bezos .
“ We thought , surely others out there could use the same infrastructure services . ”
That infrastructure consists of Amazon 's prodigious numbers of server computers and storage discs , rivalled in scale by only a few other firms in the world , including Google .
So Mr Bezos again added an entire category of customers : firms that wanted to rent computing capacity — from processing to storage to database functionality — from Amazon over the internet , rather than build their own data centres in a warehouse .
It has signed up over 370,000 customers , ranging from web start - ups to the New York Times , which used Amazon 's infrastructure to digitise much of its archive .
Almost by accident , Amazon has thus “ backed into cloud computing , ” as Mr Michalski puts it , using the buzzword for today 's next big thing : the trend among both consumers and companies to compute and store data on the internet , rather than on a local computer .
If there is a leader in the cloud , it is Google .
But Amazon is now right up there .
Better yet , although Amazon overlaps with Google in the cloud , it does not rival it directly .
Google mostly offers entire applications , such as word processing or spreadsheets , to consumers though their web browsers .
Amazon offers services to programmers so they can build and run their own applications .
So there they are .
Jerry Yang is still boss of Yahoo ! , although angry , restive shareholders may oust him at their annual meeting on August 1st , and his top lieutenants are leaving in droves .
John Donahoe is looking hard for a purpose that will enable eBay to survive another decade .
And Mr Bezos is right where he wants to be .

In 1990 , painter Jon J Muth published a four - issue comics adaptation of Fritz Lang ’s classic 1931 film , M . The stunning images — silverpoint with charcoal , plus dark and dense oils — revolutionized the way comics could look , helping to usher in an era of comics that make gestures toward high art .
Suspenseful , daring , and formally brilliant , M was a landmark story long out of print — until now .
Abrams republishes M this spring , collecting the comics classic into one volume for the first time .
Today on the Comics Page , we ’re proud to present an excerpt from M , by Jon J Muth , based on the film by Fritz Lang .
M is in stores this month from Abrams .

The efforts of Internet service providers to keep track of what their customers do online poses an interesting question for the makers of anti-spyware software :
Should they find a way to help users block these systems from monitoring their surfing or showing them advertising that relates to their interests ?
The Anti-Spyware Coalition is setting up a project to help address those issues .
It ’s potentially an important step because the coalition , run by the Center for Democracy and Technology , has created standards used by the major vendors of anti-virus and anti-spyware technology to help define how dangerous certain software and cookies are .
Most anti-spyware programs scan users ’ computers and sort the findings into high - , medium - or low - risk threats .
Users can define their own settings to tell the programs how to deal with various sorts of threats and potential privacy invasions .
Companies in the advertising business work hard to make sure their efforts are n’t blocked by this software , sometimes resorting to lawsuits .
The Anti-Spyware Coalition was formed , in part , to give the software vendors a neutral forum to define standards and help protect themselves from these suits .
The BBC surveyed several of the leading anti-spyware software companies , and most said they were still evaluating the situation .
Phorm , an advertising technology company that is starting to work with the big Internet providers in Britian , has been reaching out to the software makers .
Phorm is trying to make the case that its products are n’t spyware and that users are given a clear opportunity to opt out .
Phorm should understand these issues .
The company , then known as 121 Media , made software that displayed pop-up ads on people ’s computers after they downloaded it .
It was seen as spyware by many because of questions about how well it disclosed what it would do in advance .
Moreover , some versions used software known as a rootkit to make it very difficult to uninstall .
Ari Schwartz , a vice president of the technology center , said that the I.S.P. monitoring programs have created new issues that require the coalition ’s guidelines to be adjusted .
The questions include what sort of disclosures are made to users , what sort of data is collected and how intrusive the resulting advertising is .
Even if a software company decides that one of these I.S.P. monitoring programs violates the anti-spyware guidelines , it ’s not clear how much they could block it .
After all , the essence of these monitoring schemes is that they use their connection with the Internet provider to observe people from a perch in the network — they do n’t have to rely on software downloads or ephemeral cookies .
Still , the I.S.P. monitoring programs do use cookies for various reasons .
They all set a cookie that helps them communicate with advertising networks about what sort of ads to show each user .
And Phorm , actually appends some of its information to every other cookie on a user ’s computer .
So while anti-spyware software could n’t block these systems from watching users , it could at least cause trouble for them by removing their cookies .
If that became widespread , Phorm and its competitors could certainly look to create versions of their technology that are not so dependent on cookies .
All this puts even more pressure on the Anti-Spyware Coalition , the Internet providers , the monitoring companies and other interested parties to look closely at these programs and try to reach a consensus about much Internet providers should be able to observe about their customers , what choices they give , and how they use the information .
If there is n’t agreement , the anti-spyware companies may well open another front in what I ’ve been calling the mother of all privacy battles .
It is doubtful we can adequately inform energy policy without addressing the linkages between equity , the environment , finance , and our end goals .
I post this on theoildrum not only because Herman is one of my tribal elders but because his eloquence , courage and foresight on these issues have historically been , and continue to be , ahead of the curve .
During his resignation speech from the World Bank , Herman recommended the Bank take " a few antacids and laxatives to cure the combination of managerial flatulence and organizational constipation giving rise to such a high - pressure internal environment . "
To improve interactions with the external world he prescribed " new eyeglasses and a hearing aid . "
On theoildrum.com , we discuss the particulars of our energy supply / consumption situation .
Less frequently do we have content outlining potential macro solutions that may be necessary to mitigate problems facing human systems .
This is such a post - adapted from a paper from last week 's Sustainable Development Commission written by Herman Daly , who popularized the term " Steady State Economy " over 3 decades ago .
While it does n't discuss energy per se , it does get at the heart of how we value and use energy - for growth - and the systems underlying this growth .
Sustainable Development Commission , UK ( April 24 , 2008 )
A Steady - State Economy
A failed growth economy and a steady - state economy are not the same thing ; they are the very different alternatives we face .
The Earth as a whole is approximately a steady state .
Neither the surface nor the mass of the earth is growing or shrinking ; the inflow of radiant energy to the Earth is equal to the outflow ; and material imports from space are roughly equal to exports ( both negligible ) .
None of this means that the earth is static — a great deal of qualitative change can happen inside a steady state , and certainly has happened on Earth .
The most important change in recent times has been the enormous growth of one subsystem of the Earth , namely the economy , relative to the total system , the ecosphere .
This huge shift from an “ empty ” to a “ full ” world is truly “ something new under the sun ” as historian J. R. McNeil calls it in his book of that title .
The closer the economy approaches the scale of the whole Earth the more it will have to conform to the physical behavior mode of the Earth .
That behavior mode is a steady state — a system that permits qualitative development but not aggregate quantitative growth .
Growth is more of the same stuff ; development is the same amount of better stuff ( or at least different stuff ) .
The remaining natural world no longer is able to provide the sources and sinks for the metabolic throughput necessary to sustain the existing oversized economy — much less a growing one .
Economists have focused too much on the economy ’s circulatory system and have neglected to study its digestive tract .
Throughput growth means pushing more of the same food through an ever larger digestive tract ; development means eating better food and digesting it more thoroughly .
Clearly the economy must conform to the rules of a steady state — seek qualitative development , but stop aggregate quantitative growth .
GDP increase conflates these two very different things .
We have lived for 200 years in a growth economy .
That makes it hard to imagine what a steady - state economy ( SSE ) would be like , even though for most of our history mankind has lived in an economy in which annual growth was negligible .
Some think a SSE would mean freezing in the dark under communist tyranny .
Some say that huge improvements in technology ( energy efficiency , recycling ) are so easy that it will make the adjustment both profitable and fun .
Regardless of whether it will be hard or easy we have to attempt a SSE because we cannot continue growing , and in fact so - called “ economic ” growth already has become uneconomic .
The growth economy is failing .
In other words , the quantitative expansion of the economic subsystem increases environmental and social costs faster than production benefits , making us poorer not richer , at least in high consumption countries .
Given the laws of diminishing marginal utility and increasing marginal costs this should not have been unexpected .
And even new technology sometimes makes it worse .
For example , tetraethyl lead provided the benefit of reducing engine knock , but at the cost spreading a toxic heavy metal into the biosphere ; chlorofluorocarbons gave us the benefit of a nontoxic propellant and refrigerant , but at the cost of creating a hole in the ozone layer and a resulting increase in ultraviolet radiation .
It is hard to know for sure that growth now increases costs faster than benefits since we do not bother to separate costs from benefits in our national accounts .
Instead we lump them together as “ activity ” in the calculation of GDP .
Ecological economists have offered empirical evidence that growth is already uneconomic in high consumption countries ( see ISEW , GPI , Ecological Footprint , Happy Planet Index ) .
Since neoclassical economists are unable to demonstrate that growth , either in throughput or GDP , is currently making us better off rather than worse off , it is blind arrogance on their part to continue preaching aggregate growth as the solution to our problems .
Yes , most of our problems ( poverty , unemployment , environmental degradation ) would be easier to solve if we were richer -- that is not the issue .
The issue is : Does growth in GDP any longer really make us richer ?
Or is it now making us poorer ?
For poor countries GDP growth still increases welfare , at least if reasonably distributed .
The question is ,
What is the best thing for rich countries to do to help the poor countries ?
The World Bank ’s answer is that the rich should continue to grow as rapidly as possible to provide markets for the poor and to accumulate capital to invest in poor countries .
The steady state answer is that the rich should reduce their throughput growth to free up resources and ecological space for use by the poor , while focusing their domestic efforts on development , technical and social improvements , that can be freely shared with poor countries .
The classical steady state takes the biophysical dimensions — population and capital stock ( all durable producer and consumer goods ) — as given and adapts technology and tastes to these objective conditions .
The neoclassical “ steady state ” ( proportional growth of capital stock and population ) takes tastes and technology as given and adapts by growth in biophysical dimensions , since it considers wants as unlimited , and technology as powerful enough to make the world effectively infinite .
At a more profound level the classical view is that man is a creature who must ultimately adapt to the limits ( finitude , entropy , ecological interdependence ) of the Creation of which he is a part .
The neoclassical view is that man , the creator , will surpass all limits and remake Creation to suit his subjective individualistic preferences , which are considered the root of all value .
In the end economics is religion .
Accepting the necessity of a SSE , along with John Stuart Mill and the other classical economists , let us imagine what it might look like .
First a caution — a steady - state economy is not a failed growth economy .
An airplane is designed for forward motion .
If it tries to hover it crashes .
It is not fruitful to conceive of a helicopter as an airplane that fails to move forward .
It is a different thing designed to hover .
Likewise a SSE is not designed to grow .
Following
Mill we might define a SSE as an economy with constant population and constant stock of capital , maintained by a low rate of throughput that is within the regenerative and assimilative capacities of the ecosystem .
This means low birth equal to low death rates , and low production equal to low depreciation rates .
Low throughput means high life expectancy for people and high durability for goods .
Alternatively , and more operationally , we might define the SSE in terms of a constant flow of throughput at a sustainable ( low ) level , with population and capital stock free to adjust to whatever size can be maintained by the constant throughput that begins with depletion of low - entropy resources and ends with pollution by high - entropy wastes .
How could we limit throughput , and thus indirectly limit stocks of capital and people in a SSE ?
Since depletion is spatially more concentrated than pollution the main controls should be at the depletion or input end .
Raising resource prices at the depletion end will indirectly limit pollution , and force greater efficiency at all upstream stages of production .
A cap - auction - trade system for depletion of basic resources , especially fossil fuels , could accomplish a lot , as could ecological tax reform , about which more later .
If we must stop aggregate growth because it is uneconomic , then how do we deal with poverty in the SSE ?
The simple answer is by redistribution — by limits to the range of permissible inequality , by a minimum income and a maximum income .
What is the proper range of inequality — one that rewards real differences and contributions rather than just multiplying privilege ?
Plato thought it was a factor of four .
Universities , civil services and the military seem to manage with a factor of ten to twenty .
In the US corporate sector it is over 500 .
As a first step could we not try to lower the overall range to a factor of , say , one hundred ?
Remember , we are no longer trying to provide massive incentives to stimulate ( uneconomic ) growth !
Also , since we are not trying to stimulate aggregate growth , we no longer need to spend billions on advertising .
Instead of treating advertising as a tax - deductible cost of production we should tax it heavily as a public nuisance .
If economists really believe that the consumer is sovereign then she should be obeyed rather than manipulated , cajoled , badgered , and lied to .
Free trade would not be feasible for a SSE , since its producers would necessarily count many costs to the environment and the future that foreign firms located in growth economies are allowed to ignore .
The foreign firms would win in competition , not because they were more efficient , but simply because they did not pay the cost of sustainability .
Regulated international trade under rules that compensated for these differences ( compensating tariffs ) could exist , as could “ free trade ” among nations that were equally committed to sustainability in their domestic cost accounting .
One might expect the IMF , the World Bank , and the WTO to be working toward such regulations .
Instead they vigorously push both free trade and free capital mobility ( i.e. , deregulation of international commerce ) .
Protecting an efficient national policy of cost internalization is very different from protecting an inefficient firm .
The case for guaranteed mutual benefit in international trade , and hence the reason for leaving it “ free ” , is based on Ricardo ’s comparative advantage argument .
A country is supposed to produce the goods that it can produce more cheaply relative to other goods , than is the case in other countries .
By specializing according to their comparative advantage both trading partners gain , regardless of absolute costs ( one country could produce all goods more cheaply , but it would still benefit by specializing in what it produced relatively more cheaply and trading for other goods ) .
This is logical , but like all logical arguments comparative advantage is based on premises .
The key premise is that while capital ( and other factors ) moves freely between industries within a nation , it does not move between nations .
If capital could move abroad it would have no reason to be content with a mere comparative advantage at home , but would seek absolute advantage — the absolutely lowest cost of production anywhere in the world .
Why not ?
With free trade the product could be sold anywhere in the world , including the nation the capital just left .
While there are certainly global gains from trade under absolute advantage there is no guarantee of mutual benefit .
Some countries could lose .
Now comes the problem .
The IMF preaches free trade based on comparative advantage , and has done so for a long time .
More recently the IMF has started preaching the gospel of globalization , which , in addition to free trade , means free capital mobility internationally — exactly what comparative advantage forbids !
When confronted with this contradiction the IMF waves its hands , suggests that you might be a xenophobe , and changes the subject .
The IMF - WB - WTO ( Washington Consensus ) contradict themselves in service to the interests of transnational corporations .
International capital mobility , coupled with free trade , allows corporations to escape from national regulation in the public interest , playing one nation off against another .
Since there is no global government they are in effect uncontrolled .
The nearest thing we have to a global government ( IMF - WB - WTO ) has shown no interest in regulating transnational capital for the common good .
Their goal is to help these corporations grow , because growth is presumed good for all — end of story .
If the IMF wanted to limit international capital mobility to keep the world safe for comparative advantage , there are several things they could do .
They could promote minimum residence times for foreign investment to limit capital flight and speculation , and they could propose a small tax on all foreign exchange transactions ( Tobin tax ) .
Most of all they could revive Keynes ’ proposal for an international multilateral clearing union that would directly penalize persistent imbalances in current account ( both deficit and surplus ) , and thereby indirectly promote balance in the compensating capital account , reducing international capital movements .
One problem for the SSE already raised by the demographic transition to a non growing population is that it necessarily results in an increase in the average age of the population — more retirees relative to workers .
Adjustment requires either higher taxes , older retirement age , or reduced retirement pensions .
The system is hardly in “ crisis ” , but these adjustments are surely needed to achieve sustainability .
For many countries net immigration has become a larger source of population growth than natural increase .
Immigration may temporarily ease the age structure problem , but the steady - state population requires that births plus in - migrants equal deaths plus out - migrants .
It is hard to say which is more politically incorrect , birth limits or immigration limits ?
Many prefer denial of arithmetic to facing either one .
The SSE will also require a “ demographic transition ” in populations of products towards longer - lived , more durable goods , maintained by lower rates of throughput .
A population of 1000 cars that last 10 years requires new production of 100 cars per year .
If more durable cars are made to last 20 years then we need new production of only 50 cars per year .
To see the latter as in improvement requires a change in perspective from emphasizing production as benefit to emphasizing production as a cost of maintenance .
Consider that if we can maintain 1000 cars and the transportation services thereof by replacing only 50 cars per year rather than 100 we are surely better off — the same capital stock yielding the same service with half the throughput .
Yet the idea that production is a maintenance cost to be minimized is strange to most economists .
Shifting taxes from value added to throughput would promote this minimizing effort .
One adaptation in this direction is the service contract that leases the service of equipment ( ranging from carpets to copying machines ) , which the lessor / owner maintains , reclaims , and recycles at the end of its useful life .
Although the main thrust of reforms for the SSE is to bring newly scarce and truly rival natural capital and services under the market discipline , we should not overlook the opposite problem , namely , freeing truly non rival goods from their artificial enclosure by the market .
There are some goods that are by nature non-rival , and should be freed from illegitimate enclosure by the price system .
I refer especially to knowledge .
Knowledge , unlike throughput , is not divided in the sharing , but multiplied .
Once knowledge exists , the opportunity cost of sharing it is zero and its allocative price should be zero .
International development aid should more and more take the form of freely and actively shared knowledge , along with small grants , and less and less the form of large interest - bearing loans .
Sharing knowledge costs little , does not create unrepayable debts , and it increases the productivity of the truly rival and scarce factors of production .
Existing knowledge is the most important input to the production of new knowledge , and keeping it artificially scarce and expensive is perverse .
Patent monopolies ( aka “ intellectual property rights ” ) should be given for fewer “ inventions ” , and for fewer years .
What would happen to the interest rate in a SSE ?
Would it not fall to zero without growth ?
Not likely , because capital would still be scarce , there would still be a positive time preference , and the value of total production may still increase without growth in physical throughput — as a result of qualitative development .
Investment in qualitative improvement may yield a value increase out of which interest could be paid .
However , the productivity of capital would surely be less without throughput growth , so one would expect low interest rates in a SSE , though not a zero rate .
Would it be possible to have qualitative improvement ( e.g. increasing efficiency ) forever , resulting in GDP growth forever ?
GDP would become ever less material - intensive .
Environmentalists would be happy because throughput is not growing ; economists would be happy because GDP is growing .
I think this should be pushed as far as it will go , but how far is that likely to be ?
Consider that sectors of the economy generally thought to be more qualitative , such as information technology , turn out on closer inspection to have a substantial physical base , including a number of toxic metals .
Also , if expansion is to be mainly for the sake of the poor it must be comprised of goods the poor need — clothing , shelter , and food on the plate , not ten thousand recipes on the Internet .
In addition , as a larger proportion of GDP becomes less material - intensive , the terms of trade between more and less material - intensive goods will move against the less material - intensive , limiting incentive to produce them .
Even providers of information services spend most of their income on cars , houses , and trips , rather than the immaterial product of other symbol manipulators .
Can a SSE maintain full employment ?
A tough question , but in fairness one must also ask if full employment is achievable in a growth economy driven by free trade , off - shoring practices , easy immigration of cheap labor , and widespread automation ?
In a SSE maintenance and repair become more important .
Being more labor intensive than new production and relatively protected from off - shoring , these services may provide more employment .
Yet a more radical rethinking of how people earn income may be required .
If automation and off - shoring of jobs increase profits but not wages , then the principle of distributing income through jobs becomes less tenable .
A practical solution ( in addition to slowing automation and off - shoring ) may be to have wider participation in the ownership of businesses , so that individuals earn income through their share of the business instead of through fulltime employment .
Also the gains from technical progress should be taken in the form of more leisure rather than more production — a long expected but under - realized possibility .
What sort of tax system would best fit a SSE ?
Ecological tax reform , already mentioned , suggests shifting the tax base away from value added ( income earned by labor and capital ) , and on to “ that to which value is added ” , namely the throughput flow , preferably at the depletion end ( at the mine - mouth or well - head , the point of “ severance ” from the ground ) .
Many states have severance taxes .
Taxing the origin and narrowest point in the throughput flow induces more efficient resource use in production as well as consumption , and facilitates monitoring and collection .
Taxing what we want less of ( depletion and pollution ) , and ceasing to tax what we want more of ( income , value added ) would seem reasonable — as the bumper sticker puts it , “ tax bads , not goods ” .
The shift could be revenue neutral and gradual .
Begin for example by forgoing $x revenue from the worst income tax we have .
Simultaneously collect $x from the best resource severance tax we could devise .
Next period get rid of the second worst income tax , and substitute the second best resource tax , etc .
Such a policy would raise resource prices and induce efficiency in resource use .
The regressivity of such a consumption tax could be offset by spending the proceeds progressively , by the limited range of inequality already mentioned , and by the fact that the mafia and other former income tax cheaters would have to pay it .
Cap - auction–trade systems will also increase government revenue , and auction revenue can be distributed progressively .
Could a SSE support the enormous superstructure of finance built around future growth expectations ?
Probably not , since interest rates and growth rates would be low .
Investment would be mainly for replacement and qualitative improvement .
There would likely be a healthy shrinkage of the enormous pyramid of debt that is precariously balanced atop the real economy , threatening to crash .
Additionally the SSE could benefit from a move away from our fractional reserve banking system toward 100 % reserve requirements .
One hundred percent reserves would put our money supply back under the control of the government rather than the private banking sector .
Money would be a true public utility , rather than the by - product of commercial lending and borrowing in pursuit of growth .
Under the existing fractional reserve system the money supply expands during a boom , and contracts during a slump , reinforcing the cyclical tendency of the economy .
The profit ( seigniorage ) from creating ( at negligible cost ) and being the first to spend new money and receive its full exchange value , would accrue to the public rather than the private sector .
The reserve requirement , something the Central Bank manipulates anyway , could be raised from current very low levels gradually to 100 % .
Commercial banks would make their income by financial intermediation ( lending savers ’ money for them ) as well as by service charges on checking accounts , rather than by lending at interest money they create out of nothing .
Lending only money that has actually been saved by someone reestablishes the classical balance between abstinence and investment .
This extra discipline in lending and borrowing likely would prevent such debacles as the current “ sub - prime mortgage ” crisis .
100 % reserves would both stabilize the economy and slow down the Ponzi - like credit leveraging .
A SSE should not have a system of national income accounts , GDP , in which nothing is ever subtracted .
Ideally we should have two accounts , one that measures the benefits of physical growth in scale , and one that measures the costs of that growth .
Our policy should be to stop growing where marginal costs equal marginal benefits .
Or if we want to maintain the single national income concept we should adopt Nobel laureate economist J. R. Hicks ’ concept of income , namely , the maximum amount that a community can consume in a year , and still be able to produce and consume the same amount next year .
In other words , income is the maximum that can be consumed while keeping productive capacity ( capital ) intact .
Any consumption of capital , manmade or natural , must be subtracted in the calculation of income .
Also we must stop the asymmetry of adding to GDP the production of anti-bads without first having subtracted the generation of the bads that made the anti-bads necessary .
Note that Hicks ’ conception of income is sustainable by definition .
National accounts in a sustainable economy should try to approximate Hicksian income and abandon GDP .
Correcting GDP to measure income is less ambitious than converting it into a measure of welfare , discussed earlier .
The logic of the SSE is reinforced by the recent finding of economists and psychologists that the correlation between absolute income and happiness extends only up to some threshold of “ sufficiency , ” and beyond that point only relative income influences self - evaluated happiness .
This result seems to hold both for cross-section data ( comparing rich to poor countries at a given date ) , and for time series ( comparing a single country before and after significant growth in income ) .
Growth cannot increase everyone ’s relative income .
The welfare gain of people whose relative income increases as a result of further growth would be offset by the loss of others whose relative income falls .
And if everyone ’s income increases proportionally , no one ’s relative income would rise and no one would feel happier .
Growth becomes like an arms race in which the two sides cancel each other ’s gains .
A happy corollary is that for societies that have reached sufficiency , moving to a SSE may cost little in terms of forgone happiness .
The “ political impossibility ” of a SSE may be less than it previously appeared .
Nevertheless it is one thing to imagine the possibility of a SSE , but something else to chart a transition thereto from a failed growth economy .
Can one transform an airplane into a helicopter without first landing , or perhaps crashing ?
In order even to take such a task seriously one has to realize that the growth economy is heading for a big crash .
Whether the measures suggested above are sufficient to convert the growth airplane to a steady - state helicopter is hard to say , but I do think they are probably necessary , and at a minimum would be useful guides for reconstruction after the crash .
They also may prove capable of being applied gradually in mid air .
For example , a cap - auction - trade system could begin with a generous cap followed by a gradual pre-announced schedule of tightening .
The limits to income inequality could begin far apart , and be gradually tightened .
Ecological tax reform could substitute at first only the worst value added taxes by the best throughput taxes , as mentioned earlier .
Compensatory tariffs to protect national costinternalization policies could be imposed and raised gradually .
Reserve requirements for banks could be raised gradually to one hundred percent .
Patent monopolies could be gradually reduced and knowledge gradually restored to its proper status as a non rival good .
Downsizing of the IMFWB - WTO from a servant of global integration in the interests of transnational capitalist growth to something closer to Keynes ’ nationbased multilateral clearing union for international payments — this would be more difficult to do gradually .
But nations may begin individually to withdraw from these institutions as it becomes more evident that they have abandoned the federated internationalist nature of their Bretton Woods Charter in favor of an economically integrated globalist vision of capital - dominated growth , and are as yet incapable of conceiving the possibility , much less recognizing the reality , of uneconomic growth .
While these transitional policies will appear radical to many , it is worth remembering that , in addition to being amenable to gradual application , they are based on the conservative institutions of private property and decentralized market allocation .
They simply recognize that private property loses its legitimacy if too unequally distributed , and that markets lose their legitimacy if prices do not tell the whole truth about costs .
In addition , the macro-economy becomes an absurdity if its scale is structurally required to grow beyond the biophysical limits of the Earth .
And well before that radical physical limit we are encountering the conservative economic limit in which extra costs of growth become greater than the extra benefits .
Ten Point Policy Summary
1.. Cap limits to biophysical scale according to source or sink constraint , whichever is more stringent .
Auction captures scarcity rents for equitable redistribution .
Trade allows efficient allocation to highest uses .
2.— shift tax base from value added ( labor and capital ) and on to “ that to which value is added ” , namely the entropic throughput of resources extracted from nature ( depletion ) , through the economy , and back to nature ( pollution ) .
Internalizes external costs as well as raises revenue more equitably .
Prices the scarce but previously unpriced contribution of nature .
3.— a minimum income and a maximum income .
Without aggregate growth poverty reduction requires redistribution .
Complete equality is unfair ; unlimited inequality is unfair .
Seek fair limits to inequality .
4.— allow greater option for leisure or personal work .
Full - time external employment for all is hard to provide without growth .
5.— move away from free trade , free capital mobility and globalization , adopt compensating tariffs to protect efficient national policies of cost internalization from standards - lowering competition from other countries .
6. to something like Keynes ’ plan for a multilateral payments clearing union , charging penalty rates on surplus as well as deficit balances — seek balance on current account , avoid large capital transfers and foreign debts .
7.instead of fractional reserve banking .
Put control of money supply and seigniorage in hands of the government rather than private banks .
8. , and price it , while freeing from private enclosure and prices the non rival commonwealth of knowledge and information .
Stop treating the scarce as if it were non scarce , and the non scarce as if it were scarce .
9..
Work toward a balance in which births plus immigrants equals deaths plus out - migrants .
10 .— separate GDP into a cost account and a benefits account .
Compare them at the margin , stop growing when marginal costs equal marginal benefits .
Never add the two accounts .

Blizzard Bans WoW Botters in Massive Crackdown
MMO Glider enables its users to automatically level characters within World of Warcraft .
The program sells for $ 25 , with an optional $ 5 subscription available that provides additional functionality .
Blizzard sued the makers in February of 2007 , and now claims that bot author Michael Donnelly has made $ 2.8 million from the software .
Hundreds of posts flooded the official Glider forums following the suppression , the freshly - banned cheaters sharing their frustration .
" Is there a way ( E.U. ) to get unused month of WOW money back ?
I have paid with credit card 6 months ..?
Is there a way to get Glider Elite money back ? " read the post of one Glider user in a thread titled " I want my money Back ! "
Other Glide users repented , encouraging Blizzard in its efforts to free the game from AI influence .
" Blizzard just made the game better by excluding the people who ruin it , " said confessed Glider user Sundruid .
" I hope people learn from this and stop botting . "

The trick is to distract yourself by studying stuff that 's slightly different from whatever you 're trying to learn .
Your brain will then work harder to permanently store the original information .
It 's a tricky concept , but here 's an example :
In 2007 , researchers asked UCLA students to try to memorize a set of 48 word pairs ( country : Russia , fruit : lemon , flower : lily , etc. ) .
After studying the list , some students then had to sit through a slide show and view closely related material ( flower : rose ) .
Guess what ?
The distracted students performed better on subsequent recall tests .
" Distraction forces you to engage in processing , " says Benjamin Storm , a UCLA researcher who oversaw the study .

A hint for next time :
If you do n't want to talk about
ABC News ' " debate " was a travesty and embarrassment to decent journalists everywhere .
The gotcha debate style is more suitable to a professional wrestling match than an interview for the most important job in the world .
Clearly , ABC

YOU hate America , not people who do n't wear flag pins .
Burn in hell , you traitorous corporate whores .
A hint for next time :
If you do n't want to talk about important issues , do n't hold a debate .
If you want to ask about stupid , pointless shit , why not get Jerry Springer to hold the debate ?
I 'm sure he'd do a better job than the two ass - clowns you had run it .

You may think I 'm being impolite .
Wrong .
You should 've seen what I wanted to write .
Sincerely ,
an American voter
I did n't even watch the damn debate and I could still smell its rancid stink by checking the livebloggers .

PostGIS releases a new minor version of PostGIS every one or two years .
Each minor version of postgis has a different libname suffix .
In PostGIS 2.1 you 'll find files in your PostgreSQL lib folder called postgis - 2.1.* , rtpostgis-2.1. * , postgis- topology - 2.1. * , address - standardizer - 2.1. * etc. and in a PostGIS 2.2 you 'll find similar files but with 2.2 in the name .
I believe PostGIS and pgRouting are the only extensions that stamp the lib with a version number .
Most other extensions you will find are just called extension .
so e.g. hstore is always called hstore.dll /hstore .
so even if the version changed from 9.6 to 10 .
On the bright side this allows people to have two versions of PostGIS installed in a PostgreSQL cluster , though a database can use at most one version .
So you can have an experimental database running a very new or unreleased version of PostGIS and a production database running a more battery tested version .
On the sad side this causes a lot of PostGIS users frustration trying to use pg_upgrade to upgrade from an older version of PostGIS / PostgreSQL to a newer version of PostGIS / PostgreSQL ; as their pg_upgrade often bails with a message in the loaded_libraries .
txt log file something to the affect :
could not load library " $libdir/postgis - 2.2 " : ERROR : could not access file " $libdir/postgis-2.2 " :
No such file or directory could not load library " $libdir/postgis - 2.3 " : ERROR : could not access file " $libdir/postgis-2.3 " :
No such file or directory
This is also a hassle because we generally do n't support a newer version of PostgreSQL on older PostGIS installs because the PostgreSQL major version changes tend to break our code often and backporting those changes is both time - consuming and dangerous .
For example the DatumGetJsonb change and this PostgreSQL 11 crasher we have n't isolated the cause of yet .
There are several changes like this that have already made the PostGIS 2.4.0 we released recently incompatible with the PostgreSQL 11 head development .
SUNNYVALE , Calif . 
Call it an eco-parable : one Prius - driving couple takes pride in their eight redwoods , the first of them planted over a decade ago .
Their electric - car - driving neighbors take pride in their rooftop solar panels , installed five years after the first trees were planted .
Trees  redwoods , live oaks or blossoming fruit trees  are usually considered sturdy citizens of the sun-swept peninsula south of San Francisco , not criminal elements .
But under a 1978 state law protecting homeowners ’ investment in rooftop solar panels , trees that impede solar panels ’ access to the sun can be deemed a nuisance and their owners fined up to $ 1,000 a day .
The Solar Shade
Act was a curiosity until late last year , when a dispute over the eight redwoods ( a k a Tree No. 1 , Tree No. 2 , Tree No. 3 , etc. ) ended up in Santa Clara County criminal court .
The couple who planted the trees , Carolynn Bissett and Richard Treanor , were convicted of violating the law , based on the complaint of their neighbor , Mark Vargas , and were ordered to make sure that no more than 10 percent of the solar panels are shaded .
A few weeks after The San Jose Mercury News wrote about the situation , the first act ended with the couple pruning 10 feet to 15 feet of Tree No. 6 ’s upper branches .
The event drew more cameras than an episode of “ Extreme Home Makeover . ”

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) warned in March that Iran had detected a new highly pathogenic strain of wheat stem rust called Ug99 .
The fungal disease could spread to other wheat producing states in the Near East and western Asia that provide one - quarter of the world ’s wheat .
Scientists and international organizations focused on controlling wheat stem rust have said 90 percent of world wheat lines are susceptible to Ug99 .
The situation is particularly critical in light of the existing worldwide wheat shortage .
Also In This Edition
The fungus causes dark orange pustules on stems and leaves of infected plants .
The pustules can completely girdle stems , damaging their conducting tissue and preventing grain fill .
Yield losses may reach 70 percent , while some fields are totally destroyed .
If stem rust arrives early in the growing cycle , losses are higher .
Spores released by the fungal pustules are spread by the wind and may travel great distances in storms .
Word of the new wheat disease comes amid global shortages of rice and wheat resulting from typhoon - related flooding in Java , Bangladesh , and India and from agricultural pests and diseases in Vietnam .
Last year Australia suffered its second consecutive year of severe drought and a near complete crop failure , heavy rains reduced production in Europe , Argentina suffered heavy frost , and Canada and the U.S. both produced low yields .
Food riots have broken out in Egypt , Haiti and several African states , including Mauritania , Cameroon , Cote d'Ivoire , Burkina Faso and Senegal in recent months .

Despite unanimously supporting a bill in committee two weeks ago that would provide federal funds to local governments to pay for recounts and paper trails , House Republicans have reversed course and blocked the bill from receiving an up - or - down vote .
This move ensures two things , and two things only : a ) the accusations of fraud that marred the 2000 and 2004 elections will continue , and b ) the GOP shows once and for all that they have nothing but contempt for our democracy and free and fair elections .
Politico :
Voting rights activists who hoped the federal government would help local governments pay for paper trails and audits for electronic voting machines have gone from elation to frustration as they watched Republicans who supported such a proposal in committee vote against bringing it to the House floor .

Act came up for a vote in the House Administration Committee on April 2 , the Republicans on the committee gave it their unanimous support .
But two weeks later , those same Republican members voted against moving the bill to the House floor .
It would have taken a two - thirds vote to push the bill to the floor ; with most House Republicans opposed , the bill did n’t make it that far .
Tin foil hats aside , what possible reason could the GOP have for opposing such a measure ?
2000 and 2004 have left such a bitter taste in the electorate 's mouth that this seems like a no - brainer .
Does the West have a new secret weapon in dealing with China in the person of Kevin Rudd , the new prime minister of Australia ?
Rudd is the only Western leader who speaks Chinese , and his Chinese is pretty good at that .
But deeper still is Rudd 's understanding of China .
Australian China scholar Geremie Barme unpacks Rudd 's marvelous speech , given at Beijing University last week , in which he bluntly called on China to recognize its human rights problems in Tibet .
Most Western leaders probably would have either punted or come on too strong .
Rudd 's tone , however , was pitch perfect .
Rudd 's brilliance in the speech involves turning the Chinese term " friend " on its head .
Friend ( pengyou in Chinese ) and frienship ( youyi ) are two of the most distorted concepts in modern China culture .
In modern China , a friend is someone who will do you favors and who expects favors in return .
A " foreign friend " is someone the Chinese party - state expects will carry water for them and NEVER criticize them .
Whenever a Chinese official called me " foreign friend " ( waiguo pengyou ) , I knew some type of horrible deal would soon be asked or expected of me .
In a new report , the viability of sending solar panels into space to collect a vast quantity of uninterrupted energy has been re-investigated .
Although the idea has been around since the 1970 ’s , space solar power has always been viewed as prohibitively expensive .
In the current energy climate down here on Earth with spiralling oil prices and a massive push toward green energy sources , sending massive solar arrays into geosynchronous orbit does n’t seem like such a strange ( or expensive ) idea .
There are many obstacles in the way of this plan , but the international community is becoming more interested , and whoever is first to set up an orbital array will have a flexible and unlimited energy resource …
It sounds like the perfect plan : build a vast array of solar panels in space .
This avoids many of the practical problems we have when building them on Earth such as land availability , poor light conditions and night time , but sending a sunlight farm into space will be expensive to set up .
In the 1970 ’s a plan was drawn up by NASA for the possibility of orbital sunlight “ harvesting ” , but it was deemed too expensive with a hefty price tag of at least $ 1 trillion .
There was no country in the world that could commit to such a plan .
But as we slowly approach an era of cheaper space travel , this cost has been slashed , and the orbital solar energy case file has been re-opened .
Surprisingly , it is n’t the most developed nations in the world that are pushing for this ultimate renewable energy source .
India and China , with their ballooning populations are reaching a critical point for energy consumption and they are beginning to realise their energy crisis may be answered by pushing into space .
“ A single kilometer - wide band of geosynchronous Earth orbit experiences enough solar flux in one year to nearly equal the amount of energy contained within all known recoverable conventional oil reserves on Earth today . ” – Pentagon ’s National Security Space Office 2007 report .
So how could this plan work ?
Construction will clearly be the biggest expense , but the nation who leads the way in solar power satellites will bolster their economy for decades through energy trading .
The energy collected by highly efficient solar panels could be beamed down to Earth ( although it is not clear from the source what technology will go into “ beaming ” energy to Earth ) where it is fed into the national grid of the country maintaining the system .
Ground based receivers would distribute gigawatts of energy from the uninterrupted orbital supply .
This will have obvious implications for the future high demand for electricity in the huge nations in Asia and will wean the international community off carbon - rich non-renewable resources such as oil and coal .
There is also the benefit of the flexible nature of this system being able to supply emergency energy to disaster ( and war - ) zones .
“ It will take a great deal of effort , a great deal of thought and unfortunately a great deal of money , but it is certainly possible . ” – Jeff Keuter , president of the George C. Marshall Institute , a Washington - based research organization .
The most optimistic time frame for a fully operational space - based sunlight collection satellite would be 2020 , but that is if we started work now .
Indeed some research is being done ( Japan is investing millions of dollars into a potential prototype to be put into space in the near future ) , but this is a far cry from planning to get full - scale operations underway in a little over a decade …

SINCE the industrial revolution 200 years ago , mankind has depended on fossil fuel .
The notion that this might change is hard to contemplate .
Greens may hector .
Consciences may nag .
The central heating 's thermostat may turn down a notch or two .
A less thirsty car may sit in the drive .
But actually stop using the stuff ?
Impossible to imagine : surely there is n't a serious alternative ?
Such a failure of imagination has been at the heart of the debate about climate change .
The green message — use less energy — is not going to solve the problem unless economic growth stops at the same time .
If it does not ( and it wo n't ) , any efficiency saving will soon be eaten up by higher consumption per head .
Even the hair - shirt option , then , will bring only short - term relief .
And when a dire prophecy from environmentalism 's jeremiad looks as if it is coming true , as the price of petroleum rises through the roof and the idea that oil might run out is no longer whispered in corners but openly discussed , there is a temptation to believe that the end of the world is , indeed , nigh .
Not everyone , however , is so pessimistic .
For , in the imaginations of a coterie of physicists , biologists and engineers , an alternative world is taking shape .
As the special report in this issue describes , plans for the end of the fossil - fuel economy are now being laid and they do not involve much self - flagellation .
Instead of bullying and scaring people , the prophets of energy technology are attempting to seduce them .
They promise a world where , at one level , things will have changed beyond recognition , but at another will have stayed comfortably the same , and may even have got better .
This time it 's serious
Alternative energy sounds like a cop-out .
Windmills and solar cells hardly seem like ways of producing enough electricity to power a busy , self - interested world , as furnaces and steam - turbines now do .
Battery - powered cars , meanwhile , are slightly comic : more like milk - floats than Maseratis .
But the proponents of the new alternatives are serious .
Though many are interested in environmental benefits , their main motive is money .
They are investing their cash in ideas that they think will make them large amounts more .
And for the alternatives to do that , they need to be both as cheap as ( or cheaper than ) and as easy to use as ( or easier than ) what they are replacing .
For oil replacements , cheap suddenly looks less of a problem .
The biofuels or batteries that will power cars in the alternative future should beat petrol at today 's prices .
Of course , today 's prices are not tomorrow's .
The price of oil may fall ; but so will the price of biofuels , as innovation improves crops , manufacturing processes and fuels .
Electrical energy , meanwhile , will remain cheaper than petrol energy in almost any foreseeable future , and tomorrow 's electric cars will be as easy to fill with juice from a socket as today 's are with petrol from a pump .
Unlike cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells , of the sort launched by Honda this week , battery cars do not need new pipes to deliver their energy .
The existing grid , tweaked and smartened to make better use of its power stations , should be infrastructure enough .
What matters is the nature of those power stations .
The price is right
They , too , are more and more likely to be alternative .
Wind power is taking on natural gas , which has risen in price in sympathy with oil .
Wind is closing in on the price of coal , as well .
Solar energy is a few years behind , but the most modern systems already promise wind - like prices .
Indeed , both industries are so successful that manufacturers cannot keep up , and supply bottlenecks are forcing prices higher than they otherwise would be .
It would help if coal — the cheapest fuel for making electricity — were taxed to pay for the climate - changing effects of the carbon dioxide produced when it burns , but even without such a tax , some ambitious entrepreneurs are already talking of alternatives that are cheaper than coal .
Older , more cynical hands may find this disturbingly familiar .
The last time such alternatives were widely discussed was during the early 1970s .
Then , too , a spike in the price of oil coincided with a fear that natural limits to supply were close .
The newspapers were full of articles on solar power , fusion and converting the economy to run on fuel cells and hydrogen .
Of course , there was no geological shortage of oil , just a politically manipulated one .
Nor is there a geological shortage this time round .
But that does not matter , for there are two differences between then and now .
The first is that this price rise is driven by demand .
More energy is needed all round .
That gives alternatives a real opening .
The second is that 35 years have winnowed the technological wheat from the chaff .
Few believe in fusion now , though uranium - powered fission reactors may be coming back into fashion .
And , despite Honda 's launch , the idea of a hydrogen economy is also fading fast .
Thirty - five years of improvements have , however , made wind , solar power and high - tech batteries attractive .
As these alternatives start to roll out in earnest , their rise , optimists hope , will become inexorable .
Economies of scale will develop and armies of engineers will tweak them to make them better and cheaper still .
Some , indeed , think alternative energy will be the basis of a boom bigger than information technology .
Whether that boom will happen quickly enough to stop the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reaching dangerous levels is moot .
But without alternative energy sources such a rise is certain .
The best thing that rich - world governments can do is to encourage the alternatives by taxing carbon ( even knowing that places like China and India will not ) and removing subsidies that favour fossil fuels .
Competition should do the rest — for the fledgling firms of the alternative - energy industry are in competition with each other as much as they are with the incumbent fossil - fuel companies .
Let a hundred flowers bloom .
When they have , China , too , may find some it likes the look of .
Therein lies the best hope for the energy business , and the planet .
Bob Barr , Former Republican , Announces Bid for Libertarian Nomination
With the three remaining candidates for president being so weak , inspiring , and just plain nauseating , it is time to start looking somewhere else , anywhere else .
My search has led me here , for starters .
Bob Barr , a former Republican , has announced he is running to become the Libertarian party nominee for president .
“ My name is Bob Barr and I ’m a candidate for the presidency of the United States of America , ” said the former Republican lawmaker , who played a key role in the congressional impeachment of former president Bill Clinton .
Barr said he was running because there was not “ currently or anywhere on the horizon ” any candidate who understood the principles of fiscal conservatism and basic principles on which he said America was founded .
AMEN !
Our whole system of government has been corrupted and it truly is sad to watch .
This could pull votes away from John McCain , but so what ?
At best he will pull as many votes away from McCain as Ralph Nader will from Obama or Clinton .
And if by any chance a vote for Barr is the same as a vote for the Democrat candidate , and it leads to a Democrat president , so be it .
I do n’t care .
To me there is n’t a hell of a lot of difference between McCain , Obama , or Clinton .
They are all on the wrong side of illegal immigration , taxes , and global warming for starters .
Do I agree with everything that Bob Barr stands for ?
No .
But I probably agree with more of his stances than with John McCain’s .
I will be voting for a third party candidate , and I will do so with a clear conscience .
I will not vote for John McCain just because he is a Republican , and I sure as hell wo n’t vote for Obama or Clinton , so I have no other choice than to vote third party .
If by voting for a third party candidate Obama or Clinton becomes president , do n’t blame me or the other Republicans who decided to vote third party .
Blame John McCain , and blame the voters who nominated McCain .
You led us to this point .
Matt Ettus has the sly smile of someone who sees the invisible .
His hands fly over the boards of his Universal Software Radio Peripheral , or USRP , snapping them together with an antenna like Lego bricks .
Then he plugs in the naked boards to a USB 2 cable snaking to his Linux laptop .
After few minutes of normal Linux messing around ( " Takes forever to boot ....
Have n't got the sound driver working yet .... " ) he turns the laptop around to reveal a set of vibrating lines in humps and dips across the screen , like a wildly shaking wireframe mountain range .
" Here , " he explains , " I 'm grabbing FM . "
" All of it ? " I ask .
" All of it , " he says .
I 'm suddenly glad the soundcard is n't working .
Radio is that bit of the electromagnetic spectrum that sits between brain waves and daylight .
It 's made of the same stuff that composes light , color , electrical hums , gamma radiation from atom bombs , the microwaves that reheat your pizza .
From our perspective , radio devices behave very differently – a global positioning system gadget does n't look like a TV does n't look like a CB set , even if they are all radios .
They are single - purpose machines that use small bits of radio spectrum to do very specific tasks – about as far from the general - purpose personal computer as you can get .
But there 's no reason they have to be .
Most of the required components of a radio are the same and can be generalized .
And with Moore 's law making processors fast enough , much of a radio's function can be done with software .
Building a general radio that can receive and transmit , and attaching it to a software system that can fill in the gaps of what we normally think of as radio , is kind of like the Enterprise 's deflector dish :
Give engineering 20 minutes and it can do anything the captain needs to move the plot along .
One of Ettus ' USRPs , with the right daughterboards and radio software , can capture FM , read GPS , decode HDTV , transmit over emergency bands and open garage doors .
The GNU radio project was the brainchild of Eric Blossom , who wanted to create a software HDTV receiver in advance of broadcast flag legislation limiting what hardware was allowed to receive the high - def signal .
" We 'd just go build one of those things ( in software ) and moot ( broadcasters ' ) control over the hardware , " says Blossom .
He teamed up with Ettus , but they lacked a radio platform that was cheap enough to get into many people 's hands .
They could do a lot with the computer , but there were limits .
" How do I get from the antenna into the computer ? " explains Blossom .
" The computer wants digital samples to work on . "
Ettus secured National Science Foundation funding through the University of Utah to design what would become the USRP .
" Basically we proposed the 85 percent solution for 10 percent of the price .
Given that part of the NSF 's charter is about education ... you can get 10 more things in your students ' hands for your dollars , " says Blossom .
Ettus was drawn more to the technical challenge than the political project .
He wanted to build the HDTV receiver " because it was the Mount Everest ... it was the biggest receive - only mountain . "
Decoding HDTV was a political act of radio , but , mostly , Ettus wanted to see if he could do it .
Four years later , Ettus has n't just decoded HDTV , but has gone on to write software that does far more .
He 's quit his day job to build and sell the USRP hardware full time – you can buy it from his website starting at $ 550 for the motherboard .
Ettus and Blossom 's software - defined radio on the cheap is popping up in unexpected places , describing a very different radio world from the centralized model that has dominated radio history .
" Decentralized controls enable innovation at the edge – it's closer to the computer model , " says Blossom .
" I think what we 'll find is that people will come up with things we never really thought about . "
Ettus is more concrete about the project 's possibilities .
Citing Wi-Fi as an example , he envisions " a world in which bandwidth is not an issue .
People will create applications that will use that bandwidth , like complete telepresence . "
Ettus paints a picture of radio bringing about a many - to - many revolution , like blogging , but for a wider segment of the world .
" It enables everybody to be a broadcaster , " he says .
Toby Oliver 's business is a great example of the street finding its own use for stray radio waves .
His company , PathIntelligence , uses the USRP and GNU Radio to track foot traffic in U.K. shopping centers .
Listening for the control - channel signals of mobile phones allows the PathIntelligence setup to pinpoint the location of a phone using triangulation by measuring the difference in time it takes for the signal from a phone to get to multiple antennas .
This works like a very local version of GPS , allowing shopping - center owners to see what shop windows are most popular , and where people tend to congregate or avoid , without actually intercepting any personal data .
It 's something that processing speed made possible , and the GNU Radio / USRP project made cost - effective .
" Only recently , in the last 12 months , has computing power enabled me to do what I need to in general - purpose software without the expensive development of dedicated DSPs ( digital signal processors ) , " says Oliver .
" It means that a whole world of opportunities for tinkerers like me is being opened up . "
A person without a phone is invisible to his system , but with the market penetration of mobile phones in Britain , the occasional outlier does n't damage the data set much .
Shopping centers are showing a lot of interest in the information .
But despite his new job , Oliver 's background is n't in radio .
" In some ways , ( software - defined radio ) enables the arcane world of RF ( radio frequency ) to be available to software developers .
So you will start to be able to do more and more ' mashups ' to RF , " he says .
The USRP is being put through its paces in research labs and amateurs ' basements all over the world .
Ettus sells to companies and governments .
Some radio sets out there do more , but Ettus claims that generally the USRP costs a tenth of other software - defined radio - ready equipment .
He continues to work on the USRP , developing better signal intelligence and more diverse daughterboards to tune to different bits of radio spectrum .
Blossom is working on a passive radar system that will require a more sensitive hardware setup than the current USRP .
His passive radar reads in the ambient radio waves from existing sources , like FM stations and cell towers , and uses them to build a map of the area .
At the end of his research , he plans to have " this little gadget that you can plug into a laptop and see what 's flying around .
We 're hoping to see stuff on the order of 50 to 70 kilometers away . "
Neither Blossom nor Ettus can predict how their next projects will be used .
But that 's the point .

HotRuby is a project which aims to port the Ruby Virtual Machine over to ECMAScript ( allowing it to run , directly , in a browser using JavaScript or indirectly using ActionScript in Flash ) .
Currently the code works by using Ruby 1.9’s YARV ( Yet Another Ruby VM ) to compile down a Ruby script into opcodes , which are then serialized and passed to the browser for execution .
It ’s a little bit indirect but it still capable of creating a compelling result .
If you were to run one of the examples in your browser the actual chain of execution would be something like this :
Script finds < script type=” text / ruby ” ></ script > tags and extracts the inline Ruby code from them .
The Ruby code is sent to the server via an XMLHttpRequest .
The server - side CGI script ( in Ruby , using Ruby 1.9 ) compiles the incoming Ruby into its associated opcodes and serializes it into a JSON data structure .
The browser consumes the opcodes , translating it into JavaScript , and executes it .
To observe this full process we can take a look at the code in the provided benchmark and watch its full path through the server and final execution :
startTime = Time.new.to_f sum = " " 50000.times{|e| sum += e.to_s} endTime = Time.new.to_f puts ( endTime - startTime ) .to_s + ' sec '
For example , observe this portion of the CGI script :
#!/usr/local/bin/ruby # Requires Ruby 1.9.0 #
The license of this source is " Ruby License " require ' json ' require ' cgi ' cgi = CGI. new puts " Content - type : text / plain
" puts VM :: InstructionSequence.compile(cgi['src ' ] , " src " , 1 , {}).to_a.to_json
and a sample of the opcode data returned by the server :
[ " YARVInstructionSequence\ / SimpleDataFormat " , 1,1,1 , {" arg_size " : 0 , " local_size " : 4 , " stack_max " : 3} , " " , " src " , " top " , [" startTime " , " sum " , " endTime " ] , 0 , [ [ " break " , null , " label_21 " , " label_29 " , " label_29 " ,0 ] ] , [ 2 , [ " putnil " ] , [" getconstant " , " Time " ] , [ " send " , " new " , 0 , null , 0 , null ] , [ " send " , " to_f " , 0 , null , 0 , null ] , [" setlocal " , 4] , 4 , [" putstring " , " " ] , [ " setlocal " , 3 ] , " label_21 " , 5 , [ " putobject " , 50000 ] , [ " send " , " times " , 0 , [ " YARVInstructionSequence\ / SimpleDataFormat " , 1,1,1 , {" arg_size " : 1 , " local_size " : 1 , " stack_max " : 2} , " block in " , " src " , " block " , [ " e " ] , [ 1 , [ ] , 0,0, -1, - 1,3 ] , [[ " redo " , null , " label_0 " , " label_22 " , " label_0 " ,0 ] , [" next " , null , " label_0 " , " label_22 " , " label_22 " ,0 ] ] , [ " label_0 " , 5 , [ " getdynamic " , 3,1 ] , [" getdynamic " , 1,0 ] , [ " send " , " to_s " , 0 , null , 0 , null ] , [ " send " , " + " , 1, null , 0 , null ] , [" dup " ] , [ " setdynamic " , 3,1 ] , " label_22 " , [ " leave " ] ] ] , 0 , null ] , " label_29 " , [ " pop " ] , 7 , [ " putnil " ] , [" getconstant " , " Time " ] , [ " send " , " new " , 0 , null , 0 , null ] , [ " send " , " to_f " , 0 , null , 0 , null ] , [" setlocal " , 2] , 9 , [ " putnil " ] , 8 , [ " getlocal " , 2 ] , [" getlocal " , 4 ] , [ " send " , " - " , 1 , null, 0 , null ] , [" send " , " to_s " , 0 , null , 0 , null ] , [" putstring " , " sec " ] , 9 , [ " send " , " + " , 1 , null , 0 , null ] , [ " send " , " puts " , 1, null , 8 , null ] , 8 , [ " leave " ] ] ]
and you can find the full client - side virtual machine here : HotRuby.js .
Perhaps most fascinating about this , though , is the speeds that are able to be achieved with this script .
Granted , the above benchmark is rather contrived , but the end performance results are quite fascinating :
Firefox 3.0b5 2.47s Firefox 2 6.71s Ruby 1.8.2 12.25s
We can see a 2.71 x speed improvement from Firefox 2 to Firefox 3 and a 5 x performance improvement over regular Ruby 1.8.2 , running on the command - line .
It ’s a fascinating time to be working with JavaScript .
The performance improvements that are being provided to us by the browser afford us a realm of possibility that was n’t , previously , viable .
The fact that we ’re even discussing running a virtual machine , implemented in JavaScript , is quite impressive .
I ’m curious to see what applications end up being built with this implementation – and within what context they end up using it .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - The European Union is on track to achieve the goal of getting 12 to 14 percent of its electricity from windfarms by 2020 , according to a report on Wednesday .
The report by the European Wind Energy Association ( EWEA ) also found wind power was likely to account for around a third of new generating in the period 2005 - 2020 and 46 percent in the decade leading up to 2030 .
The 27 - nation bloc aims to get 20 percent of its energy from renewables such as solar , wave , hydro and biomass by 2020 , versus 8.5 percent now , with wind viewed as the largest contributor .
“ On average , wind power capacity needs to increase by 9.5 gigawatts per year over the next 13 years to reach 180 gigawatts and meet 12 to 14 percent of EU power demand in 2020 , ” said EWEA Chief Executive Christian Kjaer .
“ This is certainly achievable , considering that the EU wind energy capacity increased by 8.5 gigawatts last year , ” he added .
We 've heard lots of racket about Intel 's hot new Atom chip courtesy of all those subnote manufacturers who plan on using it , but Tranquil PC has noted that the first Mini-ITX motherboard to get powered by said processor is now available for ordering .
The Intel D945GCLF comes loaded with a 1.6GHz Atom 230 CPU and support for high - definition audio , 10/100 LAN , PCI , SATA II , GMA 950 graphics and DDR 2 533 / 667 ( just to name a few highlights ) .
The board can be ordered up as we speak for £ 52.90 ( $ 103 ) , and shipments are expected to make their way out during the first week of June . [ Via Tranquil PC's Weblog , thanks David ]
Corn
“ If you ’re standing in a field in Iowa , there ’s an immense amount of food being grown , none of it edible .
The commodity corn , nobody can eat .
It must be processed before we can eat it .
It ’s a raw material — it ’s a feedstock for all these other processes .
And the irony is that an Iowa farmer can no longer feed himself . ”
— Michael Pollan , author of The Omnivore 's Dilemma
Corn is everywhere — in everything from apples to antifreeze , body lotion to batteries , margarine to magazines .
The story of corn ’s ubiquity is a long one : a complex tale that begins more than 6,000 years ago in the dry valleys of Mesoamerica and continues on today in grocery store aisles — and the halls of Congress .
Grown on every continent except Antarctica , planted on 93 million acres of United States land , and finding its way into nearly everything on the dinner table , the humble corn plant may just be the most influential crop that society has ever seen .

BEIRUT , Lebanon --
In a stinging defeat for the U.S. - backed government of Lebanon , the Islamist group Hezbollah bolstered its political power in this volatile land on Israel 's border .
Hezbollah reached a bargain with the weak Lebanese government that essentially gave the Islamic group veto power in a new government to be formed .
The deal comes two weeks after Hezbollah flashed its military might by seizing Beirut neighborhoods to protest efforts to rein it in .
The trigger was unusual : Hezbollah was expanding a secret communications network , and the government wanted it dismantled .
The ensuing fighting this month left 67 dead , in the worst internal strife since a long civil war ended in 1990 .
Wednesday 's agreement could have broad regional implications .
It appeared to be the latest rebuke to the U.S. 's diplomatic efforts in the region to marginalize Syria and Iran , both big supporters of Hezbollah .
The bargain met Hezbollah 's longstanding demand for a political setup in which it could block any major legislation it opposed .
The Bush administration welcomed the agreement as an important tool for avoiding a potential civil war between Hezbollah and the pro-Western Lebanese government led by Prime Minister Fuad Siniora .
" It 's not perfect as a solution , but you have to weigh it against the alternative , " said Assistant Secretary of State David Welch .
Unlike most of the billions of chargers sold every year and even universal adapters from brands such as iGo and Targus , GreenPlug power systems stop charging products when the batteries in their associated products reach full charge and includes a glowing status indicator like those in Apple 's laptops .
The solution relies on a chip and firmware called GreenTalk embedded into the device that communicates with the power supply .
Adding new chips to the cost - sensitive consumer electronics product can often spell bad news for a company with a hot new technology , and GreenPlug 's solution would add significantly to a device 's price .
However , the company plans to seed high - volume consumer electronics companies with free chips to set its virtuous cycle in motion .
Once there is a significant flow of GreenPlug - enabled devices in the market , accessory makers can begin offering AC adapters that work across a variety of devices from different manufacturers .
Power accessory makers such as Belkin , Kensington and Targus could offer a variety of multi- port power hubs , expanding the " universal " power supply market exponentially at retailers .
There could even be enough critical mass for building charging hubs directly into lamps , desks , or even new houses .
So GreenPlug may be free to the likes of Sony , HP and Nokia .
But why would they end years of selling scores of profitable replacement AC adapter models ?
There could certainly be an early mover advantage to the first manufacturers to offer an energy - monitoring solution and it's no coincidence that these three high - volume device companies have been loudly beating the green drum .
GreenPlug notes that , while AC adapters bring in revenue , they are a major inventory management challenge .
Sony alone maintains thousands of AC adapters for its products .
GreenPlug is also green in that it encourages reuse .
There 's no need to dispose of a GreenPlug AC adapter when you dispose of a product you use with it .
In the long term and with a robust enough ecosystem , manufacturers could save money and reduce recall liability by not bundling AC adapters with their products .
And manufacturers could still differentiate based on matching designs and other innovations .
Acer , for example , could create a GreenPlug version of the brick for the Gateway One 's AC adapter , which integrates USB host and Ethernet ports .
Still , the manufacturer incentive is probably the weakest link in GreenPlug 's chain .
The next Switched
On will discuss some other challenges to GreenPlug and how the company plans to address them .
An MIT class has estimated the carbon emissions of Americans in a wide variety of lifestyles -- from the homeless to multimillionaires , from Buddhist monks to soccer moms -- and compared them to those of other nations .
The somewhat disquieting bottom line is that in the United States , even the people with the lowest usage of energy are still producing , on average , more than double the global per-capita average .
Whether you live in a cardboard box or a luxurious mansion , whether you subsist on homegrown vegetables or wolf down imported steaks , whether you 're a jet - setter or a sedentary retiree , anyone who lives in the U.S. contributes more than twice as much greenhouse gas to the atmosphere as the global average , an MIT class has estimated .
The class studied the carbon emissions of Americans in a wide variety of lifestyles -- from the homeless to multimillionaires , from Buddhist monks to soccer moms -- and compared them to those of other nations .
The somewhat disquieting bottom line is that in the United States , even people with the lowest energy usage account for , on average , more than double the global per-capita carbon emission .
And those emissions rise steeply from that minimum as people 's income increases .
" Regardless of income , there is a certain floor below which the individual carbon footprint of a person in the U.S. will not drop , " says Timothy Gutowski , professor of mechanical engineering , who taught the class that calculated the rates of carbon emissions .
The results will be presented this May at the IEEE International Symposium on Electronics and the Environment in San Francisco .
While it may seem surprising that even people whose lifestyles do n't appear extravagant -- the homeless , monks , children -- are responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions , one major factor is the array of government services that are available to everyone in the United States .
These basic services -- including police , roads , libraries , the court system and the military -- were allocated equally to everyone in the country in this study .
Other services that are more specific , such as education or Medicare , were allocated only to those who actually make use of them .
The students conducted detailed interviews or made detailed estimates of the energy usage of 18 lifestyles , spanning the gamut from a vegetarian college student and a 5 - year - old up to the ultrarich - - Oprah Winfrey and Bill Gates .
The energy impact for the rich was estimated from published sources , while all the others were based on direct interviews .
The average annual carbon dioxide emissions per person , they found , was 20 metric tons , compared to a world average of four tons .
But the " floor " below which nobody in the U.S. can reach , no matter a person 's energy choices , turned out to be 8.5 tons , the class found .
That was the emissions calculated for a homeless person who ate in soup kitchens and slept in homeless shelters .

The analysis was carried out by Gutowski and 21 students in his 2007 class , " Environmentally benign design and manufacturing . "
They derived a system for making such comparisons , which they call ELSA -- environmental life style analysis .
Unlike some other attempts to quantify carbon - emission rates , Gutowski and his students took great care to account for often - overlooked factors , such as the " rebound effect . "
That 's when someone makes a particular choice -- for example , buying a hybrid car instead of a gas - guzzler - - but then uses the money saved from their reduced gasoline costs to do something else , such as taking a long trip by airplane .
The net impact , in such a case , may actually be an overall increase in carbon emissions .
" When you save energy , you save money , " Gutowski explains .
" The question is , how are you going to spend that money ? "
The students looked at the factors within each person 's control that might lead to a reduction in carbon output .
They found that achieving significant reductions for the most part required drastic changes that would likely be unacceptable to most people .
As a result , they said , " this all suggests to us very significant limits to voluntary actions to reduce impacts , both at a personal level and at a national level . "
In a continuation of the class this semester , another group of students are exploring this question in more detail , looking at just what kinds of things people really can do to limit their environmental impact .
The question they are addressing , Gutowski says , is " can average Americans tighten their belts " in a way that would make a significant difference ?
Once again , the class will be interviewing people living in a wide variety of ways , including an Amish farming lifestyle .
Then , after analyzing the results and possible changes , they will go back to the same people and ask , " Would you consider these alternatives ? "
In general , spending money on travel or on goods that have substantial energy costs in their manufacture and delivery adds to a person 's carbon footprint , while expenditures on locally based labor - intensive services -- whether it 's going to a therapist , taking an art class , or getting a massage -- leads to a smaller footprint .
But the biggest factors in most people 's lives were the obvious energy - users : housing , transportation and food .
" The simple way you get people 's carbon use down is to tax it , " Gutowski says .
" That 's a hard pill to swallow - - politicians do n't like to step up " to support such measures .
Absent such national actions , he says , it is important to study " what role consumer choices can play " in lowering the nation 's carbon emissions .
If nothing else , the members of this class got a whole new perspective .
" The students really got into it , " Gutowski says .
" It raised everybody 's awareness about the issues . "
There are concerns that the mission may be failing
He warned that without reinforcements the Nato - led force could lose credibility in the country .
A German newspaper described Mr Gates ' letter to German Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung as " unusually stern " , and its response equally blunt .
Correspondents say the exchange comes amid growing signs of strain in the mission and in Nato as a whole .
Canada 's Prime Minister Stephen Harper has issued both US President George W Bush and UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown with an ultimatum - that Canada will end its military mission in Afghanistan if Nato does not put more soldiers in the dangerous south of the country .
New mandate
Mr Gates 's appeal comes amid strains in the Nato alliance
The newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung said it was sent about 10 days ago .
It asks for Germany to consider a new mandate which could allow thousands more troops to be sent to Afghanistan with some deployed to the more dangerous south .
The Nato - led force has almost 37,000 troops in Afghanistan .
Germany currently has 3,200 troops stationed in northern Afghanistan and around the capital , Kabul .
According to the current parliamentary mandate , the troops can only be sent elsewhere under exceptional circumstances .
The letter complains of a heavy burden on US troops and of a possible split in the Nato alliance .
The US has already promised to send an extra 3,000 US marines - but is urging other Nato countries including France and Germany to do more .
So far most Nato members have refused to send significant numbers to southern Afghanistan .
HAVE YOUR SAY Germany is a part of Nato and is obliged to send in more troops Rob , Wirral , UK
In a meeting with Mr Gates in Washington on Thursday , French Defence Minister Herve Morin called for a " comprehensive strategy " in Afghanistan but failed to pledge any more combat troops .
The BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington says the US has tried to avoid a public row with Nato members .
But speaking to a senate committee a senior US diplomat stated that " we expect more from our Nato allies " , adding that too few allies had combat troops fighting the insurgents in the south .

Dear Continental Airlines , I am disgusted as I write this note to you about the miserable experience I am having sitting in the seat 29 E on one of your aircrafts .
As you may know , this seat is situated directly across from the lavatory , so close that I can reach out my left arm and touch the door .
All my senses are being tortured simultaneously .
It ’s difficult to say what the worst part about sitting in 29E really is ?
Is it the stench of the sanitation flued that is blown all over my body every 60 seconds when the door opens ?
Is it the woosh of the constant flushing ?
Or is it the passengers asses that seem to to fit into my personal space like a pornographic jig - saw puzzle ?
I constructed a stink - shield by shoving one end of a blanket into the overhead compartment — while effective in blocking at least some of the smell , and offering a small bit of privacy , the ass - on - my - body factor has increased , as without my evil glare , passengers feel free to lean up against what they think is some sort of blanketed wall .
The next ass that touches my shoulder will be the last !
Putting a seat here was a very bad idea .
I just heard a man groan in there !
This sucks !
Worse yet , is I ’ve paid over $ 400 for the honor of sitting in this seat !
I am picturing a board room full of executives giving props to the young promising engineer that figured out how to squeeze an additional row of seats onto this plane by putting them next to the LAV .
I would like to flush his head in the toilet that I am close enough to touch , and taste , from my seat .
Does your company give refunds ?
I ’d like to go back where I cam from and start over .
Seat 29 E could only be worse if it was located inside the bathroom .
I wonder if my clothing will retain the sanitizing odor … what about my hair !
I feel like I ’m bathing in a toilet bowl of blue liquid , and there is no man in a little boat to save me .
I am filled with a deep hatred for your plane designer and a general dis-ease that may last for hours .
We are finally decending , and soon I will be able to tear down the stink shelf , but the scars will remain .
I suggest that you initiate immediate removal of this seat from all of your crafts .
Just move it , and leave the smoldreing brown hole empty , and [ something ] a good place for sturdy / non - absorbing luggage maybe , but not human cargo . ” ( thanks , Corporat )
War crimes next October surprise ?
It ’s early October 2008 , and Democratic nominee Barack Obama maintains a steady lead in the presidential race , although Republican standard - bearer John McCain , the most dogged campaigner in American politics , remains within striking range .
Suddenly , something happens overseas that throws the presidential campaigns off the TV screens entirely : Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , on vacation in Italy , is arrested and brought to The Hague to face war crimes charges .
Advertisement
Presidential campaigns try to prepare for these “ October surprises , ” late - breaking events and crises that can radically alter the race for the White House , such as the attack on the USS Cole in October 2000 .
But now there ’s a new element in the mix , something presidential campaigns have never had to plan for .
What if the October surprise is the greatest legal conflict between America and Europe since the creation of the Atlantic alliance ?
Do n’t think it ca n’t happen .
I think the arrest abroad of an American is only a matter of time and , between now and November , is at least as likely as another terrorist attack on U.S. soil .
As a former Marine Corps Commandant , Gen. Paul X. Kelley , reminded the nation in a July 2007 Washington Post op - ed , written with a University of Virginia law professor : “ Violations of Common Article 3 are ‘ war crimes ’ for which everyone involved — potentially up to and including the president of the United States — may be tried in any of the other 193 countries that are parties to the conventions . ”
Courts in Italy and Germany already have issued warrants demanding the arrest of CIA operatives for illegally kidnapping and allegedly torturing citizens and residents of their nations .
More than 30 U.S. citizens have been named , their CIA covers blown .
These warrants have not been executed , primarily for diplomatic reasons .
But they could be acted upon rapidly with a simple decision by either government .
And other names — of those directly involved in “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” — are starting to emerge overseas .
Former high - ranking government officials might want to also think twice about traveling to Europe this summer .
Just this week , new evidence emerged that waterboarding and other blatant methods of torture were specifically and directly authorized in White House meetings .
Anyone present is now potentially culpable before an international court .
As former Attorney General John Ashcroft is reported to have presciently said at one such meeting : “ Why are we talking about this in the White House ?
History will not judge this kindly . ”
Moreover , a recently declassified memo from former Justice Department lawyer John
Yoo bluntly argued for nearly unlimited presidential power to torture , without regard for international law .
Under the precedent of the Nuremberg trials , even making such an argument exposes
Yoo , along with others — including federal Judge Jay S. Bybee , a former Bush administration Justice Department official , or former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales — to war crimes indictments .
Now that President Bush is on his way out , European governments may be far more willing to act on their principles .
Most Europeans deeply disapprove of Bush ’s torture policies and might well reward one of their leaders for taking him on .
And it takes only one government , and sometimes just one politician , to issue a warrant .
That ’s what happened to former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1998 .
While Pinochet was visiting Britain , a single prosecutor in Spain suddenly charged him with torturing and murdering Spanish and Chilean citizens .
Britain was forced by European treaties to take the charges seriously , and a 16 - month legal battle ensued .
So what should the campaigns say if this unlikely but no longer impossible scenario breaks before America votes ?
The safe answer for both campaigns would be to appeal to American pride and insist that our citizens should be tried in American courts under American law .
Remember , much of the nation rallied behind Army Lt. William Calley when he was on trial for the My Lai massacre in 1971 .
The rally effect would be even greater for a CIA interrogator charged in a foreign court .
But if the person behind bars in Holland were a prominent former Bush administration official , the right answer might shift .
Could candidate Obama successfully argue that the Bush administration ’s foreign policy was responsible for this international humiliation ?
Could torture survivor McCain , a longtime critic of Rumsfeld and Bush ’s policies on enhanced interrogation , use this incident to establish his independence from the unpopular Bush administration ?
The right campaign response would ultimately depend on the reaction of the American public .
My gut tells me that the public ’s first response would be a mixture of anger and confusion , mostly directed at Europe .
And the president would certainly not remain silent ; Bush would do his damndest to convince Americans that this was a despicable assault on our liberties and sovereignty .
He might win that argument , despite his record as the president who has the lowest approval ratings for the longest period since polling began .
But in any case , the campaigns must have an answer ready .
Because even if no American is arrested between now and Nov. 4 , surely some journalist will ask in the crucial fall debates : “ Mr. Obama , you ’ve said that waterboarding violates the Geneva Conventions .
What would you do as president if an American were arrested overseas and charged with waterboarding ?
“ And Mr. McCain , you ’re on record stating that waterboarding is always torture .
If someone at this White House authorized waterboarding , should they be punished here or abroad ? ”

A Big Week for Vestas Wind Systems
May 9th , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
Denmark - based Vestas Wind Systems ( VWS : DC ) had a big week .
First , the world ’s largest wind turbine manufacturer announced that they would be building a tower manufacturing plant in Colorado .
Second , Vestas reported a 94 percent jump in earnings in the first quarter of 2008 , as compared to the same period last year .
Although they have yet to disclose the location of the new tower manufacturing facility , it would be situated to complement the company ’s fist North American blade manufacturing plant , which recently opened its doors in Windsor , Colorado .
For the tower plant , the company will need a large parcel of land that is ideally served by freight rail , a combination that Northern Colorado can provide at several locations , including the Windsor location .
Healthy Profit Margins Hide Industry Bottlenecks
In the second piece of big news for the Vestas , the company reported very strong earnings on Thursday – the kind of earnings that emphasize the wind energy industry ’s resilience to the slumping economy .
Net income for Vestas rose 94 percent to 33 million euros ( $ 56 million ) from 17 million euros a year earlier .
The company was expected to earn 35.5 million euros , according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of five analysts .
Despite the strong growth in the wind energy business worldwide , the overall demand pressure on the industry persists .
According to Bloomberg , there are still long lead times for a number of key components that can last as long as 15 months .
Of particular concern to turbine manufacturers is a global increase in demand for carbon - fiber , the graphite composite material that moderns turbines blade use because of their light weight , and high tensile strength .
With that said , it seems that it will be a few years before supply will match demand .
Even as new manufacturers pop up around the globe , they are being outpaced by the increases in global demand for clean , renewable energy .

Joint Chiefs chair : US prepping military options against Iran Mike Sheehan
Published : Friday April 25 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said that the Pentagon is planning " potential " military actions against Iran , reports The Washington Post .
Mullen criticized Iran's " ' increasingly lethal and malign influence ' in Iraq , " writes Ann Scott Tyson for the Post .
Addressing concerns about the US military 's capability of dealing with yet another conflict at a time when forces are purportedly stretched thin , Mullen said war with Iran " would be ' extremely stressing ' but not impossible for U.S. forces , pointing specifically to reserve capabilities in the Navy and Air Force , " Tyson notes .
" It would be a mistake to think that we are out of combat capability , " she quotes the U.S. 's top military leader at a Pentagon news conference .
Mullen 's assertion comes a day after American forces reportedly fired warning shots at Iranian speedboats in the Persian Gulf , a confrontation that Iran denies took place .
A prior incident involving U.S. forces in the Strait of Hormuz and Iranian speedboats in January of this year -- which Republican White House candidates used ( with the notable exception of Ron Paul ) as a saber - rattling opportunity during a nationally - televised debate - - was later discredited as a virtual fabrication .
Excerpts from the Post article , available in full here , follow ... # ... Mullen made clear that he prefers a diplomatic solution to the tensions with Iran and does not foresee any imminent military action .
" I have no expectations that we 're going to get into a conflict with Iran in the immediate future , " he said .
Mullen 's statements and others by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates recently signal a new rhetorical onslaught by the Bush administration against Iran , amid what officials say is increased Iranian provision of weapons , training and financing to Iraqi groups that are attacking and killing Americans .
In a speech Monday at West Point , Gates said Iran " is hell - bent on acquiring nuclear weapons . "
He said a war with Iran would be " disastrous on a number of levels .
But the military option must be kept on the table given the destabilizing policies of the regime and the risks inherent in a future Iranian nuclear threat . "
Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , who was nominated this week to head all U.S. forces in the Middle East , is preparing a briefing soon to lay out detailed evidence of increased Iranian involvement in Iraq , Mullen said .
The briefing will detail , for example , the discovery in Iraq of weapons that were very recently manufactured in Iran , he said . #
Beyond its severe toll on human life and public health , the COVID - 19 pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in routines that we have long assumed were reliable and safe .
Reevaluating these routines will help us find new and better ways of doing things , but only if we leave some bad ideas in the dustbin .
As Cato scholars Daniel J. Ikenson and Simon Lester explain in this Pandemics and Policy issue , one of these ideas is that the pandemic is proof of the failures of globalization .
Instead , they show how without the global economy , America will be poorer , more vulnerable , and less resilient .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The former judge who last year lost a multimillion - dollar lawsuit against a dry cleaners over a missing pair of pants wants his job back .
Roy Pearson sued the owners of this dry cleaning business for $ 54 million over a missing pair of pants .
Roy Pearson was not reappointed after his term expired as an administrative law judge in the District of Columbia .
He filed a lawsuit Thursday in federal court accusing city government and others of an " unlawful demotion and subsequent termination . "
Pearson was taken off the bench in May 2007 , during his unsuccessful $ 54 million lawsuit against a dry cleaning business , which he accused of failing to meet its promise of " satisfaction guaranteed . "
As an administrative law judge , Pearson would hear cases involving zoning law and certain business disputes .
A city panel that decides reappointments had notified Pearson during the controversial lost trousers trial that his status was under review .
A source on that panel said at the time that any judge must meet certain standards of conduct " on and off the bench . "
The source , who was among the members of the panel at the time of Pearson 's review , said " a judge is a judge 24/ 7 ; whether or not they use good judgment in all aspects of their lives is what we can consider . "
The civil case , in which Pearson represented himself , sought punitive and compensatory damages against a small family - owned dry cleaners that once posted signs promising " satisfaction guaranteed . "
A pair of trousers that hung by the witness stand was a featured part of the trial last summer .
The owners testified that the pants belonged to Pearson , who denied under oath that they were his .
The judge found in favor of the dry cleaners and disagreed with Pearson that the satisfaction promise was unconditional .
Pearson petitioned the trial judge for a reconsideration , which was denied .
He then filed an appeal with the D.C. Court of Appeals , which will hear his appeal later this year .
In court documents made available Friday at U.S. District Court in Washington , Pearson , again acting as his own attorney , relies on what he considers Washington 's " Whistleblower Protection " law to try to establish illegal retaliation .
The trial over the lost trousers generated a storm of criticism among fairness advocates , who accused Pearson of abusing the system .
The latest litigation has begun to produce the same reaction .
" He lost his job because he proved he did not have the legal requirements to fill the job , namely a judicial temperament , " said Darren McKinney of the American Tort Reform Association .
Pearson did not return a message left at home .
In his suit seeking to regain his job , he also seeks " compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial , in excess of $ 75,000 from all defendants jointly and severally , " as well as an unspecified amount of punitive damages " to be determined at trial . "
Efforts to seek reaction from the individuals named in the lawsuit were unsuccessful .
No initial hearing date has been set in the civil case assigned to U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan .

Abstract :
You should not obfuscate you code with low - level optimizations : your compiler can do them for you .
Too often people believe that they can " optimize " their program by using , say , i++ instead of i = i + 1 .
Such tricks might be important twenty years ago , but modern compilers are clever enough to do this job without your help .
Here are some of the things that your compiler can do for you .
Integer arithmetic optimizations
Paul Hsieh suggests the following tricks :
// Non-optimized : Optimized : //
Using bitwise AND to calculate Y modulo N , where N is a power of two x = y % n ; x = y & ( n - 1 ) ; x = y % 32 ; x = y & 31 ; // Using shifts instead of multiplication by power of two x = y * 8 ; x = y << 3 ;
A test with MSVC ++ , GCC , Borland C++ , Pelles C , and Digital Mars showed that all these compilers generated the same optimized code for both snippets .
So you should not obfuscate your code by writing
bitmap_size = width * height << 2 ;
instead of
bitmap_size = width * height * sizeof( COLORREF ) ;
Modern compilers optimize multiplication and division by an arbitrary constant .
For example , your compiler can use a combination of shifts , additions , and subtractions instead of the slower IMUL instruction :
// MSVC ++ 2005 , full optimization , favor fast code ( / Ox / Ot ) // GCC 3.2 , - O3 ( generates the same code as MSVC ++ ) : // ( x * 7 ) lea ecx , dword [ eax * 8 ] sub ecx , eax // ( x * 5 ) lea ecx , dword [ eax+eax * 4 ] // ( x * 8 ) lea ecx , dword [eax * 8 ]
Pelles C and Digital Mars C++ are unable to optimize some cases :
// Pelles C 4.5 , maximize speed more ( - Ot - Ox ) // Digital Mars 8.33 // ( x * 7 ) imul ecx , eax ,
7
Digital Mars and Borland C++ use SHL , not LEA for multiplication by a power of two :
// Digital Mars 8.33 // Borland C++ 5.5.1 , optimize for speed ( - O2 ) // ( x * 8 ) shl eax ,
3
MSVC ++ and GCC achieve better results , because the shift instruction is slow on Pentium IV .
In any case , replacing multiplications with shifts obfuscates your source code and gives a little or no improvement in speed .
Constant folding
To improve readability , you can use arithmetic expressions for constants :
#define AVG_MONTH_LENGTH
365.25 / 12 const double AVG_MONTH_LENGTH
= 365.25 / 12 ;
It does n't matter if you use # define or const double : in both cases , the value of AVG_MONTH_LENGTH will be calculated at compile time .
You do n't have to divide 365.25 by 12 with a calculator , and then write the result in your source code file .
Use your compiler instead .
// Another example of constant folding WORD inline BSWAP ( WORD x ) { return x >> 8 | x << 8 ; // In MSVC ++ , you can use _byteswap_ushort ( non-portable ) } const WCHAR IDEOGRAPHIC_SPACE = 0x3000 ; if(unicode_character == BSWAP( IDEOGRAPHIC_SPACE ) || unicode_character == BSWAP ( ' ' ) ) // ...
MSVC ++ , GCC , and Borland C++ can deduce that BSWAP ( IDEOGRAPHIC_SPACE ) == 0x0030 and BSWAP ( ' ') == 0x2000 , and compare the unicode_character with these values .
Obviously , the source code is much more readable than the one with " magic numbers " :
if( unicode_character == 0x0030 || unicode_character == 0x2000 ) // ...
Other tricks
Sometimes a compiler can optimize your code in a way that you did not think about .
For example , if you always use a function with the same constant argument , MSVC ++ 2005 avoids passing this parameter and propagate the constant into a function body .
This makes the function code smaller and faster .
RedHat 's site lists all optimizations performed by GCC .
This compiler also " knows " many clever tricks ; in some areas , it 's even better than MSVC ++.
( See also a similar list from a compiler performance analysis tool . )
Generally , you do n't need to use mysterious constants in your code .
Your compiler can do this work for you , while you will enjoy reading clean and simple source code .

After Downing Street , Andrea Miller —
I joined the impeachment rally yesterday at Bobby Scott ’s office ; it was excellent and there were about 15 people .
Everyone at the rally went upstairs to Bobby Scott ’s office and Chris Dorsey spoke eloquently about the need for impeachment and how the Cheney / Bush impeachment has nothing to do with partisanship .
Most notably we had the Ron Paul Virginia coordinator with us ( though the office did not know about this affiliation ) .
Allan added that we are recruiting new blood for Congress that will support impeachment as the will of the people .
He told the staffer that there are new candidates in the 8th , 1st and 10th ; I added that I was running in the 4th .
I think this double - tack may help to have an impact .
As new people step up to run , this should encourage the old guard to carefully consider where they stand with their constiuency and are they out of touch .
Bobby Scott ’s office is in a predominantly African - American neighborhood and we got honks for impeachment from everyone driving by including police and fire folks driving official vehicles .
I think we need to now have the “ suits ” approach Bobby Scott as well as the extreme activists .
We need to show support in the movement from all walks of life ( in short everybody that votes for Bobby Scott — or the new candidate that more closely reflects their political goals and ideals . )
Questions You Wo n't Hear on China 's State TV Did Shoddy Construction Worsen Disaster 's Impact ?
Schools collapsed like houses of cards , apartment blocks were reduced to dust .
The horrendous earthquake in China 's Suchuan province underscores problems with shoddy construction in the country .
State television may be full of images of people in mourning , but any questions of responsibility are taboo .
People who send large numbers of text messages and emails may have a mental disorder , a doctor writing in a leading psychiatric journal said .
Jerald Block , writing in the latest issue of the American Journal Of Psychiatry , said " internet addiction " was a " common disorder " that deserved inclusion in a manual of mental disorders used by health professionals .
Those with the condition suffered withdrawal symptoms of anger and tension when a computer was inaccessible , and often lost their sense of time through excessive use , Dr Block said .

I usually do n’t watch the Sunday morning talk shows like Meet the Press or This Week .
I ’m not sure why .
I think this is because I have a deeply ingrained aversion to them dating back to my childhood .
You see , we really only had a handful of channels in those pre-cable days , and on Sunday mornings , before the cartoons really got going , three of those channels were running these incredibly boring talk shows – when they should have been running , at least from my point of view , cartoons .
It was completely beyond me why they were running these shows at all , and not just doubling up on Superfriends or Scooby Doo !
It seems I knew , even at that young age , that there were some things are just better off left till Monday .
What I ’m getting at , is that I did not see Hillary Clinton on This Week with George Stephanopolous , on Sunday morning .
But since we have a 24 - hour media matrix covering every breath and every word in this presidential campaign , I was told all about it by all of my regular news outlets as soon as I got up .
I was most struck by Senator Clinton ’s reply to Stephanopolous ’ question about the pushback her proposed summertime gas - tax holiday has received .
STEPHANOPOLOUS :
“ Economists say that ’s not going to happen .
They say this is going to go straight into the profits of the oil companies .
They ’re not going to actually lower their prices .
And the two top leaders in the House are against it .
Nearly every editorial board and economist in the country has come out against it .
Even a supporter of yours , Paul Krugman of The New York Times , calls it pointless and disappointing .
Can you name one economist , a credible economist who supports the suspension ? ”
[ Clinton tried to elude the question with a foray into populist appeals of how elite opinion is bringing down the hard - working middle class , but Stephanopolous reiterated the question ] .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
“ But can you name an economist who thinks this makes sense ? ”
CLINTON :
“ Well , I ’ll tell you what , I ’m not going to put my lot in with economists , because I know if we get it right , if we actually did it right , if we had a president who used all the tools of the presidency , we would design it in such a way that it would be implemented effectively . ”
Now , I am usually the last person to be defending economists , but when it comes to designing energy tax policy , perhaps an economist is not a bad person to talk to , no ?
Former Labor Secretary in the Clinton administration , Robert Reich thinks so .
Reich wrote in his blog on Sunday :
“ I ’m not suggesting economists have all the answers .
But when economists tell a president or a presidential candidate that his or her idea is dumb – and when all respectable economists around America agree that it ’s a dumb idea – it ’s probably wise for the president or presidential candidate to listen .
When the president or candidate does n’t , and proudly defends the policy by saying she ’s “ not going to put my lot in with economists , ” we ’ve got a problem , folks .
“ Even though the summer gas tax holiday is pure hokum , it polls well , which is why HRC and John McCain are pushing it .
That Barack Obama is not in favor of it despite its positive polling numbers speaks volumes about the kind of president he ’ll be – and the kind of president we ’d otherwise get from McCain and HRC . ”
This gas tax holiday is just a bad idea all the way around .
First of all , Sen. Clinton proposes that her tax be paid for by the oil companies .
Do you actually think something like that would get through the Senate ?
Let me say this , if Congress would n’t repeal tax breaks to big oil to fund renewable energy tax credits , they are not going to pay for a summertime tax moratorium on gas with an increased tax on the oil companies .
Abolishing the federal excise tax on gasoline in the summer leading up to the presidential election is exactly the kind of pure pandering that is not going to get Hillary Clinton or John McCain elected .

Possible collateral damage from the ascendence of HD and Blu-ray : people want their movies to look nice and clean and sharp and without film grain , even if the feel of a movie calls for it .
Unfortunately , what seems to happening right now is that the studio marketing folks are conducting focus groups with new Blu-ray consumers , who are saying they want perfect pictures every time .
As a result , a few of the Hollywood studios are currently A ) using excessive Digital Noise Reduction to completely scrub film grain from their Blu-ray releases , or B ) not releasing as many older catalog titles as they might otherwise for fear that people will complain about grain .
Some studios are even going so far as to scrub the grain out of NEW releases that have been shot on film .
Case in point : New Line ’s Pan ’s Labyrinth Blu-ray Disc .
When I saw this film in the theaters , it was dark and gritty .
The grain was a deliberate stylistic choice — part of the artistic character of the film .
New Line ’s Blu-ray , on the other hand , is sparkly and glossy — almost entirely grain - free .
So much fine detail has been removed that the faces of characters actually look waxy .
Everyone looks like a plastic doll .
While some people know about these little tricks , the majority do not .
These are small tips to help you improve the foods we commonly eat - most are recommended by top chefs and others by very experienced home cooks .
10 . Carrots and Sugar
While it may seem strange to add sugar to vegetables , it is a very common method of preparing carrots in France .
The technical term for this dish is Vichy Carrots , in which you combine Carrots , Salt , Pepper , sugar , and Vichy water ( a sparkling water from the Vichy region ) and cook them down until the carrots are glazed .
The sugar heightens the flavor of the carrots and the end result is a stunning dish of brilliantly orange vegetables .
9. Coffee and Salt
Add a touch of salt to coffee to heighten the flavor - this is a very common use of salt as it is used in virtually all dishes ( including sweet dishes served for pudding ) .
Just a pinch is enough to make a brilliant espresso .
8. Tomatoes and Sugar
Use sugar , not salt .
Tomatoes are already acidic and the addition of salt just increases that acidic flavor .
Sugar sweetens and increases the tomato flavor .
Tomatoes are fruits after all .
7. Chocolate and Coffee
When baking with chocolate , add a little coffee - it strengthens the chocolate flavor without adding a strong coffee flavor .
6. Meat and Aniseed
When stewing meat , throw in a star anise - you ca n’t taste the aniseed but the flavor adds a deep richness to the meat .
This is a trick used in all meat dishes by Heston Blumenthal the owner of the Fat Duck ( 3 Michelin stars ) - voted the world ’s best restaurant for three years in a row .
5. Cooking tomatoes and Foliage
Throw in a tomato branch - the branch contains all of the flavor that we love in tomatoes - pick a leaf and smell it and you will see what I mean .
Simply throw in a small stick of the tomato plant and it will give your cooked tomatoes a much stronger tomato flavor .
4. Potatoes and Nutmeg
Add nutmeg - just a little - it adds a depth to the potatoes that people wo n’t recognize , but will definitely like .
This is true of virtually every potato dish .
3. Chili and Chocolate
Add chocolate to chili .
It deepens the meaty flavor of the chili while giving a strong base note to the peppers .
This is a trick well known in the South where Chili bake - offs are common .
2. Apples and Vanilla
Apples are very acidic and normally require some sugar in their cooking .
Most people add nutmeg or cinnamon to their apple dishes , but vanilla extract adds a deep layer of flavor that most people wo n’t recognize but will certainly appreciate .
1. Strawberries and Pepper
Strawberries ( fresh ) are usually served with a sprinkling of confectioners sugar , but the addition of very finely ground pepper ( from fresh corns ) heightens the flavor .
Just before the wedding ( which went great , by the way — more later , but see here and here in the meantime ) , I finished reading Jonathan Lethem ’s novel Fortress of Solitude , and I ’ve been talking about it ever since .
Maybe I ’m just deprived from not reading any contemporary fiction in the run-up to the exams , but it seemed like the sort of book that could get everyone talking .
After a couple hundred pages I knew I was going to want to blog on it , but I could n’t think of how to get beyond “ this book is really interesting ” and thus make it interesting to those ( probably almost all of you ) who had n’t read the book .
Luckily Joe Kugelmass called my attention to Timothy Burke ’s proposal for a “ Department of Everything Studies ” ( by posting his own excellent response to it ) , and I realized the way in : the novel intersects with a debate , bubbling especially over the last few years , over the juxtaposition of pop culture with high culture ( or the outright substitution of the latter with the former ) , in art , in academia , and in society at large .
Incidentally , feel free to put invisible quotation marks around “ high culture , ” but to a large extent I believe in the distinction so I ’m leaving them out .
What I ’ve written below is pretty sprawling , and I do n’t pretend to have a particularly clear thesis — except insofar as , once again , I propose the Middle Path .
Instead , I want to use the book to examine some of the issues that surround the interaction between pop culture and high culture , including the canon , race and class , and “ nerds , ” and look at how academics might resolve these .
( A note to those who have n’t read the book : I ’ll try to avoid spoilers here , but obviously a certain amount of reference to the events of the plot is inevitable . )
The novel is about a white boy , Dylan Ebdus , growing up in largely non-white Brooklyn in the 1970s .
It deals with issues of race , of family ( both Dylan and his black best friend , Mingus Rude , have been left by their mothers ) , and popular art of all kinds — Dylan and Mingus are both interested in music , comic books , and , starting in adolescence , graffiti ; Mingus ’s father is a successful soul musician , and Dylan ’s is an abstract artist who pays the bills by doing paintings for sci - fi novels .
Moreover , the novel explores how , for young people especially , the choice of different cultural relics and fashions necessarily entails participation in a particular social scene , and thus acts to define not only one ’s taste but one ’s group and personality .
This is true whether the individual means it or not — at one point one of Dylan ’s middle - class , white high - school friends , wearing a leather jacket to show solidarity with the burgeoning punk movement , gives offense to a Puerto Rican gang member who wears his leather jacket as an emblem of his own community .
More on the theme of self - definition later .
Fortress of Solitude falls short of being a great novel , mainly because the latter half of the book , dealing with Dylan ’s adulthood , is not as interesting as the half dealing with his childhood and adolescence , which is as smart and engaging as just about anything I can remember reading .
Without getting into too much detail , a character ’s harassment by bullies ( of any race ) as a child becomes much less engaging when the character is an adult and should really have more important things to worry about .
Nonetheless , the book is interesting even in failure , and I ’m excited by the prospect of one day using it in a class on interracial friendships in American novels , alongside Huckleberry Finn ( which , of course , also has a problematic second half , probably for similar reasons ) .
At a certain point in Fortress of Solitude , I began to realize that I was not only reading an extraordinary novel ; I was reading a modernist novel , in the tradition of Virginia Woolf or , especially , James Joyce .
I make this association based on three characteristics .
The first is a decentered , experimental narrative voice .
The narrator shifts significantly between the first and final half of the novel , and all three narrative voices — first , second , and third person — are used .
Other narrative forms — liner notes , in particular — are reproduced as part of the narrative , and the narrator ’s voice and phrasing changes depending on the character being narrated .
The effect created by all of this is of a sprawling , extremely subjective world of competing consciousnesses .
The second quality that makes the novel modernist is a close attention to the moment - by - moment thoughts and words of the characters , even in apparently trivial conversations .
In one scene , Dylan ’s only pre-high school white friend ( Arthur Lomb , about whom more later ) asks him about his black friend Mingus :
“ As I was saying , I noticed you talking to Mingus Rude , he ’s an eighth grader , how ’d you get to know him ?
Not that he ’s in school much , huh .
Still , it must be advantageous to be friends with , hurrh , that sort of person . ”
Arthur Lomb ’s speech bore like a small puckered scar a characteristic hitch of intaken breath in that place where he ’d omitted the word black from the sentence but not from the thought which had given rise to the sentence .
And that hitch of breath , it seemed to Dylan , was Arthur in a nutshell , making such a show of a card unplayed that he tipped his whole hand .
The third modernist characteristic of the novel , and the one I want to talk about for the rest of this entry , is its use of reference : the world of the novel is supported by a mesh of references to contemporary music , movies , comic books , cultural trends , and historical moments ( the Son of Sam killings , e.g. ) , much in the same way that The Waste Land makes reference both to classical myths and figures and to modern ones ( pop songs , the Great War ) .
Even before I started reading Fortress of Solitude , this was the characteristic that I was most curious about , because it marks the book as a member of a literary faction that is gaining both adherents and enemies .
Long before I read this book I read a review of it by John Leonard in the New York Review of Books which contained a withering , exasperated critique of the practice of incorporating pop culture into literature .
In fairness , parts of the review are very good criticism : “ Before everything goes wrong about two thirds of the way through , Solitude has been perfectly poised between sense and stress , aura and object , the man who remembers and the boy who was there ” — that all seems right to me , including the part about everything going wrong .
Which makes it all the more amazing that Leonard works himself into such a lather by the end of the review : after complaining that , by publishing stories by Lethem , Michael Chabon , and the like , “ the slick magazines with the scratch and sniff ads for vodka and opium are willing to pay a bundle for bombast about ephemera , ” he closes with a paragraph that stops just short of telling contemporary literature to get a haircut and stay off his damn lawn :
Welcome to New Dork !
We have been airpopped and multimediated unto inanity and pastiche .
Philip K. Dick and Stan Lee get made into Hollywood movies . …
The middle finger and the Bronx cheer are required courses in cultural studies .
Boomers have made sure that their every febrile enthusiasm since Pampers will last longer than radioactive waste , on digital cable and DVD .
Gen - Xers are just as solipsistic ; anything that ever mattered to them must have been profound , even , say , Debbie Harry of the pop group Blondie talking to MTV while a sirocco blows in one of her ears and out the other and neurons die like flies . …
It ’s easy to laugh at Leonard here — ” the pop group Blondie ” makes me think of how the dad in the comic strip “ Curtis ” refers to “ ‘ rap ’ music ” — and to some extent he ’s playing for a laugh .
Nevertheless , amidst all the spittle , he is making a definite argument : that when literature neglects its own canon , its power to produce thought is lost .
“ Is it so unreasonable , ” he asks early in the review , “ to want to know more of what he thinks about Julio Cortázar and less of how he feels about Obi-Wan Kenobi ? ”
( Note the shift between “ think ” and “ feel ” — to Leonard , our reaction to pop culture is never intellectual . )
The key to this dispute , I think — or more accurately , the key to Leonard ’s misreading of Lethem ’s book — is his use of the word “ ephemera ” to describe the kind of pop culture Lethem writes about .
My take : of course it is .
You would have to be extremely wide - eyed to claim that the song “ Play That Funky Music , White Boy ” ( predictably used to torment Dylan in school ) had some sort of lasting , vital effect on the larger world , and the same goes for all but a handful of the comics that Dylan , Mingus and Arthur collect , store in plastic sleeves , and eventually discard .
But all of this is no more ephemeral — in fact , it ’s a good deal less so — than the detail of what horse won the Gold Cup on June 16 , 1904 .
Ephemera — cultural and otherwise — are the bulk of what make up ordinary life , particularly that of young people , and any modern novelist who tried to omit the ephemeral would be creating … something else .
The only way Leonard ’s epithet would carry any sting would be if Lethem lost sight of this ephemerality , like people who talk about their role - playing characters as if they were real people .
In fact , he is eminently aware of it .
One example : two girls who live near Dylan are always singing lines from whatever song is popular at that part of the novel : a device that measures the passage of time by the brief , beautiful lives of radio hits .
Leonard ’s misapprehension — that Lethem ’s invocation of pop culture means he is convinced of its lasting importance — also manifests itself in his use of the term “ New Dork ” ( bravo ! ) to describe Lethem and his contemporaries , the implication being that Lethem simply has n’t been able to find anything to divert him but comics and thus is being hindered by them .
Again , though , Lethem is aware of the difference between those who use popular culture to supplement and enrich their lives and personalities , and those who use popular culture as their personalities — who have , talk about , and think about nothing besides their pop culture interests .
( This distinction is what led me and some friends of mine in college to divide nerds into classes , as Girldetective describes here , and also what led Lore Sjöberg to create the “ Geek Hierarchy . ” )
Arthur Lomb exemplifies this in Fortress of Solitude : hearing him list , in one uninterrupted paragraph , his favorite Mel Brooks film , then his favorite Pink Panther ( “ The best Panther is probably Return “ ) , then his favorite Woody Allen , Dylan begins to understand both the all - consuming nature of Lomb ’s opinions and the uncomfortable similarities they share :
Positioning , positioning , Arthur Lomb was forever positioning himself , making his views known , aligning on some index no one would ever consult .
Here was Dylan ’s burden , his cross : the accumulated knowledge of Arthur Lomb ’s policies on every possible question .
The cross was Dylan ’s to bear , he knew , because his own brain boiled with pedantry , with too - eager trivia ready to burst loose at any moment .
Moreover , Dylan perceives that , past a certain point , nerd - dom is n’t just taste , but rather personality :
On the same shelves as his comics Arthur Lomb kept mass - market paperback editions of Al Jaffe ’s [ sic ] Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions and Dave Berg ’s The Lighter Side .
The snippy irony of the Mad Magazine cartoonists seemed perfectly matched to Arthur ’s bitter views , everything funny in a not - funny - at - all kind of way .
Sarcasm as something you practiced like karate .
Later concealing your mute fury when nobody fed you the opening lines .
This is exactly the type of reference practiced by Joyce , or Eliot or Pound : the individual reference is not important in itself , but as a way of describing a character or situation , it is irreplaceable .
Also similar is the deliberate obscurity : there is little explanation of what is being referenced , so if you ’re not familiar with 1970 ’s - era Mad Magazine you will simply have to move on to the next reference .
( I imagine the gist is clear if you have n’t read these cartoons , though I would n’t know — as a kid , I devoured old issues of Mad , and was not un- Arthur Lomb-ish . )
The point is that Lethem cannot explain who Al Jaffee is , because Dylan would not and because that ’s the way the world of nerds works : you either know about it or you do n’t .
This characterizing effect of pop interests also belies Leonard ’s opinion that pop culture — ” obvious , blatant , standardized ” — cannot , unlike high art , get at the truly individual and thoughtful .
Clearly , what is “ obvious ” to one person can be defamiliarized by another , turned into something surprising and true .
“ Tags were no different from anything else : codes in layers , ready to be peeled away or overwritten , ” writes Lethem about the graffiti that began to appear in the mid-seventies .
Leonard ’s “ Obvious , blatant , standardized ” obviously describes graffiti exactly , but it fails to account for the infinite ways we can react to the obvious , nor the unacknowledged and unconsidered nature of those reactions .
Some of those differences of perception are based in differences of race and class , which is the other reason why Leonard ’s call for Lethem to “ [ close ] his comic books for good , ” in favor of the classics , is untenable : Lethem is writing about Dylan in his social and historical context , and in that context , people read comics , not Kafka .
Furthermore , an author who wants to write about race in contemporary America really has no choice but to write about pop cultural interests , since racial identity is so bound up in them , and in the question of what it means to be a “ nerd . ”
Arthur Lomb , as Dylan ’s one white friend , in a way proves the thesis given in this New York Times Magazine article , that nerdiness is defined by extreme and self - conscious whitness ; at the same time , he also shows the limitations of that thesis , since what he exemplifies is not a true identity but rather a willingness to assume a cultural persona , which can be switched out for any other .
Thus , one can be a sports nerd , a gun nerd , etc. : the extreme of “ nerdiness ” has less to do with the specific interests ( in comic books or anything else ) than it does with using those interests in place of actual character .
We see this when ultimate nerd Arthur Lomb , the whitest kid in school , soon finds himself doing a 180 and imitating the “ sort of person ” he earlier asked Dylan about :
Arthur ’s eager mimicry produces a twee , mechanical version of Mingus ’s hunched lope .
He really is , in this sense , a toy : he ’s turning himself into a Mingus - puppet .
“ Yo , them dudes were talking about Strike , man , they said he was there tagging up , but I did n’t see him .
…
Anyway , Strike ’s okay , but I prefer Zephyr , I think he ’s really got the most original tag , yo , man , you know what I mean ? ” … Arthur Lomb , it appears , contains multitudes : he ’s managed this utter self - reformatting with the same sleazy facility with which he earlier dumped the Mets for the Yankees .
“ Toy ” is a pun : as Lethem tells us earlier , it ’s what graffiti artists write over existing tags to disrespect them , but here it also implies a childish copy , unable to move on its own .
Arthur Lomb chooses to have no personality — almost as a survival strategy — and thus is as susceptible to this minstrel show as he was to the borrowed identity of comic books : “ Arthur was a phony , and Mingus would know soon enough .
[ Dylan ] imagined Arthur saying , Yo , Mister Machine sucks , Jack Kirby can’t draw anymore , dang , but a number one ’s a number one , yo , seal it in airtight plastic and put it on the shelf , that ’s my policy , yo . ”
At the end of the novel , Arthur is a property owner in a gentrified neighborhood , causing Dylan to reflect on the difference between them :
“ It was a form of autism , a failure at social mimicry , that had kept me from the adaptations which made Arthur more Brooklyn than me , in the end . …
So it only followed that Arthur Lomb would still be here , gobbling up Smith Street ’s commercial real estate just in time to cash in on the yuppie entrepreneurs … ”
Lomb ’s phoniness is identical with opportunism : the combination of his racial and social privilege with his lack of commitment to any clear identity allows him to position himself advantageously , just as he does in the endless chess games with Dylan .
He idolizes comics and movies , and then he idolizes graffiti , but he does n’t have a true appreciation of any of these things — only of the self - definition they provide .
Which brings me , at last , to the proposal for “ everything studies . ”
By positioning myself against Leonard ’s haughty canonicism , it would seem that I ’d be in favor of Burke ’s plan , which amounts to an acceptance , by English departments , of all forms of criticism practiced on anything .
Is n’t this the natural alternative to Leonard ’s “ keep ’em all out ” approach ?
But the genius of Fortress of Solitude is that it shows the difference between the genres , the reason graffiti has to be graffiti and DJing has to be DJing .
Too many academics go from the premise that everything is a text to the premise that all texts are read in basically the same way , and I fear that Burke is one of them :
If I ’m reading academic work about Buffy the Vampire Slayer , I want to hear from people interested in the craftwork involved in how it tells stories , including assessments of its quality as a visual and cultural work .
I want to hear from people who talk about its use of symbols .
I want to hear from people who study how fan communities read and write the text of the show , and from scholars who examine how mass audiences that do n’t categorize themselves as “ fans ” reacted to the show .
I want to know how much money it made , and how it made it . …
The exact same openness goes if I ’m reading academic work about Hamlet .
All of that is fair game , all of it is interesting , all of it potentially germane .
In theory , this sounds immensely democratic , since no one seems to be able to say why Hamlet deserves literary analysis and Buffy does n’t .
But it ’s not a matter of desserts , it ’s a matter of genre , so in practice — and this is one area where I feel I ’ve had a lot of experience — it ends up being phony analysis : without the expertise required to analyze film or art or graffiti , “ studying ” these things simply amounts to attempting literary close readings of works which , because they are not literature ( I mean they are different in kind , not quality ) , do not reward them .
I saw this again and again at the Popular Culture Association Conference four years ago ; for instance , I thought I would enjoy a panel on zombie movies , because I like zombie movies .
Instead , the analysis of the panel consisted of almost no work that could be called film or cultural studies , but rather of picking the lowest - hanging insights and indifferently presenting them to the audience .
One paper identified racial tension as being a theme of Night of the Living Dead and then essentially stopped there , content with the level of analysis usually applied to Lord of the Flies in seventh grade English classes .
When a cultural studies approach was attempted , the results were dubious : the same paper saw the imagery of Night of the Living Dead as having been inspired by the shootings at Kent State ( which took place two years later ) , and saw a movie that took place before the Tonkin Gulf Incident as foretelling America ’s defeat in Vietnam .
These are sloppy mistakes , but they are also predictable , systematic ones : they are more extreme versions of the mistakes that must occur when we indulge our desire to collapse pop culture , history , and literary studies into a single point , without an interest in what differentiates them .
This is why Dylan is able to superimpose Lomb ’s “ comic nerd ” persona onto his “ black ” persona : Lomb has no interest in what it means to read comics rather than tag buildings .
To be clear , of course it sometimes makes sense to make use of pop culture and historical context to help us understand a work or period — I ’m in the process of sketching out a project on early spy literature , so of course I watched Hitchcock ’s version of The 39 Steps — and Leonard ’s desire to see popular music and movies disappear from high art and the academy is not possible , let alone desirable .
But Fortress of Solitude is a novel which contains tags , comic books , music , movies , and so on , in the service of a goal which could only be attained in the literary form .
It is not about those things for their own sake .
Similarly , as Kugelmass argues , we have to build a specialty — in this case , literary studies ; in other cases , film studies and so forth — rather than simply writing about whatever we might like to write about .
The reason to have a discipline in the first place is to understand why that discipline is important , and different from others .
Without a disciplinary center , we become simply Lombesque : “ positioning , positioning , ” always drifting from mode to mode , looking for the one that will make people like us .
“ While I do , in fact , ‘ believe , ’ it is my personal view that the largest proclamation of one ’s faith ought to be in how one lives one ’s life , ” Mr. Sanford wrote on Thursday in a letter to Glenn F. McConnell , president pro tem of the Senate and a fellow Republican .

The bill directs the Motor Vehicles Department to create the plate .
Mr. Sanford told the department to charge people just enough to reimburse the state for the cost to produce the plate , estimated at $ 4 to $ 6 , and to not allow any organization to benefit from its sales .
The state offers 200 other specialty plates , supporting organizations like colleges , sororities , Boy Scouts and the Surfrider Foundation .
The state charges up to $ 70 for those plates .
The profit is sent to the sponsor .
A supporting organization normally pays the $ 4,000 start - up cost to create a plate .
Because no organization will sponsor the “ I Believe ” plate , at least 400 people have to buy one before the state will produce it .
Representatives of the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Jewish Congress said they were considering suing the state over the plate .
Neither organization was aware of any previous state that has approved a similar plate .
A proposal for an “ I believe ” plate in Florida failed in April .

Has Reality TV Hit Rock Bottom ?
New shows highlight the freakish , the gross and the unworthy .
It may get worse .
June 19 , 2008  --
Maybe you thought reality TV hit the lowest of the low when " Fear Factor " contestants devoured cockroaches , or when gold diggers paraded their wares in hopes of marrying a millionaire , or when Tila Tequila got a second shot at " love " with 10 guys and 10 girls .
Those shows look like " Masterpiece Theater " compared to what 's coming .
Take , for instance , " Hurl , " an eating - and - regurgitating competition in which contestants gorge themselves on everything from chicken pot pies to peanut butter sandwiches , then get strapped into spinning contraptions -- whoever vomits last wins .
Also in store for this summer : " Wipeout , " in which contestants try to surmount obstacles that include giant , mud-covered " dirty balls " only to fall flat on their faces , and " Greatest American Dog , " in which canines that could care less about TV are forced to compete with each other .
Then there 's Nicole Richie .
Famous solely for her friendship with Paris Hilton and their reality series " The Simple Life , " Richie is reportedly shopping a show that would scour the nation for the next … Nicole Richie .
According to EW.com , the show would take seven girls and test their ability to turn from small - town nobody into star , no talent required .
The winner would be granted -- what else ? -- her own reality show .
Sound like reality TV 's running out of ideas ?
John de Mol seems to think so .
De Mol , co-founder of the international media giant Endemol ( responsible for hits such as " Deal or No Deal , " " Big Brother " and " Fear Factor " ) , has started a Web site , TalpaCreative.com , to solicit show concepts from fans .
Is this it ?
Has the genre been tapped ?
Is the end to reality TV 's reign of terror near ?
No .
If you think we 've hit rock bottom , you ai n't seen nothing yet .
" When Lindsay Lohan 's mom gets a reality show , something 's terribly wrong , " David Bianculli , TV critic for NPR's " Fresh Air " and tvworthwatching .com , said about Dina Lohan 's E! reality show .
" This is not bottom of the barrel , this is excavating beneath the barrel .
I do n't think we 're done yet .
The question is , how deep can we go as we move towards the center of the earth ? "
" If you lose on ' The Bachelor , ' you become the bachelorette , " he continued .
" It 's like a hydra — you cut off one head and two more take its place . "
There are a couple of reasons reality series wo n't soon stop spawning .
As depraved and trite as some shows may seem , they 're guaranteed to get someone 's attention .
" America 's Got Talent " may be a sloppy Joe to " American Idol " and a local carnival freak show , but it was TV 's top-rated series last summer , averaging 11.5 million viewers , and is poised to draw as big an audience this season .
Plus , reality series are , as a rule , cheaper for networks to produce than scripted shows ( no A - list talent or writers to pay ) , and they 're showing they can continue to reap revenue in syndication .
" They 've started to show a little bit of afterlife .
Cable shows are running reality marathons , so reality 's seeming more repeatable than it used to be , " said James Hibberd of The Hollywood Reporter .
" I do n't see reality going out of favor anytime soon , especially as ratings for the broadcast networks are eroding and the cost of producing a scripted show is going up .
There 's no way you can't do the less expensive , unscripted shows . "
Back in 1992 , when Jonathan Murray pitched a show about seven strangers picked to live in a house , the idea was revolutionary .
Today , were it not for its 20 - season history , he 's not sure " The Real World " would survive alongside the likes of " Flavor of Love " and " The Moment of Truth . "
" ' The Real World 's ' almost looking pure compared to a lot of what 's on , " he said .
" It 's difficult because everyone 's trying to be louder than the next guy to get attention .
There 's this feeling that the concept has to be really loud to break through the clutter .
You 're trying to stand out .
You want something that can be put into a great 30 - second promo . "
" There are still standards out there , " he added .
" But as these cable networks try to differentiate themselves from others , the standards will bend too . "
" Hurl ! " ( premiering July 15 on the basic cable network G4 ) is an example of that .
Ten years ago , it would have been out of the question to base a TV show around vomit .
Today , a little artful editing allows it to star in its own reality series .
" Vomit on - screen is covered by animated buckets with a one - to five - bucket rating system , " said Dale Roy Robinson , who developed and executive produces " Hurl ! " with Tom Crehan .
" Actually , the show has very little to do with vomit , and everything to do with competition and camaraderie .
It 's like a college dare all grown up into its own TV show .
It 's nothing different from what fraternity boys do . "
Crehan added , " It 's more wholesome and uplifting than any dating show you 'd care to make . "
Upchuck uplifting ?
Pardon the pun , but the concept 's a little hard to keep down .
Bianculli is n't sure viewers will continue to gravitate to extreme , outlandish competition shows like " Hurl ! " despite the " Wow , I 've never seen that on TV before ! " factor .
" If 15 things come down the pike , they 're going to close their eyes to all 15 of them , unless one leaps out , " he said .
" It 's too much and too little at the same time . "
The only way to get rid of reality TV may be a scandal the likes of which the genre has never seen .
Darva Conger 's annulling her marriage to Rick Rockwell days after marrying him on " Who Wants to Marry a Multi- Millionaire ? " did n't do it ; nor did evidence that multiple scenes from " The Hills " have been staged and re-shot .
It has to be bigger .
" It 's hard to root for death , " Bianculli said , " but there has to be something short of that . "

Abstract
Skip graphs are a novel distributed data structure , based on skip lists , that provide the full functionality of a balanced tree in a distributed system where resources are stored in separate nodes that may fail at any time .
They are designed for use in searching peer - to - peer systems , and by providing the ability to perform queries based on key ordering , they improve on existing search tools that provide only hash table functionality .
Unlike skip lists or other tree data structures , skip graphs are highly resilient , tolerating a large fraction of failed nodes without losing connectivity .
In addition , constructing , inserting new nodes into , searching a skip graph , and detecting and repairing errors in the data structure introduced by node failures can be done using simple and straightforward algorithms .

Kalyn Free , a superdelegate and at large member of the DNC , has endorsed Barack Obama today .
Free is the founder and President of INDN ’s List , an organization dedicated to training and recruiting Native American political candidates .
“ Barack Obama is a once - in - a - generation kind of leader and the best hope the American people have to rebuild the erosion our collective foundation has endured the last eight years , ” Free said .
Free mentioned Obama ’s commitment to American Indian issues , “ As a member of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma , I am proud of what it means to be an American Indian .
I am proud Barack Obama is committed to our unique issues and willing to tackle our toughest problems , from historical inequities and injustices to contemporary issues , like protection of our right to tribal self - determination , access to health care for our elders , and education for our children . ”

She said Obama offered American Indians a new kind of politics , “ Senator Obama is committed to bringing American Indians into the national discussion and into the political process as voters , organizers , and leaders .
He will start a two - way dialogue with Tribes by coming to Indian Country to seek solutions for our unique issues and by bringing Indians into his administration .
For centuries the First Americans have had politicians talk to them , not with them .
That kind of politics - as - usual leadership has n’t worked for Indian Country , and it is n’t working for America .
Senator Obama will forge a new era for the First Americans by looking for answers in Indian Country , not from Washington lobbyists . ”
As these endorsements keep coming in , we are seeing an entire multicultural landscape of support for Obama .
He has a basic message that cuts across whatever might divide us .
As an American it is great to see this diverse coalition come together to try and build a better , stronger nation .
By the numbers , she is Obama ’s 258th superdelegate , and he is now 276 delegates short of the nomination .

' A Fatal Shopping Trip ' US Military Detains German Citizen in Afghanistan
For the past three months , the United States military has detained a German citizen in Afghanistan on suspicion of terrorism .
German security experts are convinced that the man , who has a history of psychological problems , is innocent .
For those hoping that Hillary would graciously accept the reality that she is n't going to win the nomination ... don't .
During a conference call this morning , the Clinton campaign said that they will continue to fight for the nomination because , well , because .
The ( long ) hour boiled down to , she has the best chance to beat McCain , she wins all the really important states , and darn it , white people really like her .
There were two rather comical moments to break up the monotony of listening to talking points being regurgitated for the umpteenth time .
The first was when Howard Wolfson said , when talking about Florida and Michigan :
This is a country of 50 states .
Coming from the campaign that has spent the last three months dismissing as irrelevant any state that Clinton lost , this was laughable .
But when Wolfson was asked about overnight fundraising numbers and said that he " had n't had a chance to look , " well , besides being laughable , I think it 's safe to say that that was a boldfaced lie .
So it 's on to West Virginia .
I decided I wanted to get better at JavaScript .
I 've been programming in it for a while but I never really developed any good skills in it .
I was just mostly copy pasting examples together and adjusting code to get it working .
I recently found a bunch of really good programming video lectures on JavaScript and decided to watch them .
These lectures are given by Douglas Crockford who is a senior JavaScript Architect at Yahoo .
He is well known for his work in introducing JavaScript Object Notation ( JSON ) .
First four lectures are on the basics of language :
Sometimes Yahoo Video gives this error : Sorry !
This video is no longer available on Yahoo Video .
In this case refresh your browser a couple of times !
The next three lectures are on Advanced JavaScript :
Then there are 6 more lectures on JavaScript which should probably be viewed only after you have viewed the ones just mentioned .
Viewing the YUI Theater I just found another JavaScript lecture which was published just recently :
My approach to watching video lectures
I have been watching various video lectures for almost 4 years now .
Mostly mathematics , physics and theory of computer science .
My approach to getting most of the lectures is the following .
When I watch the video lectures I take notes just as if I were in class .
Even better , when I do not understand a part of the lecture I can always rewind it back and see that fragment again .
I can also pause the lecture , think for a while and then continue .
Here is a photo of notes I too while watching MIT 's 803 – Vibrations and Waves .
I am serious about physics and maths video lectures , as you can see in the image , all the main results are boxed in red , the results are fully derived ( even if the professor does not do it on blackboard ) .
Btw , one lecture perfectly fits on both sides of an A4 sheet .
Here is a close - up of Lecture 13 : Electromagnetic Waves - Plane Wave Solutions to Maxwell 's Equations - Polarization - Malus ' Law .
This approach probably does not work with programming languages and computer tools .
Because mathematics and physics is mostly done on paper , watching these video lectures and taking notes is actually doing them .
The process of taking notes develops the skills because you work with the new concepts , operators , theorems , and other math terms .
Not so in programming languages .
You can read a book on a new programming language and you wo n't even be able to write the hello world program because you have only got familiar with the subject and have not developed the skills .
I have experienced this myself .
Here is my approach how I am going to learn JavaScript from these lectures .
I might adjust this approach at any moment if I find it not working , I will update this post appropriately then .
I will definitely watch all 11 video lectures .
I will start with the first four basic lectures , watch them one by one , take notes as with physics video lectures and experiment as I go .
I will be taking notes lightly to have my mind really think the information I am getting over .
But no red boxes around constructs as with physics .
That 's the experimentation part to learning .
I am going to try the new constructs as soon as I see them so they stuck in my mind better .
Update : I dropped the idea of taking any notes on paper , because I am blogging the key points from lectures here .
Also to make this article interesting , I will annotate each lecture if something really interesting catches my eye .
As I mentioned , I have programmed JS before so I am not sure how much I will learn from the first four basic lectures .
In my previous blog post I used Windows Script Host to create a program in VBScript .
The other language the same scripting host runs is JScript which conforms to the same standard as JavaScript .
So I should be safe doing JavaScript experimentation in JScript .
Points that caught my attention in JavaScript Video Lecture Part I :
( 00:45 ) World 's most misunderstood programming language - has " Java " in its name and " Script " .
It has nothing to do with Java programming language and it's a real programming language not some tiny scripting language
( 02:38 ) There are generally no books available to learn JS from - all are bad and full of nasty examples
( 02:56 ) The only book recommended is JavaScript : The Definitive Guide , 5th Edition - it 's the least bad book
( 03:37 ) JavaScript is a functional language
( 08:12 ) Microsoft reverse engineered original implementation of JavaScript and called it JScript to avoid trademark issues
( 09:49 ) During standardization , the original bugs were left as is without fixing to prevent already written programs from breaking ( Douglas slips and says " Sun " but he actually means " Microsoft " )
( 12:16 ) One of the key ideas of the language is prototypal inheritance where objects inherit from objects and there are no classes
( 12:45 ) One other key idea is that functions are first - class objects
( 13:36 ) There are no integers in the language , everything is represented as 64 - bit floating point numbers
( 14:30 ) NaN ( Not a Number ) is not equal to antyhing , including NaN .
Which means NaN == NaN is false
( 15:22 ) Type of NaN is Number
( 15:52 ) + prefix operator does the same thing as Number function
( 16:08 ) Generally always specify radix argument in parseInt function because if the first character is ' 0 ' and there is no radix argument provided , it will assume that ' 0 ' to be an octal constant
( 17:15 ) Each character takes 16 - bits of memory
( 17:56 ) There is no separate character type in JS , characters are represented as strings with a length of 1
( 19:55 ) undefined is the default value for uninitialized variables and parameters
( 20:38 ) Falsy values are : false , null , undefined , " " , 0 , NaN .
All other values ( including all objects are truthy ) .
Everything else in the language are objects
( 22:15 ) Object members can be accessed with dot notation Object. member or subscript notation Object [ " member " ]
( 22:59 ) The language is loosely typed but not " untyped "
( 25:19 ) Reserved words are overused , they can't be used in dot notation as method names
( 27:25 ) Operators == and != can do type coercion , so it 's better to use === and !=== which do no coercion
( 28:24 ) Operator && is also called the ' guard operator ' , Operator || is also called the ' default operator '
( 30:16 ) The bitwise operators convert the operand to a 32 - bit signed integer , perform the operation and then turn the result back into 64 - bit floating point .
Do n't use bitwise operators in cases like multiplying by 4 using << 2 .
It will not .
After having watched the first lecture I decided that there was no point in taking notes on paper because I am blogging the key points here and trying various examples I can come up with with JScript , taking notes just wastes time .
Points that caught my attention in JavaScript Video Lecture Part II :
( 00:20 ) Break statements can have labels
( 00:41 ) Iterating over all the members of an object with for ( var name in object ) { } syntax , will also iterate over inherited members
( 06:10 ) There is only global and function scope in JavaScript , there is no block scope
( 07:40 ) If there is no expression in a return statement , the value returned is undefined .
Except for constructors , whose default return value is this
( 08:29 ) An object is an unordered collection of name / value pairs
( 21:10 ) All objects are linked directly or indirectly to Object .
prototype
( 23:42 ) Array indexes are converted to strings and used as names for retrieving values
Points that caught my attention in JavaScript Video Lecture Part III :
( 00:29 ) Functions inherit from Object and can store name / value pairs
( 02:00 ) The function statement is just a short - hand for a var statement with a function value
( 02:35 ) Functions can be defined inside of other functions
( 03:08 ) JavaScript has closures
( 07:29 ) There are four ways to call a function : function form , method form , constructor form and apply form
( 10:00 ) this is an extra parameter .
Its value depends on the calling form
( 10:30 ) When a function is invoked , in addition to its parameters , it also gets a special parameter called arguments
( 11:53 ) Built - in types can be augmented through ( Object|Array|Function|Number|String|Boolean ) .
prototype
( 14:09 ) The typeof prefix operator returns ' object ' for Array and null types
( 15:23 ) eval ( ) is the most misused feature of the language
( 21:57 ) In web browsers , the global objects is the window object
( 22:51 ) Use of the global namespace must be minimized
( 23:11 ) Any variable which is not properly declared is assumed to be global by default
( 23:45 ) JSLint is a tool which helps identify weaknesses
( 24:21 ) Every object is a separate namespace , use an object to organize your variables and functions
( 27:15 ) Function scope can create an encapsulation
Points that caught my attention in JavaScript Video Lecture Part IV :
( 03:30 ) The language definition is neutral on threads
( 11:20 ) When the compiler sees an error , it attempts to replace a nearby linefeed with a semicolon and try again
( 12:51 ) Do not use extra commas in array literals .
Netscape will tell you that length of [ 1,2,3 , ] is 3 while IE will tell it's 4
( 18:48 ) Key ideas in JavaScript - Load and go delivery , loose typing , objects as general containers , prototypal inheritance , lambda , linkage through global variables
These four lectures gave me much better theoretical understanding of JavaScript but just a little better practical skills .
I should do a project entirely in JavaScript to become more skillful .
I can't wait to see the Advanced JavaScript lectures .
At the end of the 4th lecture Douglas said that they will continue with theory of DOM which I will follow and only then continue with Advanced JS .
Points that caught my attention in The Theory of the DOM Part I :
( 03:31 ) A scripted web browser , Netscape Navigator 2 , was first introduced in 1995
Best thing happened to have standards work was Mozilla abandoning the Netscape layer model in favor of the W3C model
( 10:03 ) List of browsers Yahoo ! wants their JavaScript library to run on are FireFox 1.5 , FireFox 2.0 , Safari 2 , Internet Explorer 6 , IE 7 , Opera 9
( 12:11 ) The < script > tag first appeared in Netscape Navigator 2
( 13:05 ) <!-- --> comment around script was a Netscape 2 hack for Mosaic and Navigator 1.0
( 14:51 ) W3C deprecated language =javascript attribute in script tags , do n't put it there anymore
( 18:48 ) If you call document .
write before onload it inserts data into the document , if you call it after , it replaces the document with the new stuff
( 20:25 ) name= is used to identify values in form data and to identify a window or frame
( 20:45 ) id= is used to uniquely identify an element so that you could get access to it
( 20:59 ) Microsoft introduced document .all as a super - collection of all elements with name or id
( 21:39 ) W3C instead said use document.getElementById( id ) and document.getElementsByName( name )
( 23:41 ) Document tree structure is different for IE than for other browsers because Microsoft decided to depart from W3C standard and not to include whitespaces as text nodes in the tree
( 25:02 ) document . body gets you to body node of the tree , document .
documentElement gets you to the html root tag of the tree
After watching this lecture I decided to add time where each point that caught my attention happened so that if anyone is interested in any of the points he / she could just fast forward to that place in the video .
Eventually I will go through the videos up to this one once more and add timestamps .
Points that caught my attention in The Theory of the DOM Part II :
( 04:32 ) The guy designing CSS chose a not so appealing names to a programmer for CSS style names .
JavaScript guys converted those to camel case in JavaScript which is probably the least compatible with CSS style names
( 08:31 ) Replacing a child is done with " java oriented , model based , nothing in common with reality sort of api " through old.parentNode.replaceChild( new , old ) where you specify old twice
( 09:03 ) It is important to remove any event handlers from the object before you delete it
( 10:10 ) Microsoft and their Internet Explorer were the first to realize that it is convenient to provide access to HTML parser and provided innerHTML property which can be assigned a string containing HTML directly
( 10:50 ) There is no standard describing innerHTML property
( 12:12 ) The browser has an event - driven , single - threaded , asynchronous programming model
( 12:55 ) There are three ways to adding event handlers - classic mode ( node [ " on " + type ] = func ) , Microsoft mode ( node.attachEvent ( " on " + type , func ) ) and W3C mode ( node.addEventListener ( type , func , bool ) )
( 14:50 ) Microsoft does not send an event parameter , they use the global event object instead .
( 15:58 ) There are two ways how events are handled - trickling and bubbling
( 17:23 ) The extra bool parameter in W3C mode of adding event handlers node.
addEventListener( type , func , bool ) tells whether the events are processed bottom up ( bubbling ) or top down ( trickling )
Points that caught my attention in The Theory of the DOM Part III :
( 01:26 ) Hugest memory leaks happen in IE 6
( 01:33 ) Because of that you must explicitly remove event handlers from nodes before deleting or replacing them
( 06:49 ) self , parent and top are aliases of window object
( 08:10 ) A script can access another window if and only if document .
domain === otherwindow.document.domain
( 10:10 ) There are three ways to get cross browser compatibility - browser detection , feature detection , platform libraries
( 11:20 ) Internet Explorer 1.0 identified itself as " Internet Explorer " but many sites refused to serve the contents complaining that it was not " Mozilla " so in version 1.5 IE identifies itself as " Mozilla "
( 12:16 ) Browser detection cross compatibility is the least recommended way
( 15:37 ) Platform library cross compatibility is the most recommended way
( 15:35 ) Platform library cross compatibility is the most recommended way
( 18:48 ) No browser completely implements the standards and much of the DOM is not in any standards .
If there was a 100 % standards compliant browser , it would not work !
( 19:19 ) When programming DOM : 1 ) do what works ; 2 ) do what 's common ; 3 ) do what 's standard
Okay , I watched the whole Theory of DOM course and have gained good theoretical knowledge but basically no practical skills .
To get better with the JavaScript and DOM will require me to do some interesting practical projects with both of these guys .
Now I am off to watch Advanced JavaScript lectures and then the remaining .
Points that caught my attention in Advanced JavaScript Part I :
( 01:20 ) In prototypal inheritance objects inherit directly from objects , there are no classes
( 01:30 ) An objects contains a " secret link " to another object .
Mozilla calls it __proto__
( 03:36 ) If looking for a member fails , the last object searched is Object .
prototype
( 07:50 ) When functions are designed to be used with new , they are called constructors
( 08:13 ) new Constructor ( ) returns a new object with a link to Constructor .
prototype
( 09:40 ) Always have your constructors named with a capital letter so you at least develop reflex for putting a new in front of it
( 09:48 ) Forgetting the new still makes code work but it does not construct a new object .
This is considered one of the language design errors
( 10:00 ) When a new function object is created , it is always given a prototype member
( 10:49 ) " Differential inheritance " is a special form of inheritance where you specify just the changes from one generation of objects to the next
( 17:24 ) JavaScript does n't have an operator which makes a new object using an existing object as its prototype , so we have to write our own function
( 18:50 ) A " public method " is a function that uses this to access its object
( 21:55 ) Functions can be used to create module containers
( 25:01 ) " Privileged methods " are functions that have access to " secret " information and they are constructed through closures
( 28:05 ) " Parasitic inheritance " is a way of creating an object of an augmented version an existing object .
Points that caught my attention in Advanced JavaScript Part II :
( 06:30 ) Pseudoclassical patterns are less effective than prototypal patterns or parasitic patterns
( 09:06 ) Inner functions do not have access to this
( 09:32 ) In JavaScript 1.0 there were no arrays
( 10:31 ) When arrays got added , arguments object was forgot to be converted to Array object and it continues to be an array like object
( 15:47 ) There are debuggers for IE - Microsoft Script Debugger , which is bad and two debuggers built in Visual Studio and Office 2003 .
Mozilla has Venkman and Firebug .
Safari has Drosera
( 17:30 ) funny instruction on how to get debugger working with Office 2003 :D
( 24:29 ) All implementations of JavaScript have non-standard debugger statement which cause a breakpoint if there is a dubgger present
Points that caught my attention in Advanced JavaScript Part III :
( 04:20 ) Array join ( ) method is much faster for concatenating large set of strings than using operator +
( 07:03 ) Just have the server gzip the JavaScript source file to minimize the load times , avoid tools which can introduce bugs such as minificators and obfuscators
( 07:19 ) JSON
The advanced JavaScript lectures provided lots of idioms and patterns used in the language .
I did not do much experimentation and have really grasped just the concepts and overall structure of these advanced concepts .
Now I am going to watch " Advancing JavaScript with Libraries " by John Resig , creator of the jQuery JavaScript library and author of Pro JavaScript Techniques .
He 's a Mozilla technologist focused on the relationship between Mozilla and the world of JavaScript libraries .
Interesting points from Advancing JavaScript with Libraries Part I :
( 08:20 ) In IE7 basically the only change to JavaScript was to XmlHTTPRequest object
( 25:14 ) There are two standards for querying the DOM document - XPath and CSS 3 selectors
( 26:13 ) IE does n't have very good CSS selector support , because of that users have been using the very minimum of CSS selectors which almost equates CSS 1
( 27:30 ) jQuery allows selecting elements from the DOM by using CSS 3 selectors which is done in one line of jQuery code instead of 20 - 25 lines of just JavaScript DOM code
Interesting points from Advancing JavaScript with Libraries Part II :
( 05:15 ) Users are expecting the DOM selectors to behave more like CSS , that is like when a new CSS selector is added , it propagates to all the elements affected .
The users expect the same to happen when a chunk of HTML is added to the DOM , that the handlers get added to them without re-running any code
( 12:30 ) Object Relational Mappings
( 14:50 ) Libraries create new patterns on top of existing APIs
There were not that many points that got me interested because it was pretty obvious stuff .
It was just interesting to see that the DOM is not perfect and there are many bugs which one or the other browser fails , why they fail and how to solve these DOM related problems .
Also typical programming meta- problems were discussed such as JavaScript trying to get elements before browser has loaded the DOM , how the white spaces are treated and what methods to use for navigating the DOM .
Later the lecture went on how to query the DOM tree using jQuery and mix of XPath and CSS 3 .
Then it is discussed how injecting HTML in an existing document is done , what 's tricky about it and what problems can arise .
Finally the lecture continues with FUEL and object relational mappings .
The other lecture I watched was " Maintainable JavaScript " by Nicholas Zakas .
He is an engineer on the team that brings you My Yahoo ! , one of the most popular personalized portals on the web .
He is also the author of two books on frontend engineering , including Professional JavaScript for Web Developers , one of the best tomes of its kind .
Interesting points from Maintainable JavaScript :
( 01:15 ) It is estimated that as much as 80 % of time is spent maintaining existing code
( 04:30 ) Maintainable code is understandable , intuitive , adaptive , extendable and debuggable
( 16:20 ) There are three layers on the client side - JavaScript for behavior , CSS for presentation and HTML for structure
( 23:42 ) Programming practices
( 26:30 ) Namespace your objects
( 32:10 ) Avoid null comparison , use instanceof or typeof operators
( 37:15 ) Write code in separate JavaScript files and use a build process to combine them
( 40:47 ) Summary of writing maintainable code - code conventions , loose coupling , programming practices and build process
There are not that many interesting points anymore because most of the stuff has been covered in the previous lectures .
Apart from that these lecture did not teach me much new because this stuff was pretty obvious .
The only point to watch this lecture is to refresh all these obvious suggestions - agree on indentation and naming conventions in your team , comment difficult algorithms and large sections of code , do n't write obvious comments , comment hacks , loose coupling , careful use of complex code and design patterns , etc .
Starting Mai 25th 2018 the EU GDPR comes into effect
The EU is implementing new data privacy rules , known as General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) .
While privacy and data protection are a good thing , the rules and regulations laid out by EU beaurocrats are for many people very hard or close to impossible to fully comply with .
Due to the risk of enourmous fines ( 20 million Euro or up to 4 % of yearly revenue ) some people have decided it 's not worth it and shut down their sites , apps and bussineses .
Dealing with vague rules and risking financial ruin sometimes just is n't worth it , especially if you did n't make any money worth mentioning doing it in the first place .

Keith tried to take a picture on the Red Line in LA , and was told that he was breaking the " 9/11 Law " by a metro worker who swore at him and threatened him with arrest when he asked what the " 9/11 Law " was .
Him : Hey !
It 's against the 9 - 11 Law to take pictures down here man !
Me : You mean the Patriot Act ?
Him :
No pictures .
Me : Could you explain ?
What law do you mean ?
Him :
You are lawyer ?
Me : No .
Him :
No pictures .
You could be a terrorist .
Very strict !
Me : How about I take a picture of you ?
Him : F **k you …( I could n't believe it either )
He then proceeded to huddle in the corner and speak into his radio .
Next thing I knew , a booming female voice very loudly announced over the loudspeaker " Attention to the gentleman in the plaid shirt :
You are not allowed to take photographs in the Subway .
You will be arrested if you continue to take photos and harrass the metro worker . "
I was incensed / surprised / embarrassed / horrified / bewildered .
People started staring .
Then the voice continued : " The gentleman in the plaid shirt :
You must approach the callbox near the escalators and speak to the sheriff . "
I did n't budge .
So she said it again , this time louder …
" Okay " I thought , I 'll play along … I went up to the callbox and pushed the button .
A new voice this time , this one male , boomed out and said , " Why are you taking photographs sir ? "
Me : " What law am I breaking ? "
Voice : " You ca n't take pictures sir , we do n't know why you are taking pictures . "
How does a government lead its people to war ?
How does it communicate to its citizens “ “ and to the wider world “ “ the reasons and rationale for initiating military conflict ?
What rhetorical devices and techniques are employed ?
And how is a nation brought to support the profound decision to wage war against another nation ?
These are the questions that LEADING TO WAR seeks to explore .
This 72 - minute film shows the evolution of the United States government ’s case for military action against Saddam Hussein ’s regime , leading to the Iraq War which began in 2003 .
LEADING TO WAR is comprised entirely of archival news footage “ “ without commentary , without voiceover “ “ presented chronologically from President Bush ’s State of the Union address in January , 2002 ( the “ axis of evil ”  speech ) , and continuing up to the announcement of formal U.S. military action in Iraq on March 19 , 2003 .
Covering these 14 months , the film presents selected interviews , speeches , and press conferences given by President Bush and his administration , including Vice President Dick Cheney , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , Secretary of State Colin Powell , National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice , Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz , as well as by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and others .
This compressed , chronological view offers a unique opportunity to examine the media record from a historical perspective , allowing the material to speak for itself .
Footage was licensed from major news sources , including ABC , AP , BBC , CNN , ITN , and NBC .
LEADING TO WAR is also intended as a historical record for future generations , who will not have had firsthand experience of the precise , incremental steps taken by the government in presenting its case for war .

Polygamists Avoiding Inbreeding Problems ?
The FLDS sect appears to be free from the major signs of inbreeding -- but why ?
April 22 , 2008  --
To geneticists , the polygamous Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) community , based in West Texas , might look a bit like an eddy in the river of gene flow .
Within this sect , for generations , a small number of families have married and remarried , their genes becoming subtly more similar with each passing decade .
Now , state officials have begun gathering DNA samples from the more than 400 children taken into state custody , primarily to help tease out the complex family trees within the group and determine whether sexual abuse has taken place .
But through these tests , officials may also get a glimpse of exactly how genetically similar the individuals that make up the group have become — and why the members of this sect appear to have largely sidestepped the archetypical deformities that come part and parcel with close inbreeding .
Martha Bradley is a sociologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City and author of the book " Kidnapped From That Land , " which documents the government 's 1953 raid on a polygamous fundamentalist community in Short Creek , Ariz .
She is also an expert on the FLDS , having studied the group in the early 1990s , and she believes it is likely that some degree of inbreeding has already occurred within the sect .
" I would n't be surprised if there were [ inbreeding ] , " Bradley says .
" It 's such a small pool of members , and it has been since the ' 20s . "
Yet , in a community roster that contains hundreds of names — but remarkably few different surnames — some wonder why the more obvious physical defects associated with inbreeding , such as cleft palate and encephalopathy , have not yet manifested themselves in the appearance of the sect members .
The answer — give it many more generations .
So says Jonathan Turner , a professor of sociology at the University of California , Riverside .
" They look fine , " says Turner , along with his wife Alexandra Maryanski , a co-author of " Face to Face : Toward a Sociological Theory of Interpersonal Behavior . "
" You do have a relatively small breeding population , but it has not been that long , " he says .
" You had a fairly diverse pool to start with , so only if that went on for a long time within this same population would you see real effects .
" Now , if you went down several generations to where people lost track of who was marrying whom , you might start to see the same kinds of problems you see with [ marriage between ] first cousins . "
Incest Taboo Keeps Inbreeding in Check
Another feature of the sect that has likely helped members avoid the problems associated with inbreeding is the incest taboo — no marriage or sexual relations between fathers and daughters or brothers and sisters , for example .
Bradley says this prohibition is observed within FLDS — though she adds that the group does not keep an official database to explicitly prevent unions between members who were related at some level .
Turner is not surprised that such a prohibition was in place , considering the religious nature of the sect .
But he says other factors could also be at play which would encourage the occasional introduction of new genes into the rarified pool .
Movement of members between communities within the sect could " reshuffle the deck " when it comes to genes , further reducing the likelihood of some of the more severe effects of inbreeding .
This , combined with observance of the incest taboo , could offer enough diversity to sidestep major problems .
" A lot of people may share one - eighth or one - sixteenth of their genes , which probably does n't create big problems , " Turner says .
" When you share 25 to 50 percent of your genes , that 's when you start to get abnormalities . "
Inbreeding May Still Leave a Mark
But just because the more overt evidence of inbreeding within the group has not yet surfaced , it does not necessarily mean that the group is untouched by the problem .
" There were frequent cases when first cousins married each other , " Bradley says .
" When you think of the complexity of the family situation , almost everyone is related to everyone else in the society at some level . "
In his past research , Mark Leone , a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland , showed that more subtle health effects , including nearsightedness and mental problems , could be seen in some isolated groups in which inbreeding was known to have occurred .
And Bradley notes that a further narrowing of genetic diversity within the group may accompany another practice that has been seen within FLDS — a skewing of the male to female ratio .
" When I did my work in the early ' 90s , it was pretty close to 50 - 50 , " she says .
" But increasingly in the last five years , these groups have been sending young boys out of the community .
They 're essentially getting rid of competition . "
When dining in China , never force yourself to clear your plate out of politeness -- it would be very bad manners for your host not to keep refilling it .

Of all the things gearheads making the 2,600 - mile Great American Run through the West will worry about – avoiding the cops , keeping the car intact , finding a bathroom before their bladders burst – the size of their carbon footprint is at the bottom of the list .
What a footprint it is .
The 200 or so cars competing in the second annual race – an update of the famed Cannonball Run – will spew about as much CO2 in seven days as the average person generates in 16 years .
Mention that to the drivers and they 'll probably ask , " Yeah ?
And ? "
They know they 'll take some heat from environmentalists , and they 're unapologetic .
" How much more do they want to strangle the human race , " asks race founder Tim " Maverick " Porter .
" Why can't car enthusiasts have a little fun ? "
The Great American Run descended from the Cannonball Run , the celebration of unfettered speed moto - journalist Brock Yatesfounded in 1971 .
The only point was crossing the country as quickly as possible .
It was blatantly illegal and wildly popular – it's spawned two movies and several imitators - until the 55 mph speed limit and a lot of heat from the cops shut it down in 1979 .
( By the way , the current record for crossing the country stands at 31 hours and 4 minutes , set by Alex Roy and Dave Maher during a flat - out run that Wired wrote about . )
Porter , who 's always had a thing for fast cars and open roads , brought it back to life seven years ago with an annual run through Europe .
It came to the states last year and attracted 200 cars for a cross-country dash to Los Angeles .
The rules are a little more strict than they were when legendary racing driver Dan Gurney quipped , " At no point did we exceed 175 mph " after winning the event in 1972 .
These days , entrants must average 61 mph .
" It 's still tough , but it 's not flat - out , " Porter says .
" It 's not socially acceptable to run flat - out anymore . "
That is n't to say the drivers do n't occasionally hit triple - digit velocities .
" We do n't break the rules , " Porter says .
" We just bend them a little . "
Still , Porter claims no one 's ever been injured during one of his rallies and there 's been only a few minor accidents .
This year 's event , which starts Sept. 7 , is a 2,600 - mile loop through the West beginning and ending in Los Angeles .
The route is top secret – " If it 's published on a blog somewhere , every cop in the world will stake out the route " – but includes a stop at the Bonneville Salt Flats .
Expect a wild assortment of cars – last year 's fleet included a Bugatti Veyron , several Ferraris and Porsches , a lot of American muscle cars and even a GMC crew - cab pickup .
We were curious to know how big a carbon footprint the cars left .
We picked 10 at random and used an online C02 calculator to determine their emissions over 3,000 miles .
Multiply that by 20 and you get 648,000 pounds of CO2 for the fleet .
It 's unscientific , sure , but it gives you a ballpark idea .
The Union of Concerned Scientists says the average person generates 40,000 pounds of C02 a year .
Registration is open , but you 'd better have a healthy bank account – the entry fee is $ 20,000 .
Gasoline and carbon offsets not included .

Ask most people where the best beer in the world comes from , and they 'll probably say Germany or England .
More worldly folks might mention Belgium .
But ask a beer aficionado these days , and odds are you 'll get an answer that might surprise you – the good old U.S.A .
Just as wines from Napa Valley , Sonoma County and Oregon are giving bordeaux , burgundy and barolo a run for their money , breweries from California to New York are proving they can make some of the best suds in the world .
And they 're not just copies of the old European originals .
While American craft brewers have proven themselves no slouches at styles such as pilsners , pale ales and stouts , they 've also created some of their own , often bold styles .
" U.S. craft beer is probably the most diverse and interesting brewing scene in the world , " beer aficionado Cass Enright said at a recent dinner in Toronto at the Academy of Spherical Arts to celebrate the Ontario launch of Southern Tier Brewing 's India Pale Ale .
Over the past few decades , the U.S. beer scene has exploded .
In 1978 , there were just 42 breweries across the U.S. In 2007 , there were 1,449 .
" You can find just about anything being made .
They 've taken the best of every kind of style and put their own twist on it , '' says Enright , founder of bartowel.com , a site for local beer connoisseurs .
At Bar Volo the next night , Southern Tier founder Phin De Mink and his brewer , Paul Cain , were mobbed by local beer fans .
" We were shocked , " says De Mink , whose five - year - old brewery is about an hour 's drive south of Buffalo .
" When we started shipping our beer up here , it was just for small private orders .
We did n't really think that many people even knew what Southern Tier was . "
At both Toronto events , De Mink was peppered with questions about when more products – including the highly respected Choklat imperial stout – will be available north of the border .
( Answer : Choklat will be sold through private import agent Roland and Russell , rolandandrussell.com , in November . )
It 's not just beer enthusiasts who are falling in love with American brews .
Toronto - area restaurants and bars are stocking an increasing number of beers from south of the 49th parallel .
At Volo , owner Ralph Morana has 29 .
Beerbistro , which recently increased its cellar space , offers about 50 American beers .
Among the U.S. beers available at Beerbistro are the so - called double IPAs or imperial India pale ales .
They 're a bolder , hoppier American take on a classic English beer designed to withstand the long boat voyages to the subcontinent .
Dogfish Head , whose 60 - Minute IPA is coming to the LCBO later this summer , has two hoppier versions called 90 - Minute and 120 - Minute .
Both are selling well at Beerbistro .
But the super - hoppy beer trend has its detractors , even among some American brewers .
" Can you imagine a chef saying , ` This is the saltiest stew you 've ever tried , and you 're not a real man if you do n't like it ? '
That 's what some of these breweries are doing , " says Garrett Oliver , brewmaster of the Brooklyn Brewery in New York .
Oliver , whose flagship Brooklyn Lager has been available at the LCBO since last year , makes an IPA more in keeping with the original English style .
He also brews a bottle - conditioned Belgian ale , which will be on sale at the LCBO some time in the next year .
Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout , a rich , strong imperial stout , will be part of the LCBO 's seasonal program this winter .
While the bolder beers are some of the more popular American brews on offer at Beerbistro , they 're not the only ones people ask for .
" The Americans are hop - heads , but there 's a lot more variety than just IPAs , " says Morin , pointing to Dogfish Head 's Chateau Jiahu , a delicate brew that includes rice , honey and hawthorn berries .
Even the LCBO is starting to surf the American wave .
It recently added four beers – Southern Tier IPA , Dogfish Head 60 - Minute IPA , Rogue Dead Guy Ale and Anchor Steam Beer – to the general list .
Several more have been added on a seasonal basis .
" Our overall plan is to continue to focus on ultra- premium products , and craft beer – from Ontario and elsewhere – definitely falls in that category , " says Leanne Rhee , the LCBO 's category manager for beer .
Still , craft beer fans should n't expect to see beer from smaller but highly touted U.S. brewers , such as Wisconsin 's New Glarus , or Indiana brewery Three Floyds , renowned for its Dark Lord imperial stout .
Many are still building a following in their home markets , says Rhee .
Another obstacle for some breweries is the LCBO 's regulations , including specific requirements for labels , packaging and rigorous testing at the LCBO 's lab .
Smaller breweries , such as Buffalo 's Flying Bison , do n't have the technical or financial ability to change their packaging .

" It really does n't make any sense for me to do it .
It 's not worth it , '' says Flying Bison brewer Tim Herzog .
Despite the new additions , Rhee admits the LCBO 's stock does n't go far enough .
" We 'd definitely like to have more American beer .
Our customers are asking for it . "

From the AP , sure to be an environmentalist ’s wet dream :
High gas prices have driven a Warren County farmer and his sons to hitch a tractor rake to a pair of mules to gather hay from their fields .
T.R. Raymond bought Dolly and Molly at the Dixon mule sale last year .
Son Danny Raymond trained them and also modified the tractor rake so the mules could pull it .
T.R. Raymond says the mules are slower than a petroleum - powered tractor , but there are benefits .
“ This fuel ’s so high , you ca n’t afford it , ” he said .
“ We can feed these mules cheaper than we can buy fuel .
That ’s the truth . ”
And Danny Raymond says he just likes using the mules around the farm .
“ We ’ve been using them quite a bit , ” he said .
Brother Robert Raymond added , “ It ’s the way of the future . ”

Firefox 3 Release Candidate 1 was revealed to the world last week , which means the final release is only about a month away .
If you have n’t yet checked that your site works smoothly in the new browser , now ’s the time !
A few ( understandably ) angry Linux users aside , the consensus seems to be that Firefox 3 represents a huge leap forward for end -users .
The browser is much faster , better looking , and sports some awesome new end - user features over its predecessor .
For us developers , much has been said about the main improvements coming in Firefox 3 .
Stuff like built - in support for features web applications that work offline with locally cached data , and full - page zoom that makes it easier to design for visually impaired users , are all great to see , but in this post I ’m going to take the opportunity to look at a couple of features that could be easily overlooked .
Soft Hyphens
Tucked away in the list of CSS improvements in Firefox 3 is this innocuous - looking feature : “ HTML soft hyphens ( ­ ) are now supported . ”
Soft hyphens are one of those obscure gems that HTML has always supported on paper , but that no one has taken any notice of because browser support has been spotty .
With the imminent release of Firefox 3 , however , soft hyphens will be supported by all major browsers including Internet Explorer , Safari , and Opera .
So , what is a soft hyphen , anyway ?
A soft hyphen is a character of text that is usually invisible .
It signals a spot in the text ( usually in the middle of a long word ) where it would be acceptable to break the line with a hyphen .
When a browser that supports soft hyphens encounters a long word or other long piece of text with no obvious wrap point that does n’t fit horizontally inside a block on the page , it will look for a soft hyphen within the text and display it as a normal hyphen followed by a line break .
Take a look at this code sample :
< div style = " width : 10 em ; border : 1 px solid red ; " >
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious </div >
Display this in any browser , and the long word will protrude from the side of the div .
This situation arises all the time in real - world web design .
Say you ’ve got a navigation menu that occupies 25 % of the width of the page .
At small enough browser window sizes , a particularly long word in one of your menu items will either protrude messily from your menu into another part of the page , or force the menu to increase its width , possibly breaking your page layout .
Soft hyphens to the rescue !
< div style = " width : 10 em ; border : 1 px solid red ; " >
Supercalifragilistic­expialidocious </div >
Firefox 3 will be the last major browser to add support for soft hyphens , but you do n’t have to wait for it to be released to start using them !
Firefox 2 simply ignores the character , leaving it invisible ( and leaving your text protruding from its box ) .
Not bad as a fallback , especially compared to Safari , which used to display it as a normal hyphen !
Thankfully , Safari 2 or later gets it right .
Depending on how you edit your HTML , you may simply want to insert the soft hyphen character itself rather than the HTML character entity reference ( ­ ) .
It ’ll save a few bytes , and good code editors ( jEdit , for example ) will display soft hyphens as normal hyphens , so you can see them in your code .
Some are even smart enough to ignore soft hyphens when checking your spelling !
You can type a soft hyphen in Windows by holding down the Alt key and then typing either 0173 on the number pad , or the plus key on the number pad followed by 00 AD , before releasing Alt .
If you ca n’t remember that ( I sure can ’t ) , or if you ’re on a Mac , you can find the soft hyphen in the Character Map ( the Character Palette in Mac OS X ) .
If you do decide to use actual soft hyphen characters in your code , make sure you know your character encodings , because unlike most Latin - 1 characters , soft hyphens are encoded differently in UTF - 8 , so you need to save your code with the right encoding for the soft hyphens to work .
Inline Blocks
Another obscure - but - useful new feature making its way into Firefox 3 after all the other major browsers support it ( mostly ) is the inline block .
When assigned to an element , a display type of inline - block causes the element to be positioned inline ( like a span ) , but the element ’s contents are laid out as if the element were a block .
This feature will come in handy in a number of situations in which the float property is currently being used for lack of a better option .
Consider , for example , a thumbnail gallery layout based on this HTML code :
< ul class = " gallery " > < li > < div class=" caption " >A short caption </ div > < div class = " thumb " >< img src=" thumb1.jpg " /></div> </li > < li > < div class=" caption " >A short caption </ div > < div class = " thumb " >< img src=" thumb2.jpg " /></div> </li > … </ul >
Using a technique familiar to many designers , we can lay out the list items ( li ) in a grid by giving them all a specific width and floating them to the left :
. gallery li { float : left ; width : 100 px ; }
The list items are stacked horizontally against the left - hand margin , and when the available page width is consumed , the browser moves the next list item down until there is room for it .
This produces the neat grid layout shown here :
Now , that ’s all well and good as long as the image captions are all the same length .
As soon as we factor in the real - world need for captions of varying lengths , this technique runs into problems :
As shown , if one of the list items is taller than the others , it can disrupt the grid layout .
Since the browser will only move a list item down the page as far as is necessary to find room for it , list items can end up stacking against earlier list items that stick out from the bottom of the row .
To solve this problem while still using floats is messy at best .
You could set the clear property on the list item at the start of each row of the grid to force it clear of the preceding list items .
Not only is this messy to code , but it assumes you know which list item will start each row .
One of the nice features of this grid - like layout is that it automatically arranges the list items into rows based on the available space — which can change in a stretchy page layout .
display : inline - block is what ’s needed here .
Like floated blocks , inline blocks stack horizontally across the page .
Unlike floats , however , inline blocks are neatly arranged into horizontal lines — not stacked wherever they ’ll fit .
Here ’s what the code looks like :
. gallery li { display : inline - block ; width : 100 px ; } /*
In an IE - only style sheet */ . gallery li { display : inline ; }
The second rule is necessary due to a bug in IE7 and earlier .
Setting display : inline - block correctly causes the contents of the list items to behave as if the list items are blocks , but to get the list items to behave as inline elements you must subsequently ( and in a different rule ) set display : inline .
Since doing this would remove the inline - block display mode in other browsers , the second rule must be placed in an IE - only style sheet ( or targeted with a CSS hack ) .
We must also make a slight tweak to the markup .
Since the list items will now be treated as inline elements , the whitespace between them will become significant , and add extra space between the list items on the page .
This can be avoided simply by getting rid of the whitespace :
< ul class = " gallery " > < li > < div class=" caption " >A short caption </ div > < div class = " thumb " >< img src=" thumb1.jpg " /></div> </li>< li> < div class=" caption " >A short caption </ div > < div class = " thumb " >< img src=" thumb2.jpg " /></div> </li><li > … </ul >
And here is the result , with the invisible line boxes shown as dotted outlines :
Not bad , eh ?
The one difference that sticks out is that the list items are aligned against the bottom of each line box , so that their bottom edges line up .
This actually works well in this example , since the captions are above the images , but if the captions were below the images it would look pretty ugly .
It turns out this is a feature , not a bug .
You can control the alignment of inline blocks within a line using the vertical - align property .
Simply set vertical - align : top on your list items , and you can get something like this :

This act of youthful activism follows the sacking last week of 24 - year - old Lynne Tziolas after she and her husband appeared in a Cleo magazine article titled " Buck naked couples talk about their sex lives " .
The article ran interviews with 10 couples about " what they get up to between the sheets " and asked Ms Tziolas and her husband , Antonios , how many times they have sex a week , their favourite body part and the most risque sexual thing they 've done .
" Leaving the blinds up and the lights on , which is all the time , " Antonios said in response to the last question .
Complaints Ms Tziolas 's sacking prompted some parents to complain .
One parent , Eileen Sawaid , organised a petition to demand Ms Tziolas 's reinstatement , and she said she has received about 300 signatures .
" I fully support Lynne and will fight damn hard to help her because what happened is wrong , " she said this morning .
Instead of protecting the children from the contents of the magazine , the sacking of Ms Tziolas had in fact brought it to their attention , she said .
" The way the children found about about Ms Tziolas 's [ magazine shoot ] was after she was sacked , it had been out for a while before then and none of them had even heard about it , " she said .
Ms Sawaid also said she had misgivings about how the children at the school had become part of the issue , and criticised a story in the Manly Daily today which discussed the student petition to reinstate Ms Tziolas .
Not good for children to be involved " Her dismissal affects the children in many ways but the [ issue ] is an adult one and I do n't think it 's good for the children to be involved , " she said .
Ms Tziolas 's husband Antonios also said he regretted the involvement of the children .
" We 're a little bit upset that the kids are being damaged collaterally by all this ... it would upset Lynne and I if they get punished for what they 've done , " he said .
The principal of the school , Julie Organ , referred questions about the alleged confiscation of the classroom petition to the Department of Education .
A spokesman for the department said : " As the situation is complex and not one easily explained to junior primary school age children , it is inappropriate for them to be asked to sign a petition without the advice and guidance of parents .
Concerned parent
" A parent raised her concern with the school about a petition being created during class time .
" The petition , which had only a small number of signatures , was provided to the principal and the exercise book in which it had been written was returned to the parent of the student involved . "
Mr Tziolas also said the couple were due to meet a lawyer provided by the Teacher 's Federation this afternoon to begin legal action to have Ms Tziolas reinstated , he said .
" Lynne and I have just been overwhelmed by the response - people we 've never met have been sending us letters , people have been stopping us in the streets to give us their support , " he said .
Gov. Jon Corzine was unable to vote this morning at his designated polling site in Hoboken because the voting machines were not working .
Corzine was scheduled to cast his ballot at 6:15 a.m at the Hoboken Fire Department Engine Company No. 2 .
But the two machines are n't working , and it 's not clear why .
A repair man was called , but no one has showed up , said District 23 manager Clarence LaPorte .
About a dozen voters were turned away , La Porte said .
Corzine has endorsed Sen. Hillary Clinton 's bid for the Democratic nomination .
Polls in the Garden State are open until 8 p.m .
Republicans have been known , from time to time , to use the politics of fear to get ahead .
That , of course , includes scaring the bejeezus out of their own rank - and - file supporters , in order to get them to open their checkbooks .
But former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist ( R - Tenn . ) seems to have laid it on pretty thick in his latest email missive on behalf of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , sent this week .
The subject line read , “ Democrats Win Landslide Victory . ”
I have a real fear of waking up to this headline after the elections this fall .
Make no mistake about it :
If our grassroots teams fail to come together and work as hard as they did in 2000 , 2002 and 2004 , that headline could very likely be the result !
In key states , news accounts indicate Democrats are outpacing Republicans registering voters .
We also know Barack Obama ’s campaign is utilizing the Internet to raise record amounts of money to support his campaign and Democrats nationally ... all in the hope that new voters and record resources will produce a Democrat landslide victory this fall .
There ’s so much at risk , and conservatives I talk with from all across the country are feeling the rumblings of “ what could be . ”
Now , I ’m obviously not the target audience of Frist ’s message , but if I were a DSCC donor , and Chuck Schumer sent me an email about John McCain doing a great job registering voters , raising money , and rallying legions of supporters , all of which points to a Republican “ landslide , ” I might feel a little discouraged .
The New Yorker ’s Hendrick Hertzberg offered some psychoanalytic observations about the email ’s author .
Introduction
For entrepreneurs venturing into the online business world for the first time , it can seem like a very confusing place .
There is so much jargon and information it is hard to narrow down what is really important , what is useful and what is a waste of time .
In this article I ’m going to focus on simplifying what you need to know about making money online and then run through a case study of a website that does all these things really well .
The Five Revenue Streams
There are essentially five ways that you can make money from your content on the internet .
I ’ll now go through each of these revenue streams in more detail .
Advertising
Advertising is the simplest way to generate revenues from online content .
In the early days of internet business website owners had to sell the advertising space on their sites directly to the advertisers or to an advertising agency .
This meant only sites with high levels of traffic were viable , and the whole process of sourcing ads was expensive and time consuming .
Now adding ads to your website is easy .
Text Advertisements
The most common advertisement and easiest to implement on your website are text ads which automatically change depending on the content on a page .
For example if a content page is about taking a vacation on the Caribbean island of Anguilla , the text ads that are displayed should also be about Anguilla , as in this example :
The biggest text ad network in the world is Google Adsense ( www.google.com/adsense).
This is the service new publishers should start with .
Other growing networks include :
Yahoo Publisher Network
Microsoft Adcentre
Adbrite
Kontera
Chikita
Display Advertisements
Before text ads the most important format was banner advertisements which usually appeared in the masthead of a page .
Website owners have now become much more creative in the ad sizes that they offer .
The two most common formats are banner ads and 125 x 125 button ads .
Other Ad Formats
As advertising becomes more competitive so publishers and ad networks are responding by creating more exciting ad formats which include :
Video ads
Content link ads – when the mouse pointer passes over a link with two lines under it , an ad appears in a pop- up box
Pop - up ads – appear on top of a web page .
Very unpopular with users
Pop -under ads – appear under a website when the browser is closed .
Not as annoying as pop - up ads , but still irritate web users
Other Ways of Making Money from Advertising
Advertising can also include :
Sponsorship – get part or all of your website sponsored
Classified ads – Create a classified ads section and charge people for posting an ad
Jobs Board –
Add a jobs board to your site and charge companies for posting jobs
A list of over 101 ad networks .

Affiliate Marketing
Affiliate marketing is halfway between advertising and ecommerce .
You place links or ads on your website .
If one of your site visitors clicks on the link , goes through to a third party merchant site AND makes a purchase , you get paid a commission on the sale .
Commissions vary depending on the value and quantity of products sold .
For example an affiliate program for holidays may pay 2 % , whereas a program for selling a downloadable ebook may pay 50 % .
The biggest affiliate program in the world is run by Amazon http://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/join .
Anyone can sign up and promote Amazon products in exchange for a commission on sales of between 4 % and 10 % .
There are also many affiliate networks which aggregate hundreds or thousands merchants .
The biggest affiliate networks are :
Commission Junction – www.cj.com
TradeDoubler – www.tradedoubler.com
Linkshare – www.linkshare.com
ClickBank – www.clickbank.com
Performics – www.performics.com
There are many entrepreneurs on the internet making six figure incomes from running affiliate marketing websites .
Ecommerce
You can sell physical and digital products from your site .
Most content sites have the potential to make good revenue from selling ebooks , reports , white papers , research , podcasts and other downloadable products .
Many also sell physical goods which they both stock and ship themselves , or just take the orders for a third party merchant to fulfil .
To enable ecommerce you need to have a shopping cart and secure payment processing integrated into your content site .
The shopping cart enables buyers to select one or more items to buy and then takes them through the checkout process .
The payment processing can be done via a Payment Service Provider ( PSP ) which handles the whole transaction .
The biggest PSP is PayPal .
You could also consider using Google Checkout .
The alternative to a PSP is getting a merchant service account from your bank .
The charges are often cheaper and the customer service much better .
However you will need three services to make it work - a shopping cart , a gateway … which checks the shopper ’s card is not stolen … and your merchant account .
Subscription
Charging access to premium content is one of the most profitable ways you can build a sustainable online business .
It is the equivalent of the traditional print newsletter or specialist magazine , with all the advantages that the web has to offer including audio and video content , forums , reader feedback , real - time updates and simple administration .
To create a successful subscription website you need to be able separate public and member content , capture and manage member ’s personal data , issue passwords and process recurring payments .
These capabilities should be fully automated so you do n’t spend your life dealing with customer service issues .
Subscription is usually charged for access to premium content , but also can be for an online service .
Participation
Participation refers to activities where your website visitor becomes actively involved with you or your company .
These activities include webinars , tele - seminars , seminars , conferences , consultancy and mentoring .
It could also include licensing products , franchising your services , or other creative ways of leveraging your audience .
Trust and Authority Equals More Money
The order that I have listed these revenue streams in is important .
As you move from advertising to participation the amount of money you can make increases .
However the amount of money your website visitors will be willing to spend will depend on how much they trust you and the value they believe you can deliver .
Advertising requires the least commitment from visitors .
You earn a small amount of revenue from each page they visit .
Affiliate marketing requires a little more trust as visitors will be buying based on your recommendations .
Ecommerce requires visitors to give you their personal details and trust you to deliver whatever they are buying .
For people to pay for a subscription they must not only trust you with their personal details and credit card information , but they must also believe you will deliver value for the term of the membership .
And participation means they are buying into you and your business .
Courses , workshops and mentoring often mean they have to invest time , effort and money in working with you .
Conclusion
There are five ways to make money from a content website .
The most profitable websites have multiple revenue streams .
When you set up your online business you should explore all the possible money making opportunities and ensure that the website you build at the outset has the capability to continually add new ways of making money .
Your long - term , sustainable online success is dependant on you building a strong relationship with your audience and moving them from one revenue stream to the next .
Rowing has a less well known , older sister : sculling .
Races between watermen in single seat boats with a scull for each hand have taken place on the Thames since 1715 , before young men from schools and universities went afloat in ' eights ' which are rowed by crews with one oar each , as epitomized by the world renowned Oxford & Cambridge Boat Race , which started in 1829 .
A silhouette is a view of some object or scene consisting of the outline and a featureless interior , with the silhouette usually being black .
The word is an eponym named after Etienne de Silhouette , a finance minister of Louis XV who in 1759 imposed such harsh economic demands upon the French people that his name became synonymous with anything done or made cheaply .

six surveillance cameras destroyed at UC Santa Cruz by anarchists
Tuesday May 27th , 2008 2:32 PM
Over the last week , we took out six surveillance cameras from the exteriors of four different buildings on the University of California in Santa Cruz campus .
This was an act of rebellion to the social control in our daily lives .
These cameras are the eyes of the police .
Over the last week , we took out six surveillance cameras from the exteriors of four different buildings on the University of California in Santa Cruz campus .
This was an act of rebellion to the social control in our daily lives .
These cameras are the eyes of the police .
This task was easy to accomplish , and would be easy for anyone to reproduce .
We checked out the camera locations in advance , and came back at night for the attack .
We found a few steel barbed - wire fence posts nearby and pulled them up .
With just one strike , the cameras broke right off of the walls they were bolted to .
We cut the cords ( when they did n’t just break on their own ) , bagged them up and took them with us .
There has been a rapid expansion of surveillance technology that affects all of us .
From the consolidation of international databases for tracking and monitoring individuals to the placement of cameras in every intersection .
From the magnetic card readers at many of the dorms and buildings on the UCSC campus that track and log information on students entering and exiting ( which has been used in students ’ arrests in the past ) , to the militarization of the borders , preventing our ability to travel and migrate freely , contributing to the organizing of the global economy to the whims of the bosses .
There are limitless examples of the pervasiveness of social control technology both locally and globally .
There is also a growing resistance .
For the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , Greece , the entire city was completely covered with surveillance cameras .
Locals there have been attacking them consistently since they were installed , vowing to continue until every last one was destroyed .
Like the Athenians , we will not rest until we eliminate every single one we can find .
We live in a panopticon , where the society we live in is modeled after prison .
Information is constantly being collected about us , and the threat of being monitored is ever - present .
Those in more precarious positions experience this intensely .
Undocumented people who were fortunate enough to make it into this country face a continuous threat of raids , indefinite detention and / or deportation by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( also sinisterly known as I.C.E. ) .
This action is dedicated to those affected by the recent immigration raids in Watsonville , a town just south of Santa Cruz .
These raids were part of a nationally coordinated attack on immigrants , with a notable concentration around the Bay Area of California .
We invite people everywhere to rise up against every form of social control that affects their lives .
FUCK I.C.E! SPREAD THE REBELLION AGAINST SOCIAL CONTROL !

It seems obvious now that there is majority support for the solution supported by the Michigan Democratic Party .
That would mean 69 delegates for Hillary Clinton and 59 for Barack Obama ( with each delegate getting one - half vote ) .
But Harold Ickes ( and , by extension , Hillary Clinton ) are very unhappy .
“ I am stunned that we have the gall and the chutzpah to substitute our judgment for 600,000 voters , ” Ickes said .
He used the word “ hijack ” a lot , and said “ Hijacking four delegates is not a good way to start down the path to party unity . ”
The big news of the day was the final words of Ickes ’ argument : “ Mrs. Clinton has instructed me to reserve her rights to take this to the credentials committee . ”
If the crowd in the meeting room is any indication , Mrs. Clinton ’s supporters want her to exercise that right .
It could be a bluff .
But make no mistake : if Hillary Clinton takes this dispute to the credentials committee , she ’ll be going to the mattresses .
Most of the top leaders of the Democratic party have indicated that they do not support this process extending to the convention .
If Clinton wants to go down that road , she ’ll face a lot of opposition .
Before the final vote , Michigan Democratic Party chair Mark Brewer got a final chance to speak in favor of the motion supporting the party ’s 69 - 59 split .
He thanked the committee for its consideration and promised to work hard for the Democratic nominee .
The measure passed , 19 - 8 .
Now it ’s time to wait and see how the Clinton campaign responds .
If Ickes ’ speech opposing the motion was any indication , they wo n’t respond well .
Still , while Mr Gorbachev may be delighted by the rebirth of what many see as Russian imperialism , many wonder whether he approves of the way in which Mr Putin has eroded freedom of expression to such an extent that some claim glasnost is dead .
In 2006 , Los Angeles federal prosecutors were in the middle of a wide - ranging investigation of Rep. Lewis of California , who until January was chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee .
He remains its senior Republican .
The investigation focused on earmarks , or special spending measures , that benefited clients of a now - defunct lobbying firm to which he had close ties .
People with knowledge of the case said that by the time the investigation stalled in December 2006 , it had branched out into other areas , including Mr. Lewis 's June 2003 role in passing legislation that helped giant hedge fund Cerberus Capital Management .
[ snip ]
After the lead prosecutor in the Lewis case quit , others assigned to the case took time getting up to speed .
Brian Hershman , a former deputy chief of the Los Angeles office 's public corruption section , declined to comment on specific cases , but confirms that his group 's work overall was derailed by the departure of experienced prosecutors .
Like several others , he says he left for more money to support his family .
[ snip ]
To jump - start the Lewis investigation , Mr. Cardona , the interim U.S. attorney , in June called on a veteran prosecutor , Michael Emmick , to revive and supervise the investigation , people with knowledge of the investigation say .

John Maynard Keynes was a member of the British delegation to the peace negotiations at Versailles after World War I .
He was disgusted by the Allies ’ vindictive , grasping , and short - sighted actions at the conference , and he dashed off a book to denounce those actions and to explain why he thought the treaty would give rise to a plethora of troubles , as indeed it did .
His book , The Economic Consequences of the Peace ( 1919 ) , is still well worth reading today for its vivid character sketches , its recitation of key facts , and its penetrating political and economic insights .
Along the way , Keynes digressed to discuss why the European governments ’ inflation of their money stocks during and after the war portended grave consequences .
Although Keynes is not ordinarily cited as a strong anti-inflationist — indeed in important ways , his later views helped to create a well - nigh inevitably inflationary system of government macroeconomic interventionism — I know of no stronger statement against inflation than the one he expressed on pp. 235-36 of his book .
It reads as follows :
Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist System was to debauch the currency .
By a continuing process of inflation , governments can confiscate , secretly and unobserved , an important part of the wealth of their citizens .
By this method they not only confiscate , but they confiscate arbitrarily ; and , while the process impoverishes many , it actually enriches some .
The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security , but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth .
Those to whom the system brings windfalls , beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires , become ‘ profiteers , ’ who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie , whom the inflationism has impoverished , not less than of the proletariat .
As the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month , all permanent relations between debtors and creditors , which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism , become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless ; and the process of wealth - getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery .
Lenin was certainly right .
There is no subtler , no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency .
The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction , and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose . ”
Paulo Coelho , author of books such as " The Alchemist " and " The Witch of Portobello " , sold over 100 million books last year .
In part , he puts this success down to BitTorrent , as he saw a huge increase in sales when his books appeared on sites such as The Pirate Bay .
We talked to Coelho to find out more about this remarkable story .
“ Since the dawn of time , human beings have felt the need to share – from food to art .
Sharing is part of the human condition .
A person who does not share is not only selfish , but bitter and alone , ” Coelho told TorrentFreak , explaining why he decided to share his books for free .
His urge to share received quite a lot of attention after Coelho started a weblog with the name Pirate Coelho a few months ago .
His motivation ?
He wanted people to have the opportunity to ‘ try ’ his books for free , but he knew some of his publishers would n’t agree right away .
So , he took matters into his own hands and put his own books onto BitTorrent , FTP sites and Rapidshare .
“ There was a strong reaction when I mentioned the site at Digital Life Design , back in January 2008 , ” Coelho explains .
“ The blog was out there for a while , but it seems that nobody from the publishing world was paying attention to it .
When I spoke about it , all eyes were aimed at the site .
From that moment on , based on actual numbers , the publishers not only accepted it , but helped me . ”
“ Harper Collins , for example , decided to offer a new book of mine every month , for free reading . ”
This , together with the pirated copies worked out really well , and the book sales went up .
“ If you go to the New York Times Bestseller list , you ’ll see that the Alchemist jumped to the # 6 , and the Witch of Portobello is in the extended list . ”
BitTorrent is one of the filesharing networks Coelho uses to share his books .
“ I am using it now , while doing this interview , ” he says , and he encourages other authors to follow his lead .
“ The ultimate goal of a writer is to be read .
Money comes later . ”
This is of course easy to say for an author who has already sold millions of copies , but Coelho goes even further , and argues that ‘ sharing ’ books will actually help upcoming authors to sell more books .
It is a win -win situation .
“ I do think that when a reader has the possibility to read some chapters , he or she can always decide to buy the book later , ” Coelho says , indicating that it is not a lost sale .
On the other hand , the Internet makes it easier for new authors to publish content , and get people to read their work .
“ Nowadays , people are being encouraged to write , and start blogs , the book industry already found a few new talents on Internet , ” Coelho says .
When we asked Paulo about the difference between book piracy and the unauthorized copying of music and movies , he told us that it is difficult to compare , since it is easier to consume movies and music digitally .
Most people still prefer to read a real book however , pirated ebooks are more often used to preview .
This can always change in the future , but for now Coelho is not impressed by the ebook reading devices that are out there , and many of his readers seem to agree .
“ A ( real ) book is easy to carry , easy to read anywhere .
Reading a book on a monitor on the other hand is very tiresome , and it would be even more expensive to print ( considering cartridge prices ) than to buy a paperback , ” he says .
What the movie and music industry can learn from Coelho , however , is that availability is of the essence , and restrictions will only lead to reactance .
Coelho fully adopted all the possibilities the Internet offers , as he uses his weblog , Myspace , FaceBook , Flickr and even Twitter to interact with his readers .
“ I want to share everything I write , from my books to my blogs . ”
He recently started a new experiment , as he encouraged his readers to make a movie based on one of his books .
When “ The Witch of Portobello ” was released , Hollywood came rushing in with movie deals , but Coelho told his agent : “ it is time to start a new adventure ! ”
The price of crude oil today is not made according to any traditional relation of supply to demand .
It 's controlled by an elaborate financial market system as well as by the four major Anglo - American oil companies .
As much as 60 % of today 's crude oil price is pure speculation driven by large trader banks and hedge funds .
It has nothing to do with the convenient myths of Peak Oil .
It has to do with control of oil and its price .
How ?
First , the crucial role of the international oil exchanges in London and New York is crucial to the game .
Nymex in New York and the ICE Futures in London today control global benchmark oil prices which in turn set most of the freely traded oil cargo .
They do so via oil futures contracts on two grades of crude oil - West Texas Intermediate and North Sea Brent .
A third rather new oil exchange , the Dubai Mercantile Exchange ( DME ) , trading Dubai crude , is more or less a daughter of Nymex , with Nymex President , James Newsome , sitting on the board of DME and most key personnel British or American citizens .
Brent is used in spot and long - term contracts to value as much of crude oil produced in global oil markets each day .
The Brent price is published by a private oil industry publication , Platt's .
Major oil producers including Russia and Nigeria use Brent as a benchmark for pricing the crude they produce .
Brent is a key crude blend for the European market and , to some extent , for Asia .
WTI has historically been more of a US crude oil basket .
Not only is it used as the basis for US - traded oil futures , but it 's also a key benchmark for US production .
' The tail that wags the dog '
All this is well and official .
But how today 's oil prices are really determined is done by a process so opaque only a handful of major oil trading banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley have any idea who is buying and who selling oil futures or derivative contracts that set physical oil prices in this strange new world of " paper oil . "
With the development of unregulated international derivatives trading in oil futures over the past decade or more , the way has opened for the present speculative bubble in oil prices .
Since the advent of oil futures trading and the two major London and New York oil futures contracts , control of oil prices has left OPEC and gone to Wall Street .
It is a classic case of the " tail that wags the dog . "
A June 2006 US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations report on " The Role of Market Speculation in rising oil and gas prices , " noted , " there is substantial evidence supporting the conclusion that the large amount of speculation in the current market has significantly increased prices . "
What the Senate committee staff documented in the report was a gaping loophole in US Government regulation of oil derivatives trading so huge a herd of elephants could walk through it .
That seems precisely what they have been doing in ramping oil prices through the roof in recent months .
The Senate report was ignored in the media and in the Congress .
The report pointed out that the Commodity Futures Trading Trading Commission , a financial futures regulator , had been mandated by Congress to ensure that prices on the futures market reflect the laws of supply and demand rather than manipulative practices or excessive speculation .
The US Commodity Exchange Act ( CEA ) states , " Excessive speculation in any commodity under contracts of sale of such commodity for future delivery . . . causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the price of such commodity , is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity . "
Further , the CEA directs the CFTC to establish such trading limits " as the Commission finds are necessary to diminish , eliminate , or prevent such burden . "
Where is the CFTC now that we need such limits ?
They seem to have deliberately walked away from their mandated oversight responsibilities in the world 's most important traded commodity , oil .
Enron has the last laugh As that US Senate report noted : " Until recently , US energy futures were traded exclusively on regulated exchanges within the United States , like the NYMEX , which are subject to extensive oversight by the CFTC , including ongoing monitoring to detect and prevent price manipulation or fraud .
In recent years , however , there has been a tremendous growth in the trading of contracts that look and are structured just like futures contracts , but which are traded on unregulated OTC electronic markets .
Because of their similarity to futures contracts they are often called " futures look - alikes . "
The only practical difference between futures look - alike contracts and futures contracts is that the look - alikes are traded in unregulated markets whereas futures are traded on regulated exchanges .
The trading of energy commodities by large firms on OTC electronic exchanges was exempted from CFTC oversight by a provision inserted at the behest of Enron and other large energy traders into the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 in the waning hours of the 106th Congress .
The impact on market oversight has been substantial .
NYMEX traders , for example , are required to keep records of all trades and report large trades to the CFTC .
These Large Trader Reports , together with daily trading data providing price and volume information , are the CFTC 's primary tools to gauge the extent of speculation in the markets and to detect , prevent , and prosecute price manipulation .
CFTC Chairman Reuben Jeffrey recently stated : " The Commission 's Large Trader information system is one of the cornerstones of our surveillance program and enables detection of concentrated and coordinated positions that might be used by one or more traders to attempt manipulation . "
In contrast to trades conducted on the NYMEX , traders on unregulated OTC electronic exchanges are not required to keep records or file Large Trader Reports with the CFTC , and these trades are exempt from routine CFTC oversight .
In contrast to trades conducted on regulated futures exchanges , there is no limit on the number of contracts a speculator may hold on an unregulated OTC electronic exchange , no monitoring of trading by the exchange itself , and no reporting of the amount of outstanding contracts ( " open interest " ) at the end of each day .

Then , apparently to make sure the way was opened really wide to potential market oil price manipulation , in January 2006 , the Bush Administration 's CFTC permitted the Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE ) , the leading operator of electronic energy exchanges , to use its trading terminals in the United States for the trading of US crude oil futures on the ICE futures exchange in London ­ called " ICE Futures . "
Previously , the ICE Futures exchange in London had traded only in European energy commodities ­ Brent crude oil and United Kingdom natural gas .
As a United Kingdom futures market , the ICE Futures exchange is regulated solely by the UK Financial Services Authority .
In 1999 , the London exchange obtained the CFTC 's permission to install computer terminals in the United States to permit traders in New York and other US cities to trade European energy commodities through the ICE exchange .
The CFTC opens the door Then , in January 2006 , ICE Futures in London began trading a futures contract for West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) crude oil , a type of crude oil that is produced and delivered in the United States .
ICE Futures also notified the CFTC that it would be permitting traders in the United States to use ICE terminals in the United States to trade its new WTI contract on the ICE Futures London exchange .
ICE Futures as well allowed traders in the United States to trade US gasoline and heating oil futures on the ICE Futures exchange in London .
Despite the use by US traders of trading terminals within the United States to trade US oil , gasoline , and heating oil futures contracts , the CFTC has until today refused to assert any jurisdiction over the trading of these contracts .
Persons within the United States seeking to trade key US energy commodities ­ US crude oil , gasoline , and heating oil futures ­ are able to avoid all US market oversight or reporting requirements by routing their trades through the ICE Futures exchange in London instead of the NYMEX in New York .
Is that not elegant ?
The US Government energy futures regulator , CFTC opened the way to the present unregulated and highly opaque oil futures speculation .
It may just be coincidence that the present CEO of NYMEX , James Newsome , who also sits on the Dubai Exchange , is a former chairman of the US CFTC .
In Washington doors revolve quite smoothly between private and public posts .
A glance at the price for Brent and WTI futures prices since January 2006 indicates the remarkable correlation between skyrocketing oil prices and the unregulated trade in ICE oil futures in US markets .
Keep in mind that ICE Futures in London is owned and controlled by a USA company based in Atlanta Georgia .
In January 2006 when the CFTC allowed the ICE Futures the gaping exception , oil prices were trading in the range of $ 59 - 60 a barrel .
Today some two years later we see prices tapping $ 120 and trend upwards .
This is not an OPEC problem , it is a US Government regulatory problem of malign neglect .
By not requiring the ICE to file daily reports of large trades of energy commodities , it is not able to detect and deter price manipulation .
As the Senate report noted , " The CFTC 's ability to detect and deter energy price manipulation is suffering from critical information gaps , because traders on OTC electronic exchanges and the London ICE Futures are currently exempt from CFTC reporting requirements .
Large trader reporting is also essential to analyze the effect of speculation on energy prices . "
The report added , " ICE 's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other evidence indicate that its over - the - counter electronic exchange performs a price discovery function -- and thereby affects US energy prices -- in the cash market for the energy commodities traded on that exchange . "
Hedge Funds and Banks driving oil prices
In the most recent sustained run-up in energy prices , large financial institutions , hedge funds , pension funds , and other investors have been pouring billions of dollars into the energy commodities markets to try to take advantage of price changes or hedge against them .
Most of this additional investment has not come from producers or consumers of these commodities , but from speculators seeking to take advantage of these price changes .
The CFTC defines a speculator as a person who " does not produce or use the commodity , but risks his or her own capital trading futures in that commodity in hopes of making a profit on price changes . "
The large purchases of crude oil futures contracts by speculators have , in effect , created an additional demand for oil , driving up the price of oil for future delivery in the same manner that additional demand for contracts for the delivery of a physical barrel today drives up the price for oil on the spot market .
As far as the market is concerned , the demand for a barrel of oil that results from the purchase of a futures contract by a speculator is just as real as the demand for a barrel that results from the purchase of a futures contract by a refiner or other user of petroleum .
Perhaps 60 % of oil prices today pure speculation Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley today are the two leading energy trading firms in the United States .
Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase are major players and fund numerous hedge funds as well who speculate .
In June 2006 , oil traded in futures markets at some $ 60 a barrel and the Senate investigation estimated that some $ 25 of that was due to pure financial speculation .
One analyst estimated in August 2005 that US oil inventory levels suggested WTI crude prices should be around $ 25 a barrel , and not $ 60 .
That would mean today that at least $ 50 to $ 60 or more of today 's $ 115 a barrel price is due to pure hedge fund and financial institution speculation .
However , given the unchanged equilibrium in global oil supply and demand over recent months amid the explosive rise in oil futures prices traded on Nymex and ICE exchanges in New York and London it is more likely that as much as 60 % of the today oil price is pure speculation .
No one knows officially except the tiny handful of energy trading banks in New York and London and they certainly are n't talking .
By purchasing large numbers of futures contracts , and thereby pushing up futures prices to even higher levels than current prices , speculators have provided a financial incentive for oil companies to buy even more oil and place it in storage .
A refiner will purchase extra oil today , even if it costs $ 115 per barrel , if the futures price is even higher .
As a result , over the past two years crude oil inventories have been steadily growing , resulting in US crude oil inventories that are now higher than at any time in the previous eight years .
The large influx of speculative investment into oil futures has led to a situation where we have both high supplies of crude oil and high crude oil prices .
Compelling evidence also suggests that the oft - cited geopolitical , economic , and natural factors do not explain the recent rise in energy prices can be seen in the actual data on crude oil supply and demand .
Although demand has significantly increased over the past few years , so have supplies .
Over the past couple of years global crude oil production has increased along with the increases in demand ; in fact , during this period global supplies have exceeded demand , according to the US Department of Energy .
The US Department of Energy 's Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) recently forecast that in the next few years global surplus production capacity will continue to grow to between 3 and 5 million barrels per day by 2010 , thereby " substantially thickening the surplus capacity cushion . "
Dollar and oil link A common speculation strategy amid a declining USA economy and a falling US dollar is for speculators and ordinary investment funds desperate for more profitable investments amid the US securitization disaster , to take futures positions selling the dollar " short " and oil " long . "
For huge US or EU pension funds or banks desperate to get profits following the collapse in earnings since August 2007 and the US real estate crisis , oil is one of the best ways to get huge speculative gains .
The backdrop that supports the current oil price bubble is continued unrest in the Middle East , in Sudan , in Venezuela and Pakistan and firm oil demand in China and most of the world outside the US .
Speculators trade on rumor , not fact .
In turn , once major oil companies and refiners in North America and EU countries begin to hoard oil , supplies appear even tighter lending background support to present prices .
Because the over - the - counter ( OTC ) and London ICE Futures energy markets are unregulated , there are no precise or reliable figures as to the total dollar value of recent spending on investments in energy commodities , but the estimates are consistently in the range of tens of billions of dollars .
The increased speculative interest in commodities is also seen in the increasing popularity of commodity index funds , which are funds whose price is tied to the price of a basket of various commodity futures .
Goldman Sachs estimates that pension funds and mutual funds have invested a total of approximately $ 85 billion in commodity index funds , and that investments in its own index , the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index ( GSCI ) , has tripled over the past few years .
Notable is the fact that the US Treasury Secretary , Henry Paulson , is former Chairman of Goldman Sachs .

According to Paul Graham , an early version of Arc had internal define , but there was a problem :
In a language with implicit local variables and macros , you 're always tripping over unexpected lexical contours .
You do n't want to create new lexical contours without announcing it .
But a lot of macros that do n't look like blocks in the call expand into blocks .
So we provided a second block operator , called justdo , which was like do but did n't create a new lexical contour ( i.e. it is Common Lisp progn ) , and this is what you were supposed to use in macroexpansions .
The trouble was , I kept forgetting and using do instead .
And I was thereby writing utilities with the worst sort of bug : the kind that might not show up for years , and only then in someone else 's code .
Huh ?
My own Lisp dialect also has internal define , and I have n't had a problem with unexpected contours .
Neither have thousands of Schemers .
( They might point out the disagreement over define in let - syntax , and the difficulty of writing macros that expand into multiple define s , but I do n't think anyone counts these among the biggest problems with the language . )
I have n't even had trouble remembering to use justdo in my Lisp , possibly because it has the more distinctive name splice .
What are these problems I 'm supposed to be having ?
I 'm also surprised by how complicated the implementation was said to be :
We wrote a hideously complicated interpreter that allowed local variables to be declared this way .
The ugliness of this code worried me : ugly things are generally a bad idea .
I suspect they just implemented it the wrong way .
You can implement internal define quite simply by defining begin ( including implicit begin ! ) as a macro which transforms define to letrec* .
Most Schemes do it this way , and my own Lisp does too , more consistently : basic special forms like lambda and begin are actually macros over more primitive ones .
It feels a little odd at first , but once you stop expecting to write in primitives all the time , it 's quite comfortable .
You get internal define and other macro - based luxuries without compromising the simplicity of the language kernel .
My experience with internal define has been almost entirely positive .
This is so different from Graham and Morris ' that I wonder if they were really doing something else .
Now , how did they describe it ?
In Arc we were planning to let users declare local variables implicitly , just by assigning values to them .
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - A ray leaped onto a boat off the Florida Keys on Thursday and knocked a woman to the deck , killing her , wildlife investigators said .
“ It ’s a bizarre accident , ” said Jorge Pino , an officer with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission .
The woman and her family were aboard a boat in the Atlantic Ocean , off the city of Marathon in the Florida Keys , he said .
“ A large ray jumped out of the water and collided with the victim , ” Pino said .
The impact threw the woman backward and she hit her head on the vessel , he said .
Investigators initially said one of the animal ’s venomous barbs had stabbed her , but they later said there was no sign of a puncture .
An autopsy was pending .
“ We believe she died as a result of the impact between herself and the spotted eagle ray , ” said Gabriella Ferraro , a spokeswoman for the wildlife commission .

The ray weighed about 80 pounds ( 36 kg ) and had a wingspan of 5 to 6 feet , Ferraro said .
The boat was traveling at about 25 mph ( 40 kph ) when the animal collided with the woman , killing both , she said .
Investigators identified the woman as Judy Kay Zagorski , 57 , of Pigeon , Michigan .
Spotted eagle rays are common in warm or tropical waters and are often seen near coral reefs .
The can grow to more than 8 feet across and have two to six short , venomous barbs near the base of their whip - like tails , according to the Florida Museum of Natural History ’s Web site .
The rays often swim near the water ’s surface and can leap out , especially when pursued , but are generally shy of humans .
“ All rays leap out of the water from time to time but certainly to see one collide with a vessel is extremely unusual , ” Pino said .
In 2006 , a spotted eagle ray leaped onto another boat in Florida waters off the Fort Lauderdale area and pierced the heart of an 81 - year - old man with its barb .
He survived .
Steve Irwin , the host of the “ Crocodile Hunter ” television show , was killed by another type of ray while filming underwater on Australia ’s Great Barrier Reef in 2006 .
He died when a stingray ’s barb pierced his heart .
The Lib Dems called the plans an " Orwellian step too far " Ministers are to consider plans for a database of electronic information holding details of every phone call and e-mail sent in the UK , it has emerged .
The plans , reported in the Times , are at an early stage and may be included in the draft Communications Bill later this year , the Home Office confirmed .
A Home Office spokesman said the data was a " crucial tool " for protecting national security and preventing crime .
Ministers have not seen the plans which were drawn up by Home Office officials .
A Home Office spokesman said : " The Communications Data Bill will help ensure that crucial capabilities in the use of communications data for counter - terrorism and investigation of crime continue to be available .
" These powers will continue to be subject to strict safeguards to ensure the right balance between privacy and protecting the public . "
Given the appalling track record of data loss , this state is simply not to be trusted with such private information
Chris Huhne
Lib Dems
The spokesman said changes need to be made to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 " to ensure that public authorities can continue to obtain and have access to communications data essential for counter - terrorism and investigation of crime purposes " .
But the Information Commission , an independent authority set up to protect personal information , said the database " may well be a step too far " and highlighted the risk of data being lost , traded or stolen .
Assistant information commissioner Jonathan Bamford said : " We are not aware of any justification for the state to hold every UK citizen 's phone and internet records .
We have real doubts that such a measure can be justified , or is proportionate or desirable .
" Defeating crime and terrorism is of the utmost importance , but we are not aware of any pressing need to justify the government itself holding this sort of data . "
' Appalling record '
A number of data protection failures in recent months , including the loss of a CD carrying the personal details of every child benefit claimant , have embarrassed the government .
The plans also prompted concern from political groups .
The shadow home secretary , David Davis , said : " Given [ ministers ' ] appalling record at maintaining the integrity of databases holding people 's sensitive data , this could well be more of a threat to our security than a support . "
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne called the proposals " an Orwellian step too far " .
He said ministers had " taken leave of their senses if they think that this proposal is compatible with a free country and a free people " .
" Given the appalling track record of data loss , this state is simply not to be trusted with such private information , " said Mr Huhne .

Editor ’s note :
It never ends .
Now the unimaginably evil al - Qaeda is taking advantage of the mentally ill , according to the mockingbird corporate media .
Of course , the actual truth is quite different — the al - Qaeda intelligence operation , run by the CIA , MI6 , and the Mossad , actively seeks the mentally ill , retards , the clueless , the easily brainwashed as patsies .
A failed restaurant bombing in England last week has raised concerns among U.S. and European counterterrorism officials that Al Qaeda and other radical Islamic groups are recruiting mentally disabled people to carry out suicide attacks .
Authorities in Britain have mounted an intensive investigation into how and why a 22 - year - old mentally handicapped man , Nicky Reilly , built a nail bomb and then attempted to set it off last Thursday .
The bomb , which was intended to detonate at lunchtime in a crowded restaurant in Exeter , a county seat in southwest England , apparently misfired , and Reilly was the only one injured in the partial explosion .
According to British news reports , he suffered minor eye injuries and burns to his face .
Earlier this week , he was released from the hospital and transferred to the custody of local police , who are now expected to question him with the help of Scotland Yard ’s antiterrorist division .
According to British news reports , shortly before leaving his home in Plymouth , England , on his bombing mission , Reilly allegedly received a text message on his cell phone that encouraged him to proceed with the attack .
Following the failed bombing , at least two men were picked up by police in connection with the investigation , but their status is unclear .

Oops , he did it again .
With Sen. Hillary Clinton locked in a dogfight with Sen. Barack Obama for votes in today 's crucial Democratic Pennsylvania primary , her husband and former U.S. president , Bill Clinton , stole the spotlight by loudly rehashing his controversial comparison of Obama to Jesse Jackson .
" He would do the [ Clinton ] campaign good if he would just stop saying stuff like this , " said Bob Shrum , a former Democratic strategist who worked on both the Al Gore and John Kerry campaigns .
" There are plenty of times when he goes out and is very effective , but then he pops off in other ways that do n't help . "
In an interview Monday with Philadelphia radio station WHYY , Bill Clinton was asked about comments he made after Obama 's South Carolina primary victory in January when he compared Obama 's win to Jackson 's primary wins in the state in 1984 and 1988 .
The comments created a furor in January as some critics considered the remark to be a way of bringing attention to Obama 's race .
Bill Clinton fired up the issue again Monday by claiming the Obama campaign had purposefully misinterpreted his words .
" I think that they played the race card on me .
And we now know , from memos from the campaign and everything , that they planned to do it all along , " he said in a telephone interview with WHYY 's Susan Phillips .
" I was stating a fact , and it 's still a fact . "
The former president says the comment was " used out of context and twisted for political purposes by the Obama campaign . "
Then , after the interview had concluded but the microphone had not yet been turned off , he said , " I do n't think I should take any s-- from anybody on that , do you ? "
Bill Clinton : A Double - Edge Sword ?
Bill Clinton is often more active in his wife 's campaign that she is , making seven or eight stops a day , consistently holding fundraisers and giving interviews .
But today , when an NBC reporter asked about his comments on the radio during a polling stop in Pittsburgh , the former president urged him to go back and listen to the interview again .
" This is a day about Election Day .
Go back and see what the question was and what my answer was , " said Bill Clinton , as he continued to shake hands despite reporters ' badgering .
" You have mischaracterized it just to get another cheap story to divert the American people from the real urgent issues before us . "
Hillary Clinton was similarly tight - lipped on the campaign trail today , dodging a question about her husband 's remarks and responding , " I think that we 're going to stay focused on what voters are focused on . "
Obama laughed off Clinton 's accusation that his campaign " played the race card . "
" So , former President Clinton dismissed my victory in South Carolina as being similar to Jesse Jackson and he is suggesting that somehow I had something to do with it , " Obama said laughing .
" Ok , well , you better ask him what he meant by that .
I have no idea what he meant . "
How much an effect his remarks will have on today 's primary is hard to gauge , several political analysts told ABCNEWS.com , but most agreed that his lack of restraint probably is n't helping things at campaign headquarters .
" [ Bill Clinton ] is an asset in the sense that Hillary would n't be there without him and he 's been helpful in terms of fundraising , but the freelance commenting is not helpful , " said Shrum .
" He keeps saying things the campaign has to explain away or live with . "
Tad Devine , a Democratic political consultant not involved in either campaign , told ABCNEWS.com that Bill Clinton seems to suffer from knowing that when he talks , people listen .
" When you 're president and particularly when you 're ex-president , you feel very uninhibited saying things , " said Devine .
" People listen to you and your words are really taken seriously . "
" [ Bill Clinton ] is just not constrained like most people in campaigns are , " said Devine .
" And when the attention is at a fever pitch any little thing that you say will be amplified . "
Ed Rollins , a Republican strategist who worked on the 2008 Mike Huckabee presidential campaign , told ABCNEWS.com that he thinks Clinton is far more damaging than helpful to his wife 's cause .
" Everything [ Bill ] has said of late has hurt his wife , " said Rollins .
" The best thing for him to do is to go back to his library in Little Rock , Ark. , and not talk until she 's nominated or out of the race , " he added .
Hillary Clinton may have caught a break because her husband 's comments were made so close to the primary , timing that Devine says will make his remarks unlikely to sway voters .
" What today is about is n't persuasion , it 's about mobilization , " Devine told ABCNEWS.com .
" It 's about what 2 million people do in an election , not what one person says . "
Could the moon be the solution to a future energy crisis ?
See more moon pictures .
2008 HowStuffWorks
If you discount all of the wars , conflicts , consumer enslavement and carbon dioxide emissions it 's generated , oil has been pretty good to humanity .
It 's fostered our global development at warp speed pace .
But oil is finite -- it 's a nonrenewable resource , which means that we will eventually run out of it .
The sense that humanity is racing against the fuel - source clock makes alternative energy a front - and - center issue .
Ideas like switchgrass ethanol , biodiesel and wind and solar power may soon actually power the globe .
But each of these still has its own obstacles to large - scale energy production .
So researchers continue to look around our planet for novel ways to power it .

Some researchers are looking beyond our planet to the night sky .
It turns out , there 's a way that we can generate electricity from the moon -- thanks to the tides created by the gravitational pull the moon exerts on Earth 's oceans .
The Earth is tugged by the sun and moon .
The sun dwarfs the moon in size , but the moon is much closer to Earth -- around 239,000 miles away , compared to the distance of 93 million miles between the sun and the Earth .
Proximity trumps size when it comes to tidal movement here on Earth :
The moon exerts more than twice as much gravitational force on Earth than the sun does [ source : Office of Naval Research ] .
Think of the water that 's found on Earth as a single , rubbery covering that encapsulates the planet .
When the moon pulls this covering toward it , it stretches so that it thins out and widens on each side .
These are the swollen , high tides .
The wrapper is stretched thinnest on the top and bottom .
This is where the low tide is found .
The moon 's pull is constant ; it 's the rotation of the Earth on its axis that causes different areas to experience high and low tides .
Because there are these predictable tides on Earth , some places around the planet are being powered by tidal movement .

Bush fuel economy rules swipe at California Plan says only U.S. regulates emissions
When the Bush administration announced proposed regulations Tuesday to raise fuel economy standards for cars and trucks to 31.6 miles per gallon by 2015 , even some environmentalists applauded .
But then they read the fine print .
Tucked deep into a 417 - page " Notice of Proposed Rulemaking " was language by the Transportation Department stating that more stringent limits on tailpipe emissions embraced by California and 17 other states are " an obstacle to the accomplishment " of the new federal standards and are " expressly and impliedly preempted " by federal law .
California Attorney General Jerry Brown called it a covert assault on California 's rules .
Environmentalists said the language will be used by automakers in their legal challenges to two recent federal court rulings that sided with the states .
The language showed that beneath the bipartisan veneer of support for new fuel economy standards - approved by Congress and signed by President Bush in December - the conflict is still raging between the White House and the states over who will set the nation 's first limits on greenhouse gases .
Transportation Secretary Mary Peters , who announced the proposed rules Tuesday , acknowledged that the preemption language was included in the document .
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has fiercely defended its role as the only government entity with the authority to set fuel economy standards for cars and trucks .
Agency officials believe the law passed last year - which mandated an increase in fuel economy to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 - reinforced the department 's power .
National standards
" It 's the belief of the department that by legislating national fuel economy standards that Congress wants national fuel economy standards , " said Brian Turmail , a Transportation Department spokesman .
But that view rankles California officials , who noted that during the debate last fall , California Sen .
Dianne Feinstein and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - San Francisco , won assurances that the bill would be neutral on whether California and other states could proceed with their own rules .
The Supreme Court ruled in the Massachusetts vs. EPA case last year that the Transportation Department 's authority to set fuel economy standards should not impede other efforts under the Clean Air Act to reduce greenhouse gases .
California traditionally has had special authority under the Clean Air Act to set limits on air pollutants that are tougher than federal standards .
A federal judge in Vermont ruled in September that the state rules do not conflict with federal mileage standards , and a Fresno court in December found that both California and the EPA are empowered to set limits on vehicle emissions .
' Respectfully disagree '
In its new document , the Transportation Department said , " We respectfully disagree with the two district court rulings " and noted that an appeal has been filed by automakers .
Agency officials wrote that the new fuel economy standards had increased the conflict between state regulations and federal law .
They added : " A conflict between state and federal law arises when compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility or when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress . "
The agency said it is considering adding language to its final rule stating that " any state regulation regulating tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles is expressly preempted " under federal law .
Roland Hwang , the vehicles policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council , said the document appeared to be an effort to bolster the legal case of the auto industry .
" We fully expect to see this rule being quoted by the automakers in their court cases in trying to overturn the Fresno and Vermont decisions , " Hwang said .
" It 's the same argument we 're hearing from the automakers . "
Charles Territo , a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers , rejected the idea that the administration is coordinating with the industry .
" It 's consistent with the federal government 's position all along , " Territo said , pointing to the EPA 's decision in December to deny California 's request for a waiver to implement its rules .
California officials said there 's a reason the industry opposes its efforts :
While the new federal standards would raise fuel economy to 31.6 miles per gallon by 2015 , California 's rules would require the U.S. vehicle fleet to get 36 miles per gallon by 2015 .
' Shameful and unlawful '
" This fuel economy plan , while attractive on the surface , is a shameful and unlawful assault on California 's landmark vehicle emissions standard , " Brown said Tuesday .
Pelosi , who pushed the fuel economy bill through the House , praised the Transportation Department for taking the first step of implementing the new federal rules .
But she chastised the agency for trying to undermine tougher state regulations .
" Despite two federal court rulings and Congress ' decision to reject the administration 's position that enacted energy legislation should preempt the authority of states to regulate greenhouse gas vehicle emissions , the administration has chosen to trot out the same tired old arguments , " she said .
India , Brazil , and South Africa are attempting to appeal ISO 's fast - track approval of Microsoft 's controversial Office Open XML ( OOXML ) format .
The organizations representing those countries in ISO complain of process irregularities , lack of inclusiveness during meetings and debates , and insufficient time to address all of the issues and concerns raised by participants during the review process .
OOXML received approval last month after receiving support from approximately 86 percent of the national bodies that participated in the process .
The highly - politicized approval process faced heavy scrutiny from critics who allege that Microsoft engaged in abusive practices including committee - stuffing and vote buying .
But the format also received strong support from unexpected allies , like ODF coeditor Patrack Durusau who described it as a " poster child fro the open standards development process . "
The matter of gravest concern to the countries that are appealing the approval is that many of the issues brought up during the initial review were glossed over during a block - voting process due to time constraints .
During the Ballot Resolution Meeting , most of ECMA 's responses to problems in the specification were approved collectively without discussion .
" Since only 67 of the 1,027 responses by ECMA were discussed , the processes used to ' approve ' the remaining responses by voting were questionable and did nothing to promote concensus , but simply ' approved ' ECMA 's attempt to improve the quality of the standard .
This was especially disconcerting to the large number of experts from various countries who had spent many hours in ad hoc meetings during the period of the BRM to develop consensus on some of the ECMA responses that contained errors or other issues of contention , " South African Bureau of Standards CEO M. Kuscus wrote in his request for an appeal .
" South Africa challenges the validity of a final vote that we contend was based upon inadequate information resulting from a poorly conducted BRM . "
The reasons cited by Brazil for its appeal are also similar .
Because of time constraints , the representatives from Brazil were not permitted to present proposals for improvements .
They also complain that the final text of the standard still has n't been published despite clear rules requiring publication within 30 days after the Ballot Resolution Meeeting .
Where the dispute goes from here is still unclear .
Standards expert and OOXML critic Andy Updegrove has written a blog entry that discusses the official rules for the ISO appeal process and notes that they are somewhat ambiguous .
The OOXML controversy will apparently linger on in the aftermath of the ISO approval process and will likely continue to cast a cloud of uncertainty over Microsoft 's format .

The native Britons have an unhealthy fondness of soldiers , policemen and spies .
Take , for example , their former prime minister , Tony Blair .
According to Neil Kinnock , who once led the Labour Party , Blair " is impressed by uniforms " and " pretty impressed by intelligence officers - spooks " .
Although Blair is not necessarily representative of British public opinion , his proclivities in this regard are more or less typical of other Britons .
One often hears , for instance , Britons referring to their " wonderful police force " .
This fondness was underlined recently when a demonstration by policemen and women demanding higher pay attracted widespread sympathy from the very same public which treats with hostility and contempt similar demands by firemen , ambulance staff , nurses , teachers and other workers .
Few British policemen who are suspected of committing crimes are prosecuted or disciplined , even when the evidence against them that is in the public domain seems overwhelming .
Of those that are brought before the courts , a tiny number are convicted .
Yet , the public and the media keep silent .
So , what is so special about the British police that makes them so pampered and almost irreproachable ?
The simple and honest answer is nothing whatsoever .
In fact , British policemen are in the forefront of efforts to roll back human rights and civil liberties in Britain .
Not content with their role as law enforement officers , they are constantly edging their way towards policy making .
You will find them campaigning almost daily to limit their accountability to the public under the pretext that accountability involves too much paper work , and too much paper work means fewer policemen on the streets .
You will also find them ceaselessly whinging and whining in favour of detaining innocent people without charge for 90 days .
The executioner is trying very hard to become the jury , yet the victims still love him .
What of those other boys and girls in uniform , the armed force ?
British soldiers are spoilt rotten and treated by the government , the media and the public like demi-gods .
The only wars these men and women have ever fought since World War II have been wars of aggression , oppression and occupation , whether in Suez , Yemen , Ireland , Iraq or Afghanistan .
And the only enemies they have faced since Hitler have been equipped with obsolete , rudimentary weapons .
Yet , their exploits against unequals are treated by the British public and media as acts of unparallelled heroism .
All British soldiers , whether full time or part time , are volunteers .
Britain has no national service , no conscripts .
Yet , when a British soldier is injured in one of the country 's wars of aggression , all hell breaks loose , with recriminations against the government and demands for compensation for what is , after all , a hazard of their chosen profession .
Although it would make sense to compensate injured soldiers if they were conscripts because they would have been press - ganged into military service , I do n't understand why compensation should be given to someone who has willingly chosen a killing machine as his vehicle in return for money and free accommodation .
The native Britons ' love affair with their internal and external security services , the so - called MI5 and MI6 , compared with their fondness of the police and the armed forces , is somewhat subtle and muted .
But it is by far the most dangerous and corrupting of the entire British body politic .
We know from the published accounts of former British intelligence officers , such as Peter Wright , David Shayler and Richard Tomlinson , that the British security services attempted to subvert at least one elected British government and , contrary to British law , plotted to murder Libya 's ruler , Muammar Gaddafi , and thought about murdering Balkan politicians .
We also know that they have spied on various self - proclaimed left - wing activists and that they were involved in recruitment vetting at the BBC and in blacklisting and ruining the lives of numerous trade unionists and communists , many of whom remained permanently unemployed for the sin of thinking differently to Her Majesty 's spooks .
Yet , despite all this , the British public remains at best indifferent or forgiving , and at worse , mildly supportive , as if they were masochists looking forward to the advent of fascism .
Despite all these misdemeanours by the security services , there have been no serious attempts or calls to bring MI5 and MI6 under tighter political control and , if we are to believe the accounts of renegade officers such as David Shayler , the security services remain as unaccountable as ever .
What makes this rather sad situation even more pathetic is the fact that neither MI5 nor MI6 are shining examples of competence .
MI6 , as is well known , either failed to establish , or did not deem fit to disclose , the fact that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction , and MI5 failed to prevent the 7 July 2005 suicide bombings in London .
And these are just two examples .
The British people had better reflect on the dangers of idolizing or giving the benefit of doubt to their police , army and intelligence services .
If they do n't , sooner or later they will find themselves prisoners of what are supposed to be public servants .
Soldiers , policemen and spies will always use " national security " and " public safety " as excuses to escape public accountability and erode civil liberties and human rights .
Yet , ironically , the more they succeed in this the less able they become to do their jobs as their focus turns towards consolidating their position and enhancing their power domestically .
In this respect , the native Britons have a lot to learn from the Arab people , and they had better learn it fast before it is too late .
For decades , we have tolerated our military and security apparatuses ' violation of our rights and their consumption of ever growing proportions of our national wealth for the sake of higher national causes in which we all passionately believe .
But , whenever it came to the crunch , these apparatuses , whose one and only concern had become self - aggandizement , were completely useless , most recently during the Anglo - American aggression against Iraq .
As the late Edward Said bemoaned on the eve of that aggression ,
Tualatin Police announced Tuesday that Kim Osbrink , a decorated Marine 's wife , died Sunday night in her Tualatin home after her husband 's gun unintentionally discharged while he was practicing drawing it from his holster .
Officers arrived at the home of Kim and Ryan Osbrink at 10:30 p.m. to find the husband trying to revive his wife , according to Capt .
Jeff Groth of the Tualatin Police Department .
Medics then rushed her to OHSU , where she later died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen , police said .
Ryan Osbrink was practicing drawing his pistol when it discharged as his wife entered the room , striking her in the abdomen area , police said .
He 'd recently signed an employment offer with the Clark County Sheriff 's Office and his first day of employment was to be December 19 .
Osbrink 's hiring is delayed now , pending the outcome of a of the investigation .
Ryan Osbrink shot his wife with an H & K model USP , .45 - caliber semi-automatic pistol .
He had n't yet been issued any weapons from the Clark County Sheriff 's Office .
When police have finished their investigation of the shooting , they will forward their findings to the Washington County District Attorney 's Office for review .
Kim Osbrink - who managed a pet services company in West Linn - is described by friends as compassionate with a special love and skill with pets .
They 've started to comment on her death on her MySpace page .
She was reportedly very proud of her husband , Ryan Osbrink , a 24 - year - old decorated veteran of the Iraq war .
She says on her MySpace profile that she 's been happily married for three years and calls him her hero " for everything he has done and everything he will do . "
Ryan Osbrink could not be reached for comment , but past media reports from Iraq featured him ducking sniper fire and fighting along with his fellow soldiers .
In June 2006 , Ryan Osbrink was awarded a Bronze Star for " courageous actions " in the line of duty when he braved fire to aid an injured Iraqi soldier .
Friends said he 'd recently been promoted from corporal to sergeant .

Stride Gum has joined with the videogaming community in its most noble pursuit : stopping Uwe Boll before he directs again .
The ridiculously long - lasting gum has apparently decided to help Boll along on his way to promised retirement by offering a coupon for a free pack of gum to everyone who signs the Stop Uwe Boll petition if it reaches its target of one million signatures .
In April , Boll was reported by Slashfilm as saying he would stop making movies if he was presented with a million - signature petition asking him to do so .
" Since gamers are one of our most supportive groups , we 've been looking for ways to return the favor , " said Gary Osifchin , North American marketing director for Stride .
" And what better way is there to get gamers ' backs than by helping them rescue their cherished videogames from the clutches of Uwe Boll ? "
The only catch , according to a report by 1 Up , is that the petition has to hit the million signature mark by May 14 in order to get the free gum .
The petition has only achieved 250,000 signatures thus far , leaving the free gum odds a bit long , but if the petition does reach its goal , Stride promises to issue coupons redeemable on May 23 , the release day of Postal , Boll 's latest movie .
LEXINGTON , Ky. ( May 15 , 2008 ) − Teenage girls of all ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds still experience sexism and sexual harassment - but cultural factors may control whether they perceive sexism as an environmental problem or as evidence of their own shortcomings .
A study of 600 girls between the ages of 12 and 18 , from California and Georgia , included young women who identified as Latina ( 49 percent ) , White ( 23 percent ) , African - American ( 9 percent ) , Asian American ( 7.5 percent ) and multi-ethnic or other ( 7.5 percent ) was conducted by researchers Christia Brown , assistant professor , Department of Psychology , University of Kentucky College of Arts and Sciences , and Campbell Leaper , professor , Department of Psychology , University of California Santa Cruz .
Participants were asked about experiences with sexual harassment and any discouraging comments they received in traditionally male - dominated areas such as math , science , computers and sports .
Ninety percent of girls reported experiencing sexual harassment at least once .
Specifically , 67 percent of girls reported receiving unwanted romantic attention , 62 percent were exposed to demeaning gender - related comments , 58 percent were teased because of their appearance , 52 percent received unwanted physical contact and 25 percent were bullied or threatened with harm by a male .
52 percent of girls also reported receiving discouraging gender - based comments on the math , science and computer abilities , usually from male peers , and 76 percent of girls reported sexist comments on their athletic abilities , again predominantly from male peers .
The researchers found that girls have different levels of understanding of sexism and sexual harassment , which may affect reporting data .
Older girls and those from a lower socioeconomic background reported more sexism than did their peers .
Latin and Asian American girls reported less sexual harassment than did girls of other ethnic groups .
Girls who had been exposed to feminist ideas , either through the media or an adult such as a mother or teacher , were more likely to identify and report sexist behavior than were girls who had no information about feminism .
Girls who reported feeling pressure from their parents to conform to gender stereotypes were also more likely to perceive sexism .
Girls who felt atypical for their gender and / or were unhappy with stereotypical gender roles were most likely to report sexism and harassment .
Brown and Leaper note that it is important for girls to be able to identify sexism and sexual harassment as environmental factors , lest they attribute negative experiences to their own faults and suffer erosion of self - esteem .
Frequent sexual harassment may lead girls to expect and accept demeaning behaviors in heterosexual romantic relationships , and sexist remarks .

Kenneth Richey smiles after being released from the Putnam County jail in Ottawa , Ohio , January 7 , 2008 .
Richey is due to return to UK on Tuesday .
REUTERS / Dave Zapotosky / The Blade / Handout
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - A British man who came close to being executed by the state of Ohio for killing a 2 - year - old girl was set free under a plea deal on Monday , with plans to return to his home in Scotland , authorities said .
Kenneth Richey , 43 , had his sentence reduced to time served since being sent to death row for setting a 1986 fire that killed Cynthia Collins , a Putnam County court official said .
Richey had been asked by the toddler ’s mother to look after the girl while she went out after a night of heavy drinking and marijuana smoking in their Columbus Grove , Ohio , apartment house .
Richey denied setting the fire and the controversial case became a cause celebre across Europe , which does not have capital punishment .
He was readied for execution in 1994 but was granted a last - minute stay .
An appeals court overturned his conviction in August , saying Richey received inadequate legal representation amid several doubtful pieces of evidence .
Richey agreed to plead no contest to attempted involuntary manslaughter , child endangering and breaking and entering , giving him his freedom but with the stipulation that he leave the United States .
In pleading no contest , the defendant concedes the charges alleged without admitting guilt .
Originally , prosecutors said Richey had set the fire to get back at a former girlfriend who was asleep with another man in the apartment below .
Richey was supposed to have been freed three weeks ago in time to spend Christmas with his mother in Edinburgh , but his hearing was delayed when he suffered heart problems .
( CNN ) -- Skybus Airlines announced Friday it is shutting down its passenger flights -- becoming the third airline this week to cease operations .
Skybus Airlines joins ATA and Aloha Airlines , which announced shutdowns earlier this week .
The low - cost carrier could n't overcome " the combination of rising jet fuel costs and a slowing economic environment , " the company said Friday .
" These two issues proved to be insurmountable for a new carrier . "
Skybus , an Ohio - based airline founded in 2004 , will cease operations effective Saturday .
Earlier in the week , ATA Airlines and Aloha Airlines announced they would shut down flights as both companies work through bankruptcy filings .
ATA , an Indiana - based low - cost charter airline , filed for Chapter 11 status Wednesday as a result of financial problems " following the loss of a key contract for our military charter business , " the company said .
The company started operation in 1973 .
Hawaii - based Aloha Airlines announced Sunday it would shut down its passenger operations this week after filing for bankruptcy protections last month , concluding 61 years of service .
In its bankruptcy filing , Aloha said it was unable to generate enough revenue from its inter-island passenger flights because of below - cost fares by competitors Mesa Air Group 's go ! airline .
The company said it was forced to match the competitor 's fares during an unprecedented increase in the cost of jet fuel .
Skybus said all flights Friday would be completed ; passengers with reservations for Saturday and beyond were told to seek refunds from their credit card companies .

Australia has increased its share of the seabed by 2.5 million sq km , after the UN agreed an extension .
Its continental shelf will be extended by five times the size of France , giving it rights to explore new areas for oil and gas .
Australia had worked for 15 years on the claim .
Some of the new areas lie beside Antarctic territories , but the resources minister said there would be no exploration of Antarctic waters .
Potential bonanza
" I am pleased to announce that Australia , the largest island in the world , has just been dramatically increased in size , " said the resources minister , Martin Ferguson .
He said the new territory was 10 times the size of New Zealand and 20 times the size of the UK .
The minister said he could not put a figure on the potential oil and gas reserves contained in the areas .
" The truth of the matter is that they have been hardly explored , " he said .
" This is potentially a bonanza .
We have got unknown capacity up there . "
Mr Ferguson said it was important that Australia got on with exploration , because it was not rich in oil .
Australia 's continental shelf is being extended beyond the 200 nautical mile limit , in parts of the west , south and east , and also beside the Antarctic territories of Macquarie and Heard islands .
The claim was made under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea .
Washington , D.C. -
This morning the House of Representatives passed a compromise surveillance bill that does not include retroactive immunity for phone companies alleged to have assisted in the NSA 's warrantless wiretapping program .
The bill would allow lawsuits like the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's case against AT&T to proceed while providing specific security procedures allowing the telecom giants to defend themselves in court .
The House bill succeeded 213 to 197 despite the president 's threat to veto any bill that does not include immunity .
" We applaud the House for refusing to grant amnesty to lawbreaking telecoms , and for passing a bill that would allow our lawsuit against AT&T to proceed fairly and securely , " said Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston .
" Amnesty proponents have been claiming on the Hill for months that phone companies like AT&T had a good faith belief that the NSA program was legal .
Under this bill , the companies could do what they should have been able to do all along : tell that story to a judge . "
The Senate is expected to consider the House bill when it returns from recess on Monday , March 31 .
House and Senate staff are expected to spend much of the break negotiating over differences between the new House bill and a previous Senate bill that includes immunity provisions .
" This newly - passed House bill represents a true compromise on the amnesty issue : customers whose privacy was violated would get their day in court , while the companies would be allowed to defend themselves despite the Administration 's broad demands for secrecy , " said EFF Legal Director Cindy Cohn .
" We look forward to assisting the Senate in its consideration of this compromise solution , which EFF believes is the only reasonable response to the White House 's attempt to evade court review of its illegal spying program and the phone companies ' collaboration in it . "
EFF represents the plaintiffs in Hepting v. AT&T , a class - action lawsuit brought by AT&T customers accusing the telecommunications company of violating their rights by illegally assisting the National Security Agency in widespread domestic surveillance .
The Hepting case is the leading case aimed at holding telecoms responsible for knowingly violating federal privacy laws with warrantless wiretapping and the illegal transfer of vast amounts of personal data to the government .

In our Behind the Scenes series , CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events .
CNN's Michael Ware covers the Iraq war .
CNN 's Michael
Ware says the Quran incident could have become a crisis .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
What the Iraqi fighter found threatened America 's vital alliance with Sunni militia .
A week ago in a police station shooting range on Baghdad 's western outskirts , the American - allied Iraqi militiaman found what one or more GIs had been using for target practice -- a copy of the Quran , Islam 's holy book .
Riddled with bullets , the rounds piercing deep into the thick volume , the pages were shredded .
Turning the holy book in his hands , the man found two handwritten English words , scrawled in pen .
" F*** yeah . "
The discovery was incendiary .
It was an affront to Islam and a serious challenge to the religious credentials of the U.S - allied militias , or Awakening Councils , who turned on al - Qaeda and are now on the U.S. government payroll .
Watch villagers protest the incident »
Largely moderate Sunnis , the American - backed militias face constant accusations from Islamic groups that they have turned against Islam to support the cause of the infidels , or nonbelievers .
If this indignity had gone unanswered , the Islamists ' case would have been won .
Abdullah , the militiaman who found the defaced Quran , complained to his superiors .
Soon , there was outrage among the tribes and population of Radhwaniya , a semi-rural area long home to loyalists of the former regime of Saddam Hussein .
Word of what the Americans had done rippled throughout the district and the fury spread .
Honor was at stake , and the urge for a violent response against the insult was strong .
However , tribal leaders made an approach to American commanders in the region .
" Honestly , we have to defend our religion , " said Sheikh Saad al - Falahi , " and relations [ with the U.S. ] would deteriorate if they did not apologize . "
Do n't Miss Soldier uses Quran for target practice
Having fought and then negotiated so hard and for so long to quiet the insurgency in Radhwaniya , American commanders were wary of the potential crisis .
The U.S. 4th Infantry Division is posted in Baghdad and surrounds ; many of its commanders and soldiers are veterans of the Iraq campaign .
Col .
Ted Martin , commander of the Division 's 1st Brigade , immediately launched an investigation , promising the tribal leaders a swift outcome .
Investigators soon identified the Army section that had been at the police station 's small arms range , and a staff sergeant , a sniper section leader from the 64th Armor Regiment , was the primary suspect .
After denying involvement , the sergeant eventually confessed , though he claimed he had no idea the book used for target practice was a Quran .
Martin dismissed the excuse .
On Saturday , about a week after the incident ( locals say the shooting practice was on May 9 , U.S. forces say the Quran was discovered May 11 ) , CNN was present for the showdown in Radwaniyeh as the Americans faced the tribes .
U.S. commanders arrived at a police outpost in heavily armored vehicles to be met by a human tempest ; hundreds of chanting tribesmen lined up behind razor wire , offering their blood and souls in sacrifice for the Quran .
A former college quarterback , Maj. Gen. Jeffery Hammond , commander of the 4th Infantry Division , stood facing the angry crowd .
His face was grim and fixed as tribal sheikhs swirled around him .
" I am a man of honor , I am a man of character .
You have my word , this will never happen again , " the general told the angry crowd through loudspeakers , pounding the makeshift podium three times with his fist .
" In the most humble manner , I look in to your eyes today and I say , please forgive me and my soldiers . "
The act of his sniper was criminal , he said .
" I 've come to this land to protect you , to support you ... this soldier has lost the honor to serve the United States Army and the people of Iraq here in Baghdad . "
Martin stood before the crowd next , opening his address with an Islamic blessing .
He announced the sergeant had been relieved of duty with prejudice ; reprimanded by the commanding general with a memorandum of record attached to his military record ; dismissed from the regiment and redeployed from the brigade .
Holding a new Quran in his hands , he turned to the crowd .
" I hope that you 'll accept this humble gift . "
Martin kissed the Quran and touched it to his forehead as he handed it to the tribal elders .
The crowd 's voice rose , " Yes , yes , to the Quran .
No , no , to the devil . "
But would it be enough to appease the mood in Radhwaniya ?
A local sheikh came to the microphone .
" In the name of all the sheikhs , " he said , " we declare we accept the apology that was submitted . "
With hands shaken and sheepish thank - yous made , the general and the colonel returned to their armored convoy .
The crisis , it seems , was averted .
The stakes , though , had been high .
If accord had not been found , says Sheikh Ayad Abd al - Jabbar , head of the local Support Council , it could have been dire .
" Then surely the situation would have changed in another direction and more tension will have risen up , after all the cooperation with the Americans to restore security . "

ORIGINAL SIN ACCORDING TO ST .
PAUL
© John S. Romanides
[ This article originally appeared in the St. Vladimir 's Seminary Quarterly , Vol. IV , Nos. 1 and 2 , 1955 - 6 . ]
TABLE OF CONTENTS
In regard to the doctrine of original sin as contained in the Old Testament and illumnated by the unique revelation of Christ in the New Testament , there continues to reign in the denominations of the West -- especially since the development of scholastic presuppositions -- a great confusion , which in the last few centuries seems to have gained much ground in the theological problematics of the Orthodox East .
In some circles this problem has been dressed in a halo of mystifying vagueness to such an extent that even some Orthodox theologians seem to expect one to accept the doctrine of original sin simply as a great and profound mystery of faith ( e.g. , Androutsos , Dogmatike , pp. 161-162 ) .
This has certainly become a paradoxical attitude , especially since these Christians who cannot point their fingers at this enemy of mankind are the same people who illogically claim that in Christ there is remission of this unknown original sin .
This is a far cry from the certitude of St. Paul , who , of the devil himself , claimed that " we are not ignorant of his thoughts " ( noemata ) . [ 1 ]
If one is to vigorously and consistently maintain that Jesus Christ is the unique Savior Who has brought salvation to a world in need of salvation , one obviously must know what is the nature of the need which provoked this salvation . [
2 ]
It would , indeed , seem foolish to have medical doctors trained to heal sickness if there were no such thing as sickness in the world .
Likewise , a savior who claims to save people in need of no salvation is a savior only unto himself .
Undoubtedly , one of the most important causes of heresy is the failure to understand the exact nature of the human situation described by the Old and New Testaments , to which the historical events of the birth , teachings , death , resurrection and second coming of Christ are the only remedy .
The failure to understand this automatically implies a perverted understanding of what it is that Christ did and continues to do for us , and what our subsequent relation is to Christ and neighbor within the realm of salvation .
The importance of a correct definition of original sin and its consequences can never be exaggerated .
Any attempt to minimize its importance or alter its significance automatically entails either a weakening or even a complete misunderstanding of the nature of the Church , sacraments and human destiny .
The temptation facing every inquiry into the thought of St. Paul and the other Apostolic writers is to approach their writings with definite , although many times unconscious , presuppositions contrary to the Biblical witness .
If one approaches the Biblical testimony to the work of Christ and the life of the primitive community with predetermined metaphysical notions concerning the moral structure of what most would call the natural world , and , by consequence , with fixed ideas concerning human destiny and the needs of hte individual and humanity in general , he will undoubtedly take from the faith and life of the ancient Church only such aspects as fit his own frame of reference .
Then , if he wishes to be consistent in representing his own interpretation of the Scriptures as authentic , he will necessarily proceed to exaplain away everything extraneous to his concepts as secondary and superficial , or simply as the product of some misunderstanding on the part of certain Apostles or a group of Fathers , or even the whole primitive Church in general .
A proper approach to the New Testament teaching of St. Paul concerning original sin cannot be one - sided .
It is incorrect , for example , to emphasize , in Romans 5:12 , the phrase , eph 'ho pantes hemarton , by trying to make it fit any certain system of thought concerning moral law and guilt without first establishing the importance of St. Paul 's beliefs concerning the powers of Satan and the true situation not only of man , but of all creation .
It is also wrong to deal with the problem of the transmission of original sin within the framework of dualistic anthropology while at the same time completely ignoring the Hebraic foundations of St. Paul 's anthropology .
Likewise , and attempt to interpret the Biblical doctrine of the fall in terms of a hedonistic philosophy of happiness is already doomed to failure because of its refusal to recognize not only the abnormality but , more important , the consequences of death and corruption .
A correct approach to the Pauline doctrine of original sin must take into consideration St. Paul 's understanding of ( 1 ) the fallen state of creation , including the powers of Satan , death and corruption , ( 2 ) the justice of God and law , and ( 3 ) anthropology and the destiny of man and creation .
These divisions are not meant to suggest that each topic is to be dealt with here in detail ; rather , they shall be discussed only in the light of the main problem of original sin and its transmission according to St. Paul .
I. Fallen Creation
St. Paul strongly affirms the belief that all things created by God are good . [
3 ] Yet , at the same time , he insists on the fact that not only man , [ 4 ] but also all of creation has fallen . [
5 ] Both man and creation are awaiting the final redemption . [ 6 ]
Thus , in spite of the fact that all things created by God are good , the devil has temporarily [ 7 ] become the " god of this age . " [ 8 ] A basic presupposition of St. Paul 's thought is that althought the world was created by God and as such is good , yet now there rules in it the power of Satan .
The devil , however , is by no means absolute , since God has never abandoned His creation . [ 9 ]
Thus , according to St. Paul , creation as it is is not what God intended it to be --" For the creature was made subject to vanity ... by reason of him who hath subjected the same . " [
10 ] Therefore , evil can exist , at least temporarily , as a parasitic element alongside and inside of that which God created originally good .
A good example of this is one who would do the Good according to the " inner man , " but finds it impossible because of the indwelling power of sin in the flesh . [
11 ] Although created good and still maintained and governed by God , creation as it is is still far from being normal or natural , if by " normal " we understand nature according to the original and final destiny of creation .
governing this age , in spite of the fact that God Himself is still sustaining creation and creating for Himself a remnant , [ 12 ] is the devil himself . [
13 ]
To try to read into St. Paul 's thought any type of philosophy of a naturally well balanced universe with inherent and fixed moral laws of reason , according to which men can live with peace of mind and be happy , is to do violence to the apostle 's faith .
For St. Paul , there is now no such thing as a natural world with an inherent system of moral laws , because all of creation has been subjected to the vanity and evil power of Satan , who is ruling by the powers of death and corruption . [
14 ]
For this reason all men have become sinners . [ 15 ]
There is no such thing as a man who is sinless simply because he is living according to the rules of reason or the Mosaic law . [
16 ]
The possibility of living according to universal reason entails , also , the possibility of being without sin .
But for Paul this is a myth , because Satan is no respecter of reasonable rules of good conduct [ 17 ] and has under his influence all men born under the power of death and corruption . [
18 ]
Whether or not belief in the present , real and active power of Satan appeals to the Biblical theologian , he cannot ignore the importance that St. Paul attributes to the power of the devil .
To do so is to completely misunderstand the problem of original sin and its transmission and so misinterpret the mind of the New Testament writers and the faith of the whole ancient Church .
In regard to the power of Satan to introduce sin into the life of every man , St. Augustine in combating Pelagianism obviously misread St. Paul .
by relegating the power of Satan , death , and corruption to the background and pushing to the foreground of controversy the problem of personal guilt in the transmission of original sin , St. Augustine introduced a false moralistic philosophical approach which is foreign to the thinking of St. Paul [ 19 ] and which was not accepted by the patristic tradition of the East . [ 20 ]
For St. Paul , Satan is not simply a negative power in the universe .
He is personal with will , [ 21 ] with thoughts , [ 22 ] and with methods of deception , [ 23 ] against whom Christians must wage and intense battle [ 24 ] because they can still be tempted by him . [ 25 ]
He is active in a dynamic manner , [ 26 ] fighting for the destruction of creation and not simply waiting passively in a restricted corner to accept those who happen to rationally decide not to follow God and the moral laws inherent in a natural universe .
Satan is even capable of transforming himself into an angel of light [ 27 ] .
He has at his disposal miraculous powers of perversion [ 28 ] and has as co-workers whole armies of invisible powers . [
29 ]
He is the " god of this age , " [ 30 ] the one who deceived the first woman . [
31 ]
It is he who led man [ 32 ] and all of creation into the path of death and corruption . [ 33 ]
The power of death and corruption , according to Paul , is not negative , but on the contrary , positively active .
" The sting of death is sin , " [ 34 ] which in turn reigns in death . [
35 ]
Not only man , but all creation has been yoked under its tyrannizing power [ 36 ] and is now awaiting redemption .
Creation itself shall also be delivered from the slavery of corruption . [
37 ] Along with the final destruction of all the enemies of God , death -- the last and probably the greatest enemy -- will be destroyed . [
38 ] Then death will be swallowed up in victory . [
39 ] For St. Paul , the destruction of death is parallel to the destruction of the devil and his forces .
Salvation from the one is salvation from the other . [ 40 ]
It is obvious from St. Paul 's expressions concerning fallen creation , Satan , and death , that there is no room in his thinking for any type of metaphysical dualism , of departmentalization which would make of this world and intermediary domain which for man is merely a stepping stone leading either into the presence of God or into the kingdom of Satan .
The idea of a three story universe , whereby God and His company of saints and angels occupy the top floor , the devil the basement , and man in the flesh the middle , has no room in Pauline theology .
For Paul , all three orders of existence interpenetrate .
There is no such thing as a middle world of neutrality where man can live according to natural law and then be judged for a life of happiness in the presence of God or for a life of torment in the pits of outer darkness .
On the contrary , all of creation is the domain of God , Who Himself can not be tainted with evil .
But in
His domain there are other wills which He has created , which can choose either the kingdom of God or the kingdom of death and destruction .
In spite of the fact that creation is of God and essentially good , the devil at the same time has parasitically transformed this same creation of God into a temporary kingdom for himself . [
41 ]
The devil , death , and sin are reigning in this world and not in another .
Both the kingdom of darkness and kingdom of light are battling hand to hand in the same place .
For this reason , the only true victory possible over the devil is the resurrection of the dead . [
42 ]
There is no escape from the battlefield .
The only choice possible for every man is either to fight the devil by actively sharing in the victory of Christ , or to accept the deceptions of the devil by wanting to believe that all goes well and everything is normal . [
43 ]
II .
The Justice of God and Law
It is obvious , according to what has been said about St. Paul 's views concerning the non-dualistic nature of fallen creation , that for Paul there cannot exist any system of moral laws inherent in a natural and normal universe .
Therefore , what man accepts as just and good according to his observations of human relationships within society and nature cannot be confused with the justice of God .
The justice of God has been revealed uniquely and fully only in Christ . [
44 ]
No man has the right to substitute his own conception of justice for that of God . [ 45 ]
The justice of God as revealed in Christ does not operate according to objective rules of conduct , [ 46 ] but rather according to the personal relationships of faith and love . [
47 ] " The law is not made for a just man , but for the lawless and disobedient , for the ungodly and for sinners ... " [
48 ]
Yet the law is not evil , but good [ 49 ] and even spiritual . [
50 ] However , it is not enough .
It is of a temporary and pedagogical nature , [ 51 ] and in Christ must be fulfilled [ 52 ] and surpassed by personalistic love , according to the image of God 's love as revealed in Christ . [
53 ] Faith and love in Christ must be personal .
for this reason , faith without love is empty .
" Though I have all faith , so that I could remove mountains , and have not love , I am nothing . " [
54 ] Likewise , acts of faith bereft of love are of no avail .
" Though I bestow all my goods and though I give my body to be burned , and have not love , it profiteth me nothing . " [
55 ]
There is no life in the following of objective rules .
If there were such a possibility of receiving life by living according to law , there would be no need of redemption in Christ .
" Righteousness should have been by the law . " [
56 ]
If a " law was given capable of giving life " [ 57 ] then salvation , and not a promise , was bestowed upon Abraham . [
58 ]
But life does not exist in the law .
It is rather of essence of God , " Who alone hath immortality . " [
59 ] Only God can bestow life and this
He does freely , according to his own will , [ 60 ] in His own way , and at the time of His own choosing . [
61 ]
On the other hand , it is a grave mistake to make the justice of God responsible for death and corruption .
Nowhere does Paul attribute the beginnings of death and corruption to God .
On the contrary , nature was subjected to vanity and corruption by the devil , [ 62 ] who through the sin and death of the first man managed to lodge himself parasitically within creation , of which he was already a part but at first not yet its tyrant .
For Paul , the transgression of the first man opened the way for the entrance of death into the world , [ 63 ] but this enemy [ 64 ] is certainly not the finished product of God .
Neither can the death of Adam , or even of each man , be considered the outcome of any decision of God to punish . [
65 ] St. Paul never suggests such an idea .
To get at the basic presuppositions of Biblical thinking , one must abandon any juridical scheme of human justice which demands punishment and rewards according to objective rules of morality .
To approach the problem of original sin in such a naive manner as to say that tout lecteur sense concilura qu'une penalite commune implique une offense commune , and that thus all share in the guilt of Adam , [ 66 ] is to ignore the true nature of the justice of God and deny and real power to the devil .
The relationships which exist among God , man and the devil are not according to rules and regulations , but according to personalistic freedom .
The fact that there are laws forbidding one from killing his neighbor does not imply the impossibility of killing not only one , but hundreds of thousands of neighbors .
If man can disregard rules and regulations of good conduct , certainly the devil cannot be expected to follow such rules if he can help it .
St. Paul 's version of the devil is certainly not that of one who is simply obeying general rules of nature and carrying out the will of God by punishing souls in hell .
Quite on the contrary , he is fighting God dynamically by means of all possible deception , trying by all his cunning and power to destroy the works of God . [
67 ]
Thus salvation for man and creation cannot come by a simple act of forgiveness of any juridical imputation of sin , nor can it come by any payment of satisfaction to the devil ( Origen ) or to God ( Rome ) .
Salvation can come only by the destruction of the devil and his power . [
68 ]
Thus , according to St. Paul , it is God Himself
Who has destroyed " principalities and powers " by nailing the handwriting in ordinances , which was against us , to the cross of Christ . [
69 ] " God was in Christ , reconciling the world to Himself , not imputing to them their offences . " [
70 ] although we were in sin , God did not hold this against us , but has declared His own justice to those who believe in Christ . [
71 ]
The justice of God is not according to that of men , which operates by the law of works . [
72 ] For St. Paul , the justice of God and the love of God are not to be separated for the sake of any juridical doctrine of atonement .
The justice of God and the love of God as revealed in Christ are the same thing .
In Romans 3:21 - 26 , for example , the expression , " love of God , " could very easily be substituted for the " justice of God . "
It is interesting to note that every time St. Paul speaks about the wrath of God it is always that which is revealed to those who have become hopelessly enslaved , by their own choosing , to the flesh and the devil . [
73 ]
Although creation is held captive in corruption , those without the law are without excuse in worshipping and living falsely , because " the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even His eternal power and Godhead [ 74 ] --" Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the desires of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves ... " [ 75 ] and again , " God gave them over to reprobate mind . " [
76 ]
This does not mean that god caused them to become what they are , but rather that He gave them up as being completely lost to corruption and the power of the devil .
One must also interpret other similar passages in like manner . [
77 ]
This giving up by God of people who have already become hardened in their hearts against
His works is not restricted to the gentiles , but extends , also , to Jews . [
78 ] " For not the hearers of the law are just before God , but the doers of the law shall be justified . " [
79 ] And , " For as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law . " [
80 ]
The gentiles , however , even though they are not under the Mosaic law , are not excused from the responsibility of personal sin , for they , " having not the law , are a law unto themselves , who shew the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience also bearing witness , and amongst themselves accusing or else excusing their thoughts . " [
81 ]
At the last judgment , all men , whether under the law or not , whether hearers of Christ or not , shall be judged by Christ according to the Gospel as preached by Paul , [ 82 ] and not according to any system of natural laws .
Even though the invisible things of God " from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even His eternal power and Godhead , " there is still no such thing as moral law inherent in the universe .
The gentiles who " have not the law " but who " do by nature the things contained in the law " are not abiding by any natural system of moral laws in the universe .
They rather " shew the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience also bearing witness . "
Here , again , one sees Paul 's conception of personal relationships between God and man .
" God hath shewed it unto them , [ 83 ] and it is God Who is still speaking to fallen man outside of the law , through the conscience and in the heart , which for Paul is the center of man 's thoughts , [ 84 ] and for members of the body of Christ the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit [ 85 ] and Christ . [ 86 ]
III .
The Destiny of Man and Anthropology
Before making any attempt to determine the meaning of original sin according to what has been said thus far , it is necessary to examine St. Paul 's conception of the destiny of man and his anthropology .
[ Return ] ( a ) The Destiny of Man
It would be nonsense to try to read into Paul 's theology a conception of human destiny which accepts the aspirations and desires of what one would call " natural man " as normal .
It is normal for natural man to seek security and happiness in the acquisition and possession of objective goods .
The scholastic theologians of the West have often used these aspirations of natural man as proof that he is instinctively seeking after the Absolute , the possession of which is the only possible state of complete happiness , that is , a state wherein it is impossible to desire anything more because nothing better exists .
This hedonistic type of approach to human destiny is , of course , possible only for those who accept death and corruption either as normal or , at most , as the outcome of a decision of God to punish .
If those who accept God as the ultimate source of death were to really attribute sin to the powers of corruption , they would in effect be making God Himself the source of sin and evil .
For St. Paul , there is no such thing as normality for those who have not put on Christ .
The destiny of man and creation cannot be deducted from observations of the life of fallen man and creation .
Nowhere does Paul call on Christians to live a life of security and happiness according to the ways of this world .
On the contrary , he calls on Christians to die to this world and the body of sin , [ 87 ] and even to suffer in the Gospel , according to the power of God . [
88 ] Paul claims that " all who want to live godly lives in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted . " [
89 ]
This is hardly the language of one who is seeking security and happiness . [
90 ] Nor is it possible to suppose that for Paul such sufferings without love could be considered as the means to reach one 's destiny .
This would fall under the category of payment for works and not eh personal relationships of faith and love . [ 91 ]
St . Paul does not believe that human destiny consists simply in becoming conformed to the rules and regulations of nature , which supposedly remain unchanged from the beginning of time .
The relationship of the Divine Will to human wills is not one of juridical or hedonistic submission of the one to the other ( as St. Augustine and the scholastics thought ) , but rather one of personal love .
St. Paul claims that " we are co-workers of God . " [
92 ]
Our relationship of love with God is such that in Christ there is now no longer need for law .
" If ye be led by the Spirit ye are not under the law . " [
93 ]
The members of the body of Christ are not called on to live on the level of impersonal ordinances , but are now expected to live according to the love of God as revealed in Christ , which needs no laws because it seeks not its own , [ 94 ] but strives to empty itself for others in the image of the love of Christ . [ 95 ]
The love and justice of God have been revealed once and for all in Christ [ 96 ] by the destruction of the devil [ 97 ] and the deliverance of man from the body of death and sin , [ 98 ] so that man may actually become an imitator of God Himself , [ 99 ]
Who has predestined His elect to become " conformed to the image of His Son , " [ 100 ] who did nothing to please Himself but suffered for others . [
101 ] Christ died so that the living should no longer live unto themselves , [ 102 ] but should become perfect men , even " unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ . " [
103 ] Christians are no longer to live according to the rudiments of this world , as though living in this world , [ 104 ] but are to have the same mind as Christ , [ 105 ] so that in Christ they may become perfect . [
106 ] Men are no longer to love their wives according to the world , but must love their wives exactly " as Christ loved the Church and gave Himself for it . " [
107 ]
The destiny of man is not happiness and self - satisfaction , [ 108 ] but rather perfection in Christ .
Man must become perfect , as God [ 109 ] and Christ are perfect . [
110 ] such perfection can come only through the personalistic power of divine and selfless love , [ 111 ] " which is the bond of perfection . " [
112 ]
This love is not to be confused with the love of fallen man who seeks his own . [
113 ] Love in Christ does not seek its own , but that of the other . [
114 ]
To become perfect according to the image of Christ is not restricted to the realm of love , but forms and inseparable part of the salvation of the total man and creation alike .
Man 's body of humility will be transformed to become " conformed " to Christ 's " body of glory . " [
115 ] man is destined to become , like Christ , perfect according to the body also .
" He Who raised Christ from the dead shall bring to life also your mortal bodies by His Spirit which dwells in you . " [
116 ]
St. Paul claims that death is the enemy [ 117 ] which came into the world and passed unto all men through the sin of one man . [
118 ] not only many , but all of creation became subject to corruption . [
119 ]
The subjugation of man and creation to the power of the devil and death was obviously a temporary frustration of the original destiny of man and creation .
It is false to read into Paul 's statements about the first and second Adams the idea that Adam would have died even though he had not sinned , simply because the first Adam was made eis psychen zosan -- which expression , according to St. Paul 's usage within the context , clearly means mortal . [
120 ] Adam could very well have been created not naturally immortal , but if he had not sinned there is no reason to believe that he would not have become immortal by nature . [
121 ]
This is certainly implied by the extraordinary powers St. Paul attributes to death and corruption .
[ Return ] ( b ) Anthropology of St. Paul
as we have said , for St. Paul , the law is good [ 122 ] and even spiritual . [
123 ] According to the " inner man " this is obvious . [
124 ]
But in spite of the fact that he can possess the will to do good according to the law he cannot find the power to do the good [ 125 ] because he is " carnal and sold under sin . " [
126 ]
If he himself , according to the " inner man , " wants to do good but cannot , it is no longer he who does the evil , but sin that dwelleth in him . [
127 ]
So he asks , " O wretched man that I am ! who will deliver me from the body of this death ? " [
128 ]
To be delivered from the " body of this death " is to be saved from the power of sin dwelling in the flesh .
Thus , " the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has liberated me from the law of sin and death . " [
129 ]
It is misleading to try to interpret this section [ 130 ] of Paul according to a dualistic anthropology , which would make the term , sarkikos , refer only to the lower appetites of the body -- and especially of the sexual desires -- to the exclusion of the soul .
The word , sarkikos , is not used by Paul in such a context .
Elsewhere , St. Paul reminds married people that they have not authority over their own bodies and so should not deprive one another , " unless it be with consent for a time that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer , and come together again that Satan may not tempt you for your incontinency . [
131 ] [ 132 ]
To the Corinthians he declare that they are an epistle written not with ink , " but with the spirit of the living God , not in tables of stone , but in fleshly tables of the heart - - en plaxi kardias sarkinais . " [
133 ] Christ was known according to the flesh [ 134 ] and " God was manifested in the flesh . " [
135 ] St. Paul asks whether , if he has planted spiritual things amongst the Corinthians , it is such a great thing if he shall reap the sarkika [ 136 ] .
Nowhere does he use the adjective , sarkikos , exclusively in reference to the sexual , or what is commonly called the desires of the flesh in contrast to those of the soul .
It seems that St. Paul attributes a positive power of sin to the sarx as such only in the epistle to the Galatians , who , having begun int he Spirit , now think that they are being perfected in the flesh . [
137 ]
The sarx here has a will which desires against the pneuma . [
138 ] " The works of the flesh are manifest , which a re these ; adultery , fornication , uncleanliness , lasciviousness , idolatry , witchcraft , hatred , variance , emulations , wrath , strife , seditions , heresies , envyings , murders , drunkenness , revellings and such like . " [
139 ]
Most of these works of the sarkos would require the very active , and even initiative , participation of the intellect , which here is an indication that the sarx , for Paul , is much more than what any dualistic anthropology would be ready to admit .
The flesh as such , however , as a positive force of sin , found over - emphasized in Galatians , where Paul is infuriated over the foolishness of his readers , [ 140 ] cannot be isolated from other references , where sin parasitically dwells in the flesh [ 141 ] and where the flesh itself is not only not evil , [ 142 ] but that in which God Himself has been manifested . [
143 ]
The flesh as such is not evil , but has become very much weakened by sin and the enmity which dwells in it . [
144 ]
To understand St. Paul 's anthropology , it is necessary to refer not to the dualistic anthropology of the Greek , s who made a clear cut distinction between soul and body , but rather to the Hebraic frame of references , in which sarx and psyche ( flesh and soul ) both denote the whole living person and not any part of him . [
145 ] Thus , in the Old Testament the expression , pasa sarx ( all flesh ) , is employed for all living things , [ 146 ] as well as for man in particular . [
147 ]
The expression , pasa psyche ( all souls ) , is used in the same manner . [
148 ]
In the New Testament , both expressions , pasa sarx [ 149 ] and pasa psyche , [ 150 ] are used in perfect accord with the Old Testament context .
Thus we find that , for St. Paul , to be sarkikos [ 151 ] and psychikos [ 152 ] means exactly the same thing .
" Flesh and blood ( sarx kai haima ) cannot inherit the kingdom of God " [ 153 ] because corruption cannot inherit incorruption . [
154 ]
For this reason , a soma psychikon is " sown in corruption " and raised in incorruption ; it is sown in dishonor , it is raised in glory ; it is sown in weakness , it is raised in power . " [
155 ] " A soma psychikon is sown , and a soma pneumatikon is raised .
There is a soma psychikon and there is a soma pneumatikon ! " [
156 ] Both the sarkikon and the psychikon and dominated by death and corruption and so cannot inherit the kingdom of life .
This only the pneumatikon can do .
" However , the pneumatikon is not first , but the psychikon , and afterward the pneumatikon .
The first man is from the earth ; earthy ; the second man , the Lord , from heaven . " [
157 ]
That the first man became eis psychen zosan ( a living soul ) , for Paul , means exactly that he became psychikon , and therefore subject to corruption , [ 158 ] because " from the earth , earthy ... " [
159 ] Such expressions do not admit of any dualistic anthropology .
A soma psychikon " from the earth , earthy , " or a psyche zosa " from the earth , earthy , " would lead to impossible confusion if interpreted from the viewpoint of a dualism which distinguishes between the body and soul , the lower and the higher , the material and the purely spiritual .
What , then , would a psyche zosa be , which came from the earth and is earthy ?
In speaking of death , a dualist could never say that a soma psychikon is sown in corruption .
He would rather have to say that the soul leaves the body , which alone is sown in corruption .
Neither the psyche nor the pneuma is the intellectual part of man .
To quote I Corinthians 2:11 ( tis gar oiden anthropon ta tou anthropou ei me to pneuma tou anthropou to en auto ? ) or I Thessalonians 5:23 ( Autos o Theos tea eirenes hagiasai hymas holoteleis , kai holokleron hymon to pneuma kai he psyche kai to soma amemptos en te parousia toy K.H.I.X. teretheie ) does not prove otherwise .
One cannot take these expressions in isolation from the rest of Paul 's writings for the sake of trying to make him speak the language of even a Thomistic dualist , as is done , for example , by F. Prat in La Theologie de s.
Paul , t.2 , pp. 62-63 .
Elsewhere , in speaking against the practise of certain individuals ' praying publicly in unknown tongues , St. Paul says , " If I pray in an unknown tongue my pnuema prays , but my mind is unfruitful .
What is it then ?
I will pray with the pneuma and I will pray with the mind also . " [
160 ]
Here a sharp distinction is made between the pneuma and the nous ( mind ) .
Therefore , for St. Paul , the realm of pneuma does not belong within the category of human understanding .
It is of another dimension .
In order to express the idea of intellect or understanding all four evangelists use the word , kardia ( heart ) . [
161 ]
The word , nous ( mind ) , is used only once by St. Luke . [
162 ]
In contrast , St. Paul makes use of both kardia [ 163 ] and nous [ 164 ] to denote the faculty of intelligence .
Nous , however , cannot be taken for any such thing as the intellectual faculties of an immaterial soul .
Nous is rather synonymous with kardia , which in turn is synonymous with the eso anthropon .
The Holy Spirit is sent by God into the kardia , [ 165 ] or into the eso anthropon , [ 166 ] that Christ may dwell in the kardia . [
167 ] The kardia and the eso anthropon are the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit .
Man delights in the law of God according to the eso anthropon , but there is another law in his members which wars against he law of the nous . [
168 ]
Here the nous is clearly synonymous with the eso anthropon , which in turn is the kardia , the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit and Christ . [
169 ]
To walk in the vanity of the nous , with the dianoia darkened , being alienated from the life of God through ignorance , is a result of the " hardening of the heart - - dia ten perosin test kardias . " [
170 ]
It is the heart which is the seat of man 's free will , and it is here where man by his own choice either becomes blinded [ 171 ] and hardened , [ 172 ] or else enlightened in his understanding of the hope , glory , and power in Christ . [
173 ]
It is in the heart where the secrets of men are kept , [ 174 ] and it is Christ " Who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the heart . " [
175 ]
It would be absurd to interpret St. Paul 's use of the expressions , eso anthropon and nous , according to a dualistic anthropology by ignoring his use of the word , kardia , which is in perfect accord with the New Testament and Old Testament writers .
By using such words as nous and eso anthropon , Paul is certainly introducing new terminology , foreign to traditional Hebraic usage , but he is definitely not introducing any new anthropology based on Hellenistic dualism .
St. Paul never refers to either psyche or pneuma as faculties of human intelligence .
His anthropology is Hebraic and not Hellenistic .
In both the Old and New Testaments , one finds the expression , to pneuma tes zoes ( the spirit of life ) , but never to pneuma zon ( the living spirit ) . [
176 ]
Also , one finds psyche zosa ( the living soul ) , but never psyche tes zoes ( the soul of life ) . [
177 ]
This is due to the fact that the psyche , or sarx , lives only by participation , while the pneuma is itself the principle of life given to man as a gift from God , [ 178 ] " Who alone hath immortality . " [
179 ]
God gives man of His Own uncreated life without destroying the freedom of human personality .
Thus , man is not an intellectual form fashioned according to a predetermined essence or universal idea of man whose destiny is to become conformed to a state of mechanical contentment in the presence of God whereby his will become sterile and immobile in a state of complete self - satisfaction and happiness ( e.g. , according to the Neo-platonic teaching of St. Augustine and the Roman scholastics in general concerning human destiny ) .
The personality of man does not consist of an immaterial intellectual soul which has life of itself and uses the body simply as a dwelling place .
The sarx , or psyche , is the total man , and the kardia is the center of intelligence where the will has complete independence of choice to become either hardened to truth or receptive to divine enlightenment from without .
The pneuma of man is not the center of human personality , nor is it that faculty which rules the actions of men , but rather it is the spark of divine life given to man as his principle of life .
Thus , man can live according to the pneuma tes zoes or according to the law of the flesh , which is death and corruption .
The very personality of man , therefore , although created by God Himself , remains outside of the essence of God , a nd therefore completely free either to reject the act of creation , for which he was not consulted , or to accept the creative love of God by living according to the pneuma , given to him for this purpose by God .
" The mind of the flesh is death , but the mind of the spirit is life and peace . " [
180 ] Those who live according to the flesh shall die . [
181 ]
Those who mortify the deeds of the flesh by the spirit shall live . [
182 ]
The spirit of man , however , deprived of union with the vivifying spirit of God , is hopelessly weak against the flesh dominated by death and corruption [ 183 ] -- " Who shall deliver me from the body of this death . " [
184 ] And , " the law of the pneumatos tes zoes ( spirit of life ) in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death . " [
185 ]
Only those whose spirit has been renewed [ 186 ] by union with the Spirit of God [ 187 ] can fight the desires of the flesh .
Only those who are given the Spirit of God and hear Its voice in the life of the body of Christ are able to fight against sin .
" The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God . " [ 188 ]
Although the spirit of man is the principle of life given to him by God , it can still partake of the filthiness of fleshly works .
For this reason , it is necessary for Christians to guard against the corruption not only of the flesh , but of the spirit , also . [
189 ]
The union of man 's spirit with the Spirit of God in baptism is no magical guarantee against the possibility of their separation .
To become again enslaved tot he works of the flesh may very well lead to exclusion from the body of Christ . [
190 ] The Spirit of God is given to man that Christ may dwell in the heart . [
191 ] " Now if any an have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of His . " [
192 ]
To have the Spirit of God dwelling in the body is to be , also , a member of the body of Christ .
To be deprived of the one is to be cut off from the other .
It is impossible to be in communion with only part of God. Communion with Christ through the Spirit is communion with the whole Godhead .
Exclusion from the One Person is exclusion from all Three Persons .
" The works of the flesh are manifest ... " [
193 ] " The mind of the flesh is enmity against God , for it is not subject to the law of God , neither indeed can it be .
So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God . [
194 ]
Such people are enslaved to the power of death and corruption in the flesh .
They must be saved from the " Body of this death . " [
195 ]
On the other hand , those who have been buried with Christ through baptism have died to the body of sin and are living unto Christ . [
196 ]
They are no longer living according to the desires of flesh , but of the spirit .
" The fruit of the spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , goodness , faith , meekness , temperance -- against such there is no law .
And they that are Christ 's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts . " [
197 ]
It is clear that , for St. Paul , the union of man 's spirit with the Spirit of God in the life of love within the body of Christ is life and salvation .
On the other hand , to live according tot he desires of the flesh , dominated by the powers of death and corruption , means death - -" For the mind of the flesh is death . " [
198 ] St. Paul is dealing throughout his epistles with the categories of life and death .
God is life .
The devil holds the reins of death and corruption .
Unity with God in the Spirit , through the body of Christ in the life of love , is life and brings salvation and perfection .
Separation of man 's spirit from the divine life in the body of Christ is slavery to the powers of death and corruption used by the devil to destroy the works of God .
The life of the spirit is unity and love .
The life according to the flesh is disunity and dissolution in death and corruption .
It is absolutely necessary to grasp the essential spirit of St. Paul 's usage of the words , sarx , psyche , and pneuma , in order to avoid the widespread confusion that dominates the field of inquiry into Pauline theology .
St. Paul is never speaking in terms of immaterial rational souls in contrast to material bodies .
Sarx and psyche are synonymous and comprise , together with the pneuma , the total man .
To live according to the pneuma is not to live a life according to the lower half of man .
On the contrary , to live according to the sarx , or psyche , is to live according to the law of death .
To live according to the spirit is to live according to the law of life and love .
Those who are sarkikoi cannot live according to their original destiny of selfless love for God and neighbor , because they are dominated by the power of death and corruption .
" the sting of death is sin . " [
199 ] Sin reigned in death . [
200 ] Death is the last enemy to be destroyed . [
201 ]
So long as man lives according tot he law of death , in the flesh , he cannot please God [ 202 ] because he does not live according to the law of life and love .
" The mind of the flesh is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God , neither can it be . " [
203 ]
In order to live according to his original destiny , man must be liberated from " the body of this death . " [
204 ]
This liberation from the power of death and corruption has come from God , Who sent His own Son " in the likeness of sinful flesh " to deliver man " from the law of sin and death . " [
205 ]
But , although the power of death and sin has thus been destroyed by the death and resurrection of Christ , participation in this victory can come only through dying to this world with Christ in the waters of baptism . [
206 ]
It is only by dying in baptism and then continuously dying to the rudiments and ways of the world that the members of the body of Christ can become perfect as God is perfect .
The importance that St. Paul attributes to dying to the rudiments of this world in order to live according to the " spirit of life " can not be exaggerated .
To try to pass off his insistence on complete self - denial for salvation as a product of eschatological enthusiasts is to miss completely the very basis of the New Testament message .
If the destruction of the devil , death and corruption is salvation and the only condition for life according to man 's original destiny , then the means of passing from the realm of death and its consequences to the realm of life , in the victory of Christ over death , must be taken very seriously .
For Paul , the way from death to life is communion with the death and life of Christ in baptism and a continuous life of live within the body of Christ .
This new life of love within the body of Christ , however , must be accompanied by a continuous death to the ways of this world , which is dominated by the law of death and corruption in the hands of the devil .
Participation in the victory over death does not come simply by having a magical faith and a general sentiment of vague love for humanity ( Luther ) .
Full membership int he body of Christ can come only by dying in the waters of baptism with Christ , and living according to the law of the " spirit of life . "
Catechumens and penitents certainly had faith , but they either had not yet passed through death , in baptism , to the new life , or else , once having died to the flesh in baptism , they failed to remain steadfast and allowed the power of death and corruption to regain its dominance over the " spirit of life . "
In regard to St. Paul 's teaching concerning baptismal death to the rudiments of this world , it is interesting to note his usage of the word , soma , to designate the communion of those in Christ who constitute the Church .
The word , soma , in both the Old and New Testaments , apart from Paul , is used predominantly to designate a dead person , or corpse . [
207 ]
At the Last Supper , our Lord used the word , soma , most likely to designate the fact that He was to pass through death , while his use of the word , haima , was to show his returning to life -- since , for the Old Testament , blood is the element of life . [
208 ]
Thus , at the Last Supper as at every Eucharist , there is a proclamation and confession of the death and resurrection of Christ .
According to the presuppositions set forth by St. Paul concerning baptismal death , it is very possible to describe the Church as the soma of Christ no only because of the indwelling of Christ and the Holy Spirit in the bodies of Christian , but also because all the members of Christ have died to the body of sin in the waters of baptism .
Before sharing in the life of Christ , on must first become an actual soma by being liberated from the devil in passing through a death to the ways of this world and living according to the " spirit . " [
209 ]
Synthetic Observations
St . Paul does not say anywhere that the whole human race has been accounted guilty of the sin of Adam and is therefore punished by God with death .
Death is an evil force which made its way into the world through sin , lodged itself in the world , and , in the person of Satan , is reigning both in man and creation .
For this reason , although man can know the good through the law written in his heart and may wish to do what is good , he cannot because of the sin which is dwelling in his flesh .
Therefore , it is not he who does the evil , but sin that dwelleth in him .
Because of this sin , he cannot find the means to do good .
He must be saved from " the body of this death . " [
210 ]
Only then can he do good .
What can Paul mean by such statements ?
A proper answer is to be found only when St. Paul 's doctrine of human destiny is taken into account .
If man was created for a life of complete selfless love , whereby his actions would always be directed outward , toward God and neighbor , and never toward himself -- whereby he would be the perfect image and likeness of God -- then it is obvious that the power of death and corruption has now made it impossible to live such a life of perfection .
The power of death in the universe has brought with it the will for self - preservation , fear , and anxiety , [ 211 ] which in turn are the root causes of self - assertion , egoism , hatred , envy and the like .
Because man is afraid of becoming meaningless , he is constantly endeavoring to prove , to himself and others , that he is worth something .
He thirsts after compliments and is afraid of insults .
He seeks his own and is jealous of the successes of others .
He likes those who like him , and hates those who hate him .
He either seeks security and happiness in wealth , glory and bodily pleasures , or imagines that this destiny is to be happy in the possession of the presence of God by an introverted and individualistic and inclined to mistake his desires for self - satisfaction and happiness for his normal destiny .
On the other hand , he can become zealous over vague ideological principles of love for humanity and yet hate his closest neighbors .
These are the works of the flesh of which St. Paul speaks . [
212 ]
Underlying every movement of what the world has come to regard as normal man , is the quest for security and happiness .
But such desires are not normal .
They are the consequences of perversion by death and corruption , though which the devil pervades all of creation , dividing and destroying .
This power is so great that even if man wishes to live according to his original destiny it is impossible because of the sin which is dwelling in the flesh [ 213 ] -- " Who will deliver me from the body of this death ? " [ 214 ]
To share in the love of God , without any concern for one 's self , is also to share in the life and truth of God .
Love , life and truth in God are one and can be found only in God .
The turning away of love from God and neighbor toward the self is breaking of communion with the life and truth of God , which cannot be separated from His love .
The breaking of this communion with God can be consummated only in death , because nothing created can continue indefinitely to exist of itself . [
215 ]
Thus , by the transgression of the first man , the principle of " sin ( the devil ) entered into the world and through sin death , and so death passed upon all men ... " [
216 ]
Not only humanity , but all of creation has become subjected to death and corruption by the devil . [
217 ]
Because man is inseparably a part of , and in constant communion with , creation and is linked through procreation to the whole historical process of humanity , the fall of creation through on man automatically involves the fall and corruption of all men .
It is through death and corruption that all of humanity and creation is held captive to the devil and involved in sin , because it is by death that man falls short of his original destiny , which was to love God and neighbor without concern for the self .
Man does not die because he is guilty for the sin of Adam . [
218 ]
He becomes a sinner because he is yoked to the power of the devil through death and its consequences . [
219 ]
St. Paul clearly says that " the sting of death is sin , " [ 220 ] that " sin reigned in death , " [ 221 ] and that death is " the last enemy that shall be destroyed . " [
222 ]
In his epistles , he is especially inspired when he is speaking about the victory of Christ over death and corruption .
It would be highly illogical to try to interpret Pauline thought with the presuppositions ( 1 ) that death is normal or ( 2 ) that at most , it is the outcome of a juridical decision of God to punish the whole human race for one sin , ( 3 ) that happiness is the ultimate destiny of man , and ( 4 ) that the soul is immaterial , naturally immortal and directly created by God at conception and is therefore normal and pure of defects ( Roman scholasticism ) .
The Pauline doctrine of man 's inability to do the good which he is capable of acknowledging according to the " inner man " can be understood only if one takes seriously the power of death and corruption in the flesh , which makes it impossible for man to live according to his original destiny .
The moralistic problem raised by St. Augustine concerning the transmission of death to the descendants of Adam as punishment for the one original transgression is foreign to Paul 's thoughts .
The death of each man cannot be considered the outcome of personal guilt .
St. Paul is not thinking as a philosophical moralist looking for the cause of the fall of humanity and creation in the breaking of objective rules of good behavior , which demands punishment from a God whose justice is in the image of the justice of this world .
Paul is clearly thinking of the fall in terms of a personalistic warfare between God and Satan , in which Satan is not obliged to follow any sort of moral rules if he can help it .
It is for this reason that St. Paul can say that the serpent " deceived Eve " [ 223 ] and that " Adam was not deceived , but the woman being deceived was in the transgression . " [
224 ]
Man was not punished by God , but taken captive by the devil .
this interpretation is further made clear by the fact that Paul is insisting that " until the law sin was int he world , but sin is not imputed when there is no law .
Nevertheless , death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam 's transgression . " [
225 ]
It is clear that Paul here is denying anything like a general personal guilt for the sin of Adam .
Sin was , however , in the world , since death reigned even over them who had not sinned as Adam sinned .
Sin here is obviously the person of Satan , who ruled the world through death even before the coming of the law .
This is the only possible interpretation of this statement , because it is clearly supported elsewhere by Paul 's teachings concerning the extraordinary powers of the devil , especially in Romans 8:19 - 21 .
St. Paul 's statements should be taken very literally when he says that the last enemy to be destroyed is death [ 226 ] and that " the sting of death is sin . " [
227 ]
From what has been observed , the famous expression , eph 'ho pantes hemarton , [ 228 ] can be safely interpreted as modifying the word , thanatos , which preceeds it , and which grammatically is the only word which fits the context .
Eph'ho as a reference to Adam is both grammatically and exegetically impossible .
Such an interpretation was first introduced by Origen , who obviously used it with a purpose in mind , because he believed in the pre-existence of all souls whereby he could easily say that all sinned in Adam .
The interpretation of eph'ho as " because " was first introduced into the East by Photius , [ 229 ] who claims that there are two interpretations prevalent -- Adam and thanatos -- but he would interpret it dioti ( because ) .
He bases his argument on a false interpretation of II Corinthians 5:4 by interpreting eph'ho , here again , as dioti .
But here it is quite clear that eph ' ho refers to skensi ( eph'ho skenei ou thelomen ekdysasthai ) .
Photius is interpreting Paul within the framework of natural moral law and is seeking to justify the death of all men by personal guilt .
He claims that all men die because they sin by following in the footsteps of Adam . [
230 ]
However , neither he nor any of the Eastern Fathers accepts the teaching that all men are made guilty for the sin of Adam .
From purely grammatical considerations it is impossible to interpret eph 'ho as a reference to any word other than thanatos .
Each time the grammatical construction of the preposition epi with the dative is used by Paul , it is always used as a relative pronoun which modifies a preceding noun [ 231 ] or phrase . [
232 ]
To make an exception in Romans 5:12 by making St. Paul use the wrong Greek expression to express the idea , " because , " is to beg the issue .
The correct interpretation of this passage , both grammatically and exegetically , can be supplied only when eph 'ho is understood to modify thanatos -- kai houtos eis pantas anthropous ho thanatos dielthen eph'ho ( thanato ) pantes hemarton - -" because of which " ( death ) , or " on the basis of which " ( death ) , or " for which ( death ) all have sinned . "
Satan , being himself the principle of sin , through death and corruption involves all of humanity and creation in sin and death .
Thus , to be under the power of death according to Paul is to be a slave to the devil and a sinner , because of the inability of the flesh to live according to the law of God , which is selfless love .
The theory of the transmission of original sin and guilt is certainly not found in St. Paul , who can be interpreted neither in terms of juridicism nor in terms of any dualism which distinguishes between the material and the allegedly pure , spiritual , and intellectual parts of man .
It is no wonder that some Biblical scholars are at a loss when they cannot find in the Old testament any clear - cut support for what they take to be the Pauline doctrine of original sin in terms of moral guilt and punishment . [
233 ]
The same perplexity is met by many moralistic Western scholars when they study the Eastern Fathers . [
234 ] Consequently , St. Augustine is popularly supposed to be the first and only of the early Fathers who understood the theology of St. Paul .
This is clearly a myth , from which both Protestants and Romans need liberation .
It is only when one understands the meaning of death and its consequences that one can understand the life of the ancient Church , and especially its attitude toward martyrdom .
Being already dead to the world in baptism , and having their life hidden with Christ in God , [ 235 ]
Christians could not falter in the face of death .
They were already dead , and yet living in Christ .
To be afraid of death was to be still under the power of the devil -- II Timothy 1:7 : " For God hath not given us the spirit of fear , but of power , and of love , and of sound mind . "
In trying to convince the Roman Christians not to hinder his martyrdom , St. Ignatius wrote : " The prince of this world would fain carry me away , and corrupt my disposition toward God .
Let none of you therefore , who are in Rome , help him . " [
236 ]
The Cyprianic controversy over the fallen during times of persecution was violent , because the Church understood that it was a contradiction to die in baptism and then to deny Christ for fear of death and torture .
The canons of the Church , although today generally ignored as an aid to understanding the inner faith of the ancient Church , still remain very severe for those who would reject their faith for fear of death . [
237 ]
Such an attitude towards death is not the product of eschatological frenzy and enthusiasm , but rather of a clear recognition of who the devil is , what his thoughts are , [ 238 ] what his powers over humanity and creation are , how he is destroyed through baptism and the mystagogical life within the body of Christ , which is the Church .
Oscar Cullman is seriously mistaken in trying to make the New Testament writers say that Satan and the evil demons have been deprived of their power , and that now leur puissance n'est qu'apparente . [
239 ]
The greatest power of the devil is death , which is destroyed only within the body of Christ , where the faithful are continuously engaged in the struggle against Satan by striving for selfless love .
This combat against the devil and striving for selfless love is centered in the corporate Eucharistic life of the local community - -" For when you assemble frequently epi to auto ( in the same place ) the powers of Satan are destroyed and the destruction at which he aims is prevented by the unity of your faith . " [
240 ]
Anyone , therefore , who does not hear the Spirit within him calling him tothe Eucharistic assembly for the corporate life of selfless love is obviously under the sway of the devil .
" He , therefore , who does not assemble with the Church , has even by this manifested his pride and condemned himself ... " [
241 ]
The world outside of the corporate life of love , in the sacraments , is still under the power of the consequences of death and therefore a slave to the devil .
The devil is already defeated only because his power has been destroyed by the birth , life , death and resurrection of Christ ; and this defeat is perpetuated only in the remnant of those saved before Christ and after Christ .
Both those saved before Christ and after Him are saved by His death and resurrection , and make up the New Jerusalem .
Against this Church the devil cannot prevail , and by this fact he is already defeated .
But his power outside of those who are saved remains the same . [
242 ] Satan is still " the god of this world , " [ 243 ] and it is for this reason that Christians must live as if not living in this world . [
244 ]
Concluding Remarks
The modern Biblical scholar cannot claim to be objective if his examination of Biblical theology is one - sided , or governed by certain philosophical prejudices .
The modern school of Biblical criticism is clearly making a false attempt to get at the essential form of the original kyregma , while remaining quite ignorant and blind to the very essence of the Old and New Testament analysis of the fallen state of humanity and creation , especially in regard to its teachings concerning the natures of God and Satan .
Thus , one sees the anti-liberal tendencies of modern Protestantism , accepting the method of Biblical criticism and at the same time trying to salvage what it takes to be the essential message of the Gospel writers .
yet , in all their pseudo - scientific method of research , writers of this school fail to come to any definite conclusions because they stubbornly refuse to take seriously the Biblical doctrine of Satan , death and corruption .
For this reason , such a question as whether or not the body of Christ was really resurrected is not regarded as important -- e.g. , Emil Brunner , The Mediator .
What is important is the faith that Christ is the unique Savior in history , even though very possibly not resurrected in history .
How he saves and what he saves men from is presumably a secondary question .
It is clear that for St. Paul the bodily resurrection of Christ is the destruction of the devil , death , and corruption .
Christ is the first fruits from the dead . [
245 ]
If there is no resurrection there can be no salvation . [
246 ]
Since death is a consequence of the discontinuation of communion with the life and love of God , and thereby a captivity of man and creation by the devil , then only a real resurrection can destroy the power of the devil .
It is inaccurate and shallow thinking to try to pass off as Biblical the idea that the question of a real bodily resurrection is of secondary importance .
At the center of Biblical and patristic thought there is clearly a Christology of real union , which is conditioned by the Biblical doctrine of Satan , death and corruption , and human destiny .
Satan is governing through death , materially and physically .
His defeat must be also material and physical .
Restoration of communion must be not only in the realm of mental attitude , but , more important , through creation , of which man is an inseparable part .
Without a clear understanding of the Biblical doctrine of Satan and his power , it is impossible to understand the sacramental life of the body of Christ , and , by consequence , the doctrine of the Fathers concerning Christology and Trinity becomes a meaningless diversion of scholastic specialists .
Both Roman scholastics and Protestants are undeniably heretical in their doctrines of grace and ecclesiology simply because they do not see any longer that salvation is only the union of man with the life of God in the body of Christ , where the devil is being ontologically and really destroyed in the life of love .
Outside of the life of unity with each other and Christ in the sacramental life of corporate love there is no salvation , because the devil is still ruling the world through the consequences of death and corruption .
Extra - sacramental organizations , such as the papacy , cannot be fostered off as the essence of Christianity because they are clearly under the influence of worldly considerations and do not have as their sole aim the life of selfless love .
In Western Christianity , the dogmas of the Church have become the object of logical gymnastics in the classrooms of philosophy .
What is usually taken as natural human reason is set up as the exponent of revealed theology .
The teachings of the Church concerning the Holy Trinity , Christology , and Grace , are no longer the accepted expressions of the continuous and existential experience of the body of Christ , living within the very life of the Holy Trinity through the human nature of Christ , in whose flesh the devil has been destroyed and against whose body ( the Church ) the gates of death ( hades ) cannot prevail .
It is the mission of Orthodox theology today to bring an awakening to Western Christianity , but in order to do this the Orthodox themselves must rediscover their own traditions and cease , once and for all , accepting the corroding infiltration of Western theological confusion into Orthodox theology .
It is only by returning to the Biblical understanding of Satan and human destiny that the sacraments of the Church can once again become the source and strength of Orthodox theology .
The enemy of life and love can be destroyed only when Christians can confidently say , " we are not ignorant of his thoughts . " [
247 ]
Any theology which cannot define with exactitude the methods and deceptions of the devil is clearly heretical , because such a theology is already deceived by the devil .
It is for this reason that the Fathers could assert that heresy is the work of the devil .

UNTIL nine years ago , Dr. Neal Grossman did n’t make a habit of parading around his bedroom in his skivvies and admiring his physique in the mirror .
Nor did he ever imagine that his oldest son , then a teenager , would take one look at his father midflex and cry out , “ Dad , put your clothes back on ! ”
But now that Dr. Grossman , a 60 - year - old Baltimore dentist , is a competitive amateur bodybuilder , an extra ounce of flab makes the difference between a sizable trophy and going home empty - handed .
“ The minute you start winning , that ’s all the validation people need to accept what you do as legitimate and something to be appreciated , ” said Dr. Grossman , who is 5 - foot - 2 and a chiseled 121 pounds .
He is one of a small but growing number of 60 - and 70 - year - old bodybuilders stripping down to Speedos , slathering on bronzer , and strutting their stuff onstage in natural , or drug - free , competitions .
The season for amateur and pro-level events begins this month .
Last year , the World Natural Sports Organization , one of about a dozen bodybuilding groups devoted to drug - free contests , had 44 competitors older than 60 , up from two in 2000 , said Jeffrey Kippel , a founder .
Researchers break Internet speed records
A group of researchers led by the University of Tokyo has broken Internet speed records — twice in two days .
Operators of the high - speed Internet2 network announced Tuesday that the researchers on Dec. 30 sent data at 7.67 gigabits per second , using standard communications protocols .
The next day , using modified protocols , the team broke the record again by sending data over the same 20,000 - mile path at 9.08 Gbps .
That likely represents the current network ’s final record because rules require a 10 percent improvement for recognition , a percentage that would bring the next record right at the Internet2 ’s current theoretical limit of 10 Gbps .
However , the Internet2 consortium is planning to build a new network with a capacity of 100 Gbps .
With the 10 - fold increase , a high - quality version of the movie “ The Matrix ” could be sent in a few seconds rather than half a minute over the current Internet2 and two days over a typical home broadband line .
Researchers used the newer Internet addressing system , called IP v6 , to break the records in December .
Data started in Tokyo and went to Chicago , Amsterdam and Seattle before returning to Tokyo .
The previous high of 6.96 Gbps was set in November 2005 .
Speed records under the older addressing system , IP v4 , are in a separate category and stand at 8.8 Gbps , set in February 2006 .
The Internet2 is run by a consortium of more than 200 U.S. university .
It is currently working to merge with another ultrahigh - speed , next - generation network , National LambdaRail .
The announcement of the new record was made at the Internet2 consortium ’s spring meeting , which ends Wednesday in Arlington , Va .

Introduction
No matter what OS you use , you need to think about security .
But what happens when you do n't have time to think ?
Turn to Ars !
We 've got you covered with five freeware or shareware security tools for Linux boxes , Macs , and Windows machines , all recommended by Ars staffers .
Running behind a firewall and a NAT router can keep many threats at bay , and skeptical computing can keep most people safe on the Internet , but it never hurts to have a toolbox of well - crafted apps that you can reach into should your machine be breached .
Windows
A quick note on security suites : we do n't believe in them .
There is no security suite out there that properly takes care of two or more security needs ; a company usually gets good at one aspect and wants to expand into another for the sake of growing their business .
We have not yet encountered a truly solid security suite , although some companies are slowly getting there .
The idea here is to keep expenditures down to a minimum while still addressing the top five security software categories ( in no particular order ) for a Windows PC .
Firewall
Almost everyone has sensitive data on their hard drives that they prefer to keep off the network .
For Windows XP , the Windows Firewall is not good enough .
We recommend using Comodo Firewall Pro Free instead .
First introduced as a part of Service Pack 2 , XP 's firewall is not capable of blocking outbound connections .
This is the number one reason for using a software firewall , as a router ( also known as a hardware firewall ) takes care of inbound connections perfectly .
For Windows Vista , Microsoft addressed this problem ; spyware and viruses that " phoned home " with stolen information would be caught by Vista 's firewall .
If you have Windows Vista , there is no need for Comodo or any third - party firewall .
Regardless of whether you 're on XP or Vista , a router is essential .
We would even go as far as saying that a hardware firewall is more important than having a software firewall enabled — regardless of which OS you 're running .
Recommendations
Windows Vista : built - in firewall
Windows XP : Comodo Firewall Pro Free ( freeware )
Anti-virus
This is the security application most users should n't pass up .
If you insist on not shelling out a dime , we recommend one of the three As : Antivir , Avast , or AVG .
The choice between the three comes down to user preference : download and install them one by one ( never , under any circumstances , have more than one anti-virus program installed on your computer ) and check out which features and interface suits you best .
Make sure to compare how often updates are sent out , how well the application can auto - update itself , and the resource footprint it has on your computer .
For commercial anti-virus software , the choice comes down to two recommendations : ESET NOD32 or Kaspersky Anti-Virus .
Kaspersky Anti-Virus has slightly superior detection rates based on signature files , while NOD32 provides excellent heuristic detection ( called " ThreatSense " by ESET ) for new viruses discovered in the wild .
Either is an excellent anti-virus solution .
Recommendations
Anti-spyware and Anti-adware
While Spybot Search & Destroy was king in anti-spyware for a long while , this is no longer the case .
Thanks to Microsoft 's acquisition of GIANT Company Software in December 2004 , the software maker now has an anti-spyware offering available for Windows XP and that comes with Windows Vista .
Windows Defender , while a very solid application considering its young age , may be better than Spybot but it is still not quite there yet .
Lavasoft Ad - Aware
Free is the freeware application we recommend , but we do not suggest disabling Windows Defender ; use them together .
On the other hand , if you do have the cash , there is no question that the best commercial option out there is Webroot Spy Sweeper .
Recommendation
Encryption
Everyone has those files on their computer that are only for their eyes .
Password - protection is a possibility , but passwords can be cracked too easily in this day and age .
Give a 13 - year - old the right program , and weep as he breaks into your p0rn stash and locks you out of it .
For all your privacy needs , encryption is the way to go .
TrueCrypt is an application that offers on - the - fly encryption with minimal user intervention .
It is the best that is out there right now , and it 's entirely free .
Furthermore , TrueCrypt is available for Microsoft Windows , Mac OS X , and Linux .
Recommendation
Watchdog
This is the application that was designed to annoy you .
If used correctly , it can block various types of malware from getting onto your computer .
It monitors what you or an application is trying to change on your computer , and informs you when it deems something might be being changed that should n't be .
Unfortunately , this occurs more often under legitimate changes than under non-legitimate ones .
For this reason , users often choose to disable or not to install such programs .
For Windows Vista , the watchdog of choice is none other than the unloved User Account Control ( UAC ) , and for Windows XP , we recommend Winpatrol .
Watchdog programs can be — but are not recommended to be—used as alternatives to other security solutions .

Above is a picture of the Lena River
during the bitter Russian winter .
The Lena Highway ( road of mud ) is nearby .
As they say , a picture is worth a thousand words .
How would you like to be caught in a mess like that ?
This is the story of Russia 's Lena Highway , aka the Highway from Hell .
The Russian Federal Highway runs from Moscow city to the Siberian city of Yakutsk .
The last 600 miles is called the " Lena Highway " .
This bizarre road runs parallel to the Lena River on the final leg to Yakutsk .
As you can readily see for yourself from the picture , in the summertime , the Lena Highway turns completely to mud whenever it rains .
There are several Internet sites that consider the Lena Highway to be the worst road in the world .
Personally I would give this dubious honor to Bolivia 's Road of Death ( next story ) .
After all , no one gets killed in the mud , just incredibly aggravated .
People actually die on the Bolivian road all the time .
Yakutsk is the capital of the Yakutia Republic , part of the vast Russian region known as Siberia .
The old joke is ' War is God 's way of teaching us geography '.
With that in mind , any kid who grew up playing the board game Risk remembers Yakutsk and neighboring Kamchatka as two territories with weird names located up at the top of Asia .
As a kid , I had never heard of these places until I played Risk .
Nor did it ever dawn on me that people actually live there ( as if getting stuck in the mud is considered living ... )
The road of mud is n't the only problem .
It seems that people who live in Yakutsk were born to suffer .
Yakutsk is considered the coldest city on earth , with January temperatures averaging - 45 °F .
The coldest temperatures ever recorded outside Antarctica occur in the basin of the Yana River just to the northeast of Yakutia .
Yakutsk , the capital , is the world 's biggest city built on top of continuous permafrost .
Most houses are mounted on concrete piles to keep from sinking .
Surprisingly , for most of the year , the driving is excellent .
The road to Yakutsk is so frozen that the road is frozen solid .
It is only in the summer that the road periodically becomes impassable .
In the autumn the road freezes back and becomes even better than most soil roads .
In the dead of winter there is no problem as vehicles drive over the frozen Lena Highway .
Cars are al lowed to drive up to 70 kmh ( 45 mph ) .
In fact , one report suggested some vehicles even drive over the Lena River as well in the winter !
It becomes a solid block of ice .
But watch out for Summertime !
Believe or not , Yakutsk is actually cut off from the world much of the time during the summer .
In a story I read about a 2001 flood caused by the overflowing Lena River , it said Yakutsk does not even have railroad !
This means that in the summer when it rains , Yakutsk is virtually inaccessible except by boat or plane .
And even the boats are not much help .... the Lena River is impassable for large stretches of the year when it is full of loose ice , or when the ice cover is not sufficiently thick to support traffic , or when the water level is high and the river turbulent with spring flooding .
Get this : July temperatures often exceed 90 °F !
This makes the Yakutia region among the greatest in the world for seasonal temperature differentials .
This helps explain the mud road fiasco which you are about to witness .
When it rains in Yakutsk , it pours !
And the rains turn the Road to Yakutsk into a quagmire .
Unfortunately , this major artery does not have an asphalt surface even though it is a vital Federal highway .
Attempts have been made to put down a proper surface , but the road immediately turns to mush the moment it thaws making repairs impossible .
Consequently , in the summer , e very time it rains , hundreds of cars become stuck in the mud .
Yakutia is an area of permafrost .
The Lena Highway melts down to 1 meter every summer for 2...3 months ( usually July and August ) - that makes it impossible to build usual roads ( using asphalt or concrete ) there .
Such roads are called " zimnik " ( " zima " means " winter " in Russian ) .
In the autumn the road freezes back and becomes even better than usual soil roads , but that is little consolation to those stuck in the summertime mud .
The pictures you are about to see were made in August 2006 at the start of the problem .
Ultimately 600 cars got stuck there .
In other words , as bad as things are in the pictures you are about to view , they only hint at how impossible the conditions can really be .
A car can be trapped in the quagmire for days .
According to witnesses , hunger and lack of the fuel are all part of these mud traps .
One woman even gave birth to a child right in the public bus she was riding because no ambulance could possibly get to her .
Making things worse , people are afraid to come to the rescue .
There is a report of construction teams that were afraid to appear on site when called .
It turned out that during their previous visit they were beaten by people who had been stuck in the jam for a few days .
So now the cars and trucks are left to fend for themselves .
Only in Russia .
Lawlessness is common .
People often break the locks on the trucks in a search of food and warm clothing .
Fuel , food , firearms and steel tow - line cables are needed most during the rainy days on the Lena Highway .
Apparently Russia is infamous for its bad roads .
For instance , the cynics insist Russia 's bad roads had more to do with stopping the advance of the German army in World War II than anything the Red Army did .
I decided to ask my friend Olga about the Russian roads .
Olga was raised in Russia , but now works here in Houston .
This is what Olga had to say .

Subject : the russian roads
Back when I was growing up my parents never could afford a car ( well , they actually still do n't have one ) .
Consequently , we did not have much to do with the roads problems all that much .
But it is common knowledge the roads are quite an issue in Russia .
We even have a national song about how bad our roads are .
And it has lots of verses . :)
It seems like Russia could do something about this road .
After all , America built the Alcan Highway in Alaska under similar conditions .
Driving upon these roads in summer when the snows have melted seems like a very stupid idea .
But the authorities never even meant for the Lena Highway to be used in the summertime .
Apparently the ancient way of reaching Yakutsk in the summer was by boat .
Now , even though it is the 21st Century , this tradition continues .
Yakutsk can only be reached by ferry in the summer .
The road dead ends on the wrong side of Yakutsk .
In fact , there is no bridge anywhere in the Sakha Republic that even crosses the mighty Lena .
But just because it is a very bad idea to drive does n't mean people do n't try anyway .
After all , most people in this area are have no choice if they wish to reach another part of Russia .
Unless they own a plane or a boat , the Road of Mud is the only way in and out of the city .
These poor people were born to suffer .
The picture above was taken on August 30 , 2006 .
As you can see , this is a dirt road .
The ground is firm because his truck is stopped on the high ground .
However the road has become impassible due to the watery conditions up ahead .
This driver probably has no idea how lucky he is that his truck is n't stuck .
As you see below , others are not quite so lucky .
Have you ever seen a more unbelievable picture of a car stuck in mud ?
Please note the condition of the Lena Highway before the rains came .
Maybe a few ruts , but the road is dry and in good shape .
Now let 's see some truly horrifying pictures of a road ruined with mud .
This road resembles a river .
Or maybe a ' lake ' would be a better description .
This area is surrounded by hills on both sides and there appears to be nowhere along the side of the road for the water to drain .
Instead the water just sits there .
Note the sign in the picture above on the left .
70 kilometers an hour is the posted speed limit .
That translates to 45 miles per hour .
Lots of luck reaching that speed ... my guess is the summertime speed is 45 miles per week .
Somehow those two trucks got to the top of the hill .
As you can see from the overturned trucks , others were n't so lucky .
Did they ever think of perhaps dropping gravel on this road ?
You can do that any time of year .
If nothing else , they could use gravel to elevate the road above the terrain around the road .
Another idea might be to dig some trenches alongside the road to improve drainage .
In the picture with the yellow truck , it looks like the water has nowhere to go ... the sides of the road seem as high or higher than the road itself .
Surely there must be a low spot to use as a retention pond somewhere .
A damsel in distress .
Such a pretty girl and such a pretty car .
What a pity .
Two more damsels in distress .
That jeep looks seriously stuck in the mud .
Have you ever seen more mud in all your life ?
Well , at least they are smiling ... sort of .
I am not sure I would be able to smile in such a predicament .
Notice the blonde on the truck .
She is actually smiling for the camera !
And I know why - for some reason , no one has made her get in the mud and push .
She is clean as a whistle .
Glad someone 's in a good mood .
If you study this picture , you realize just how hopeless this situation is .
It could be days before they get out of this mess .
Surely there is modern technology to fight this problem .
This is ridiculous .
Do you know anything about this road or have a comment to share ?

Subject : RE : Russian Road
After seeing the page on the road to Yakutsk and your despair at the fact that the Russian government seems to do nothing about the road ( or can do nothing ) , and that you stated there must be some modern technology to make this a passable road -- well , there is a way to make a very passable , all weather road -- and it is not modern technology , but a modern understanding of how roads must be built on permafrost .
I watched road construction in Alaska back in the 80's .
The construction crews built a modern 4 lane divided highway over permafrost - and it functioned very well -- year - round .
However , it does require a lot of digging out for the road ( a very large trench , much wider than the actual road and quite deep ) and backfilling with rock and gravel .
This allows the heat from the road to dissipate so the permafrost does not melt and cause the road to break up .
It just costs money and time - neither of which the Russian government is willing to spend on a mere road .

Subject : your article about the Russian Highway from Hell
Dear sirs ,
I have read your article about the Russian Highway to Yakutsk .
I just would like to comment the general tone of the article .
I think it is a gross mistake to use such contemptuous sentences like ' this people are dirt poor ' or can't these poor people do something about it ? .
The general tone of the article is characteristic of an ugly and stupid feeling of superiority toward Russia .
e.g. : these women should get married in Australia / in the U.S.A ... look at these poor bastards trying to get out from the mud , etc ...
You seem to ignore that
1 ) The Soviet empire collapsed in 1991 and as a result , all its economy was destroyed .
almost all the infrastructures have not been renewed since the soviet union area .
Russia and the former soviet republic is ruled by gangsters and mafias ( at least it is clear ) who do not care investing into public transportation .
This is partially the result of an aggressive policy of the U.S.A aiming at promoting this gangs in the former soviet union space so that the ' threat ' of communism would be definitively buried .
The consequence is that the populations of Russia who were not fortunate enough to relocate into Europe or other ' developed ' country after 1991 must - as it is said - suffer the effect of the total collapse of communism , state , economy , science that happened in 1991 .
To mock them is really disgusting .
Since they are not different as you .
2 ) The basis of the scientific and technological power of the USA comes almost exclusively from German , Jews and Russian scientists who had to escape Europe .
I have never seen a U.S university able to provide ' pure american ' scientists .
Only they can buy them to foreign nations .
When you mock these people , just think of the tremendous number of high - level mathematicians , physicists or technologists who are giving to your prestigious universities the label ' prestigious ' .
3 ) The soviet union liberated the world from Nazi Germany .
Just for your knowledge , the Nazi army was so powerful that it was almost the same equivalent power as the U.S army nowadays ( and this comes from the best army experts , U.S included ) .
When the USA entered into Europe , the war was already lost for Hitler .
Only the Russian communist power wiped out the invincible Nazi army . ( and this still remains partly a mystery ) .
The Nazi army had wiped out in a few days the French army who was at that time the first army in the world while the US army was only at that time made with battalions of peasants .
Ask yourself what your country would have do in front of the Nazi Army in 1941 ?
You would have been reduced to slavery .
The Russian did not .
4 ) What destroyed the Soviet Union was something which is very difficult to understand .
I have been analyzing this and came to the conclusion that it is some kind of intrinsic process bound to the maximum level of information that can be contained in a Human society .
If I am right , the USA should themselves collapse such as the European Union since this process must be universal .
Look at Katrina ?
Was n't there a technological solution to this ?
It is just that I am living there .
I am not Russian but French .
I find rather disgusting to be so contemptuous .
Look at these dirty roads and all these people who fight to get from one point to an other and you may look your future , when the economical crisis of 2008 will come back and will blast your country as a tsunami .
Will you have enough courage to survive economical destruction , to learn other languages and other alphabet ?
Never judge since you do n't know .
I take these roads .
Yes they should build new roads .
That 's easy to say .

Subject : Yakutia Road
I read carefully your article .
I observe the fotos one by one .
Many are from the internet , but not in the Lena Highway .
What I can tell you ?
Good news !
I was in an solitary expedition riding my Aprilia Pegaso motorbike from Bucharest - Romania to Magadan - Russian Federation .
2100 km before Magadan is that Lena Highway .
Why good news ?
Because last year ( 2010 ) exacly in july - august when I ride exactly this road the condition was normal : macadam type of road , 3 layers of rocks , stone and gravel , dirt on the surface for " glue " the gravel .
With the motorbike the average speed was 70 km/h , the peak speed was 120 .
Sometime in the Lena Highway they work to the road , and the speed decrease down to walk speed for few kilometers .
Was need few days to reach Yakutsk , and two days rain like hell .
The problem is when is not raining the dust go anywhere , including in the… …..
So , believe me , these pictures are no more available .
The situation is about normal now .

Hallo Rick
Some picture are from Lena ( road to Yakutsk ) " highway " , but not all of them .
Few are from another places , or from inside the cities ; I saw these fotos in tens of internet sites .
But still missing one with a modern Russian battle tank stocked in mud .
Regarding the status of the road , last year in july - august just ride all way and the situation is far away from what you present in the article : the road in with no asphalt or concrete ( in fact is asphalt but just maybe 200 km in different legs , usual from cities to the nearby airport ) , but the rest is in good condition , including in raining weather .
In some sectors I reach maybe 120 - 130 km/h speed with my Aprilia Pegaso with heavy load .
But is ok , taking in consideration that the pictures and article are talking about 2006 , and now is 2011 .
By the way , last year they almost reach the Yakutsk city ( of course , in right bank , the city is on the left one ) by railway .
Slowly , they come with the train .
The Lena barrier between the road / train and Yakustk is an heavy problem , taking in consideration few month / year when the big river froze and defrost , that means no ferry navigation and no auto / truck crossing on ice .
But they have hovercrafts and a lot of helicopters for some cases .
The situation is not like in the internet .
This is a big problem with internet , people think they know the truth , never been there .
All the best

Dear Rick ,
I enjoyed your site .
The pictures bring back old memories .
I have never been to Yakutia , so I can not testify on whether the pictures were taken there or somewhere else .
However , the first 34 years of my life I lived in the Soviet Union , and , though a city dweller , I spent some time in the countryside .
After couple of rainy days , dirt roads would become dirty indeed , and pictures like the ones on your site could be taken 40 miles from Moscow , albeit at that time they would be black - and - white .
I do not want going into political discussions , but that was before the collapse of the Communism .
As for which particular road goes from / to Hell , it is always debatable .
With Best Regards , Lennie . .

The boy suffered extensive bruising
The girls , two aged 17 and one 16 , were convicted of false imprisonment and causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent .
Inner London Crown
Court heard the victim , now 18 , was stripped , punched and kicked while the attack was filmed .
It took place in a flat in Woolwich , south - east London , in March 2006 .
Begging for mercy
Judge Colin Smith told them that a particularly unpleasant and increasingly common feature of the victim 's ordeal was that it was video - recorded on at least one mobile phone .
During the boy 's ordeal he was subjected to a " sudden severe physical assault " , made to strip naked and forced to perform a sex act in front of the group .
The court heard that in a recording the boy could be seen being forced to sit in a cold bath while ketchup and kitchen oil was poured over him as he begged for mercy .
This kind of behaviour went far beyond even serious bullying
Judge Colin Smith
" One can tell , listening to that video , that the ordeal was being played out to a background of extremely loud screaming and laughing by the group , " the judge said .
After several hours the boy managed to escape , with some of his clothes , and went to his ex-girlfriend 's mother 's house .
He had red marks on his face , was bleeding from one ear and a doctor 's examination revealed extensive bruising all over his body .
Pain and humiliation
The judge told the girls he was satisfied there had been " some kind of non-payment of some kind of debt and as a result of that ... you decided to teach the victim a lesson " .
" This kind of behaviour went far beyond even serious bullying , and amounted to the infliction of pain and humiliation on the victim , which is intolerable behaviour . "
One of the 17 - year - olds , said to be the ringleader , received a four - year detention order .
The 16 - year - old was given three years ' detention and the other 17 - year - old was given a two - year detention and training order .
The trio , who can not be named because of their age , were found guilty of false imprisonment and causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent on 9 August .
One of the girls pleaded guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm and the other two were found guilty of the same charge .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Men are n’t all from Mars when it comes to their sexuality , a new study from Kinsey Institute researchers shows .

Among the revelations from their focus groups in which men talked about what influenced their sexual desire and arousal : one man ’s turn - on is often another ’s turn - off ; an erection does n’t always signal arousal ; and not every guy wants to jump into bed at the drop of a hat .
“ We ’re probably from a whole bunch of different planets , ” Dr. Erick Janssen , an associate scientist at the Bloomington , Indiana - based institute and one of the study ’s authors , told Reuters Health .
“ We do n’t tend to -- from a research perspective -- sit down a lot with men or groups of men and talk about such intimate topics , such as what influences ... sexual desire and arousal and the topic or the question of where in all of this the penis comes in , ” he added .
“ This is one of the studies that attempted to do that . ”
Janssen and his team set up six focus groups in which 50 men between the ages of 18 and 70 , most of whom were white and heterosexual , talked about what aroused them sexually and what enhanced or inhibited their arousal .
The findings are published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior .
Men reported getting erections without necessarily being aroused , while some men , especially older men , said they might become aroused without having an erection .
Some used masturbation as a way to “ fix ” it “ when something just feels off , ” or as a “ great way ” to get out of a funk .
Many men said feeling confident and good about themselves often led to feeling sexually aroused ( while “ feeling scruffy ” had the opposite effect ) .
And for many men , a self - confident partner was also more desirable than one who did n’t feel good about herself .
In addition to a nice body and a pretty face , many men found intelligence “ really attractive ” and “ a big turn on . ”
Mood and feeling emotionally connected also influenced arousal for men , while a woman ’s scent was key for some men , but not others .
However , an “ overwhelming majority ” said that being outdoors , for example on a camping trip or having a picnic , boosted their sexual desire and arousal .
Taken together , the findings provide a much more nuanced picture of men ’s sexuality than is promoted by men ’s magazines , Janssen pointed out .
“ There ’s huge variability among men in how easily they ’re turned on or turned off , how easily they experience sexual desire and arousal , ” he explained .
“ The differences among men and the differences among women are much larger than the average difference between the sexes in almost anything sexual . ”
In fact , the researcher added , as many as 30 percent of women may be more easily sexually aroused than most men .
“ This study ’s challenging the idea that men are simple , ” he said .

This article explains the connection between cell phone recycling and Gorillas the hidden connection .
Like many people , I never thought there is a connection between cell phone recycling and endangered African gorillas .
When I started doing research on the dangerous chemicals found in cell phones , I came across this little known connection between the widespread use of cell phones today and survival of African Eastern Lowland Gorillas .
When you consider the sheer number of cell phones being dumped to our landfills every year , the threat of toxic chemicals these cell phones contain : antimony , arsenic , copper , cadmium , lead , and zinc is quite real and alarming .
There are 140 million estimated cell phone users in the US today .
Due to rapid changes in cell phone technology , it is estimated that the average cell phone user changes their cell phone model very 14 months .
Last year , more than 100 million cell phones were discarded , but less than 10 % of these were recycled .
Sadly , one study of cell phone disposal for the 4th quarter of 2007 shows that 10.2 of cell phone users threw their cell phones away or said that they were stolen , and a full 32 % did not do anything more than store their cell phone somewhere .
If the number holds true for the entire year , there are now over 10 million discarded cell phones rotting in our landfills and potentially leaking dangerous chemicals into our water sytems while another 36 million units are gathering dust in the drawers and closets throughout America .
And these are used cell phones discarded in 2007 only .
( Read the iSuppli Cell Phone Recycling Q4 report here )
We shall explore the danger of toxic substances present in cell phones in another post .
Today , let ’s examine the impact of cell phone production and cell phone recycling on the continued survival of a species of gorillas in Africa , which brings us to the subject of Coltan .
What is Coltan ?
Coltan is the African term for the metallic ore columbite - tantalite used to produce niobium and Tantalum .
The metal that allows your cell phone to run efficiently – Tantalum – is the very same metal that ’s fueling the civil war in the Congo and decimating gorilla populations in the area .
Tantalum is prized for its resistance to corrosion and extreme heat , and is used to produce capacitors and other parts of cell phones , DVD players , laptops , and video game consoles .
The burgeoning cell phone and electronics industries by necessity require huge supplies of Tantalum and the ore from which it is derived – Coltan .
Coltan is found and mined in several countries , including Australia , Canada , Ethiopia , Nigeria , Zimbabwe , Mozambique , Namibia , South Africa , and Egypt .
However , the largest supply is coming from the Congo or the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) in Africa , which is believed to possess 80 % of the world ’s Coltan reserves .
In particular , Coltan is mined extensively in the eastern part of Congo where the Kahuzi Biega National Park , home to the Eastern Lowland Gorilla , is located .
Coltan is fueling the war in the Congo .
The huge demand for Coltan and its derivative metal Tantalum coming from the cell phone and electronics industries , has jacked up its price in the world market ( reaching $ 600 per kilogram at one time ) and has made its mining and extraction quite profitable for the different armed groups ( rebels , bandits , Rwandan invading troops , etc. ) in the area .
Profits from the mining operations by these groups are then used to buy more weapons and ammunitions , thus prolonging the conflict that has already claimed 3.2 million lives since 1998 .
The Coltan bonanza has also attracted thousands of impoverished migrants into the area .
As the mining concerns widen and more people arrive , thousands of acres of tropical forest , the natural habitat of the Eastern Lowland Gorillas ( Gorilla beringei graueri ) are destroyed .
The destruction of their natural habitat and the hunt for “ bush meat ” to feed the hungry miners and armed groups has brought the Eastern Lowland Gorillas to the very brink of extinction reducing their population by about 90 % ..
Before the civil war broke out in 1998 , there were over 17,000 silverback Gorillas in the Congo .
Today , their number is estimated to be below 3,000 .
While many American cell phone manufacturers since 2001 have taken the position of purchasing Tantalum produced by non-African Coltan suppliers , like Australia and Canada , or from African suppliers who certify that their ores are n’t mined from conflict areas , illegal Coltan mining continues to this day .
The ores are smuggled through the bordering countries to Europe and the sheer volume of contraband Coltan in the market makes the likelihood of some blood - tainted Tantalum part of the handset I or you are using today .
How can we help ?
The obvious answer is cell phone recycling .
It may not be that simple to end the conflict in Africa , but following the basic law of supply and demand , cell phone recycling would effectively lessen the demand for Coltan by the manufacturers .
If done in a concerted and high rate ( certainly higher than 9 plus percent rate today ) , it will make Coltan mining and the collateral forest destruction in the Congo less profitable for the armed groups and migrants .
“ Most people do n’t know that there ’s a connection between this metal in their cell phones and the well - being of wildlife in the area where it ’s mined , ” said Karen Killmar , the associate curator of mammals at the San Diego Zoo , as reported in The National Geographic .
“ Recycling old cell phones is a way for people to do something very simple that could reduce the need for additional coltan … and help protect the gorillas , ” Killmar added .

Sumner Redstone , who controls the twin media giants Viacom and CBS , is leaning on Internet service providers and online media outlets to do his heavy lifting .
Speaking at the Seoul Digital Forum 2008 , the 84 - year - old media mogul came down particularly hard on YouTube , equating the video platform with piracy and demanding that ISPs and web sites do more to police content .
" Solutions turn on enlisting the aggregators — ISPs , device manufacturers , hosting companies , and site operators — this effort , " Redstone said , according to the Associated Press .
" We ask that companies that become aware of piracy using their facilities do something about it . "
Redstone 's statements make sense in the light of his long - running legal campaign against piracy in general and YouTube in particular ( Viacom is suing YouTube for $ 1 billion at the moment ) .
It 's also far from a unique stance among studio bigwigs .
But is it really fair to ask the service providers to beat piracy on behalf of the content producers , when the networks and studios already have much better tools at their disposal ?
Game theory
Matt Mason , in his book The Pirate 's Dilemma ( look for our review next week ) , shows how a culture of piracy tends to grow up whenever and wherever a human need meets draconian restrictions — economic , legal , what have you .
The establishment that gave birth to hip - hop , Wikipedia , disco , and YouTube must change in the end or risk losing out as new players monetize the new market staked out by the pirates .
Rap and graffiti started out as rebel yells , then became accepted as art forms , and they have now been integrated into the multibillion - dollar pop culture machinery that once was the enemy .
It happened to Dr. Dre because the record companies could n't silence him and his fans with cookie - cutter pop , so hip - hop quickly became a business model instead .
Sumner Redstone
What Sumner is missing with his comments is the fact that pirates can be beaten — it happens all the time — but not primarily by means of legal threats and lawsuits .
No , you subjugate these rebels with the tools of free enterprise .
Piracy is just another business model , and the pirates will lose and go away when you come up with a better model ( or they will become legitimate players themselves ) .
Stripped down to the bare essentials , consumers will choose the service with the most attractive balance of price , convenience , and quality .
Piracy will always win on price , because you can't really beat free .
The other two components are up for grabs , but the media companies are only now starting to seize the opportunity .
Quality
Take YouTube as competition for the Comedy Central cable network , for example .
Redstone 's Viacom has asked Google to remove clips of Colbert and Jon Stewart , time and again .
But a YouTube search on " Colbert " today still returns more than 6,200 results .
And if Viacom managed to shut YouTube down entirely , you 'd see those clips moving to MySpace Video .
Or perhaps Yahoo , MSN , or some platform that does n't exist yet .
The pirates will always keep a steady supply of free clips on hand , if you 're willing to chase down the sources and deal with bad quality , clip length limits , and other flaws .
So Comedy Central eventually fought back hard , hosting the complete Daily Show archives online , and tagged the clips to make them searchable .
NBC and Fox formed Hulu to distribute their shows with minimal commercials , and ABC and CBS are doing their own experiments with online distribution ( ABC offers Lost in HD , for instance ) .
Make sure the videos are of high quality , preferably in high - def and surround sound .
Do n't skimp on the extras : if anything , there should be exclusive content online only , not the other way around .
Remember , you 're creating a new distribution channel , and need to promote it .
There 's the quality play .
Convenience
If Redstone really wants YouTube to stop " stealing " his viewers , it 's easy to do .
In fact , his companies are already doing it .
Start up a one - stop shop for all the Comedy Central content you want or , even better , everything you 'd ever want to watch on any Viacom or CBS property .
Some shows are produced by other companies — just tell them to put up with this , or they 're off your airwaves .
An industry - wide content portal would be even better , but it will take years to sort out the branding , control , and revenue sharing issues there .
Then promote this site .
Relentlessly .
If you watch just one episode of South Park or Tila Tequila , it should be impossible to walk away without the awareness of a convenient service that will fill you in on missed episodes , shows you never heard of , and all the classics , too .
They start on demand and play stutter - free from any PC , Mac , or Linux box , anywhere in the US , any time .
There 's the convenience play .
So Viacom can concede the price point to piracy , having won the other two battles .
Throwing in the towel entirely and charging retail DVD prices for a season of Family Guy may still be a mistake , but with any reasonable scheme , this should become a profitable venture very quickly .
Figure out an ad - supported model if you can , or charge less than a dollar per episode .
Let people burn it to DVD or play the file on iPhones for a buck .
Endgame
In the end , piracy will force all the big - time content producers to move in this kind of direction .
Capitalism , properly applied , will beat the rebels every time , and the odd thing is that the content companies are finally moving full - speed ahead with these new initiatives even as the bosses sometimes seem fixated on the " stick " half of the " carrot and stick " approach .
Even Sumner Redstone is starting to understand this .
" Media companies need to make it easy for consumers to obtain our content in a legal manner , " said Redstone .
" We can not let the lack of perfect antipiracy tools keep us from forging ahead in providing the best , most innovative , creative content to the consumer over whatever medium they prefer , whenever and wherever they prefer it . "
Media companies think they 're moving as fast as possible , but consumers are impatient creatures , and have moved even faster .
False identifications based on a terrorist no - fly list have for years prevented some federal air marshals from boarding flights they are assigned to protect , according to officials with the agency , which is finally taking steps to address the problem .
Federal Air Marshals ( FAMs ) familiar with the situation say the mix-ups , in which marshals are mistaken for terrorism suspects who share the same names , have gone on for years — just as they have for thousands of members of the traveling public .
One air marshal said it has been “ a major problem , where guys are denied boarding by the airline . ”
“ In some cases , planes have departed without any coverage because the airline employees were adamant they would not fly , ” said the air marshal , who asked not to be named because the job requires anonymity .
“ I ’ve seen guys actually being denied boarding . ”
A second air marshal said one agent “ has been getting harassed for six years because his exact name is on the no-fly list . ”
Video : Guns on a plane : Pilots train to use firearms
Earlier this month , the agency issued a new Security Directive ( SD ) “ to address those situations where air carriers deny FAMs boarding based on ‘ no - fly list ’ names matches . ”
The memo was issued April 23 from the assistant director of the office of flight operations .
Gregory Alter , spokesman for the Federal Air Marshal Service , said the new directive “ mitigates any misidentification concerns by empowering airlines to quickly clear an air marshal ’s status after positively identifying their law - enforcement status . ”
“ In rare instances , air marshals , like all travelers , are occasionally misidentified as being on a watch because of name or personal identifier similarities to individuals actually on the lists , ” Mr. Alter said .
The air marshal service does not release how many agents are employed and declined to specify the number of agents whose names are similar to those of wanted or suspected terrorists .
The new procedures are classified as “ sensitive security information ” and address both domestic and international check - in procedures .
“ FAMs may encounter situations where this SD has not yet reached every air carrier customer service representative ( CSR ) , ” the memo said .
“ If a FAM is denied boarding based on ‘ no fly list ’ issues , FAMS should request to speak to an air carrier supervisory CSR .
If the air carrier continues to deny the FAM a boarding pass , FAMS should contact [ their supervisor ] as soon as possible for assistance , ” the memo said .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said this week that one major air carrier reports roughly 9,000 false positive hits on the watch list every day .
The Terrorist Screening Center announced April 10 it will automatically review nearly 500,000 names on its watch list that are frequently matched during airport screenings and other law - enforcement encounters with the general public , and remove those names that do n’t belong to actual suspects .
Additionally , Mr. Chertoff announced Monday that each airline can now create a system of limited biographical data including a passenger ’s date of birth to clear up watch list misidentifications .
“ Hassles due to misidentification and the resulting necessity to stand in line to check in at the ticket counter is consistently among the deepest and most valid complaints of the traveling public , ” Mr. Chertoff said .
“ Thousands of passengers are inconvenienced each day , and this change should provide a way to eliminate the vast majority of these situations .
This is good for travelers and for security , because as we make the checkpoint environment calmer , it becomes easier to spot individuals with hostile intent , ” Mr. Chertoff said .

Who Barack Obama is and what he represents is just as important in the US presidential nomination campaign as what he says or what he proposes by way of policy .
He has come to embody everything the Democratic party has stood for and pursued for 50 years .
Barack Obama ’s candidacy is a movement as much as it is a campaign , with boisterous rallies , many volunteers and over a million small donors .
This movement has mobilised many new voters into the democratic process , particularly the young and independents ( citizens unaffiliated with either major party ) .
As a result of this enthusiasm , as well as the closeness of the race , turnout in Democratic primaries and caucuses across the nation has reached historic highs .
And yet there are wide differences of opinion over what the Obama candidacy represents .
To supporters , he is a fundamentally new force in US politics , who rises above partisanship and tells people to “ turn the page ” on the political gridlock inside Washington ’s Beltway .
To opponents within the Democratic party ( those supporting the candidacy of rival senator Hillary Clinton ) , he is nothing but bombast , coupled with youth and inexperience .
And to Republican partisans , he is beguiling but not mysterious : an old - fashioned tax - and - spend liberal , scarcely different from those who have come before .
Each of these perspectives has an element of truth .
The newness of this man , his freshness and vitality have provided plenty of material for the commentariat .
With a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas , Barack Obama was raised in Hawaii and in Indonesia , where his mother had moved to pursue her research for a doctoral degree in anthropology .
( She eventually re-married , providing Barack with an Indonesian stepfather . )
He attended college in California ( Occidental ) and New York ( Columbia ) , then moved to the south side of Chicago to serve as a community organiser before receiving his law degree in Massachusetts ( Harvard ) .
Barack Hussein Obama is a useful screen on which the world has projected many themes .
Messenger not architect
He is a messenger but not an architect of the modern Democratic party .
Novelties aside , Obama ’s candidacy is defined by many now - traditional Democratic themes .

Biofuels based on ethanol , vegetable oil and other renewable sources are increasingly popular with government and environmentalists as a way to reduce fossil fuel dependence and limit greenhouse gas emissions .
But new research led by a biologist at the University of Washington , Bothell , shows that some of the most popular current biofuel stocks might have exactly the opposite impacts than intended .
The authors of a paper published in the June issue of the journal Conservation Biology offer a dozen policy recommendations to promote sustainability and biodiversity in biofuel production .
The study looked at factors such as the energy needed to produce a renewable fuel source compared with how much energy is produced , the impact on soil fertility and effects on food supply when fuels based on crops such as corn and soybeans are mixed with fossil fuels .
Based on those factors , the authors determined that corn-based ethanol is the worst alternative overall .
" It 's foolish to say we should be developing a particular biofuel when that could mean that we 're just replacing one problem with another , " said lead author Martha Groom of the UW Bothell .
Co-authors are Elizabeth Gray of The Nature Conservancy and Patricia Townsend of the UW Seattle .
The authors argue that precise calculations are needed to determine the ecological footprints of large - scale cultivation of various crops used for biofuels .
They note , for example , that because such large amounts of energy are required to grow corn and convert it to ethanol , the net energy gain of the resulting fuel is modest .
Using a crop such as switchgrass , common forage for cattle , would require much less energy to produce the fuel , and using algae would require even less .
Changing direction to biofuels based on switchgrass or algae would require significant policy changes , since the technologies to produce such fuels are not fully developed .
The paper 's policy suggestions are " not definitive at all , " Groom said , " but rather each category calls out a question and is a starting point in trying to find the proper answers . "
These concerns are becoming more acute with the rapid rise of both food and fuel prices , she said .
The issue is especially touchy for farmers who might for the first time be realizing significant profits on their crops , but it also is a serious concern for motorists .

" I 've heard about people getting their gas tanks siphoned , and I had n't heard of that since the ' 70s , " she said .
A difficulty , Groom said , is that while escalating prices add pressure to find less costly fuel sources , acting too hastily could create a host of other problems .
For example , farmers who plant only corn because it is suddenly profitable , and do n't rotate with crops such as soybeans , are likely to greatly deplete their soil , which could limit crop growth and promote soil erosion .
Also , some plants are better than others for absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , while others perhaps need more cultivation , which requires more fossil fuel for farm equipment .
In addition , fertilization , watering and harvesting all require energy .
The study took about a year to conduct and is a synthesis of peer - reviewed research published in a various journals .
The scientists examined the literature looking for indicators of biofuels that are more sustainable and carry a smaller ecological footprint , then used that information to derive the policy recommendations .
The primary audiences for the work are policy makers , students and other biologists , Groom said .
The primary goals are to establish a logical basis to evaluate options for biofuel development and to spur new research to find the most ecologically promising alternatives .
" We do n't want to make new mistakes .
If we do n't ask the right questions to start with , we 're going to replace old problems with new ones , " she said .
Policy Recommendations
My friend and Wired writer extraordinaire Gary Wolf has been researching people who self - experiment .
He recently discovered a fascinating " champion of self - experimentation " named Seth Roberts , an emeritus professor of psychology at UC Berkeley .
Does standing up a lot during the day reduce susceptibility to colds ?
Go ahead and doubt it ; I did .
But Roberts has data to back it up , and while it would be foolish to believe that standing up a lot during the day would eliminate colds across an entire population — foolish , that is , without experiments to prove it — Roberts ' own practice of standing up a lot has a lot more empirical back - up than many of the more " sensible " things we naively believe .
Here 's anther one : for a long time Roberts had a problem with his sleep .
He woke too early , could not go back to sleep , and then was tired in the morning .
He tried different ways to cure this problem until , through a combination of coincidence , experiment and analysis of the data , he discovered an expected correlation : his problem disappeared when he skipped breakfast .
He cured his early awakening by not eating until 11 a.m .
The idea that skipping breakfast may reduce early awakening was , wrote Roberts , " a new idea in sleep research . "
Strangely , Roberts was not hungry in the wee hours when he was troubled by early awakening , which lead him to suspect that it was not discomfort that roused him , but rather some glitch in his sleep cycle caused by anticipation of food .
NOTE : I have a great relationship with my children 's book editor at S&S ( shortand those of us in the industry use when referring to Simon & Schuster ) , and I mean him no disrespect when I say that he 's a fucking idiot .
The text you are about to read is terrific with a capital " T . " I know this because my children told me so and they are both geniuses .
How do I know they are geniuses ?
Because I am a genius and they sprang from my loins .
You might argue that my logic is kind of circular here ( book I wrote is genius because my kids like it and they geniuses , which I know because I , the author of the book , annointed them as such ) , but I do n't want to get into a syllogistic * debate here .
The point is , you are on MY side , and not my schmucky editor's .
If you want to be on his side , go read his blog .
But just know that by reading his blog , it will be exactly the same as approaching me with a fountain pen and stabbing me in the heart .
But if that 's what you want to do , by all means go ahead .
Part of his criticsm with the text is he says there " scansion problems , " which is a fancy way of saying it does n't rhyme right .
To which I say - horse feathers !
I have read this book aloud over and over to my genius children , and not once did either myself of my children detect any problems in the way of scansion .
My theory : the scansion is TOO GOOD .
It 's basically SCANSION FROM THE FUTURE .
The other problem , he said , was that it sends the wrong message .
To which I say again : horse feathers !
And to which I add , cow pucky !
I am a master of sending the wrong message ; my entire career has based on inappropriate message - sending , so believe me when I tell you , the message of this book is exactly the RIGHT message , but it is a message which only reveals itself after careful reading of the Futurescansh **.
Anyway , I am publishing it here on my blog because I want others to enjoy it as much as my family did .
In fact , our laughter was the only thing that kept us warm this winter ; we could n't afford to heat our house because my editor rejected this manuscript .
I 'm considering this story my " Yankee Hotel Foxtrot . "
That 's the album that Wilco recorded , which their label rejected , and then the public outcry was so great for it got leaked online and eventually some other label distributed it , and it sold three and a half billion copies .
That 's basicaly what I 'm hoping happens with this .
Yes , I could just take it to another publisher , but that would betray my relationship with my editor , who really is a great guy even though he is being an obstinate fucker in the case of this particular book .
* I have no idea what syllogistic means , but I really hope I 'm using it correctly .
** Futurescansh = Scansion from the Future

Do NOT Eat Your Vegetables !
When mealtime comes , as it does thrice a day
Some well - meaning grown - up will undoubtedly say ,
“ Now Timothy , Margaret , Trudy , or Bert
If you do n’t eat your veggies you ca n’t have dessert . ”
Well …
If there ’s a brain in your head you ’ll instantly see
How unfair and uncalled for such statements can be .
Ca n’t have dessert ?
The injustice !
The gall !
Dessert ’s the only reason for eating at all !
Without dessert we ’re no better than beasts
Who forage the ground in search of their feasts .
I ’m not a rabbit , scrounging for cabbages .
Vegetables , I say , are fit only for savages !
When popsicles begin growing on trees
Perhaps then I will consider eating their leaves .
But until that day comes , I implore you :
Eat cupcakes and cookies !
Eat ice cream and candies !
Scrumptious brownies !
Warm pecan sandies !
Eat chocolate ice cream in a butterscotch shell .
That ’s what you eat when you want to eat well !
Do NOT eat your vegetables - no if , and , or but .
When they offer them to you , clamp your mouth shut .
No broccoli , madam .
No asparagus , sir .
Neither zucchini nor turnip should you have to endure .
My friends …
I ate a vegetable once .
‘ Twas a pea .
And that pea made me as peevish as peevish can be .
That round little lump of mushy green squish
Somehow found its way onto my dish .
( Where it came from , I have no idea .
Perhaps it arrived all the way from Korea . )
We stared at each other , that pea and I
Until , bravely , I decided to give it a try .
With a tentative pinch , I plucked up the orb
Which I touched to my tongue so I could absorb
Whatever hideous flavor that little pea had .
I tasted the thing , then started to gag .
The sensation was akin to eating the dirt !
It tasted so bad it practically hurt !
“ Ptooie ! ” said I , as I spat it away ,
Then collapsed in a bath that I filled with sorbet .
From that day forward , I swore North and South
To let no vegetable again touch my mouth !
IT WAS THE WORST DAY OF MY ENTIRE LIFE !
Do NOT eat your vegetables , young masters and misses
If your parents insist , then refuse them their kisses .
“ No goodnight kisses for you ! ” you must say .
If they want to play tough , then tough you will play !
Now …
Perhaps you are under the mistaken impression
That vegetables aid in proper digestion .
Or they magically somehow help bones to lengthen ,
Hair to grow , and bodies to strengthen .
Well that is a lie that I would like ended .
I do n’t eat veggies and I turned out splendid !
I ’m fit as a fiddle and strong as an ox .
Need proof ?
I can lift up this empty shoe box .
Here ’s more evidence if you still doubt the truth :
I ’ll open my mouth and show you my tooth .
See that ?
A perfectly formed little chopper
A little brown , yes , but still quite a whopper .
And here – look at this .
One half of a muscle .
You would n’t want to face THAT in a tussle !
So …
Do NOT eat your vegetables , I beg you once more
No rutabaga , peppers , spinach , or gourds .
Abstain from those foods which are fibrous or bitter .
Cream pies and custard will keep you much fitter .
All leafy things must be met firmly with scorn .
But if you MUST eat a veggie , I suggest candy corn .
Now that I ’m done I must go eat some frosting .
All this activity has been quite exhausting .
While those in London can use SMS to actually find a lavatory , folks passing through Western Finland will be required to bust out their handset in order to relieve themselves in select public restrooms .
In an attempt to curb vandalism , the Finnish Road Administration has implemented a system along Highway 1 which requires restroom visitors to text " Open " ( in Finnish , of course ) in order to let themselves in .
The idea is that folks will be less likely to lose their mind and graffiti up the place knowing that their mobile number is ( at least temporarily ) on file , but it remains to be seen if uprooters will simply take their defacing ways elsewhere or actually excrete in peace .

Debate between female newscaster and religious leader in Saudi Arabia
Americans are used to foreign cars — nearly half of us , after all , drive one — but no American has yet seen a vehicle bearing the brand name Tata Motors tooling along the highway .
So when , a few weeks ago , news broke that this same Tata Motors , an Indian auto company , was close to buying Jaguar and Land Rover , the first reaction of many was “ Who ? ”
The implausibility of the bid was magnified when Tata rolled out its newest product , a tiny , stripped - down car that will sell for a mere twenty - five hundred dollars .
The spectacle of a low - end specialist trying to buy a couple of established luxury brands looked to some like a cubic - zirconium peddler making a play for Tiffany .
Illustration by Cristoph Niemann
There ’s no denying the audacity of Tata ’s bid — the company has never sold a car in the U.S. — but there ’s also no denying Tata ’s distinguished pedigree : the parent company of Tata Motors ( called the Tata Group ) started in the nineteenth century , and , in the years since , its divisions have created India ’s first steel mill , provided electricity to Mumbai , started the country ’s first airline , and built its first locally made trains and automobiles .
Today , Tata is a huge conglomerate — ninety - eight companies producing everything from tea to steel and solar power — with annual revenues of around thirty billion dollars and a chairman whom Fortune recently named one of the twenty - five most powerful people in business .
If Tata is so powerful , why have so few Americans heard of it ?
In large part , because so much of its fortune has been made selling to its home market and to other developing countries , rather than to the U.S. and Europe .
Historically , developing - country firms that have become global powerhouses — like Japanese companies decades ago or , more recently , Korean companies like Samsung — were companies that , in addition to dominating their domestic markets , were heavily oriented toward exports to the West .
Tata — with some exceptions , such as its steel and consulting businesses — has taken a very different approach , becoming tremendously rich while selling to people who are still pretty poor .
Tata has been able to do this because of the way the global economy has changed .
Even three decades ago , selling to the U.S. and Europe made sense , because that ’s where all the money was .
Most developing countries had only a minuscule upper class and a tiny middle class , and business conditions in these countries were difficult at best .
Today , the economies of developing countries are still only a fraction of the size of Western economies , but many nonetheless have growing middle and upper classes with disposable income .
And , as the business professor C. K. Prahalad argues in his book “ The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid , ” even the poor in these countries constitute a market worth trillions of dollars .
Twenty years ago , few people in India could have afforded even a twenty - five - hundred - dollar car .
Today , tens of millions can .
Making money in developing countries remains challenging , of course , but meeting those challenges can actually help a company like Tata become a formidable global competitor , since figuring out how to earn a profit in markets where your selling prices are necessarily low forces a company to be innovative in thinking about how products are made and sold .
That may be why a huge wave of what you might call developing - country multinationals — companies like Mittal Steel , Lenovo , Chery Automobile , and Cemex — have recently begun to move aggressively into Western markets .
These are the advance guard of what ’s been called “ the emerging - markets century . ”
The distinctive thing about this trend is that the companies involved are n’t simply making stuff abroad and then shipping it here .
Instead , they ’re now using their wealth to take a shortcut , by buying up Western companies .
In 2005 , the Chinese computer company Lenovo bought I.B.M. ’s P.C. division , and the Mexican cement company Cemex acquired the British cement giant RMC .
Last year , India ’s Mittal Steel paid thirty - three billion for the Belgian company Arcelor , and Tata ’s steel company bought the British - Dutch steel producer Corus for more than eleven billion .
The acquisitions help companies avoid potential export restrictions , bring them closer to customers in the developed world , and provide a kind of instant credibility — at least , when the acquisitions are done well .
( Lenovo ’s ThinkPads , for instance , seem to be as well regarded as I.B.M. ’s once were . )
These deals are often also a way to acquire managerial and technological expertise .
It may very well be true , as many have suggested , that knowing how to build a twenty - five - hundred - dollar car does n’t mean that Tata will be able to build a seventy - thousand - dollar car .
But the people at Jaguar can , and buying Jaguar will give Tata quick access to that knowledge .
This buying spree could , of course , end badly .
When some Japanese companies in the nineteen - eighties went on a buying binge in the U.S. , they often ended up overspending .
But such an outcome would n’t change the fact that developing countries are now producing genuine global contenders .
Globalization , it once seemed , was mainly going to give companies in the U.S. , Europe , and Japan billions of new customers and plenty of cheap labor .
But it has also meant that these companies have had to face many more real competitors than they once imagined .
When we persuaded developing countries to open their doors to us , we also opened our doors to them .
Now they ’re walking through . ♦
The buyers of Clear Channel Communications received a curious e-mail message last July from Credit Suisse , one of the banks financing the radio broadcaster ’s sale .
But it was misdirected and not meant for their eyes .
Attached to the message were confidential documents from the six banks that had agreed to finance that $ 19.5 billion takeover .
What the prospective buyers , Bain Capital and THL Partners , found most startling was that the banks were discussing how they planned to renege on terms of the lending agreements , just two months after they had reaffirmed their commitment to financing the deal .
That e-mail message has set the stage for a big and complex battle over a broken private equity deal .
On Wednesday , Bain and THL filed suits against the bank consortium , naming Citigroup , Morgan Stanley , Deutsche Bank , the Royal Bank of Scotland and Wachovia , as well as Credit Suisse .
In New York on Monday , nearly 30 people from the private equity firms and banks met at the law firm of Ropes & Gray to try to reach an agreement .
But the banks refused to finance the deal , according to people involved in the meeting , one of whom described it as “ a lot of silent staring and awkward moments . ”
Analysis
If you download " the al Qaeda manual , " never share it , even if you 're a scholar - in - training studying terrorism .
Especially if you and the recipient go by the wrong kind of names .
In mid-May , University of Nottingham master 's student Rizwaan Sabir apparently sent the electronic manual to a school clerk , Hicham Yezza , for printing .
This triggered an investigation in which counter - terror police arrested the two and held them for six days , after which Sabir was released without charge .
However , Yezza was held on an immigration violation and is in custody , threatened with deportation to Algeria .
Reg readers know now that reading the wrong stuff in the UK gets you on the fast track to prison for one possession of something likely to be of use to potential terrorists .
Technically , get - out - of - jail - free cards have been issued for journalists and academics , both of which have a well - defined public interest in writing about and analyzing such documents .
However , under the current climate it 's inevitable that those with good reasons for possessing jihadi electronic documents will find themselves in anti-terror cross -hairs .
The paradox in this case is that the source of the so - called al Qaeda manual .
According to UK reports , Sabir downloaded it from the US government .
Readers may already know that when someone cites a document attributed to al Qaeda , it 's time to squint and look closely .
Because one either wo n't be getting the entire picture , or its historical context and provenance will be distorted in some interesting but painful and politically expedient manner .
The " al Qaeda manual " was posted to the US Department of Justice website years ago . *
It is more accurately known as the " Manual of Afghan Jihad " or " Military Studies in the Jihad [ Holy War ] Against the Tyrants . "
( Or simply the Manchester manual , from its place of confiscation . )
You can think of it as a mouldy oldy , dragged out and banged about to shake loose a dust of fear when counter - terror men need some to sprinkle on the polity .
The " Manual of Afghan Jihad " was obtained in Manchester in April 2000 by British anti-terrorism agents and subsequently turned over to the FBI 's Nanette Schumaker later that month .
It was originally the property of Nazib al Raghie , also known as Anas Al Liby to the US government .
Al Raghie was the equivalent of an old pensioner from the Afghan war living in retirement in Britain .
At the time the manual was confiscated during a counter - terror recce operation , UK authorities were not interested in him .
Neither , apparently , was the FBI and he was not arrested .
Not unexpectedly , he then disappeared .
Translations of it have been copied onto the web but at least two ( and possibly more ) primary sources for it lie within the jurisdiction of the US government , one on a Dept of Justice server and another at the Air Force 's Air University .
Since they 're officially sanctioned sites , they are seen as legitimate sources by those who would study it , as well as attracting the simply curious .
* The US DoJ originals of the manual , edited , are split into four parts , part one ; part two ; part three ; part four .
The Air University mirror , cited by the White House , hosts it here .
You likely saw the Wall Street Journal article on Intel and Microsoft 's efforts to crush / compete with the One Laptop Per Child project : Mr. Negroponte 's ambitious plan has been derailed , in part , by the power of his idea .
For - profit companies threatened by the projected $ 100 price tag set off at a sprint to develop their own dirt - cheap machines , plunging Mr. Negroponte into unexpected competition against well - known brands such as Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system .
A version of Mr. Negroponte 's vision is starting to come true .
Impoverished countries are indeed snapping up cheap laptops for their schoolchildren -- just not anywhere near as many of his as he expected .
They now have several cut - price models to choose from , raising the possibility that One Laptop Per Child , or OLPC , will end up as a niche player .
Nicholas Negroponte 's
One Laptop Per Child project sought to get $ 100 laptops into the hands of millions of the world 's poorest schoolchildren .
But for - profit versions of the laptop are competing fiercely in the developing world .
" I 'm not good at selling laptops , " Mr. Negroponte has told colleagues .
" I 'm good at selling ideas . "
I think the article overplays the " derailed " aspect , but leaving that aside , I started to wonder , what can we as a community do to help ?
Anything beyond participating in the Give One Get One campaign ?
The most obvious need , if we credit that Negroponte quotation , is for someone good at marketing .
Are you good at that ?
If so , can you volunteer ?
I have some ideas that I 'll throw out there , and maybe someone will find a way to add some more and implement them , and who knows ?
My ideas stem from observing how Intel is marketing its competing offering , and flipping it over .
Let me show you .
What Intel 's Classmate is Like and How They Market It I took a look at Intel 's ripoff of the OLPC as I think of it .
Here .
You can too .
A brochure with some specs [ PDF ] .
Here are some videos of the OLPC that you can enjoy and which might give you some ideas .
The Intel Classmate is only close to the idea behind OLPC , and only if you do n't look too closely .
But let 's look closely .
Look at the pictures , for starters .
Look how it looks after you open it .
Would you want to use a computer that looks like that ?
Would a child ?
If Intel asked me to market it so kids would like it , I would n't know where to start .
The Classmate looks to me to be just another laptop , only smaller and cheesier looking , with a too small screen ( it has a resizing feature , so you can cram a normal amount of a page on it , which I 'm guessing people leave on all the time ) and nothing a child would particularly enjoy by my reckoning , other than the fact that any laptop is better than none , except the digital pen , which is an optional addon , and I 'm guessing those pens disappear or get lost in no time .
And indeed Intel does n't market Classmate as something kids will love .
They market it as a laptop teachers and parents will find reassuring , because it gives them the illusion of control .
Now * that 's* significant .
I just learned something about marketing .
It 's about dreams , not about reality .
What dreams are Intel selling ?
Here 's the Classmate demo showing the parental monitoring / policy control feature .
Intel is using that to market the thing .
The parents can allegedly force kids to turn off the laptop and control what they can do with it , even in the classroom , even turning off the laptop while the child is in class .
Why would a parent ever want to do that ?
In real life , they never would , I 'm thinking .
It 's the illusion , just knowing that they can , not any reality , being sold .
I have some disturbing news for you parents and teachers :
The kids will work around the parental control system that regulates when and how the child can use the computer in no time flat .
So why is that one of Intel 's selling points ?
Because the adults they are selling to do n't know that it wo n't control the children at all ?
I expect it 's a big selling point , to those who are clueless about tech .
It 's like how Hollywood drooled over DRM , because they did n't have a tech clue and actually believed it would work .
That type of application can be done in GNU / Linux on the OLPC , by the way , if someone wanted to write an application to do that .
You can do whatever you want in GNU / Linux .
But OLPC has worked to design special security particularly suited to children , Bitfrost .
You do n't even need a separate application in a sense because it 's built in , and I 'd let parents and teachers know that in addition the Linux operating system comes with admin and user permissions , read , write , etc .
Just have the parent be admin and the child the user , and the parent really would have some meaningful control .
You can prevent access to anything in a GNU / Linux computer by what you allow in the way of permissions .
It 's easy .
And it mostly does work .
So if they do take a Classmate , at least choose the Linux version and implement those options .
Bitfrost works from the principle that kids wo n't be able to remember passwords , so it 's taken security one step beyond .
I 'm thinking to counteract Intel 's marketing , though , someone should just write a stupid application that purports to give parents and teachers " control " over the laptop , by making it so easy and GUI 'd up that it looks like Intel 's regimented offering .
Not literally like it , but with that aura .
It has to look easy to use and be easy to use , and at the same time be official and regimental in appearance , like it really will keep your children in a playpen you can control by pushing some buttons .
Kids get the tech way beyond the older generation , and they will figure out a bypass and then tell each other , whether in Windows or in GNU / Linux , but if that is a feature the adults crave , why not give it to them ?
If the adults want to dream that they can control their children 's use of computers , so be it .
See my idea ?
Sell the dream they are wanting to buy into .
Intel obviously spends a lot of money on marketing , and there 's no way to match that budget , but if you guys would write up some " parental control " features in an application with a fearsome - sounding name and some more applications for " interactive activities with teachers " to slap on the OLPC or at least find and list for them , I think that might really be useful .
For marketing .
In real life , Bitfrost is there already .
As for educational software , there is plenty of FOSS educational software already out there , like Moodle and Sakai .
Why not include it , or at least let them know about it with lists with links on the OLPC , so teachers know that it is available and freely available ?
Here 's the Moodle homepage : Moodle is a course management system ( CMS ) - a free , Open Source software package designed using sound pedagogical principles , to help educators create effective online learning communities .
You can download and use it on any computer you have handy ( including webhosts ) , yet it can scale from a single - teacher site to a University with 200,000 students .
It 's something that teachers can relate to , something for them .
But unless you tell them it 's available , and for free , I 'm guessing they might get the impression from Intel 's marketing that Classmate offers a feature that the OLPC can't , and that 's just not so .
The marketing Intel is doing is probably effective with adults who do n't quite understand computers themselves .
The marketing , to me , is selling old ideas , but because they are old ideas , they are familiar and comforting .
So if someone could please write some applications that provide similar comfort , or collect them for marketing , to add to OLPC 's offerings , those Classmate marketing bullet points are erased .
What OLPC Offers That Classmate Does n't First , the OLPC is great for classroom use , but that is n't all it offers by a mile .
You already know about the amazing tech advances , like the innovative screen that you can use in sunlight .
But there is more than that .
Classmate actually misses the fundamental point of the OLPC , as far as I 'm concerned , which is essentially that kids invariably grasp the tech before the parents and the teachers do , so why hold them back ?
OLPC is a way to educate kids who have inadequate school resources , in areas where there may not even be any adequate schools or teachers , maybe not any at all , let alone any that know anything about computers .
Here 's a bit about the OLPC vision : mission Most of the nearly twobillion children in the developing world are inadequately educated , or receive no education at all .
One in three does not complete the fifth grade .
The individual and societal consequences of this chronic global crisis are profound .
Children are consigned to poverty and isolation just like their parents never knowing what the light of learning could mean in their lives .
At the same time , their governments struggle to compete in a rapidly evolving , global information economy , hobbled by a vast and increasingly urban underclass that cannot support itself , much less contribute to the commonweal , because it lacks the tools to do so .
It is time to rethink this equation .
Given the resources that developing countries can reasonably allocate to education sometimes less than $ 20 per year per pupil , compared to the approximately $ 7500 per pupil spent annually in the U.S. even a doubled or redoubled national commitment to traditional education , augmented by external and private funding , would not get the job done .
Moreover , experience strongly suggests that an incremental increase of more of the same  building schools , hiring teachers , buying books and equipment is a laudable but insufficient response to the problem of bringing true learning possibilities to the vast numbers of children in the developing world .
What does Classmate do for those billions of children who have no education or none after the 5th grade , no one to show them how to function in the Classmate 's more regimented environment ?
I 'd say not so much , except that the Internet makes knowledge available to anyone who can connect and has figured out how to do that .
For that matter , if I were marketing OLPC , I 'd include a graphic of all the educational materials already available on the Internet and on the OLPC for any child in the world to use and learn from .
That treasure of knowledge is already there , already done , and all the children need is a way to reach it , which with the OLPC they can do this exact minute , with no one needed to even show them .
It just works .
But could you write some application to make it more readily available , so it 's already there on the OLPC , just an easy click from the list ?
Classmate is the old way , and that 's fine for those that can afford it and have good schools and plenty of teachers for one and all .
But for the problem that OLPC is addressing , what does it do ?
OLPC is n't just a laptop .
It 's an idea about education : Standing still is a reliable recipe for going backward .
Any nation 's most precious natural resource is its children .
We believe the emerging world must leverage this resource by tapping into the children 's innate capacities to learn , share , and create on their own .
Our answer to that challenge is the XO laptop , a children 's machine designed for learning learning .
XO embodies the theories of constructionism first developed by MIT Media Lab Professor Seymour Papert in the 1960s , and later elaborated upon by Alan Kay , complemented by the principles articulated by Nicholas Negroponte in his book , Being Digital .
Extensively field - tested and validated among some of the poorest and most remote populations on earth , constructionism emphasizes what Papert calls learning learning as the fundamental educational experience .
A computer uniquely fosters learning learning by allowing children to  think about thinking , in ways that are otherwise impossible .
Using the XO as both their window on the world , as well as a highly programmable tool for exploring it , children in emerging nations will be opened to both illimitable knowledge and to their own creative and problem - solving potential .
OLPC is not , at heart , a technology program , nor is the XO a product in any conventional sense of the word .
OLPC is a non-profit organization providing a means to an endan end that sees children in even the most remote regions of the globe being given the opportunity to tap into their own potential , to be exposed to a whole world of ideas , and to contribute to a more productive and saner world community .
I note that Intel is offering " training " to teachers , and indeed they'd have to , if they want teachers to understand the tech first and then have them teach the kids afterward .
The OLPC skips that step as being impractical and not necessary if you design the OLPC right .
Teachers do use the OLPC wonderfully , and parents can too -- in fact the interactive , cooperative social tools that are built in to the OLPC ensures that parents can have lots of fun with the children and that teachers can seamlessly interface with the children -- but most parents do n't know anything about computers , and most teachers do n't either .
That is true in the US as well .
Here 's what some teachers are saying about the OLPC after using it in their classrooms :
What teachers are saying  Before the laptop , the focus of the school curriculum and evaluation was to show what students do n't know .
Now , the focus is in what the student knows , and how this knowledge can be used as a support so they learn even more .
 With the laptop we can say that our school is really elevated because the children are really learning more ...
They see themselves discovering things that they have never been doing before .
 The bringing of the laptop into the school has brought a transformation into the school ...
It has brought another idea of how to teach better : now we see that teaching is not more abstract ; it 's something that pupils can see , and they catch on better . 
 Pupils go even beyond what I can teach in the class .
It 's a very interesting thing to use .
I personally have a better idea about teaching ...
We discovered that giving them time to discover something and to do it in their own way , they feel more happy and they are so excited in using it that ,  Yes , I discovered it !
Yes , I can get it !!
Yes , I can do this on my own !!!
Teaching is getting more interesting and less stressful .
I do n't think we will see that being said about the Classmate , simply because that is n't what it is for .
It 's OK for what it is marketed for , but it does n't attempt even to address the problems that OLPC is addressing .
Instead of waiting for that older generation to catch up , the OLPC makes learning available to children * today * , right now , without the need to train the oldsters first , using the natural way all children learn -- by trying things , by interacting with other children and adults , and by experimenting .
That is the part that speeds up the process , so it wo n't be two generations before the children can effectively learn .
Have you ever seen a child with access to a computer for the first time ?
They usually start banging on the keyboard and experimenting with the mouse , do n't they ?
Fearless .
Have you ever tried to teach your dad or grandma how to use a computer ?
They do n't dare touch anything , do they , without permission , because they are afraid of it , afraid they will break it by touching it .
Who learns first ?
If your dad is like mine , he never fully catches on .
If I had to wait for him to teach me , well ...
I love my dad , but I had to teach myself and find other contemporaries to help me .
All I know is that experimenting is a wonderful way to learn to use a computer , and I have n't broken one yet .
Sometimes you have to reinstall , but that is so easy in Linux -- just keep your home partition and reinstall the rest and you are good to go .
It much easier than in Windows , and you do n't have to get permission from the Mother Ship either .
Say , does the Windows Classmate come with WGA ?
I can just imagine how well * that * will work .
And do you want your kids to be tracked by Microsoft ?
I 'd do marketing on security and privacy , for real , and on upkeep and future costs of upgrading .
Some Other Ideas on How to Help Market OLPC
These are just my ideas , of course , and I have no connection to OLPC , so before you make any moves , it'd be wise to contact them and make sure no one is doing it already .
Here 's the developers page , and this page explains the software environment , principally Fedora and Python , it looks like .
And here 's a list of applications already done .
In OLPCland , they call applications Activities .
I can't wait to try Flipsticks .
I wish I 'd had that and Cartoon Builder , also on that list , when I was working on my video for the USPTO - Peer2 Patent project .
In other words , my idea stems from observing what Intel did .
They saw this wonderful idea , knew it would catch on , and so they figured out what to say to blunt its appeal and redirect it to them , and they market that .
Why could n't the community turn that on its back , flip it over or copyleft it , so to speak ?
All we'd have to do is see what they are pushing and make sure OLPC has it too , on top of all the other wonderful things Classmate does n't offer .
For example , Intel is also marketing Classmate like this : IA - based , runs on already available content , applications and operating systems with full compatibility to standard PC ecosystem
They mean Windows , of course , although the Classmate can do Linux too .
So if someone could prepare a demo that shows how easy it is for kids on OLPC to interface with Window - using folks , I think that would be helpful too .
If you have one already , maybe you could do such a video or a review for Groklaw .
Or for anywhere .
I 'd like to see marketing materials that include information on how once you learn any operating system , you can use pretty much any other , that what children learn with OLPC , with the key to view the source code , is how computers do what they do .
That knowledge makes it possible to use any other operating system very easily .
I know you know that , but those parents and government representatives trying to decide what to order do n't .
They probably actually believe that if you do n't grow up using Windows , you will be lost when it 's time to get a job .
I know .
It 's laughable , but they probably do think that , and from my viewing of Intel 's marketing , I 'd say that this is an idea they are promoting .
So why not just respond effectively , in a way that the parents and government representatives can understand ?
The simple truth is there is nothing Classmate offers that OLPC can't do , and OLPC offers something beyond that and on top of that .
I 'd like to see marketing stressing that the world is switching to Linux in a big way .
It 's the future .
It 's obvious to you and me that children learning Linux will be miles ahead of children learning only Windows , as far as comprehension of computing and computer skills go -- indeed look at what OLPC has now , Guido van Robot , which teaches kids how to program .
Here 's what Guido van Robot offers : Guido van Robot is a localized minimalistic programming language providing just enough syntax to help students learn the concepts of sequencing , conditional branching , looping and procedural abstraction .
Its biggest strength is that it permits this learning in an environment that combines the thrill of problem - solving with instant visual feedback .
In short , it is an interactive , introductory programming language that is excellent for learning the basic concepts of programming , applicable in any high - level language .
Best of all , it 's a whole lot of fun , too !
Anything like that in Classmate ?
Hardy har .
Would kids rather do that or do school activities led by teachers ?
For that matter , how many teachers can teach what Guido van Robot does ?
See the point ?
If you go through our News Picks , just a list of all the places in the world that governments are switching to Linux would be a useful graphic , I think , for marketing .
Let them understand that without this knowledge , the young people will be handicapped in the modern world .
I personally believe that the local economies will benefit directly from children learning Linux , because you can build businesses at a very low cost , based on your skills and ingenuity , not how much money you have to invest in infrastructure and software licenses , and without sending your money to a software vendor outside of the local economy .
No doubt you can find quotations from experts saying that and marketing materials could include it .
You also have protection from common malware that Windows users so often suffer from , and when I think of those children and all that can happen in a Windows environment , I worry for them and for the Internet .
So the marketing should include information on security built in to OLPC and some easy to find statistics on 0wned computers in the wild already .
This is a very strong selling point , I think .
Here 's one article with some statistics , to get you started .
Here 's a YouTube demo of the two , and you 'll see the difference in the screen size between OLPC and Classmate even if you do n't understand Portuguese , but if you see the part showing the specs , I think you 'll see how someone could be misled into thinking that they need the Classmate for more power .
For example , it lists the Classmate at 900 MHz , OLPC at 500 ; Classmate storage space at 1 GB , OLPC at 512 ; memory 256 for Classmate , 128 for OLPC .
Those are probably old figures , but can't you see how some might react by assuming that makes the Classmate better ?
That seems to be the point of that video , actually .
While it 's always desirable to have more memory and speed , what some might not know is that Linux does n't need more power .
It runs just fine on much less .
And the OLPC project is customized to cut back on power consumption quite deliberately .
It 's a feature , not a bug .
And here 's a question for you : can Classmate run Vista ?
Ever ?
Perhaps they are working on that , but surely it can't now , since Microsoft says you need a 1 Ghz processor and a 20 GB hardrive with 15 GBs available just for Home Basic , the lowest version , so already those kids on a Windows Classmate are behind the times , if you think about it .
Well , you get the concept .
I do n't know if anyone is ever going to actually use Vista much .
But , when it 's time to upgrade , will it be free or will the schools then pay again ?
Will it be at the special rate then ?
Did you get that in writing ?
For that matter , I 'd tell the adults that they can put the OLPC software on their other computers if they have one available and want to , and get even more mileage .
Make sure they know .
Here 's my list then of marketable ideas : 1 . Kids love OLPC .
It 's designed to please them .
They will love to learn using it , and you wo n't have to beg them to do their homework .
2 . Parents and teachers can control what the children can do , because GNU / Linux has tools built in to do that , if desired .
3 . Children can learn computers without adults needing to do so first .
OLPC even teaches them how to program .
4 . There are lesson plans and interactive projects that teachers can use in the classroom with OLPC .
But even if there is no school and no teacher , or no competent teachers , your child will learn and keep up with the world anyway , and when it 's time to enter the job market , he or she will have marketable skills .
5 . There are no hidden , future costs of upgrading .
6 . Linux is the future .
If your kids do n't learn it , they will be at a disadvantage in the market .
7 . If they learn Linux , they can use any other operating system .
8 . Applications are available that behave a lot like Microsoft Office .
There is no meaningful learning curve , and the children will be able to interact with others using Windows .
9 . The Firefox browser , included on OLPC , opens up the world of learning to your children .
10 .
No one tracks your child 's activities on an OLPC , and malware is not a problem in GNU / Linux to the same degree it is in Windows , so your children should be safer .
Other Ways to Help
You can participate , as I mentioned , in the Give One Get One offer , which has been extended through December 31 .
I hope they extend it indefinitely , myself .
I 'll bet you know some kids that would love to have one , and you'd be teaching them too the joy of giving and sharing with other children in the world .
Schools can participate too , not just individuals , by the way .
Alabama figured that out already .
You can contribute to translation .
Here 's the page of the latest OLPC news and the archives , so you can see what others have done and are doing to help .
You can subscribe to the OLPC mailing list to keep up to date , so your ideas will mesh well .
But What Dream Can OLPC Market ?
The real one -- that your children can have a better life than you do .
That they can leap over the boundaries that restrict you , by learning more than you know , even if the schools are underfunded and understaffed and technically backward , even if you have no money to spend on their education , and that after they learn they will show you , too .
Is that not every parent 's dream ?
That their child will succeed beyond what the parent ever did ?
That is a dream worth marketing .
Because it 's true .
The Big Here
You live in the big here .
Wherever you live , your tiny spot is deeply intertwined within a larger place , imbedded fractal - like into a whole system called a watershed , which is itself integrated with other watersheds into a tightly interdependent biome .
( See the world eco-region map ) .
At the ultimate level , your home is a cell in an organism called a planet .
All these levels interconnect .
What do you know about the dynamics of this larger system around you ?
Most of us are ignorant of this matrix .
But it is the biggest interactive game there is .
Hacking it is both fun and vital .
The following exercise in watershed awareness was hatched 30 years ago by Peter Warshall , naturalist extraordinaire .
Variations of this list have appeared over the years with additions by Jim Dodge , Peter Berg , and Stephanie Mills among others .
I have recently added new questions from Warshall and myself , and I have edited or altered most of the rest .
It 's still a work in progress .
If you have a universal question you think fits , submit it to me .
I am extremely interested in hearing from anyone who scores a 25 or better on the quiz on their first unassisted try .
I 'd like to know how you got your Big Here education .
I have a few small prizes for anyone who scores ( on the honor system ) a perfect 30 , without Googling .
The intent of this quiz is to inspire you to answer the questions you can't initially .
I 'd like to collect and then post the best step - by - step suggestions about how to answer a particular question .
These are not answers to the quiz , but recommended paths on how one might most efficiently answer the question locally .
Helpful websites which can provide local answers are wanted .
Because of the severe specificity of local answers , the methods provided should be as general as possible .
The emerging list of answer - paths will thus become the Cool Tool .
Post your methods in the comment section for each question linked in red to my Help Wanted page .
I will award a copy of the next paper - book version of Cool Tools to the person providing what I consider the best solution method (s ) for each question .
