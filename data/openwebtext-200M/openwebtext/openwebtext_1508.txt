The one index that just refused to correlate to the market , and the UMichigan Index , and the Confidence Board , was released today , and once again hit a 2010 low of - 49 .
The index has been in a - 48 to - 49 range for the past five weeks .
The primary reason for this week 's drop was due to a 6 point decline in the personal finance component , from - 6 to - 12 , the lowest reading since December 6 , with not much change in the other two readings : National Economy and Buying Conditions .
It is somewhat confounding that this index persistently " refuses " to go up with all the other self - reinforcing confidence indices out there .
Maybe this is the reason : from the report " Eighty - eight percent think that the economy , despite what economists say to the contrary , is still in a recession . "
From the press release :
Consumer confidence is on a cold streak , locked in place since the beginning of the year at very near its worst - ever rating – and more than three in four think the economy is stalled or will decline in coming months .
The ABC News Consumer Comfort Index stands at - 49 on its scale of +100 to - 100 , in a 2 - point range and without significant movement for the past six weeks .
It is hovering just 5 points from its all - time low , - 54 last January , and is far worse than its long - term average , - 13 in 24 years of weekly polls .
A separate , forward - looking measure finds little in the way of optimism for the economy ’s future .
Just 23 percent think things are getting better and 77 percent say the economy is staying the same or getting worse – a chilling assessment given the very low ratings of current sentiment .
And the clincher :
A key indicator from last week ’s ABC News / Washington Post poll underscores these persistent negative feelings .
Eighty - eight percent think that the economy , despite what economists say to the contrary , is still in a recession .
And on a more personal note , 53 percent say that based on their experience the economy has not begun to recover .
Propaganda fail .

I 'm sorry to say that I wo n't be releasing the Facebook data I 'd hoped to share with the research community .
In fact I 've destroyed my own copies of the information , under threat of a lawsuit from Facebook .
As you can imagine I 'm not very happy about this , especially since nobody ever alleged that my data gathering was outside the rules the web has operated by since crawlers existed .
I followed their robots .
txt directions , and was even helped by microformatting in the public profile pages .
Literally hundreds of commercial search engines have followed the same path and have the same data .
You can even pull identical information from Google 's cache if you do n't want to hit Facebook 's servers .
So why am I destroying the data ?
This area has never been litigated and I do n't have enough money to be a test case .
Despite the bad taste left in my mouth by the legal pressure , I actually have some sympathy for Facebook .
I put them on the spot by planning to release data they were n't aware was available .
I know from my time at Apple that reaching for the lawyers is a tempting first option when there 's a nasty surprise like that .
If I had to do it all over again , I 'd try harder not to catch them off - guard .
So what 's the good news ?
From my conversations with technical folks at Facebook , there seems to be a real commitment to figuring out safeguards around the widespread availability of this data .
They have a lot of interest in helping researchers find ways of doing worthwhile work without exposing private information
To the many researchers I 've disappointed , there 's a whole world of similar data available from other sources too .
By downloading the Google Profile crawling code you can build your own data set , and it 's easy enough to build something similar for Twitter .
I 'm already in the middle of some new research based on public Buzz information , so this wo n't be stopping my work , and I still plan to share my source data with the research community in the future .

IPCC ’s Dr. Pachauri must be having a conniption fit about now , since he ’s been an advocate of meat free global warming salvation .
From the American Chemical Society :
Eating less meat and dairy products wo n’t have major impact on global warming
SAN FRANCISCO , March 22 , 2010 — Cutting back on consumption of meat and dairy products will not have a major impact in combating global warming — despite repeated claims that link diets rich in animal products to production of greenhouse gases .
That ’s the conclusion of a report presented here today at the 239th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society .
Air quality expert Frank Mitloehner , Ph.D. , who made the presentation , said that giving cows and pigs a bum rap is not only scientifically inaccurate , but also distracts society from embracing effective solutions to global climate change .
He noted that the notion is becoming deeply rooted in efforts to curb global warming , citing campaigns for “ meatless Mondays ” and a European campaign , called “ Less Meat = Less Heat , ” launched late last year .
Reducing consumption of meat and dairy products might not have a major impact in combating global warming despite claims that link diets rich in animal products to production of greenhouse gases .

“ We certainly can reduce our greenhouse - gas production , but not by consuming less meat and milk , ” said Mitloehner , who is with the University of California - Davis .
“ Producing less meat and milk will only mean more hunger in poor countries . ”
The focus of confronting climate change , he said , should be on smarter farming , not less farming .
“ The developed world should focus on increasing efficient meat production in developing countries where growing populations need more nutritious food .
In developing countries , we should adopt more efficient , Western - style farming practices to make more food with less greenhouse gas production , ” Mitloehner said .
Developed countries should reduce use of oil and coal for electricity , heating and vehicle fuels .
Transportation creates an estimated 26 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. , whereas raising cattle and pigs for food accounts for about 3 percent , he said .
Mitloehner says confusion over meat and milk ’s role in climate change stems from a small section printed in the executive summary of a 2006 United Nations report , “ Livestock ’s Long Shadow . ”
It read : “ The livestock sector is a major player , responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions measured in CO2e ( carbon dioxide equivalents ) .
This is a higher share than transport . ”
Mitloehner says there is no doubt that livestock are major producers of methane , one of the greenhouse gases .
But he faults the methodology of “ Livestock ’s Long Shadow , ” contending that numbers for the livestock sector were calculated differently from transportation .
In the report , the livestock emissions included gases produced by growing animal feed ; animals ’ digestive emissions ; and processing meat and milk into foods .
But the transportation analysis factored in only emissions from fossil fuels burned while driving and not all other transport lifecycle related factors .
“ This lopsided analysis is a classical apples - and - oranges analogy that truly confused the issue , ” he said .

I started my Deadlands campaign with the excellent Cray Canyon Cold Snap - it seemed to fit right in with the theme of the world , and let me concentrate on learning the system !
However , there 's no reason why you could n't slip it in anywhere in a campaign .
The PCs are on a train , things go wrong ... you get the idea .
The main antagonist is pretty creepy , especially if he just wo n't die !
We had a pretty memorable scene where Berstock ran along the roof of the train while the PCs tried to shoot him from below ...
Where to go from here :
How do the heroes get back to civilisation ?
Do the Rail Baron 's cronies come after them to question them about the events ?
Reward them ?
Offer them a job ..?
Legalizing Marijuana to Be on Ballot for Californians Californians will vote on a measure to legalize posession of up to an ounce .
March 28 , 2010  -- Richard Lee is a well - known businessman in Oakland , Calif .
His business is marijuana -- and it is booming .
From his coffee house selling medical marijuana , to his trade school for marijuana growers , Oaksterdam University , Lee employs 58 people and pays hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in taxes .
But last week , Lee achieved what is arguably his biggest success yet , after California 's secretary of state ruled that his campaign to make marijuana legal had gathered enough signatures to place the issue before voters this November .
" I 've always thought since I grew up in the '70s that cannabis prohibition is unjust and hypocritical , " Lee said .
The initiative would allow adults 21 or older to possess up to an ounce of marijuana for personal use .
It also would allow the growing of up to 25 square feet of marijuana per residence .
If the ballot measure is approved , California would become the first state to allow the recreational use of pot .
It is likely to be a fierce campaign .
Lee , a 47 - year - old taciturn transplant from Texas , spent $ 1 million from his marijuana businesses -- all of them legal -- on the petition drive that got the referendum on the ballot .
And now he hopes to raise $ 20 million for the fall campaign .
He 's being advised by some well - known political strategists , most notably Chris Lehane , who worked in the White House under President Bill Clinton and was a top operative in Al Gore 's 2000 presidential race
" We 're starting radio commercials Monday in Los Angeles and the Bay Area and we have over 100,000 friends of Facebook , " Lee said .
" We 're raising money from all over the United States on the Internet because people know this is a national issue and it starts in California . "
But opponents are mobilizing , too .
Pastor Ron Allen of Sacramento is one of the leaders of a coalition of cops and clergy who say legalizing marijuana will lead to the use of harder drugs and only cause more problems for society .
For Allen , this is also a personal crusade .
He was a crack cocaine addict for seven years , and he says it all started with marijuana .
Passage " would devastate California to the fullest extent .
...
This is the worst thing that California could ever try to do , " Allen said .
Legalizing Marijuana to Be Put to a Vote in California
" To legalize marijuana with our kids , we are going to see more dropouts , we are going to see more crime , we are going to see more thefts , and we are going to see our kids just hanging out on the corner , " he said .
Still , opposition to legalization is easing , both in California and nationally .
Indeed , in some ways , Lee is a living symbol of how marijuana is becoming mainstream .
His Oaksterdam University -- the name is a marriage of Oakland and drug - tolerant Amsterdam -- has grown to three campuses in California and one in Michigan .
More than 4,000 people are expected to take classes this year .
The school , which boasts that it provides " quality training for the cannabis industry , " and Lee 's other businesses have helped to revitalize part of downtown Oakland and turn the city into something of an unofficial capital of the legalization movement .
Oakland already has passed its own version of the statewide ballot question .
Its referendum directed the Oakland police to make enforcement of marijuana laws their lowest priority .
Lee was a prime mover behind that ballot question , too .
An ABC News / Washington Post poll in January found that 46 percent of Americans support legalizing small amounts of marijuana for personal use , up from 39 percent in 2002 and 22 percent in 1997 .
A Field Poll last year found that 56 percent of Californians support the idea .
In 1996 , California became the first state to make medical marijuana legal .
Thirteen states have followed suit , and more are considering it .
Making recreational use legal is the next logical step , Lee said .
And in these tough times , he and other advocates say they have a powerful new argument : Governments need the cash that taxing marijuana could generate .
" The bad economy has definitely helped us out a lot as far as opening up a lot of people 's minds to seeing that this is a waste of money and that we need to use our public funds better and tax these people , " Lee said .
Advocates say taxing marijuana could generate $ 1.4 billion in revenue for California every year , and save the state tens if not hundreds of millions dollars more in enforcement costs .
Legalizing Marijuana to Be Put to a Vote in California
But any tax revenue derived from legalizing marijuana would be " blood money , " Allen said .
" They would have to have new smokers and new smokers would be our youth and our next generation , " Allen said .
" And the money that they are talking about gaining on taxes , they are not telling us on how much more the parents will spend on funerals , on how much more the kids are going to spend in the emergency room , " he said .
" It will exceed those taxes . "
The referendum 's passage would set up a clash with federal law , which still considers marijuana a dangerous drug .
But Lee and other advocates said they doubt the federal government would ever come after individuals for smoking pot .
If you want to see the unvarnished , true nature of our latest president , you need look no farther than two issues : whether to tax health plans that are deemed " too generous " and whether or how to tax the banks that brought about the financial crisis .
In the case of the health insurance tax , President Obama , after opposing the idea as a candidate when it was proposed by Republican candidate John McCain , is endorsing the Senate bill 's approach , which would levy a 40 % tax on all insurance plans that cost more than $ 8500 for an individual or $ 23,000 for a family .
According to the union movement such a tax would hit one in four union members , who over years of struggle have negotiated decent medical benefits , often foregoing pay increases in order to provide members with health coverage .
It would also hit employers with older workforces , smaller employers , who have to pay more for insurance , and also employers in parts of the country where the overall payscales and cost of living are higher , such as the Northeast and the West Coast .
Obama says he thinks that taxing such plans ( which are hardly " Cadillac " in today 's health marketplace ) , would help restrain health inflation .
More important , he and the Senate backers of the measure , like that it is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to bring in $ 149 billion in revenue over 10 years .
( Note that we 're talking about just $ 14.9 billion per year - - a rather minor sum compared to the total US healthcare bill of $ 2.5 trillion a year , or the taxpayer 's share of that bill - - $ 1.2 trillion . )
The claim that taxing health plans which provide better coverage to people will reduce health care costs overall is spurious and based upon the work of ideological free - market economists who take it on faith that healthcare is a good which " consumers " use based upon price .
This notion is far from proven and in fact many studies show it to be flat - out wrong .
Most people have no idea what the price or cost of any treatment is .
Whether they are in a preferred provider plan ( PPO ) or an HMO , most people do n't know what a visit to the doctor actually costs , do n't know what their medicine actually costs , and do n't know the cost of a stay in the hospital .
They only know what their co-pay amount is .
Furthermore , when people are sick , they generally go to doctors that they believe will cure them , not to the cheapest doctor .
The only thing that taxing better health insurance plans will do is lead employers to cut back on the benefits offered by those plans -- most likely dropping things like mental health coverage , dental coverage , payment for medical tests , etc. , and raising the co-pays .
Aside from the basic unfairness of penalizing workers who have fought hard at the bargaining table to win better benefits , this tax plan simply lowers the bar for all people in terms of what quality of health insurance they receive from their employer .
When union plans get whacked , you can bet that non-union plans will also get whacked , since the main reason non-union employers even offer health insurance is to help keep unions at bay .
This tax is a body blow to the union movement , plain and simple .
( And to anyone who believes that employers who cut back on health plans will offer the savings to workers as higher wages , I have a bridge in New York to sell you , cheap . )
Meanwhile , an alternative proposal to raise the same money to fund government health care programs -- a supplemental tax on all families earning more than $ 1 million a year -- something that is long overdue in a nation where the income divide between rich and poor has been widening to a chasm over the past decade -- is going nowhere .
Obama opposes taxing the rich .
So do Senate Democrats .
If it 's a choice between taxing unionized workers and taxing the rich , the workers get the shaft from President Obama .
Now let 's turn to the banksters .
Here , the challenge facing the president is that the American public , left , right and middle , is incensed over the huge amount of money -- trillions of taxpayer dollars -- that has been shoveled out to the banks , with very little increase in lending to show for it , and at the billions of dollars in bonuses that the banks are paying to their top executives and employees -- the very people who made the bad bets and risky investments that produced the current recession / depression .
So , this being an election year , Obama and the Democrats in Congress are looking for a way to at least appear to be taking the banks to task and making them repay the as much as $ 120 billion that has already been lost .
Obama 's proposal is a tax on the big banks -- either on their profits , or based upon the riskiness of their investments and loans .
That would be fine as far as it goes , but for the fact that bank accountants can easily make profits vanish through accounting sleight of hands , and to the fact that there is no easy way to define what is risky .
The chances are good that such a tax would be largely ceremonial .
Meanwhile , rejected from consideration is a proposal that would generate large amounts of revenue while hitting only those who speculate in markets -- primarily the wealthy - - a small tax on stock and bond trades .
A tax of 0.5 % on securities transactions could raise anywhere from $ 50 - 100 billion a year , experts say , and because it would only be levied on short - term trades , it would not impact long - term investors such as people investing in retirement funds at all .
It would also have the likely effect of reducing market volatility -- not a bad idea .
Although the US already has a very minor transaction tax of 0.0033 % , meaning it long ago crossed that Rubicon , the Obama administration will not hear of the idea of significantly raising that tax , though it would fall almost entirely on hedge funds and the wealthy , and on the brokerage arms of the big banks , who would stand to see their business -- trading securities for clients -- shrivel .
It 's not as though this is a particularly radical idea -- there are such taxes in place in the UK ( .03 % ) , as well as Australia , India , Austria , Finland , Germany , Singapore , Hong Kong , Korea , Taiwan and Japan .
Here are two cases where the Obama administration is clearly showing its true colors : no pain for the wealth and the powerful , and stick it to the working stiff .
This is n't " change we can believe in . "
It 's the same old crap we 've been being dished for years .

One more time White House spokesman Robert Gibbs was asked to say that the President was committed to getting Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell repealed this year .
Gibbs refused , again .
In fact , today Gibbs made it pretty clear that the White House does n’t want a repeal this year , which directly contradicts what the President said in his State of the Union address just three months ago .
Here ’s the quote from the White House transcript :
This year , I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are .
( Applause . )
It ’s the right thing to do .
( Applause . )
It is still the right thing to do , but , apparently it ’s not being done “ this year , ” despite that promise .
Pam Spaulding heard the same thing as we did from Gibbs .
Her post is titled , “ Robert Gibbs finally admits the Obama Admin has no intention of pushing DADT repeal in 2010 . ”
There is a serious danger of Democrats losing the House this fall .
And regardless , everyone expects the Democrats to lose a good number of seats .
There wo n’t be the large Democratic majorities that exist today ( and it ’s not like today we ’re seeing any great action on DADT , ENDA or DOMA ) .
That ’s why we want — and need — repeal to happen this year .
This year is what the President promised us .
Here is Advocate reporter Kerry Eleveld questioning Gibbs today at the White House :
Q Let me get back to the question .
So there was the heckling on Monday night , there ’s the veterans yesterday at the White House gates handcuffing themselves to the fence .
All of these actions are aimed at getting repeal this year , something the White House has sort of declined to commit to since the State of the Union address .
Has the White House misjudged the level of patience among LGBT and grassroots activists on this ?
MR. GIBBS : No .
Again , I would remind anybody on this issue — look , first of all , I will say this .
Obviously the President made a commitment in the presidential campaign , and understands the passion that people hold the belief that all should be able to serve .
The President holds that belief too .
But I would remind folks that was n’t a belief that the President held in 2007 — that ’s a belief that the President held in running for the Senate as far back as 2003 .
The President has made and is committed to making this changed law .
I do n’t think he ’s underestimated the — as you said , the patience of some .
The President wants to see this law changed , just as you ’ve heard the Chair of the Joint Chiefs and others in the military say that it ’s time for that change to happen .
Q
But he ’s committed to them letting the Pentagon work through its working group process until December 1st , is that true ?
He ’s committed to that ?
MR . GIBBS : Yes .
The President has set forward a process with the Joint — the Chair of the Joint Chiefs and with the Secretary of Defense to work through this issue .
Q
Before any legislative action is taken — that rules out legislative action this year ?
MR .
GIBBS : Well , again — the House and the Senate are obviously a different branch of government .
The President has a process and a proposal I think that he believes is the best way forward to seeing , again , the commitment that he ’s made for many years in trying to — changing that law .
That ’s nice that Obama supported repeal back in 2003 and 2007 .
But , now he ’s the President and he can actually make it happen .
It ’s weird that Gibbs is bringing up old campaign promises to somehow prove that the President is serious today , when there ’s growing evidence that he is backing off of his promises .
There are lots of people on the Hill who will use the President ’s failure to push for repeal this year as a signal that they should n’t do it , period .
That ’s why Barney Frank said last week that the President ’s silence is now costing us votes .
All of this is exacerbated by members of the President ’s legislative team telling Hill offices that they do n’t want repeal this year , as we learned via SLDN ’s Aubrey Sarvis on Monday .
Then again , it does n’t sound like Gibbs wants it either .
And we know Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina does n’t .
The White House political team “ misjudged the level of patience among LGBT and grassroots activists on this ” and other issues .
They ’re making a calculation that it ’s a better political move to hold off on repeal until next year or later .
They probably expect cover from the Human Rights Campaign and other connected gays , and they ’ll probably get it .
But HRC is not the powerhouse it once was , or we would n’t be in the current predicament of voting for a President who is now breaking his top promises .
I have no doubt that someone inside the White house political shop is asking : “ What are they going to do ?
Vote Republican ? ”
What I fear is that a lot of people – gays , enviros , women , labor , Latinos , and more , may simply not vote at all .
Turnout matters .
It ’s Elections 101 .
So spare us the “ who are you going to vote for , Palin ? ” talk .
It ’s condescending , and it ignores the reality of how much enthusiasm matters to a campaign .
If DADT is n’t repealed and ENDA is n’t passed this year , Obama is going to start his reelection campaign with a serious gay problem .
And , it ’s going to be even worse when the mastermind behind this failed DADT strategy , Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina , is named campaign manager .
It ’s all so unnecessary .
Repealing DADT is a “ no - brainer . ”
Polls show amazing support and even Dick and Liz Cheney are on our side .
I just think that the White House and the DNC are making a serious miscalculation as to how much damage they are causing with a core Democratic constituency .
The Wonk Room has the video :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWlKnTyBbiM]
In the January 2010 copy of IEEE Computer , David Parnas published an article , “ Really Rethinking ‘ Formal Methods ’ ” ( sorry , you ’ll need an IEEE subscription or purchase the article to access it ) , with the following abstract :
We must question the assumptions underlying the well - known current formal software development methods to see why they have not been widely adopted and what should be changed .
I found some of the opinions therein to be antiquated , so I wrote a letter to the editor ( free content ! ) , which appears in the March 2010 edition .
IEEE also published a response from David Parnas , which you can also access at the letter link above .
I ’ll refrain from visiting this debate here , but please have a look at the letters , enjoy the controversy , and do not hesitate to leave a comment !

Dr. Hanson of NOAA said today that the new study does not in any way contradict the findings reported by the NASA scientists and others .
He said that his study , in which he was joined by George A. Maul and Thomas A. Karl , also of NOAA , looked at only the 48 contiguous states .
Dr. Hanson said that global warming caused by the greenhouse effect might have been countered by some cooling phenomenon that has not yet been identified and that the readings in his study recorded the net effect .
'' We have to be careful about interpreting things like this , '' he said .
What About Urbanization ?
One aspect of the study that Dr. Hanson said was interesting was the finding that the urbanization of the United States has apparently not had a statistically significant effect on average temperature readings .
A number of scientists have theorized that the replacement of forests and pastures by asphalt streets and concrete buildings , which retain heat , is an important cause of rising temperatures .
Dr. Hansen of NASA said today that he had '' no quarrel ' ' with the findings in the new study .
He noted that the United States covered only 1.5 percent of Earth .
'' If you have only one degree warming on a global average , how much do you get at random ' ' when taking measurements in such a relatively small area , he asked rhetorically .
'' We are just arguing now about whether the global warming effect is large enough to see , '' he added .
'' It is not suprising we are not seeing it in a region that covers only 1.5 percent of the globe . ''
Dr. Hansen said there were several ways to look at the temperature readings for the United States , including as a ' ' statistical fluke . ''
Possibililty of Countereffects
Another possibility , he said , was that there were special conditions in the United States that would tend to offset a warming trend .
For example , industrial activity produces dust and other solid particles that help form liquid droplets in the atmosphere .
These droplets reflect radiation away from Earth and thus have a cooling influence .
The actor : Danny
Trejo has played a lot of colorful roles over the course of his prolific career , but few are as dramatic and larger - than - life as the actor playing them .
Trejo was a teenage drug addict , a bank robber , and a convict before going straight , turning his life around , and becoming a drug counselor , a position he holds today .
Working as an extra on 1985 ’s Runaway Train led to a bigger gig as Eric Roberts ’ boxing coach , and a larger role in the film .
Trejo has n’t stopped working in film and television since .
Along with Cheech Marin , he ’s a core member of Robert Rodriguez ’s repertory troupe , appearing in Desperado , Planet Terror , the Spy Kids movies , and just about everything Rodriguez has been involved in .
In 2006 , Trejo got rave reviews for a rare dramatic role as a recovering drug addict who hooks up with Maggie Gyllenhaal in SherryBaby .
After decades of bit and supporting parts , Trejo makes an unexpected but long - overdue transition to much - buzzed - about leading man/action hero in Rodriguez ’s Machete , the feature - film version of the trailer of the same name that appeared in Grindhouse .
In the feverishly anticipated film , Trejo toplines a cast that includes Robert De Niro , Steven Seagal , Jessica Alba , Don Johnson , Cheech Marin , Lindsay Lohan , and Michelle Rodriguez .
In addition , Trejo is re-teaming with Rodriguez for Predators , the second Predator sequel — Rodriguez is producing , Nimród Antal is directing — and he recently took small but memorable roles on Breaking Bad and in the 2010 kids ’ film Justin Time , which has just been released on DVD .

Predators ( 2010 ) — “ Cuchillo ”
Danny Trejo : Predators is the movie starring Adrien Brody .
He took over the Arnold Schwarzenegger part .
Well , there ’s a big difference between Arnold and Adrien .
Arnold ’s like steroid muscles , you know what I mean ?
Adrien uses his mind .
Every time this camera ’s on him , you can almost hear him thinking about how we ’re going to kill this predator .
There ’s a line where Alice Braga says , “ We have to work like a team . ”
And we ’re all assassins , right ?
So I look at her and say , “ Does this look like a team - oriented group of individuals ? ”
And Adrien says , “ We might have to work another way . ”
But he ’s always thinking .
I actually like his character better .
The first Predator was more about “ How big ’s my bicep ? ”
The second one was fighting aliens .
This is one is about an actual plan and an actual war on how to beat these things .

But his role , he was very serious about .
And me , I wo n’t do it unless I can have some fun , and I had a lot of fun with it .

Because I bring in the Latin audience .
So I was in The Expendables all the way up until the time they started casting .
I ’m not in The Expendables .
That ’s one of Hollywood ’s ploys to … how do you say it ?
They have this huge cast , and then all of a sudden , when it comes time to cast , the people that actually raised the money are n’t in it .

DT : I walked on that movie set as a drug counselor .
I was helping this kid I was counseling .
He called me up and said , “ Hey , there ’s a lot of blow down here . ”
It was 1985 , and cocaine was running rampant in the movie industry .
It was crazy .
You ’d walk into production and there ’d be lines on the table .
He just asked me to come down and support him , because that ’s what I did .
I still do it .
I ’m going over on an intervention right now to one of our Hollywood actors .
I went onto this movie set , and he was a PA , and I thought it was cute .
I had never been on a movie set in my life .
All these guys were dressed up as inmates , and they were all trying to act tough .
They all had these fake tattoos .
I kept smearing these tattoos .
I had to say , “ Oh shit , I ’m sorry .
That stuff smears . ”

This guy asked me if I wanted to be in a movie , and I said , “ What do I gotta do ? ”
And he said , “ Do you want to be an extra ? ”
And I said , “ An extra what ? ”
And he said , “ Can you act like a convict ? ” I thought it was the funniest thing I had ever heard .
I ’d been in every penitentiary in the state .
I looked at him and I said , “ Well , I ’ll give it a shot . ”
He gave me a blue shirt , and I took off my shirt , and I have that big tattoo on my chest .
He said “ Leave your shirt off . ”
Then this other guy comes over and says , “ Hey , you ’re Danny Trejo .
I saw you win the lightweight and welterweight title up in San Quentin . ”
And I go , “ Yeah .
You ’re Eddie Bunker . ” I had been in prison with him .
And he was a writer .
We started talking , and he asked , “ Are you still boxing ? ” And I go , “ Well , I still train . ”
And he said , “ Do you want a job ?
We need someone to train one of the actors how to box . ”
And I said , “ I got a job .
They ’re going to give me 15 bucks for acting like a convict .
What ’s this pay ? ”
He said , “ It pays $ 320 a day . ”
So I said , “ How bad do you want this guy beat up ?
Shit , for 320 bucks — ”
And he goes , “ No , you have to be really careful , this actor ’s really high - strung .
He ’s already socked a couple of people . ”
I said , “ For $ 320 , man , give him a stick .
I ’ll fight Godzilla for 320 bucks . ”
I started training Eric Roberts how to box .
Eric wanted to learn how to box , and I think he was scared of me , so he ’d do whatever I told him to do .
Andrey Konchalovskiy , the director , saw that he would do whatever I told him to do .
I guess Andrey had some problems with it .
So Andrey comes over and hires me .
He says , “ You be in the movie .
You fight Eric in the movie . ”
And that ’s where it started .
From that day until right now , I ’ve got 183 movies .
AVC : How are you able to be so prolific ?
DT : I love doing it .
Let me tell you something .
When I was young , I was an armed robber .
I did robberies .
And there ’s no adrenaline rush like that .
When you ’re using drugs and doing robberies , it ’s hard to distinguish whether you ’re doing robberies to support your drug habit , or doing drugs to support your robbery habit .
Those guys that flip on motorcycles — it ’s like the same kind of adrenaline .
It ’s unreal .
The only time I ever felt that was when I heard Andrey Konchalovskiy yell , “ Action ! ”
And then I was like , “ Wow .
Here we are again .
This whole adrenaline — ” But this time I did n’t have a gun .
I was like , “ Wow .
This is awesome . ”
I just totally got hooked .
I found my calling .
And then when I got my check , I said , “ Fuck . ” [ Laughs . ]
“ Wait a minute .
For the first half of my life , I went to prison for being a bad guy .
Now they ’re paying me to be a bad guy . ”

AVC : Did you take acting classes ?
DT : In 1985 it was a little different .
I would just go with the extras and the director would see me .
I was always Inmate No. 1 , and I always had one line like , “ Kill ’em all . ” [ Laughs . ]
It was like , “ I can do this . ”
I remember a director handed me a shotgun and he said , “ Kick in this door and take control . ”
There was a poker game going inside , and the director said there would be a couple of stunt people inside .
He said to improvise .
So I kick in the door , somebody jumps up , I bash them with the shotgun , and I ask this guy , “ Oh , you wanna die , huh ? ”
This lady starts screaming , and I put this gun right in her face .
So the director yells , “ Cut ! Cut !
God , Danny , where did you study ? ” I said , “ Let me see .
Von’s .
Safeway .
Thrifty Mart . ” [ Laughs . ]
So all this stuff I was doing , I just knew .
You ’ve got to remember , I was Inmate No. 1 for the first five years of my career .
So shit , I know how to be an inmate .

AVC : You were a Method actor .
DT : [ Laughs . ]
So I was really having a blast , and then I was getting paid .
I ’m still a drug counselor .
I still go to high schools .
We just left Sylmar Juvenile Hall .
We did last night , speaking to about 60 kids .
I still do that .

The Hidden ( 1987 ) — “ Prisoner ”
DT : Shit !
That was actually a little sleeper movie .
That was a little movie that they did about some monster that got inside people ’s bodies .
I could n’t believe the money that was made on that movie .
It was this little movie that was “ Blah blah blah blah blah , ” then all the sudden it was like , “ The Hidden , The Hidden , The Hidden ! ” Wow .
That was fun .
What did I say ?
“ Whoa , hippie !
What kind of dude are you ? ” [ Laughs . ]

Kinjite : Forbidden Subjects ( 1989 ) — “ Prison Inmate ”
DT : You know what ?
I did a movie with Charles Bronson before that , Death Wish 4 .
I met him , and one of the guys on the movie , one of the young guys , got shitty with an old character actor named Perry Lopez , who was like 80 years old and had emphysema .
He could n’t even blow out a candle on a cake .
He ’s been in the movies since like the ’30s .
He was trying to set up our little scene , and then all of the sudden , out of the clear blue sky , this guy who thought he was cute says , “ Who the fuck nominated you director ? ”
And I laughed ; I thought he was joking .
This guy ’s 80 years old .
Perry says , “ No , no , I ’m trying to set up this little scene so we all wo n’t be standing here . ”
Advertisement
So this punk comes up , he says , “ I went to blah blah , ” just some , I do n’t know what the hell it is , Lee Strasberg or some bullshit training , “ and I do n’t need no has - been actor to give me direction . ”
Then I realized this guy was n’t kidding .
I ’m thinking , “ This guy ’s 80 .
Anybody over 40 is an older person .
You better give them some respect . ”
So I just jacked this punk up and told him , “ You know what , bitch ?
I ’ll beat your ass .
I nominated him director .
Now fuck you .
Do whatever he says . ”
This guy looks at me , almost starts crying , and says , “ Hey , I ’m trying to stay in character . ” I was , “ Well , your character ’s about to get his ass beat . ”
So then I turn around .
Charles Bronson is standing right behind me , and he ’s watching this .
And the last thing you want anybody to see is that you could be violent on a movie set .
I look at Charlie , and he saw what I was doing .
But he says , “ You know , Danny .
I like the way you deal with people . ” [ Laughs . ]
And then he walked away .
Then , about two months later , he called me and said , “ Danny , I ’ve got this little movie , Forbidden Subjects .
You want a little role in it ? ” I go , “ Yeah , sure . ” I ’ll never forget that .
We had a long talk .
Charlie was cool .
He was awesome .
Advertisement
AVC : He was fairly old at that point , too , was n’t he ?
In his 60s ?
DT : Oh , yeah .
He was in great shape .
He was n’t buffed up , but he was slim and cut up pretty good .
That ’s the way I try to stay .
Advertisement
AVC : The joke was that he ’d keep on making Death Wish sequels until he was 80 and in a wheelchair .
DT : It ’s really funny , because he changed .
I saw him about a month before Jill [ Ireland ] passed away , and he looked healthy , then she passed away , and man , he just got old .
You talk about soulmates .
I just saw him get really old right away once she passed away .

Marked For Death ( 1990 ) — “ Hector ”
DT : Steven Seagal . [ Laughs . ]
He was cool .
He ’s all macho , “ I got bigger nuts than you . ”
But he was cool .
He was all right .
He kept trying to get me to do my own stunts .
I went , “ Ah , hell no .
They got this guy who looks just like me . ”
At times he would get overzealous , you know what I mean ?
You do your own stunts as an actor , and you end up getting hurt .
It ’s not your job .
You ’ve got stunt guys .
Stunt guys make a lot of money .

Baywatch ( 1991 - 1992 ) — “ Carlos Urueta ”
DT : Wow . [ Laughs . ]
Red bathing suits .
[ Laughs . ]
I could n’t believe that show .
I ’d be sitting in Venice , looking at all these girls running around and thinking , “ They ’re paying me for this .
Thank you , Jesus . ” [ Laughs . ]
You know what I mean ?
“ I wish the guys in prison could see me right now . ”
But what was amazing was about five years later , I went to Paris , and there ’s this big crowd at the airport .
They ’re all waiting to see me .
I ’m thinking one of my movies , right ?
They know me from Baywatch .
“ You were on Baywatch ! ” I believe that thing was all over the world .
Advertisement
AVC : They say it ’s one of the most popular TV shows internationally of all time .
DT : It ’s amazing .
I did a favor for David Hasselhoff , before he got Baywatch .
I was in this little movie called W.B. , Blue And The Bean .
He asked me “ Would you do this ? ” and I said “ Sure . ”
And then bang , bang , when he got Baywatch , he got me two episodes .

Desperado ( 1995 ) — “ Navajas ”
DT : Desperado .
That was the one .
Boy , that thing was amazing , because that character was so strong , and never said a word .
I kept asking Robert , “ Come on , give me a line , man , ” and he would n’t .
“ No , no .
This is heavy .
I ’m telling you , Danny , you ’re so strong . ”
“ Give me a line ! ” I ’m screaming at him .
“ No . ” So , after the movie came out , we were in front of Sony , we were talking in this big group over at Sony , and somebody raises their hand and says , “ You know , Danny , in that movie , your character was so strong and never said a line .
Was that an actor ’s choice ? ”
I looked right in Robert ’s eye and said , “ Yes it was . ”
He gave me the finger .
[ Laughs . ]
Advertisement
He was awesome .
Robert is just — you know what ?
The directors I ’ve been working with , let me tell you , I ’ve been working with Nimród [ Antal ] , with Rob Zombie .
And they all kind of come under the umbrella of Robert Rodriguez .
They ’ve all read [ Rodriguez ’s memoir about the making of El Mariachi ] Rebel Without A Crew , and they all shoot like Robert .
I love the way they shoot .
They know what they want .
They do n’t have to see what they want .
A director that has to see what he wants has got you doing seven , eight , nine takes .
Then , “ That ’s it !
That ’s what I want ! ”
But a director that knows what he wants , bang .
Two takes , three takes , “ Let ’s go , move it on . ”
He knows where he ’s going to cut .
I love that .
I love that about Robert , I love that about Nimród .
I love that about Rob Zombie .
Rob is so laid - back .
He ’s like , “ Eh , we got it . ”
Heat ( 1995 ) — “ Trejo ”
DT : Yeah , that was the shit .
That was unreal .
Me and Eddie Bunker walked on that set as armed - robbery consultants .
What a job .
[ Laughs . ]
I ran into Michael Mann , and he knew me from a movie called Drug Wars : The Camarena Story that me and him did years ago .
Then he also knew my uncle who ’s in Folsom , because he did a movie called The Jericho Mile .
So Michael Mann says , “ Come on , Danny , I want you to meet a couple of guys you ’re going to be working with . ”
I walk into a room with Robert De Niro , Al Pacino , Val Kilmer , Jon Voight .
I just said , “ Wow . ” [ Laughs . ]
I could not believe it .
And then he says , “ Here , ” and that ’s where I got that role .
Advertisement
AVC : What does an armed - robbery consultant do ?
DT : You just make it look real .
You show somebody how to hold a gun .
You show somebody how to walk into a bank .
You show somebody how to take control .
Everybody has an idea of what an armed robbery is supposed to be , and the reality is , you have to scare people up until a point .
If you scare them too much , you will lose control , because they will freak out .
That ’s the last thing you want .
So some people will come in , “ All right , you motherfuckers !
Everybody get up against the fucking … ” and it ’s like , “ Dude , they ’re going to blow .
You understand what I ’m saying ? ”
But if you walk up to somebody and say , “ Look , I ’ve got a gun , and if you make one move , I ’ll kill you . ”
All of a sudden , they take that in , okay , they ’ve taken that into their senses , and they ’re saying , “ I better not move . ”
It ’s like a horse .
If you run up to a horse , you ’re going to scare it .
It ’s going to jump .
So you just walk up to him real slow and then put a saddle on him or whatever you want .
Advertisement
AVC : If you ’re too aggressive , people will feel like they have nothing to lose .
They ’re probably thinking , “ If I ’m going to die anyway , I might as well be a hero . ”
DT : Exactly .
You ’ve got it .
Wow , you ’d make a good armed robber .
[ Laughs . ]
From Dusk Till Dawn ( 1996 ) — “ Razor Charlie ”
DT : Yeah , that was great .
I got to work with George Clooney , who is the man .
George Clooney was cool .
He was a lot of fun .
But you ’ve got to watch him , because he is a prankster .
If he ain’t having fun , he wo n’t do it .
It ’s got to be fun , or he ’ll be , “ Hell no , let ’s not do it .
That ’s not fun . ”
Me and him had a blast , man .
I just saw him at the première of Up In The Air .
You know what ?
Actually a good movie .
It ’s a chick flick , but it ’s a good movie .
Do n’t tell anybody I watched it .

Anaconda ( 1997 ) — “ Poacher ”
DT : We got to go to Brazil on that .
We ’re in Brazil on the Amazon River .
The funny thing is , I used to have a fourth - grade teacher , Mrs. Henley , who was anal about the Amazon River .
She would always be crazy about it .
She would say , “ The Amazon this ” and “ The Amazon that , ” and I ’m like , “ Who gives a shit ?
I did n’t care about the Amazon River .
Forty years later , I ’m doing Anaconda on the damn Amazon River . [ Laughs . ]
I ’m sitting there , and Jon Voight , J. Lo , Ice Cube are all asking questions , and I knew all the answers .
They thought I was the smart guy .
I know all about this !
Thank you , Mrs. Henley .

Con Air ( 1997 ) — “ Johnny ‘ Johnny - 23 ’ Baca ”
DT : Con Air .
You do n’t know how many people scream that to me at Target .
“ Hey ! Johnny - 23 ! ”
So a lot of people watched that movie .
That was a lot of fun .
The only problem : the biggest case of testosterone I ’ve ever been in .
It was 30 guys all trying to be bad - asses .
It was so weird .
If you would spit , somebody would spit a little farther .
Pretty soon , you ’ve got 40 people trying to see how far they can spit .
If you did a push - up , somebody would do two , then three , then four .
It was like a competition of who was the baddest ass .
It was funny .
Advertisement
AVC : Who do you think won the competition to see who could be the baddest ass on Con Air ?
DT : I ’m going to tell you something : Nicolas Cage ?
He ’s in shape .
That guy , when we did Con Air , he was in great , great shape .
Advertisement
AVC : He had all those scenes where he was exercising in prison .
DT : John Malkovich was n’t too much for push - ups .
[ Laughs . ]
AVC : That was one of Dave Chappelle ’s first really big roles .
DT : Yeah , Dave Chappelle .
He was funny , man .
Dave Chappelle is a riot .
He ’s a riot to be around .
Nice guy .

Six Days Seven Nights ( 1998 ) — “ Pierce ”
DT : Yeah , that was funny .
We were on Kauai for about three months .
I was a pirate .
I was working with two Australian guys .
No , from that island around Australia .
New Zealand .
They were pretty cool .
I got to meet Harrison Ford , and that ’s a big dog .
That was real fun ; we hung out a little bit .
I met Anne Heche. Ellen [ DeGeneres ] came to visit her , so I got to meet Ellen .

Walker , Texas Ranger ( 1998 -1999 ) — “ Joe Lopez ”
DT : Walker , Texas Ranger .
Big Chuck Norris .
That ’s it , man .
“ Chuck Norris does n’t do push - ups , he pushes the world down . ” I remember those jokes .
Now they ’re saying “ Chuck Norris dresses up like Danny Trejo on Halloween . ”

xXx ( 2002 ) — “ El Jefe ”
DT : Yeah , xXx .
That was with Vin Diesel .
I actually met Vin Diesel when we were doing Reindeer Games with Charlize Theron and Ben Affleck .
We did that up in Canada , and Vin Diesel actually had a role , but he was going to miss another role .
He was going to go do The Fast And The Furious .
And Reindeer Games was n’t right for him anyway .
Donal Logue ended up taking the role .
Vin Diesel was torn between staying there and going to do The Fast And The Furious .
I was , “ What the fuck ’s wrong ?
That ’s a no-brainer .
Get the fuck out of here ! ”
He said , “ Man , I do n’t want to leave . ” I said , “ You have n’t been on film yet !
They have n’t got you on film .
They ’ll get another sucker up here right now . ”
So he called up and said , “ Hey , you know what ?
I ’m leaving . ”
He went back to do The Fast And The Furious , and Donal Logue , who ’s one of my best , best friends , came up and played Pug in Reindeer Games .
Advertisement
AVC : So Vin Diesel made the right choice .
DT : Absolutely .
Dear God , are you kidding ?
Come on .
I think his agency was doing a favor for somebody sending him .
I said , “ Man , fuck ’em .
Are you kidding ? ”
It ’s like , if I ’m going to star in a movie , or I ’m going to do this shit — and Reindeer Games is a great movie , do n’t get me wrong — but I ’m saying , you ’ve got this little role where you ’re playing a goofy little guy — he did n’t fit it anyway !
Vin Diesel is n’t a goofy , silly little guy .
He ’s an action hero .
Good guy , too .
Really nice guy .
And he ’s very , very loyal .
When he did xXx , he called me direct and said , “ Danny , come on .
I want us to do this .
I owe you . ” I said , “ Okay , ” and I went and did xXx .
Advertisement
AVC : He ’s supposedly coming back for xXx 3 .
DT : I do n’t know what they ’re going to do .
I do n’t keep up with Hollywood .
My philosophy is , “ Call me if you need me . ”

Anchorman : The Legend Of Ron Burgundy and Wake Up , Ron Burgundy : The Lost Movie ( 2004 ) — “ Bartender ”
DT : Anchorman .
That was Will Ferrell .
Funny , funny guy .
When he walks in the room , everybody starts laughing .
He ’s just got a funny aura .
He ’s a funny dude .
I bet he got beat up a lot in school .

The Devil ’s Rejects ( 2005 ) — “ Rondo ”
DT : Yeah .
Diamond Dallas Page .
DDP !
That was a lot of fun .
That ’s where I met Rob Zombie .
Rob was just a sweetheart .
His wife Sheri , another sweetheart .
Two great people .
Like I said , they like to work like Robert Rodriguez .
It ’s laid back .
I brought my kids on the set .
It ’s not like everybody ’s real serious about getting this …
It ’s about “ Hey , let ’s have fun doing it . ”

SherryBaby ( 2006 ) — “ Dean Walker ”
DT : I did n’t want that role .
I did n’t really want to do that .
It was my agent , Gloria , just , “ Come on , do it .
You ’ve got to do this .
Do this , do that . ”
So I went and did it and got to go all over the world with that movie .
Everywhere they premièred it , they wanted us there .
I got to go to Prague , to Paris , to Germany .
Advertisement
AVC : Why were you reluctant to take the role ?
DT : Well , it was a drama .
[ Laughs . ]
But once I got into it , it was awesome .
It was heavy .
Unbelievable actress ; it was a joy to work with her anyway .
I kept asking Laurie [ Collyer ] , the director , “ Come on , let me at least slap her . ”
All she did was come and cry on my shoulder .
Let me pull hair or something , right ?
Everyone else is abused . ”
But no , I am the nice guy .
It worked out really well .

Smiley Face ( 2007 ) — “ Albert ”
AVC : A year later — you have a very eclectic filmography here — you played Albert in Smiley Face .

DT : Yeah , Smiley Face , that was funny .
That was just a cute movie .
Oh , God .
What did I play in Smiley Face ?
[ Long pause . ]
I do n’t remember .
AVC : [ Laughs . ]
You have 183 credits .
DT : [ Laughs . ]
I can forget a couple .
Delta Farce ( 2007 ) — “ Carlos Santana ”
AVC : In 2007 , you portrayed Carlos Santana in Delta Farce .
DT : Oh , man .
Larry The Cable Guy .
What a farce .
That was so funny .
Me and Larry , we just kept cracking up every day .
We would just tell each other jokes all day long , because I love to laugh .
Making him laugh was just like my joy , like , “ Wow ! I made Larry The Cable Guy laugh ! ” [ Laughs . ]

Grindhouse ( 2007 ) — “ Machete ”
DT : I play the Uncle Machete in Spy Kids .
He ’s the mysterious uncle with all the gadgets .
He ’s a scientist .
But Machete , the movie Machete , Robert talked about when we were doing Desperado .
He said , “ I want to use you for this character … ”
He had that idea then .
Then when we did the trailer to Machete , I said , “ So this is going to happen ? ”
He goes , “ I think so . ”
So they put the trailer for Machete in Grindhouse .
Then the trades said that Machete was the best thing in Grindhouse , that trailer .
It was a really exciting trailer .
The movie just got a mind of its own .
It was unreal .
You got Robert De Niro , Jessica Alba , Lindsay Lohan , Michelle Rodriguez , Don Johnson , Steven Seagal , Jeff Fahey , Cheech Marin , and a couple of other people .
The twins , the two twins that are in Grindhouse [ Electra and Elise Avellan as The Crazy Babysitter Twins ] , are also in Machete .
My son and daughter are in Machete .
My two best friends are in Machete .
It just kept on and on , and it ’s an action - packed movie from start to finish .
I think it ’s a culmination of everything Robert Rodriguez has done .
Advertisement
AVC : Do you think it ’s a culmination of everything you ’ve done as well ?
DT : Well … yeah .
I think so .
If you ’re looking for literary value , do n’t go .
If you ’re looking for action - packed , it is from start to finish .
And I get to kiss Jessica Alba .
That ’s my love interest .
And Michelle Rodriguez .

AVC : Is it surreal being the leading man after playing so many supporting roles ?
After playing so many prisoners , was it surreal to be the star of such a big movie ?
DT : You know what ?
You ’ve got to do the same job .
It does n’t matter .
When Robert De Niro came up , because I worked with him in Heat , he looked at me and said , “ Danny !
It ’s your starring role , man .
I ’m really proud of you .
I knew you were going to make it when we were doing Heat .
You had it . ”
I looked him right in the eyes and said , “ Can I get you some coffee , Mr. De Niro ? ” [ Laughs . ]
He says , “ No , we ’ve got people to get us coffee . ” [ Laughs . ]

The Young And The Restless ( 2008 ) — “ Bartender ”
DT : Let me tell you something : my mother did not believe I had a job until I did those episodes of The Young And The Restless .
When I walked into her house after she saw them , she said , “ Oh , you finally made it ! ”
She was so proud of me .
She was calling all her friends .
“ Danny ’s going to be on The Young And The Restless ! ”
That was hilarious .

AVC : Did you get to beat anybody up as the bartender ?
DT : No . I was helping …
I forget the star of that , the one guy , I got my mom his picture .
He ’s been on there for 30 years or whatever .

AVC : It was your first soap opera , was n’t it ?
Was filming a soap opera different from your usual roles ?
DT : Soap operas , they ’re going a mile a minute .
It ’s bang , bang .
When you ’re shooting this scene , they ’re setting up the next scene on another stage .
It ’s go , go , go , go , go .
It ’s not like a film where you ’re shooting a scene , then you shoot another scene , then you rest .
It is a mile a minute .

King Of The Hill ( 2003 -2008 ) — “ Enrique ”
DT : That ’s a lot of fun , because you ’re working in front of a microphone , so you can show up in your pajamas if you want .
So I got to be pretty good friends with the little girl that passed away , Brittany Murphy .
I got to meet her .
You sit in the green room for a while , you ’re just talking to see what ’s happening .
It ’s real sad , but Hollywood ’s full of tragedies .

Breaking Bad ( 2009 - 2010 ) — “ Tortuga ”
DT : Tortuga .
“ The Turtle . ” That was funny .
My head ends up on top of a turtle , so people try to tease me .
They say , “ Hey !
We saw your head on top of a turtle ! ” I tell them , “ Yeah , well , my body was at the bank . ” [ Laughs . ]

AVC : Did they have to make a mask of your face for that ?
DT : Of the whole thing .
They put this cast stuff all over you , and you come out with this perfect bust of your head .

AVC : That had to be very strange , to see your head on top of a turtle .
DT : Yeah . [ Laughs . ]
“ What did you do today ? ” “ My head was on top of a turtle . ”

AVC : This year , you portrayed Criminal in an episode of Tim And Eric Awesome Show , Great Job !

DT : I do n’t remember that .
I ’ve done quite a bit this year .
I just finished doing Death Race 2 for seven weeks in South Africa .
That spun my mind .
I do n’t think my mind ’s right yet from the time difference .
AVC : Is it a big role ?
DT : Yeah .
I play the lead mechanic in Death Race 2 .
The only person I know who ’s in it is a gorgeous girl , Tanit [ Phoenix ] .
She ’s an African actor .
She ’s absolutely beautiful .
She ’s up for the role of Wonder Woman .
If she does n’t get it , they ’re idiots .
She ’s perfect .
She almost looks like Lynda Carter .
But naturally Hollywood ’s probably got some little bimbo they want .
I could n’t believe she was like as , I even told her , “ God , you look like Lynda Carter . ”
And this guy Fred Koehler , who was in Death Race , the first one , and so anyway , I just finished that one .

Vengeance ( 2010 ) — “ Jack ”
DT : Go to vengeancearmy.com and you can get that movie .
AVC : Also known as Danny Trejo ’s Vengeance .
What can you say about that ?
DT : Remember I told you that I love Charles Bronson ?

That is basically the storyline :
They kill my wife and daughter , and I take revenge , vengeance , on criminals .
I kill people that are jaywalking .

Sexual slavery involving boys as young as 10 is being condoned and in many cases protected by authorities in northern Afghanistan .
In a story to be broadcast on Four Corners tonight , the practice of bacha bazi or " boy play " , as well as other allegations of child abuse , are explored .
Afghan journalist Najibullah Quraishi has filmed police attending a party where a young boy is the " entertainment " .
The police shown on the video include one officer from the youth crime squad .
Such parties are illegal under Afghanistan law and with good reason .
The " dancing boys " are in effect sex slaves .
They are lured off the streets by pimps .
They are taught to dance and sing , to wear make - up and to dress like girls .
Then they are made to perform before large groups of men .
All of them are sexually abused .
Dancing boys are a lucrative business .
Powerful former warlords and businessmen love to watch them and will pay a lot of money to have their own boy for bacha bazi .
Some of the boys are traded like swap cards among the rich and powerful , and if they disobey their owners they are killed or brutalised .
The trade in boys is well known to the United Nations .
According to Nazir Alimy , who compiled a report on the issue for the UN , there is no doubt who is funding this practice and why the police refuse to stop it .
" According to our research these dancing boys are used by powerful men for sex , " Mr Alimy said .
Tonight 's Four Corners follows the criminal activity of two paedophiles who search for young boys so they can sell or groom them to be trained as dancing boys .
In one case the journalist goes in the car with a paedophile named Dastager .
As they drive , Dastager describes the type of boy he is looking for .
Then in broad daylight the dancing boy master stops the car , goes to a shopfront and brings a boy back to his waiting car .
According to the UN report , there is evidence that the practice of bacha bazi and the sexual abuse of boys is common throughout the north of the country .
It confirms that boys , some as young as 10 , are lured into life as a sex slave .
There is also evidence this type of abuse is spreading throughout Afghanistan .
Mr Alimy says his research shows it is happening in the south and even in the Afghan capital , Kabul .
" It 's true they make the boys wear girls ' clothes and make them dance in front of many men , " he said .
The powerful men he refers to are often former warlords who helped drive the Taliban out of the north .
Others are wealthy businessmen .
Under the Taliban , bacha bazi was outlawed .
Today it is still a crime , but clearly there is no concerted effort being made to stop the practice and the criminal activity that surrounds it .
Unable to find anyone willing to do anything about the abuse of children , Mr Quraishi flew to New York to meet Radhika Coomaraswamy , who has been appointed by the UN to raise awareness of the plight of children in war zones .
She explains she is deeply pessimistic about the future of these children and the capacity of officials to stop the trade in young boys .
" When I mentioned the topic it was as if I had dropped a big brick , especially in the official circles , " she said .
" It was very clear to me , and someone actually said it to me , these are not things people talk about .
So let 's first deal with the war and then we 'll deal with these other issues . "
The Warlord 's Tune goes to air tonight at 8:30 on ABC1 .
THIESSEN’S DEFINITION OF ‘ RADICAL ’….
If you have n’t seen Marc Thiessen ’s appearance on “ The Daily Show ” last night , it ’s worth watching the full , unedited version .
If it seemed as if Jon Stewart was n’t fully prepared for John
Yoo a few weeks ago , he clearly had done his homework before last night ’s interview .
The two covered a fair amount of ground , but there was something Thiessen said early on that stood out for me .
In the process of defending the smear campaign against nine Justice Department attorneys , the speechwriter - turned - columnist insisted those attorneys who successfully challenged Bush administration detainee policies deserve to be attacked .
“ Some of these people have very radical views .
Jennifer Daskal is one of these lawyers who has been raised questions about .
She has written that any terrorist who is not charged with a crime , even though they ’re being held as lawful combatants , should be released from Guantanamo and set free — even though we know they may go out and kill American soldiers . ”
Thiessen was referring to Jennifer Daskal , an Obama - appointed Justice Department attorney , who worked on detainee issues at Human Rights Watch during the Bush / Cheney era .
I ca n’t say for certain if Thiessen characterized her writings accurately , but let ’s give him the benefit of the doubt .
Stewart responded by arguing that Daskal ’s position had been bolstered by Supreme Court rulings .
But let ’s go one step further , and note that none other than Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) articulated a position on national television that was identical to the Daskal position that Thiessen described on “ The Daily Show . ” McCain said on “ Meet the Press ” in 2005 :
“ Now , I know that some of these guys [ at Guantanamo ] are terrible , terrible killers and the worst kind of scum of humanity .
But , one , they deserve to have some adjudication of their cases .
And there ’s a fear that if you release them that they ’ll go back and fight again against us .
And that may have already happened .
But balance that against what it ’s doing to our reputation throughout the world and whether it ’s enhancing recruiting for people to join al Qaeda and other organizations and want to do bad things to the United States of America .
“ I think , on balance , the argument has got to be — the weight of evidence has got to be that we ’ve got to adjudicate these people ’s cases , and if it means releasing some of them , you ’ll have to release them …
[ E]ven Adolf Eichmann got a trial . ”
What ’s the difference between McCain ’s post - 9/11 position and the one Thiessen ascribed to Jennifer Daskal ?
There is n’t one .
As such , by Thiessen ’s logic , John McCain is a dangerous “ radical , ” whose opinions on national security disqualify him from having a role in shaping government policy .
Indeed , to hear Thiessen tell it , Liz Cheney should start smearing McCain immediately .
Of course , the real radical here is Thiessen — he supports torture , McCarthyism , and moral bankruptcy .
It was heartening to see Stewart make that plain .
Nearly every economist , including those from the administration and the Federal Reserve , say that unemployment will not be much reduced before the November elections .
In addition the chances of a “ double - dip ” recession have risen as a new wave of foreclosures , possible trade war with China and other threats emerge .
A double - dip would mean unemployment may actually rise again before November ’s mid-term congressional elections .
If so , the fate of the Obama recovery agenda will be in the hands of grassroots activists as never before , as it contends with ultra - right forces working feverishly to channel popular frustration and outrage toward destructive and harmful actions blocking reform on every front .
Any success by the right wing will of course mean more paralysis , more dysfunction , in Washington .
No surprise .
Dysfunction of government is their program .
The critical health care vote this weekend was really the first , and also very important , salvo of the November battle for the hearts and minds of voters .
In order to be effective , however , candidates vying to direct populism toward constructive ends must have a keen sense of the urgency and grave dangers of paralysis , as well as the opportunities to make significant structural reforms in finance , education , environmental policy , green public works and infrastructure , and de-militarization .
Making dramatic , very visible moves to put people back to work directly , using national service and other public programs , must be given top priority .
This signals the important role that candidacies that run to the left of the president will play in moving the debate deeper into reform rather than stepping away from it .
At the same time all must be mindful of the need to defeat Republican efforts to split the Obama coalition in showdown votes .
Viva Dennis Kucinich !
There is every reason to pray , for example , that every Blue Dog Democrat will have a progressive challenger in the primary season , and turn the powerful populist outrage emerging across the country into 1 ) a solid Republican setback , and 2 ) a caution to Obama not to overplay the “ bipartisanship ” tactic .
I hope I am not one who fails to understand that openness to bipartisan compromises is an important political tactic in the U.S.
Obviously , bills passed with filibuster - proof majorities have a stronger national mandate than those passed with 51 Senate votes .
But in this era , doing nothing is the worst political result of all .
Obama ’s recent impassioned campaigning on health care , and his ( at last ) decision to go with 51 votes rather than no health care bill after spending a year of the people ’s time on it , is most welcome .
It would have happened sooner , if the left had been more united and organized .
Which brings up a big question in my mind :
What is it that stands between the U.S. left and its ability to unite on a radical – but eminently practical and responsible – left - democratic agenda , at least in the electoral arena ?
Further , what prevents such electoral campaigns from aligning themselves with some much - increased militancy , kicking things up a notch ?
– for example with demonstrations , sit-ins , and well - chosen actions of civil disobedience against the vested interests of banks and insurance companies that are behind much Republican stonewalling , as well as some ultra - right foundations , pouring racist and other less than democratic - minded cocktails throughout the land .
Well , there are those , of course , who view the struggle for expanding democracy under the capitalist system as a pointless endeavor , except for exotic propaganda purposes .
There ’s not much hope for unity there , but these groups are really quite small , and most do not vote anyway if one can credit what they write .
The remaining challenges to greater left unity seem minor to me .
Foreign policy differences , for example are narrower than they have been in decades , across the spectrum of left - democratic politics , and most remaining differences reflect the whipsawing effects of globalization on different sectors of the population .
Take China for example .
We could have a big argument between manufacturing workers desperately seeking protection from Chinese competition and those who depend on its low prices for food , shelter and clothing , or those who view conflict with China ( which for anti-poverty advocates plays a positive world role ) as the onset of a new Cold War , a threat to peace .
But few would place these differences in the top five issues .
All would agree that decisions and costs of war should be paid for , at least in part , directly , not all put on the credit card ( or not even appear in the budget , as under Bush ) .
All agree that imperial adventures must be restrained and the power to declare war returned to Congress .
All agree that soldiers and veterans deserve the highest possible care for their service .
And that such service should always be directed toward honorable objectives .
Further , all agree enough on vastly expanded public works , health care reform , education reform , on improving workers economic bargaining power , on progressive taxation , on leveraging the positives of a multicultural , multiracial , multi-national national identity – enough to be able to hammer out a more coherent national left electoral agenda .
Perhaps that ’s asking too much – but regional and local efforts are under way in a number of areas , especially in the hard - hit Midwest and California , and can become much bigger .
The situation is dire and the need for united action is felt by all .
The key that permits everyone to come to the table and leave with a deal is thinking about moving majorities of working people .
There lies unity , and victory .
Thinking like Dr. King would be a good moral and ideological guide , right now .
Conan O'Brien hosts the 54th annual Emmy Awards in Los Angeles , September 22 , 2002 .
REUTERS / Adrees Latif
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Former late - night talk show host Conan O’Brien on Thursday unveiled plans to poke fun at being barred from television in a live comedy show that will tour U.S. and Canadian theaters starting next month .
The 30 - city tour , titled “ Legally Prohibited From Being Funny on Television , ” is set to start April 12 in Eugene , Oregon .
It will travel to Vancouver and Toronto in Canada , as well as major U.S. cities .
Conan spent an ill - fated seven months as host of the “ The Tonight Show ” on NBC , a position he took over from Jay Leno .
Amid falling ratings , NBC ousted O’Brien and placed Leno back on the late - night talk show as of March 1 .
As part of a $ 45 million exit package , O’Brien agreed not to appear on TV before September 1 .
Billed as “ a night of music , comedy , hugging , and the occasional awkward silence , ” according to O’Brien ’s website www.teamcoco.com, he will be accompanied on stage by sidekick Andy Richter and his former “ Tonight Show ” band .
O’Brien , 46 , joked about his motivation in a press release announcing the tour with the quip : “ It was either a massive 30 - city tour or start helping out around the house . ”
Earlier on Thursday , O’Brien announced his plans for the tour on his Twitter account : “ Hey Internet : I ’m headed to your town on a half - assed comedy & music tour ...
I repeat :
It ’s half - assed . ”
During his “ Tonight Show ” run , fans nicknamed the often self - deprecating , redheaded O’Brien “ Coco . ” A Facebook page run by O’Brien fans entitled “ I ’m with Coco ” was abuzz shortly after the tour was announced with some of his nearly one million fans lamenting that he was n’t stopping in their town .

NBC is part of the NBC Universal media division of General Electric Co .
Church encoding of data types is a fun exercise .
Something that blew my mind while learning functional programming was that a data structure is completely defined by its catamorphism .
So for example , foldr is not just another function over lists .
The list data type is the foldr function .
For example , in Haskell , we can encode pairs as this function :
pair x y f = f x y
A pair is then a higher - order function .
It takes a function with two arguments and yields the result of applying that function to the two elements with which we constructed the pair .
Doing this in Scala is not quite as pretty .
Here ’s an attempt :
def pair [ A , B , C ] ( a : A , b : B ) = ( f : ( A , B ) => C ) => f( a , b)
Seems to work :
scala > pair ( 10,20 ) ( _ + _ ) res1 : Int = 30
However , that C type parameter is going to give us problems if we try this :
scala > val x = pair ( 10,20 ) x : (( Int , Int ) => Nothing ) =>
Nothing = < function > scala > x ( _ + _ ) < console >: 12 : error : type mismatch ; found :
Int required : Nothing x ( _ + _ ) ^
Oops .
It looks like Scala needs all of the type parameters to a function up front .
In other words , it seems like its type system is unable to unify the types ( ∀ a. a -> ( ∀ b. b -> b ) ) and ( ∀ a b. a -> b -> b ) .
Is this accurate ?
If you know the answer , please comment below .
However , we can be saved with anonymous type syntax ( which , I ’m told , unfortunately makes use of reflection ) :
def pair [ A , B ] ( a : A , b : B ) = new { def apply [ C ] ( f : ( A , B ) => C ) = f( a , b ) }
Now this works as expected :
scala > val x = pair ( 1,2 ) x : java.lang .Object{def apply [ C ] (( Int , Int ) => C ) : C} = $ anon $ 1@ad8dbc scala > x ( _ + _ ) res13 : Int = 3
Sweet !
Let ’s do this for lists .
Here ’s the Haskell .
nil p z = z cons x xs p z = p x ( xs p z )
Testing this in GHCi :
Prelude > let xs = cons 1 ( cons 2 ( cons 3 nil ) ) Prelude > xs (+ ) 0 6
No sweat .
Now , let ’s do this in Scala .
This is the best I ’ve come up with :
def nil = new { def apply [ A ] ( a : A ) = new { def apply [ B ] ( b : B ) = b }} def cons [ A ] ( x : A ) = new { def apply [ B ]( xs : ( ( A => B => B ) => B => B ) ) = ( f : A => B => B ) => ( b: B ) => f(x ) ( xs ( f ) ( b ) ) }
This does n’t completely work :
scala > val xs = cons ( 1 ) ( cons ( 2 ) ( cons ( 3 ) ( nil ) ) ) < console >: 20 : error : type mismatch ; found : java.lang .Object{def apply [ A] ( A ) : java.lang .
Object{def apply [ B ] ( B ) : B}} required : ( ( Int ) => ( ? ) => ? ) => (? ) => ? val xs = cons( 1 ) ( cons ( 2 ) ( cons ( 3) ( nil ) ) ) ^
Scala is not able to unify those two types .
Let ’s help it along :
def objToFun [ A , B ] ( o : {def apply [ A ] ( a : A ) : {def apply [ B ] ( b : B ) : B}} ) = ( a : A ) => ( b : B ) => o( a ) ( b ) def nilp [ A , B ] = objToFun [ A => B => B , B ] ( nil )
With a little annotation , we can now create a list that has the right type :
scala > cons ( 3 ) ( cons ( 2 ) ( cons ( 1 ) ( nilp [ Int , Int ] ) ) ) xs : ( ( Int ) => ( Int ) => Int ) => ( Int ) =>
Int = < function > scala > xs(x => y => x + y ) (0 ) res44 : Int = 6
Not terrible , but can we do better ?
Can this be done without the anonymous type syntax ?
Is using that syntax necessarily bad ?
Why ?
Could we modify Scala to get a nicer notation for anonymous function types ?
Is rank - 2 polymorphism required for that , or can we convince the compiler to move universal quantifiers to the left of a single arrow ?
While many are again taking notice of Norway 's Patrick Thoresen , the Norge have a another forward that has caught my eye .
He 's yet to score a goal or assist on a goal .
He 's not made any highlight - reel plays , and he 's not been the Norwegians vocal leader .
What Mats Zuccarello - Aasen has done , however , is skate from end - to - end , throw his body around ( as seen above ) and play the game at the same speed or faster than the Canadians and the Americans .
Zuccarello - Aasen came to MODO of the Swedish Elite League from the Frisk Tigers of Norway 's GET - ligaen after being pursued by nearly every club as his transfer window approached .
Since joining MODO , Zuccarello - Aasen has been the top producer on the team , playing both left and right wing and the point on the power play .
In 83 games in the Elite League , his totals read like an all - star : 30 goals , 61 assists , 91 points .
Gabe Desjardins ' excellent work on league translations shows an eye - opening 70 NHLE points in that span .
The stat lines and translations are below .

139 12.9 %
The problem with Zuccarello - Aasen , of course , is his size .
At 5 ' 7 " and 165 lbs , he 's the same height and ten pounds lighter than Brian Gionta .
The picture at the right shows Zuccarello - Aasen standing next to 6 ' 4 " Raitis Ivanāns of the Los Angeles Kings .
While the NHL is a big man 's game , occasionally a smaller player will succeed .
It 's rare , but it happens and Gionta is a fine example .
While Gionta has become a perennial 20 goal scorer , he 's been allowed to play third - level minutes by protective coaches , and has thrived in the NHL .
Gionta has learned the game and is n't afraid of playing in front of the net , nor will he stand down from a battle in the corner .
So it 's interesting to compare their NHLE82 values during their 21 and 22 year - old seasons .
Gionta 's 21 year - old season came at Boston College where he tallied 54 points in 43 games , for an NHLE of 42 points .
From the chart above Zuccarello - Aasen 's NHLE82 was 73 points .
Gionta 's 22 year - old season came as he made the jump to the professional game in both Albany and New Jersey .
He combined to score 36 points in 70 games for an NHLE82 of 26 points .
Zuccarello - Aasen 's season is n't over yet , but he 's put up an NHLE82 of 68 .
The devil , for Zuccarello - Aasen , will be in the details , like making the transition to the North American game and remaining an effective scorer and playmaker as Gionta learned to do .
If Zuccarello - Aasen is able to make the transition to the North American game and handle the more physical play here , his scouting report reads like a scout 's dream :
High - end skills , including incredible passing ability
Hard , accurate shot , though not top- level
Able to play the point on the power play
Outstanding playmaker
World - class speed
He 's a free agent to the NHL and a team that is desperate for playmakers at both the NHL and AHL level like , say , the Edmonton Oilers , would be wise to sign him to an entry level deal and bring him in for the 2010 - 2011 season .
If he 's unable to crack the NHL lineup , he 's certainly a step ahead of a number of the players currently in Springfield .
Giving him a season in the AHL would be a smart bet as it holds zero risk for the Oilers .
If the experiment fails , the Oilers are out an AHL entry - level salary and Zuccarello - Aasen is off to the SEL for a long and likely excellent career .
No draft picks wasted , no multi- year guaranteed contracts , no guaranteed starting positions on the NHL roster .
The Oilers would get a high - end talent for nothing and give themselves a chance at a real NHL scorer or tradeable asset as the deadline approaches in 2011 .
Steve Tambellini should be on the phone with Zuccarello - Aasen 's agent before the Norge leave Canada on Wednesday .

Marshall and the Dolphins subsequently agreed on a four - year , $ 47.5 million contract extension that includes $ 24 million in guaranteed money , according to a league source .
The deal includes close to $ 29 million in the first three years of the contract and makes Marshall the highest - paid receiver in NFL history .
Arizona 's Larry Fitzgerald previously had the richest deal of any receiver , averaging $ 10 million per season .
The trade is contingent upon the league processing the paperwork and Marshall passing his physical .
In acquiring Marshall , the Dolphins gained a deep threat at receiver to loosen up defenses for their potentially potent ground game and young , strong - armed quarterback Chad Henne .
In return , the Broncos get two high draft picks for a player who caused them headaches in addition to making plays .
" It 's good to be here , man , " Marshall said as he mingled with fans at the Miami Heat 's game against New Jersey .
Last summer , Marshall was suspended by the team for throwing a tantrum at practice during training camp .
The source of his frustration was twofold : he was upset with the team 's medical staff for misdiagnosing a hip injury that required offseason surgery and he was displeased with his contract .
Despite those difficulties , Marshall caught 101 passes for 1,120 yards and 10 touchdowns last season , including an NFL - record 21 in a loss at Indianapolis .
He has 327 career receptions for 4,019 yards and 25 touchdowns in four seasons , all in Denver , which drafted him out of Central Florida with a fourth - round pick in 2006 .
Broncos coach Josh McDaniels told ESPN 's Ed Werder that in a post - trade phone call with Marshall , he told the receiver that he enjoyed their time together , predicted success for him with the Dolphins and expressed regret that their own partnership could not be successful in the long term .
Marshall 's departure leaves the Broncos with Jabar Gaffney , who had 54 catches for 732 yards and two TDs last season , as their top receiver .
Eddie Royal caught 37 passes with no TDs and Brandon Stokley had 19 catches , four for TDs .
" I 'm not quite sure how the future would have been if he was around and how it would have affected everything , " Broncos tight end Daniel Graham said at an event at a Denver high school on Wednesday night .
In a little more than a year , with a pair of blockbuster trades , Denver has recouped two first - round picks , two second - round picks , a third - round pick and quarterback Kyle Orton in exchange for Jay Cutler and Marshall .
" We 're going to miss what he brings to that football field , " Graham said .
" But we 've got to move on .
It 's a business . "
Graham , who grew up in Denver , said he realizes a good portion of the team 's fan base is upset that McDaniels has traded away Cutler and Marshall in successive offseasons .
" I know looking from the outside it's hard to understand what 's going on , especially when you lose players the caliber we 've lost in the past couple of years , but it is the ultimate team sport , " Graham said .
" Not one player is going to win the Super Bowl for us . "
McDaniels told Werder the decisions to trade Cutler and Marshall were motivated by his belief that the moves were essential to build a successful team .
He also said he is convinced that the Broncos achieved the best possible result in trading Marshall for a pair of second - round draft picks , while remaining mindful of Marshall 's interests .

It appears the FDIC is getting closer to taking action in Puerto Rico .

The Yates High School boys basketball team set a state record and set itself up for controversy Tuesday night at Butler Fieldhouse .
The Lions beat Lee High School 170 - 35 , setting the single - game state scoring record .
Hardin - Jefferson had owned the record of 166 points since 1992 .
But the Lions ' brush with history was marred by a second - half scuffle and questions of sportsmanship .
In the third quarter , a fight erupted after an intentional foul was called on a Lee player .
After breaking up the fight , the referees told both coaches they would have to play just five players the remainder of the game .
The other players for both teams spent the rest of the second half sitting in the stands .
“ I feel very disrespected right now , ” Lee coach Jacques Armant said .
“ I do n't understand why Yates just kept scoring and pressing when they were up so much .
These are kids .
It is n't good to do that to other young men . ”
Yates , which led 100 - 12 at halftime , is 14 - 0 this season and has won 39 consecutive games .
The 100 points in the first half is also a state record and the second - most ever in a boys high school basketball game .
It was the eighth time this season Yates scored more than 100 points and the sixth time the Lions won by more than 60 .
It was the first time this season Yates ' margin of victory topped 100 .
While the large margins of victory are turning heads , Yates coach Greg Wise said he is n't worried about his team 's reputation .
Thomas Nguyen / For the Chronicle
Defending state champs
Last season , the Lions went 34 - 1 on the way to winning the Class 4A state championship .
The one loss was a 78 - 76 decision to Elsik in the Houston Independent School District Tournament .
That night ,
Wise said he let his kids down by telling them to put on the brakes .
“ We practice running , pressing , trapping every day , ” he said .
“ If we get to a game and I tell them not to do what we do in practice , I am not coaching well .
I am not leaving my starters in the whole game .
We have 15 guys , and all 15 play . ”
Wise said he should n't have to tell his “ third line ” they can't go out and score .
“ They work really hard in practice , and when they go in , they deserve the chance to play hard and compete , too , ” Wise said .
“ We are looking for another state championship , and we can't get that unless we are continuing to get better and perfect our game .
We are n't scoring on other teams out of disrespect . ”
Despite Wise 's intentions , Armant said other teams simply do n't want to play Yates .
“ No coach wants to put his kids in a position to be embarrassed , ” he said .
“ We have great kids on our team , hard workers , and I am proud that they played the whole game tonight , but you can see how coaches are hesitant to put their kids on the floor with a team that is going to score on them that way . ”
National record : 211
The Lions could be on par to break more records this season .
Yates is averaging 119 points per game .
The national record is 114.6 .
Yates has reached the 100 - point mark in three consecutive games .
The national record for consecutive 100 - point games is 14 .
The national single - game scoring record is 211 set by De Quincy ( La. ) Grand Avenue in 1964 .
The Lions are ranked No. 2 in the nation by MaxPreps and No. 5 by ESPN .
They just returned from trips to Hawaii and Alabama for national tournaments .
“ We know what people say and some of it is negative , but I believe that Houston is an area that is great for boys basketball , and I believe we have been on the national stage this year and showed that there is a lot of good basketball here , ” Wise said .
“ I think that is good for our team , our community and the Houston area . ”

[ Python - Dev ] Packaging JIT - less versions of Python
Hey packaging guys ,
We recently committed a change to Unladen Swallow [ 1 ] that moves all the JIT infrastructure into a Python extension module .
The theory [ 2 ] behind this patch was that this would make it easier for downstream packagers to ship a JIT - less Python package , with the JIT compiler available via an optional add - on package .
Some questions for you , so we 're not shooting blind here : - Have you guys thought about how a JIT - enabled Python 3 installation would be packaged by your respective distros ?

Would you prefer the default python3.x package to have a JIT , or would you omit the JIT by default ? -
How would you prefer to build the JIT - less package ( current options : via a ./ configure flag ; or by deleting _llvmjit . so from the JIT - enabled package ) ?
-
Would the two packages be able to exist side - by - side , or would they be mutually exclusive ?
My strong preference would be to have the JIT included by default so that it receives as much testing as possible .

Now think about this - if any GOPers had announced their support of the bill , they might well have given " bipartisan " cover for Dems to vote against the bill .
Instead they spent the last 6 months doing a victory dance and declaring that Obama was one term president .
If they had kept the debate alive and welcomed wavering Dems , they could have defeated the proposal and made themselves look reasonable .
But they made themselves look stubborn and crazy .
Suppose a dozen Republican representatives had just pretended to be on the fence ?
Would n't Pelosi and Reid have been much less effective at lining up votes ?
And then the GOPers could have voted no , and the proposal would have lost by a dozen or more votes .
The endless Lucy - yanking - the - football - away routine would have worked one more time if the GOP had just made an effort to sell it to Dems and the voters .
Instead , they alternated between doing their little endzone celebration and whining that the Dems were not given them a chance to participate .
Ireland : Public sector unions agree four - year strike ban
13 April 2010
The agreement between Ireland ’s public sector trade unions , the government and employers to ban strikes until 2014 gives full expression to the role of the union bureaucracy as the ally of the financial aristocracy and its plundering of public finances .
The agreement , reached March 31 in the offices of Ireland ’s Labour Relations Commission ( LRC ) , will drastically impact the lives of 300,000 public service workers .
It sets down a new marker in the class collaboration practised by the trade union bureaucracies throughout Europe , which are seeking to emulate the “ Irish model ” in imposing the costs of recession and the financial crisis on the working class .
The proposals include large - scale job cuts , productivity and flexibility provisions aimed at “ organisational rationalisation ” , and the replacement of annual pay increments with merit- and performance - related pay .
Finally , “ Strikes or other forms of industrial action by trade unions , employees or employers are precluded in respect of any matters covered by this Agreement ” .
In return for these pledges , the government and the employers have ostensibly agreed that there will be no further pay cuts , and any redundancies will be “ voluntary . ”
Even so , 18,000 jobs are immediately at risk , with 6,000 of these in the health service .
In truth , these pledges are worthless , since they are “ subject to no currently unforeseen budgetary deterioration ” .
Anticipating fierce opposition from broad sections of workers , Jack O’Connor of the Services , Industrial , Professional and Technical Union ( SIPTU ) said , “ Is it better to fight on in the knowledge we ’re still living in a ruined economy , and that any action we take will be depicted as an attack on the citizens of the country ? ”
An overtime ban at passport offices has been suspended by the Civil and Public Services Union .
SIPTU and IMPACT , both of whose members are engaged in work - to - rule actions to force the government into talks , are campaigning for acceptance of the agreement .
So far , only the teachers ’ unions — the Association of Secondary School Teachers and the Teachers Union of Ireland — have rejected the deal and encouraged their members to vote against it .
The proposals are worse than the terms offered by the unions during the “ social partnership ” talks that collapsed in December .
Then , the government walked away from a deal offered by the unions that would have cut public spending by € 1.3 billion through rationalisations and forced unpaid leave .
The government and employers decided they wanted more , rejected the deal , and imposed a new round of welfare and pay cuts .
Thereafter , every action by the unions has been geared to re-establishing working relations with the government and employers .
Key to this was the agreement earlier in March by IMPACT to recommend a pact concocted by the Labour Relations Commission entailing 600 job losses at Aer Lingus .
This was taken by the government and the employers as an unmistakable indicator of the readiness of the union bureaucracy to do their bidding .
Irish events express in a more finished form than perhaps anywhere else the complete collapse of the trade unions as defensive organisations of the working class .
For some years , this was masked by the specific economic conjuncture within which Ireland found itself during the boom years of the so - called “ Celtic Tiger ” .
By means of a host of European Union subsidies and investments from the United States , Irish - based companies were able to take advantage of export opportunities to Europe .
The trade unions were central to the success of this project , since the “ social partnership ” deals they championed offered employers industrial peace .
For a time , the huge profits made out of the Irish work force came alongside pay increases for sections of workers .
Ireland even became a destination for emigrant workers from around the world .
The end of the Celtic Tiger boom came when the advantages offered by Ireland as a production base were outweighed by vastly cheaper labour costs available in Eastern Europe , the Indian subcontinent and China .
Thereafter , the Irish economy , including state finances , became increasingly dependent on the country ’s financial sector , the speculative returns from which generated immense profits and a huge building bubble .
Most of the toxic loans now being channelled from the ruined Irish banking system into the country ’s “ bad bank ” , the National Asset Management Agency ( NAMA ) , were put together in the years between 2004 and 2008 .
Within hours of the LRC agreement , the Irish parliament finally approved the NAMA bailout .
The political representatives of the same parasitic elite to whom the unions have pledged their collaboration voted to transfer massive debts onto the public purse , payment to be collected from the working class at the first opportunity .
Estimates of the total cost of NAMA are still contested , but some run as high as € 100 billion — more than the state ’s entire public spending for three years .
Every bank remains in a near ruinous state and is likely to be pumped up with yet more state cash .
During the debate on the NAMA bailout , Finance Minister Brian Lenihan announced that the Anglo Irish Bank , which recently announced the biggest loss in Irish history — € 12.7 billion — would need an additional € 10 billion on top of € 8.3 already made available .
Irish Nationwide Building Society is due to receive € 2.7 billion , AIB € 7.4 billion , Bank of Ireland € 2.7 billion and EBS a mere € 875 million .
This is where the subordination of the Irish working class to the Irish bourgeoisie by the trade unions has ended up .
The period when these bureaucratic shells could dominate the working class is rapidly coming to an end .
No appeals to patriotism and the shared interests of the “ Irish people ” can hide the fact that , under capitalism , Ireland has been driven to near bankruptcy by a narrow layer of the super - rich .
There is no way out of this situation on a purely national basis and without challenging the essential foundations of capitalism .
Objective circumstances have created the basis for the creation of new mass workers ’ organisations and a new revolutionary socialist party , tasked with merging the struggles of working people in Ireland together with those of their class brothers and sisters across Europe and internationally .

State police are investigating
as homicide by vehicle , according to documents filed in the case on Tuesday .
Luke Lee Frederick Stump Jr. , 5 , and his 2 - year - old twin siblings , Megyn Diane Stump and Troy Matthew Stump , all of Duncannon , were pronounced dead at the scene Saturday night .
The driver , Laurie Hatfield , 47 , the children ’s grandmother ,
.
Hatfield , who has a Duncannon address ,
, troopers said in an affidavit of probable cause seeking a warrant to search Hatfield ’s 2001 Ford Taurus station wagon .
They were looking for evidence of controlled - substance or medication use , car defects , data - collection devices , paint chips , and hair , blood and tissue samples , troopers said .
The driver in that crash identified Hatfield and her car as having hit his or her vehicle about 2 miles from the fatal crash scene , documents state .
That driver told investigators false information was given to him or her and that the car sped off as he or she tried to write down the license plate number , troopers said .
The driver recorded the license plate as ENE1248 ; Hatfield ’s license plate is ENE1268 , troopers said .
Troopers interviewed Hatfield on Monday in the hospital , and she told them the road and weather conditions were clear , documents state .
She described the trip as “ smooth sailing , ” and that there were no problems or issues with the car , according to the documents .
Hatfield told emergency medical personnel at the scene that she could not remember what happened , but that she was not drinking but does take several prescription medications , troopers said .
Her son , Luke Lee Frederick Stump , the children ’s father , told investigators on Monday that his mother takes several medications for treatment of cancer and thyroid , heart and kidney problems , troopers said .
Hatfield also takes daily pain pills that she would have had with her at the time of the crash , Stump told troopers .
Troopers are investigating whether the children were restrained in car seats in the crash .
At least one of them was not in a child safety seat , Dauphin County District Attorney Edward M. Marsico said .
State law calls for a child younger than 4 to be in a child - safety seat , and children age 4 to 8 must be restrained in booster seats .
Even if the evidence shows that all three children were not restrained , it can not be used to prosecute Hatfield for vehicular homicide or other violations except failing to properly restrain the children , Marsico said .
“ The law says that is not admissible in criminal proceedings , ” Marsico said .
Hatfield ’s car left the highway , went over a guardrail and struck trees and bushes before landing on its roof 25 feet down an embankment on the Susquehanna River side of the highway near Route 325 , or Mountain Road , troopers said .
Hatfield was charged in 2005 by the state attorney general ’s office with two counts of acquiring or obtaining possession of controlled substances by misrepresentation .
Those charges were dropped in March 2007 after she completed a year of probation under the accelerated rehabilitation disposition program , court records show .
Records also show Hatfield pleaded guilty to bad check charges in five cases from January 2008 to November 2009 .
( CNN ) --
It may be the most iconic piece of office equipment of the past half - century .
It has saved workers countless hours , spit out forests worth of documents , been cursed by anyone who 's faced a paper jam on deadline and been used by office pranksters to copy body parts .
It 's been immortalized in pop culture by Rob Schneider 's " Saturday Night Live " skits -- " Ran-dyyy !
The Rand-man ! Randatollah !
Making copies ! " -- and by the secretaries of " Mad Men , " who greet the 1962 arrival of the exotic new machine like a curiosity from another planet .
It 's that aging plow horse of the workplace -- the much - used , much - maligned office copier , and it 's 50 years old .
In March of 1960 , the first plain - paper office copier was shipped to a paying customer by Haloid Xerox , a little - known photographic - supply company in Rochester , New York .
The contraption was the size of two washing machines , weighed 648 pounds and had to be turned on its side to fit through doorways .
It also occasionally caught on fire .
But it revolutionized the workplace as we know it .
" It 's hard to imagine now , because we take it so much for granted .
But it took human communication forward a huge step , " said David Owen , author of " Copies in Seconds : Chester Carlson and the Birth of the Xerox Machine . "
" It was a product no one knew they needed until they had it . "
It was also a product that many loved to hate .
The earliest models were so unreliable that Haloid Xerox 's repair crews got emergency calls almost daily .
In the cult hit movie " Office Space , " three oppressed cubicle drones take a balky machine -- some say it 's not a copier but a fax machine or a printer -- into a field and smash it to pieces .
In today 's digital age , a machine that copies paper feels like a quaint mechanical relic .
And in most offices , the traditional copier has been eclipsed by the Internet - connected , multipurpose printer .
But in its heyday , the copier was an indispensable tool that turned Xerox into a verb ( much in the way " Google " is used today ) .
Imagine workplace life in the 1980s or 1990s without break - room memos , NCAA basketball tournament brackets or copies of copies of dog-eared cartoons , pinned to cubicle walls or passed virally around the office .
Remarkably , the first Xerox copier 's core technology -- a process called xerography -- is still widely used in copy machines five decades later .
It 's a technology that , despite inspiring what Fortune magazine later called " the most successful product ever marketed in America , " almost never saw the fluorescent light of day .
A lone inventor 's long quest
Since the dawn of the written word , people have sought an easy , quick way to copy documents .
The earliest " copiers " were actually monks who painstakingly transcribed text by hand with pen and ink .
They were eventually replaced by printing presses , stencils and carbon copies -- those messy colored sheets of paper that were used for credit - card transactions .
The first primitive office copiers , introduced in the 1950s with such retro-futuristic names as Dial - A - Matic and Duplitron , used chemically treated paper that smelled horrible and eventually turned black .
No one had devised a way to make a lasting copy on plain paper until Chester Carlson , a shy young New York City patent lawyer , came up with an idea during the Great Depression while looking for a solution to his writer 's cramp .
Carlson conceived a dry - printing process , called xerography , that would use photoconductivity , light and powdered resin to produce a mirror image of any document .
He offered it to dozens of corporations , including Kodak and IBM , but he could n't prove it would work .
They all turned him down .
Carlson spent more than a decade trying to design a working model of his copier -- an obsessive and mostly fruitless quest that cost him his first marriage -- until the Haloid company finally showed an interest .
By the mid-1950s , Haloid had devoted a team of engineers to the project .
It was a huge gamble .
The team toiled seven days a week in a Rochester warehouse , but progress was slow .
One early version of the machine stood almost 12 feet tall .
Another could only make copies in the dark .
Engineers improvised by cobbling together crude prototypes out of spare parts , such as aluminum pipes and rabbit - fur brushes .
But the company was running out of money , and outside observers saw no market for the copier .
" They all thought we were crazy .
We were spending money we did n't have on a product nobody wanted , " said Horace Becker , a mechanical engineer who worked on the machine .
That pressure to succeed created a tense working environment , Becker , now 86 , told CNN .
" My favorite pastime was throwing up breakfast . "
Success at last
By 1959 , however , Becker and the other engineers had produced a reliable prototype .
The model was called the 914 , because it copied -- at a then - blazing rate of seven pages per minute -- original sheets up to nine inches wide and 14 inches long .
The machine was an immediate hit with Haloid Xerox 's secretarial pool .
" Our girls love to use the 914 and have discovered many new copying jobs for it to do , " Haloid Xerox President Joseph Wilson said in a 1959 news release that was very much of its time .
" They feel great pride when their copies all look like originals . "
In fact , the 914's success may have been built on the enthusiasm it generated among those who actually used the copier most -- corporate America 's support staff .
These early adopters were overlooked by consultants who predicted the machine had " no future in the office - copying market . "
" They were asking the wrong people the wrong questions , " said Ann Neal , who manages Xerox 's historical archives .
The earliest 914s cost $ 2,000 to manufacture -- too much to make them viable as mass - market products .
So Haloid Xerox leased them for $ 95 a month , including 2,000 free copies .
The company earned 5 cents for every copy beyond that , and because customers used the machines much more heavily than expected , the income added up fast .
In 1959 , Haloid Xerox 's annual revenues were $ 32 million .
By 1962 , two years after the 914 hit the market , they had more than tripled .
By 1968 , Xerox ( the " Haloid " name was dropped in 1961 ) was a billion - dollar corporation -- bigger than U.S. Steel .
" It [ the copier ] made the company , " Neal said .
" It literally revolutionized the way business did business . "
A future for copying ?
By the time the first 914 model rolled off Haloid Xerox 's assembly line , Carlson 's original patent had expired .
Even so , he became a wealthy man almost overnight .
Fifty years later , many massive metal copiers are gathering dust in office storerooms -- long since replaced by sleek , digital desktops that print information from the Internet .
Xerox does n't even make a copier - only machine anymore , said Steve Hoover , the company 's vice president of global software and solutions .
" It 's gone .
They 're all printers .
Pure copying is down significantly , " he added .
Hoover said Xerox today must fight the perception that it 's only a copier company -- an ironic position considering how the company made its name .
" Sometimes you 're a victim of your past success , " he said .
" The use of paper has radically changed .
It used to be archival .
Now , it 's not , " Hoover said .
" The average document in the office , when it 's printed , has a life of about two days . "
From resumes to party invitations , paper in the 21st century is rapidly giving way to digital content stored on computers and shared via the Web .
So what 's the future of copying in the age of the iPad ?
For starters , researchers at Xerox have invented a kind of silver ink that can conduct electricity and will allow them to add computing power to plastics , film and fabrics .
" We 're in a time of transition , " Hoover said .
" We 're not worried about paper going away because we 've got other technology we 're working on .
The next five years are going to be really interesting . "
Now 65 , Eszterhas was interviewed on a visit to Los Angeles , in his suite at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel .
After a short time , and on the eve of the Oscars , it becomes clear that Joe Eszterhas does not need Hollywood .
But Hollywood just might need Joe Eszterhas .
The Devil 's Guide to Hollywood is dedicated to your wife , Naomi — and also a man called Jeno Mate .
Who is he ?
Jeno Mate brought me to America .
At the beginning of my film career , I thought that if I ever won an Oscar , I would make a little speech about Jeno Mate .
That Oscar speech looks unlikely , so I dedicated the book to him instead .
What was your relationship with him ?
My family and I left Hungary in 1945 , and we lived in refugee camps in Austria until 1950 .
But we needed a sponsor to come to the U.S.
We finally got one , and it was a man called Jeno Mate .
He sponsored hundreds of Hungarians to come to America .
When we arrived , we went to see him .
This huge , wild - haired , barrel - chested man came to the door , very Gypsy - looking , and yelled , " What do you want ?!
Do you want money ?!
I do n't have any money ! "
My father said , " No , I just want to thank you , sir . "
He shook our hands and slipped my dad a $ 20 bill .
You have a bumper sticker on your Suburban , " What This Country Needs is More Men Like John Wayne . "
Why do you think the Duke would be good for America ?
Well , movie critics do n't like John Wayne 's politics , but I think he was a terrific actor .
He was a natural .
I love cowboy movies , and he 's certainly my favorite cowboy .
But John
Wayne was much more than that .
He 's the personification of the rugged , all - American man .
That 's out - of - style these days .
One of the major themes in your last three books is your great affection for America .
Do you think other screenwriters are as passionate as you are about this country ?
Look , I 'm an immigrant , and the way an immigrant can love this country is unique .
I came to America when I was six years old .
My family was dirt poor .
I did n't have any contact with anybody — so I could n't network .
But my father kept saying to me , " Just do the work , and if you do it well , this is a big wide - open country — trust that you can get somewhere . "
I followed his advice , and that 's exactly what happened .
What was your big break ?
Well , I went to Ohio University .
I was a terrible student , but in 1966 I won the National Writing Competition sponsored by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation .
I was selected as the outstanding college journalist in the country .
I went to the White House and was awarded a gold medal .
That must have been quite a moment , especially given your humble beginnings .
President Johnson was busy at the ranch , so in his absence , Vice President Hubert Humphrey did the honors .
Hubert — God bless him — treated me as though I 'd just come off the boat .
He took me around the White House and showed me the portraits .
Look , Joe , that 's Dolly Madison .
As you may know , she was the wife of President James Madison .
Vice President Humphrey was a very warm man .
Because of that success , I became a reporter .
Dell has told a Linux - loving Reg reader that he can't receive a refund on the copy of Windows 7 that shipped with his new Dell netbook because it was bundled with the machine for " free " .
In October , another Reg reader succeeded in gaining a $ 115 ( £ 70.34 ) refund from the computer maker after he rejected the licence for Microsoft 's OS and installed Linux instead .
Microsoft 's EULA , you see , provides for such a refund .
" By using the software , you accept these terms , " it reads .
" If you do not accept them , do not use the software .
Instead , return it to the retailer for a refund or credit . "
UK - based school teacher Adam Drake recently tried the same Windows rejection trick .
But his effort to secure a refund was in turn rejected by Dell .
According to a company support rep , Drake was not entitled to a refund because his copy of Windows 7 was included with his machine for free .
" The one that was charged to you is just for shipping and handling so that means you got the Windows 7 for free , " the rep says .
Presumably , the rep is mistaking Drake 's copy of Windows 7 - which came preloaded on his system - with the Windows 7 upgrade kit that OEMs provided with Windows XP systems around the time of the new OS 's launch last fall .
Drake made multiple efforts to convince her that the OS actually costs money and that he was indeed entitled to a refund .
" I hope you understand that this is n't going to go away , " he told her .
" My plan is to pursue this as long as it takes , and maybe write a book or film script along the way .
I 'd be played by Harrison Ford or Liam Neeson . "
But the rep would not back down .
Asked about refunds for rejected copies of Windows 7 , Dell tells us that despite the $ 115 success of Reg reader Graeme Cobbett , the company policy is that it will only accept returns for the entire system .
" We consider the OS part of the base config , like and other key components ( e.g. processor , memory , etc. ) , " the company says .
We have pointed out to Dell that Dell handed Cobbett a refund after he rejected Windows 7 in favor of the Ubuntu - based Linux Mint .
But the company seems to view this as a mistake .
" Would have to look to see if there was any other potential issue in play that contributed to a refund being offered , or else use this as a touchpoint point for training refresh , " it tells us .
In any event , Windows 7 is not free . ®

In recent years the US has begun to lag in education for science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( STEM ) , and a number of efforts are underway to address this issue .
We know that giving kids hands - on experience is one of the best ways to spark and keep their interest in STEM - related fields , and to this end , high schoolers all over the country are getting an opportunity to learn and apply STEM knowledge by participating in the annual Rube Goldberg Machine Contest .
Rube Goldberg , who was himself an engineer , is most famous for his cartoons that depicted contrived , complex contraptions for executing the most mundane tasks .
The cartoons were meant to serve as a criticism for the encroachment of technology in our lives during the early part of the 20th century , and the tendency to favor " exerting maximum effort to achieve minimal results . "
Rube Goldberg machines , named in honor of these cartoons , typically involve complex arrangements of levers , pulleys , balloons , ball bearings , mouse traps , and other mechanical means that could accomplish something as simple as starting a phonograph .
Perhaps the most recent example of a Rube Goldberg machine in pop culture was featured in a recent video by the band OK Go. Known for their unusual and widely viewed music videos , the band spent 5 months with a team of as many as 60 engineers and designers to create an elaborate Rube Goldberg machine synced to its song " This Too Shall Pass . "
The machine ultimately shoots colored paint out of air cannons and all over the band members at the end of the four - minute song .
In 1949 , two engineering fraternities at Purdue University began a competition to devise the most complex machine to accomplish a given goal .
That competition lasted for six years , but was later revived by one of the fraternities in 1983 .
The competition culminated in the first national Rube Goldberg Machine Contest in 1988 , and it has been held at Purdue ever since .
In 2007 , high schools were permitted to participate in the national contest for the first time , giving kids as young as 14 exposure to one of the most exciting and diabolical engineering competitions ever .
This is a classic Rube Goldberg machine , " How to Keep the Boss from Knowing you are Late for Work . "
It sometimes comes in handy around here in the Orbiting HQ .
Having grown up in the same city as Purdue University , I got to witness several collegiate national competitions , including the classics , " put coins in a bank , toast a slice of bread " and " squeeze the juice from an orange . "
This year 's goal was to create a machine that can dispense hand sanitizer in no less than 20 steps .
I had the incredible opportunity to serve as a judge for a Chicago - area regional high school competition held recently at Prosser Career Academy .
Five schools competed for a chance to go on to compete at the national contest at Purdue on March 27 , including one school that traveled all the way from North Carolina .
Competition builds better engineers
The teams competing included Prosser and Jones College Prep from the Chicago Public Schools system , Niles West High School and Downers Grove North High School from the suburbs , and River Mill Academy from Graham , North Carolina .
Schools normally compete in a local regional competition , and advisor Sandi Daigle told Ars that the Rivermill team had originally planned to compete in Knoxville , Tennessee .
However , only River Mill and a team from Knoxville were registered for that event , and the rules require at least three teams to compete to move on to nationals .
" It was either here , Las Vegas , or Korea , " she said .
Funding seemed to be a big concern for most of the schools participating .
" Our school is tiny — we do n't even have bells , " Daigle told Ars .
" We ended up having a parent donate frequent flyer miles to pay for the hotel . "
The team from Jones Prep had an even bigger budget constraint : $ 0 .
The science budget only included enough money for the entry fee for the regional competition ; the machine itself had to be built using only materials in advisor Alexis Kovacs '
Physics lab .
" Using what we could find , including cardboard and duct tape , we built a pretty good Rube Goldberg machine without buying anything fancy , " Kovacs told Ars .
The machine also included masses from a balance set , physics text books , astronomy board games , the ever - popular series of dominos , a vintage motorized solar system model , and trash cans " appropriated " from the school 's sixth floor .
The team did admit to pooling loose change to buy water balloons , however .
" I think it makes it more challenging , " Kovacs said , " but I think in the end the kids feel better about themselves about having built something that did n't require buying anything . "
The team from Jones College Prep describes how their machine works for the judges .
The teams were all built from membership in a science or engineering club , and most noted that the Rube Goldberg competition gave them a directed goal to work towards throughout the school year .
" We do n't have a lot of extra - curricular activities , " River Mill 's Daigle told Ars , " and I said , ' Hey , I 'm interested in starting an engineering club . '
The Rube Goldberg contest gave us something to do in the club , as opposed to sitting around and tinkering with stuff . "
Most of the teacher / advisors agreed that giving kids a hands - on opportunity was a critical aspect of participating in the competition .
" It 's a great way to get kids who might otherwise be intimidated by the math or hard science involved and interested in STEM , " Kovacs said .
" For those that are already interested in science or engineering fields , this helps them be able to solve real problems and really use their hands . "
Downer Grove North 's Jeff Grant agreed , noting that the competition helped his students to see their ideas turned into something tangible .
" I think that 's super vital , " he told Ars .
" There 's just no opportunity to do something like this in the classroom . "
Teamwork and the team - building experience were also considered important aspects of the competition .
Niles
West advisor Ben Brzezinski told
Ars that working as a team will be a skill that the students will use for the rest of their lives .
" Wherever they end up , they are going to have to work as a team to build things , whether they go into engineering or any other field , " he said .
" There definitely has to be a sort of synergy there , as well as leadership , and camaraderie . "
That camaraderie is something that River Mill team member Joshua Crumb valued most .
" It 's a great bond — you have eight or so people that you might honestly never talk to , and by the end we 're all like family , " he told Ars .
Prosser advisor and competition organizer Nathan Dolenc said that getting to know his students better was his number - one priority , something he felt many teachers miss out on .
" Yes , it 's about making the machine work , but it 's also about the journey getting there , " he told Ars .
" Hopefully , some of my lessons rub off on them . "
What should an aspiring candidate for governor do if she has never run a campaign before and wants to nearly double her lead in polls as her party ’s primary election approaches ?
Here is Meg Whitman ’s answer : Spend $ 358,439 a day , $ 14,935 an hour , $ 249 a minute .
The billionaire former EBay chief has distributed $ 27.2 million -- almost all of it her own money -- to hundreds of businesses and people in the 76 days between Jan. 1 and March 17 , a campaign statement filed with the state Monday shows .
In approximately that time , she built a soaring lead over fellow Republican Steve Poizner and a narrow one over Democrat Jerry Brown in a poll released last week .
Most of the money , nearly $ 21 million , bought airtime and production of radio ads that Whitman began airing last fall and the television ad campaign she launched in February .
Her single largest expenditure , $ 6.1 million on Feb. 3 , went to Smart Media Group , which buys air time , two days before she unveiled her first television ad .
It portrays an optimistic Whitman amid images of desolate California landscapes .
Less than a month later , Whitman began her second series of ads .
The “ Why we ca n’t trust Steve Poizner ” spots have been running one after another during prime time , enumerating “ reasons ” related to property taxes , contributions to Democrat Al Gore and use of state resources .
Whitman has paid $ 770,000 to her staff since Jan. 1 and at least $ 106,443 to private charter airplane companies .
“ We ’re running a campaign that is designed to get our message out , that is designed to reach voters by all different kinds of media , ” Whitman said at a Sacramento campaign stop Tuesday .
“ And then of course I ’m traveling the state .
. . .
It ’s a six - day - a - week job , and we will have the resources that are required to get all the way through . ”
Her campaign has been a bonanza for political consultants .
She paid 28 individuals or firms more than $ 2 million for consulting services , according to her disclosure .
Among them , a firm run by Mike Murphy , a former political advisor to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , received $ 430,000 , including a $ 250,000 initial fee and two monthly payments of $ 90,000 each .
She paid $ 255,000 to the consulting firm of Spencer Zwick , who was finance director for the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney , Whitman ’s former employer at Bain Co. and a mentor .
Whitman has injected $ 39 million of her own money into her race .
She also has raised $ 1.1 million this year from independent sources , but she paid $ 531,269 to professional fundraisers , her filing shows -- a high ratio of expenses to fundraising , experts say .
“ You would never want your cost to be in the neighborhood of 50 % , ” said Bettina Duval , founder of the California List , a fundraising organization dedicated to electing female Democrats to state office .
Whitman ’s spokesman , Tucker Bounds , said much of the fundraising expense was related to work done last year .
Her campaign paid $ 667,411 to Tokoni Inc. , a firm run byformer associates at EBay , for Internet , e-mail , website and other services .
Whitman ’s other expenditures included almost $ 9,000 at branches of the Apple Store .
The campaign made two purchases at Sigona ’s Farmer ’s Market in Redwood City for a total of $ 518 .
Several consultants said Whitman ’s approach -- beginning to spend on radio ads last year and moving to television this year -- has worked .
“ You can say all you want as to what the public thinks about people spending lots of money , ” said Allan Hoffenblum , a former Republican political consultant who is now publisher of the nonpartisan California Target Book , which tracks legislative and congressional races .
“ My personal opinion is they do n’t really care as long as it ’s not their own .
She spent it very wisely and effectively . ”
Garry South , a Democratic consultant who ran Gray Davis ’ campaigns for governor , said Whitman is spending “ at a pace that has never been seen before in a California governor ’s race . ”
But he said she did not start too early and has not bombarded viewers to the point of annoyance , as Al Checchi , a Democrat , did in 1998 when he spent tens of millions of dollars in a losing primary race against Davis .
“ She ’s spending her money much more smartly than Checchi did , ” South said .
“ The proof ’s in the pudding .
She ’s got a huge lead over Poizner and now is leading . . . Brown . ”
Derek Cressman , Western states regional director for Common Cause , a civic group , said wealthy candidates largely have the political arena to themselves .
“ I do feel like our elections are now out of striking distance for regular people , and the only way you can run for office is to be personally wealthy yourself or be really well - connected to rich people , ” he said .

At PyCon , Maciej from the PyPy team asked for programs that the PyPy JIT did a really bad job on .
I have a directory full of over 200 little Python programs that attempt to solve Project Euler math problems .
Only 186 of them get the right answer , and fewer of them run in a reasonable period of time .
But this led me to concoct a quick benchmark comparing the Python implementations installed on my computer : CPython , CPython with Psyco , Unladen Swallow , and PyPy .
( I have n't tested them with Jython or IronPython yet .
Maybe someday . )
Basically , I just run all of euler *. py under four different Python implementations , record how long it took each implementation to run each program , and throw out the results for any programs that did n't work in all four versions of Python , or that did n't finish in 60 seconds or less on all of them .
Here are the results , for recent svn checkouts of PyPy and Unladen , CPython 2.6.4 , and CPython 2.6.4 plus Psyco 1.6 .
( Do n't get too obsessed with the exact results , since it 's just a private benchmark and most of the code is unpublished .
This is just background for the real information at the bottom of the post . )

So all the JITs are faster than CPython for this set of programs , but none is twice as fast .
PyPy has the most wins , but Psyco has the lowest total time .
While PyPy does very well overall , it 's an order of magnitude slower than all the others on 3 of the programs : 14 , 135 , and 174 .
If PyPy fixed whatever made those ones slow , it would definitely be the overall leader .
Here 's my euler14.py
#!/usr/bin/env python " " " Project Euler , problem 14 The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers : n -> n / 2 ( n is even ) n ->
3n + 1 ( n is odd )
Which starting number , under one million , produces the longest chain ? " " " def next_num ( num ) : if num & 1 : return 3 * num + 1 else : return num // 2 MAX_NUM = 1000000 lengths = { 1 : 0} def series_length ( num ) : global lengths if num in lengths : return lengths [ num ] else : num2 = next_num ( num ) result = 1 + series_length ( num2 ) lengths [ num ] = result return result def main ( ) : num_with_max_length = 1 max_length = 0 for ii in range ( 1 , MAX_NUM ) : length = series_length ( ii ) if length > max_length : max_length = length num_with_max_length = ii print num_with_max_length , max_length if __name__ == " __main__ " : main ( )
Why is 14 so slow ?
My guess would be that it 's because it heavily mutates a global dictionary .
Here 's euler135.py :
#!/usr/bin/env python " " " Project Euler , problem 135 Given the positive integers , x , y , and z , are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression , the least value of the positive integer , n , for which the equation , x** 2 - y** 2 - z** 2 = n , has exactly two solutions is n = 27 : 34**2 - 27**2 - 20**2 = 12**2 - 9**2 - 6**2 = 27
It turns out that n = 1155 is the least value which has exactly ten solutions .
How many values of n less than one million have exactly ten distinct solutions ? " " " " " " x** 2 - y** 2 - z** 2 = n y = z + d x = z + 2 * d d > 0 z > 0 ( z + 2 d ) ** 2 - ( z + d ) ** 2 - z ** 2 = n ( z ** 2 + 4dz + 4d ** 2 ) - ( z** 2 + 2dz + d** 2 ) - z** 2 = n z** 2 + 4dz + 4d **2 -z**2 - 2dz - d**2 - z**2 = n -z**2 + 2dz + 3d**2 - n = 0 a = - 1 b = 2d c = 3d**2 - n z = (- b +/- sqrt( b**2 - 4ac ) ) / 2a z = ( - 2d +/- sqrt(4d**2+4( 3d ** 2 -n ) ) ) / - 2 z = ( - 2d +/- sqrt( 4d**2+12d**2-4n ) ) ) / - 2 z = ( - 2d +/- sqrt( 16d**2 - 4n ) ) ) / - 2 z = ( - 2d +/- 2 sqrt ( 4d** 2 - n ) ) / - 2 z = ( -d +/- sqrt( 4d**2 - n ) ) / - 1 z = d +/- sqrt( 4d**2 - n ) 4d**2 - n >= 0 n <= 4d**2 4d**2 - n is a perfect square " " " def main ( ) : limit = 1000000 counts = limit * [ 0 ] for d in range ( 1 , limit / 4 + 1 ) : d24 = d ** 2 * 4 if d24 < limit : start = 1 counts [ d 24 ] += 1 else : start = int(( d24 - limit ) ** 0.5 ) if start < 1 : start = 1 for root in xrange ( start , 2 * d ) : n = d24 - root ** 2 if n <= 0 : break if n < limit : z = root + d y = z + d x = y + d # print " n " , n , " d " , d , " root " , root , " x " , x , " y " , y , " z " , z #assert x** 2 - y** 2 - z** 2 == n counts [ n ] += 1 if d > root : z = d - root y = z + d x = y + d # print " n " , n , " d " , d , " root " , root , " x " , x , " y " , y , " z " , z #assert x** 2 - y** 2 - z** 2 == n counts [ n ] += 1 total = 0 assert counts [ 0 ] == 0 for val in counts : if val == 10 : total += 1 print total if __name__ == " __main__ " : main ( )
Why is PyPy so slow on this one ?
Well , maybe it's because all the work happens in one function , if PyPy does n't JIT a function while it 's still running .
Or maybe it 's the list with a million elements in it .
Finally , euler174.py :
#!/usr/bin/env python " " " Project Euler , problem 174
We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square " hole " so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry .
Given eight tiles it is possible to form a lamina in only one way : 3x3 square with a 1x1 hole in the middle .
However , using thirty - two tiles it is possible to form two distinct laminae .
If t represents the number of tiles used , we shall say that t = 8 is type L( 1 ) and t = 32 is type L( 2 ) .
Let N( n ) be the number of t <= 1000000 such that t is type L( n ) ; for example , N ( 15 ) = 832 .
What is sum ( N ( n ) ) for 1 <= n <= 10 ? " " " from math import ceil from collections import defaultdict def gen_laminae ( limit ) : " " " Yield laminae with up to limit squares , as tuples ( outer , inner , squares ) " " " for outer in range ( 3 , limit // 4 + 2 ) : if outer & 1 : min_min_inner = 1 else : min_min_inner = 2 min_inner_squared = outer ** 2 - limit if min_inner_squared < 0 : min_inner = min_min_inner else : min_inner = max ( min_min_inner , int(ceil(min_inner_squared ** 0.5 ) ) ) if outer & 1 != min_inner & 1 : min_inner += 1 outer_squared = outer ** 2 for inner in range ( min_inner , outer - 1 , 2 ) : squares = outer_squared - inner ** 2 yield ( outer , inner , squares ) def main ( ) : squares_to_count = defaultdict ( int ) for ( outer , inner , squares ) in gen_laminae ( 1000000 ) : squares_to_count[ squares ] += 1 histogram = defaultdict ( int ) for val in squares_to_count.values ( ) : if val <= 10 : histogram[ val ] += 1 print sum( histogram.values ( ) ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : main ( )
Perhaps this one is slow because it heavily uses generators and a defaultdict ?
Anyway , I 'm not claiming any of these are great programs .
I know others have much better solutions to these problems .
And this code is certainly not optimized for PyPy .
They 're just examples of small programs that were originally written for CPython , and do work correctly on PyPy , but happen to be much slower on PyPy than on CPython .
Again , note these are the exceptions not the rule .
PyPy runs most pure - Python code great .
Just not these three programs .

London 's financial district is " aflame " with rumors of a possible takeover of ARM by a company that only yesterday announced that it was sitting on a cash reserve of $ 41.7bn : Apple .
With that amount of liquidity sloshing around , such a takeover would be by no means unrealistic for Jobs & Co .
According to Wednesday 's Evening Standard , The City's " gossips " are floating a rumor of Apple 's interest in the UK chip designer .
And apparently many financial types feel there may be truth behind that gossip : the Standard reports that more than five million ARM shares changed hands on Wednesday , boosting the stock price by over 3 per cent and making it FTSE 's biggest winner in the day 's trading .
" A deal would make a lot of sense for Apple , " one trader told the Standard .
" That way , they could stop ARM 's technology from ending up in everyone else 's computers and gadgets . "
Which would , shall we say , send shockwaves throughout the " computers and gadgets " industry .
Apple was recently reported to have bagged all or part of chip - designer Intrinsity , ( one of ) the alleged brains behind the A4 chip powering the iPad .
Also , Cupertino acquired chipmaker PA Semi back in 2008 , although word on the street is that many of the engineers that came along with that deal have moved on to their own start - up , Agnilux - which was just acquired by Google .
But those acquisitions would be small potatoes compared to an Apple acquisition of ARM .
Although the Cambridge - based chipmaker 's stock closed today at 251.1 p , the Standard 's sources are of the opinion that a takeover offer would be in the 500 p per share range - which would place ARM 's value at more than £ 5.2 bn ( $ 8 bn ) .
That figure would amount to nearly 20 per cent of Apple 's war chest - but the competitive advantage of acquiring ARM might very well make such an expenditure a long - term bargain .
After all , Apple is essentially minting money right now .
Why not spend a good chunk of it to both enhance your chipmaking expertise and kneecap your competitors ? ®
— A Chapel Hill man was arrested Tuesday morning after a high - speed chase on Interstate 40 that crossed 22 miles of Wake County , ending on Airport Boulevard in Morrisville .
A deputy stopped a pink 1997 Mercury Grand Marquis for a traffic violation at U.S. Highway 70 and Jones Sausage Road around 8:45 a.m. , said Phyllis Stephens , a spokeswoman for Wake County Sheriff 's Office .
As the deputy approached , the driver – identified as Randel Levone Riggsbee , 32 , of 503 Sykes St. in Chapel Hill – sped away .
The chase went onto Interstate 40 West , where the state Highway Patrol took over .
Sky 5 video showed at least nine law enforcement vehicles chasing a pink sedan with a " Hello Kitty " vanity plate .
The chase reached speeds over 85 mph .
Stephens said the Mercury ran over stop sticks laid down by troopers and went down the Airport Boulevard exit .
The Mercury struck an SUV , then crashed into a guardrail , ending the chase around 9:10 a.m .
Riggsbee jumped out of the Mercury and ran into a wooded area , but officers caught him after a short foot chase , she said .
No one was injured in the chase .
The SUV sustained minor damage , and the front window of a cruiser was cracked .
Deputies seized an undetermined amount of cash from the Mercury .
Riggsbee faces 15 charges stemming from the wreck and outstanding warrants in Wake , Orange , Alamance and Randolph counties :
felony speeding to elude arrest
reckless driving
hit-and-run
resisting , obstruct or delaying justice
giving fictitious information to an officer
damage to property
exceeding posted speed limit
tint violation
driving with a revoked license
communicating threats
breaking - and - entering a motor vehicle
felony possession of stolen property
misdemeanor drug possession
resisting , obstruct or delaying an officer
passing a worthless check
He was placed in the Wake County jail under a $ 148,150 secured bond .
Riggsbee served a one - year sentence after being convicted in 2007 of two counts each of driving while impaired and speeding in an attempt to elude arrest , according to state Department of Correction records .
This was the second high - speed chase in Wake County this week .
On Monday , authorities chased a driver along Interstate 540 from Wendell into Raleigh .
Matthew Draper , 24 , of 3020 Allenby Drive in Raleigh , was charged in that chase .
On the drive back from Madison yesterday , I listened to a lecture by MIT psychologist Sherry Turkle on the very personal relationships we have with objects , particularly the objects that help us think .
Turkle talked about her 2008 book , Falling for Science , a collection of interviews with MIT students , and established scientists , about the objects that first drew their minds to math , computers , science and technology .
Some were what you 'd expect : Broken radios , Legos , a computer .
But one story , about a My Little Pony , really caught my attention .
I had several small plastic Ponies that I used to play make - believe with my friends .
But I had one larger , plush My Little Pony , a bright - green stuffed horse with a vivid pink mane and tail that I played with all by myself .
I would sit for hours on my own , braiding and rebraiding its tail .
I developed a system for braiding the tail of my Pony that taught me about mathematical concepts– from division to recursion .
Read more of computer scientist Christine Alvarado 's story after the cut .
When I started , I took the hair on the Pony 's tail and divided it into three pieces for braiding .
Soon I became bored with a single braid .
I then divided the tail into nine pieces and made three groups .
I braided each group of three until I had three braids , then took these three braids and braided them together .
Soon I was up to starting with twenty - seven pieces ( nested down to nine braids , then to three and then one ) and then on to eighty - one .
All the while I was learning about math : I saw that division is the process of taking a large number of things and grouping them into a smaller number of groups .
In order to end up with one even braid at the end , I had to be able to divide the initial number evenly by three , then by three , and then by three again , until I ended up with just one braid .
I learned that I had to start with speciï¬c numbers of pieces in order for the braid to come out evenly .
These speciï¬c numbers , of course , turned out to be powers of three .
Overall , though , what I liked most about braiding was recursion .
The large braid was made up of smaller braids that in turn were also made up of smaller braids , and I pushed this structure as far as I could take it .
I once attempted to begin the braiding process with 243 pieces , but because each of these sections consisted of only about ï¬ve strands of hair , I was forced to give it up .
With braiding on my mind , I began to see recursion everywhere .
One night at the dinner table , I was eating cauliflower and I noticed that it had the same recursive structure of my braids .
Moreover , the cauliflower seemed to continue to recurse forever .
I began to divide the piece of cauliflower on my plate , determined to ï¬nd the base level , but it split further and further until the pieces were too tiny to hold .
My parents gave me a strange glance , and I continued to eat , still fascinated by the underlying structure of my vegetables .
More evidence of violations in West Virginia mine explosion
By Samuel Davidson
13 April 2010
Rescue teams reentered the Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia early Monday morning hoping to remove the nine remaining bodies of the 29 miners that were killed in last Monday ’s blast .
Early Saturday morning rescuers found the bodies of four missing miners .
On Sunday , teams seeking to recover bodies were forced to leave the mine after encountering high levels of methane gas .
Crews worked during the night to ventilate the mine through several boreholes .
The Upper Big Branch Mine is owned by Massey Energy , the 5th largest mining company in the United States .
The disaster last Monday was the deadliest coal mining accident since a 1970 explosion in Hyden , Kentucky that killed 38 miners .
Public pressure is growing for the Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) to hold a public investigation into this disaster .
Already a huge body of evidence has emerged that justifies the criminal prosecution of Massey CEO Don Blankenship and other top officials at Massey Energy .
In addition , evidence exists that top MSHA officials are also criminally responsible for failing to carry out their responsibility to ensure miners ’ safety .
MSHA records reveal that over the past several months company officials at the Upper Big Branch Mine were engaged in a dispute with regulators over serious ventilation problems .
In December of last year , mine safety officials cited Massey for disregarding a previous order to redirect dirty air that was coming off a conveyor belt tunnel away from the area where miners were working .
In March 2010 , safety officials found that Massey still had not corrected the problem .
In addition , they found that airflow was half of what was needed to prevent the buildup of explosive methane gas and coal dust .
On Friday , MSHA officials released data showing that the Upper Big Branch Mine was cited five times more often than the national average for ventilation and coal dust control problems .
In fact , MSHA investigators had ordered the mine or parts of it closed 61 times since 2009 , including seven times this year because of unsafe conditions .
However , MSHA officials took no action to have the mine shut entirely .
Since 2006 , when MSHA began a somewhat more aggressive inspections and citations policy following the Sago mine disaster , Massey Energy officials carried out a deliberate policy of challenging citations .
The aim was to bury the small number of Labor Department judges under a pile of appeals .
More important to Massey than not having to pay the small fines was the fact that an appealed citation would not be considered when establishing a “ pattern of violations ” that could lead to the mine being closed down .
MSHA records show that company officials at the Upper Big Branch mine began appealing citations issued by safety officials to prevent a “ pattern of violations ” from emerging
This practice is not limited to the Upper Big Branch Mine or even Massey Energy .
Government records show that every major coal producer has instituted the same policy .
The World Socialist Web Site spoke to workers and residents in West Virginia about the mine disaster and the conditions that led up to it .
Kelly , who works in a local store , said , “ Mining is not a career choice .
If you live in this area , mining is the only job around .
If you are not working at Massey or one of the other few mines in the area , there is not very much else that you can do that pays enough to support a family .
These men are working because this is how to get by .
These men have no other choice .
“ I do disagree with how things work at Massey .
These state and federal inspectors go into these mines , and they are able to continue operating unsafe . ”
“ Massey makes a killing in these mines , and then it is big news that they announce they will pay for the funerals , ” Kelly added .
“ What is it going to do for these families who have lost husbands , fathers and sons that the company will pay for the funeral ? ”
Denny , with his coworker Sherry
Denny , 19 , said , “ I feel that if there were not so many safety violations , the situation would be a whole lot different .
I hear a lot of people talking about Massey and I can’t think of a good thing that anybody has said about them .
“ There are no jobs in a little spot like this except the coal mines .
I have to drive all the way to Charleston every day for a job that is not in the mines .
“ It is basically mines if you want to make money to support a family .
The only future I see here are the coal companies .
Even the railroads depend on coal .
The company does n’t care about the miners , just about the money . ”
Chuck Smith is a laid - off miner with seven years working underground .
“ Massey does n’t care about the miners , just getting that coal out .
They have a slurry pond in the mountain right above an elementary school .
What is going to happen to those children if the dam breaks ?
A few years ago , they were mining in the mountain under the slurry pond and accidentally punched into it and had all that water and mud flooding into the mine .
“ When I started as a miner , I was working for a contractor in a Massey mine .
There was a cave - in , and they brought us in to clean it out .
The miners told us it was n’t safe .
When we got done , instead of giving us all jobs , they sent us home .
We fixed the mine up and were laid off the next day .
I ’ll never work for Massey again .
“ My friend went in and worked the long wall [ at Upper Big Branch ] .
He said the whole face was falling and breaking all the time .
He came out and said there was going to be a cave - in in that mine .
If you could look at the company records , you would see that in the last three months lots of people quit that mine because they knew it was n’t safe . ”
SCO 's fate has been placed in the hands of 12 Utah jurors who will resume deliberations on Tuesday .
They are tasked with deciding whether the UNIX SVRX copyrights were transferred from Novell to SCO in a 1995 asset purchase agreement .
SCO 's legal battle began in 2003 when the company claimed that Linux includes code that was misappropriated from UNIX .
Novell claims that SCO does not have standing to pursue litigation relating to SVRX copyright infringement because it does not own the relevant copyrights .
A bench trial that concluded in 2007 ruled in Novell 's favor but was later overturned .
The case was put before a jury , which heard the closing arguments on Friday .
Groklaw has published a series of first - hand accounts from spectators who were present on Friday when the final arguments were heard .
Laywer Sterling Brennan , representing Novell , contends that SCO 's claim of owning the SVRX copyrights is invalid because it is based on a term sheet rather than the final agreement .
He also questioned the credibility of SCO 's witnesses , contending that the few who seem to remember what actually transpired have a financial stake in the outcome of the trial .
Further , he says that the threats of litigation that SCO sent to Linux customers were a blatant violation of the terms of the asset purchase agreement .
Stuart Singer , representing SCO , claims that the transfer of the SVRX copyrights was excluded by accident in the original transaction , but that this was rectified in an amendment that was added later .
He contends that the amendment is valid and that it was authorized by Novell .
This matter is disputed , but SCO 's witnesses say that the original intent of the agreement was to transfer the copyrights .
The judge has instructed the jury to consider the amendment when evaluating SCO 's claim of ownership .
He also explained that SCO has the burden of proof , which means that they should only find in SCO 's favor if they believe that SCO 's evidence is clear and convincing .
The jury will not deliberate on Monday due to a scheduling conflict for one of the jurors , but may return a verdict as early as Tuesday ; any decision must be unanimous .
If they do not issue a verdict in SCO 's favor , it 's likely that this will be the end of the road for the dying UNIX vendor .
SCO 's bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing , and the end result could very well be liquidation if a verdict in favor of Novell pulls the rug out from under SCO 's legal campaign against Linux .

The severe epidemic of plague known as the " Black Death " caused the death of a third of the European population in the 14th century .
It is probable that the climatic conditions of the time were a contributory factor towards the disaster .
" The late Middle Ages were unique from the point of view of climate , " explains Dr Ulf BÃ¼ntgen of the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest , Snow and Landscape Research ( WSL ) in Birmensdorf , Switzerland .
" Significantly , there were distinct phases in which summers were wetter than they are today . "
What exactly took place at the time can be reconstructed today by studying the annual growth rings of old oak trees .
" Annual growth rings provide us with an accurate indication of summer droughts for each individual year , dating back to late medieval times , " adds Professor Dr Jan Esper of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz .
Together with colleagues at the universities of Bonn , GieÃŸen , and GÃ¶ttingen , BÃ¼ntgen and Esser managed , with the aid of the information provided by tree growth rings , to identify for the first time the summer drought periods over extensive areas of Germany in the last 1000 years .
Their results have been published in the leading specialist journal Quaternary Science Reviews .
Using dendrochronology , the researchers have been able to demonstrate , for example , that a ridge beam in an old timber - framed house in the city of Kassel must have come from a tree felled in 1439 .
In this technique , the pattern of annual growth rings is compared with those in already dated wood samples .
" We can thus determine the exact age of every beam , " says BÃ¼ntgen , describing the process .
The ridge beam can also provide information on whether past summers in Kassel were wet or dry .
" If a summer tended to be wet , the trees generally grew faster , thus resulting in wider growth rings , " Esper explains .
However , the information available from one beam is not enough to allow reliable conclusions about the climate in Kassel in 1439 to be reached .
A large number of wood samples are required .
For their survey the researchers analyzed 953 different pieces of oak .
To obtain information on the more recent past , they took wood from living trees .
They also took samples from wooden construction elements of old timber - framed houses , castles , and churches , thus roughly covering the period of the last 1000 years .
All construction wood samples were obtained in the north of the German state of Hesse and the south of Lower Saxony , while the living wood came from the region of the Kellerwald - Edersee National Park .
" Oak trees in this area are particularly sensitive to climate change , " states BÃ¼ntgen , explaining why these sites were selected .
The oldest wood sample used in this survey dates back to the year 996 A.D. , a time when the Holy Roman Empire was just coming into being .
A total of 135,000 individual growth rings were measured to obtain a detailed overview of the history of rainfall in Germany , covering major eras ranging from the optimal Medieval climate ( warm and humid ) through the Little Ice Age ( dry and cold ) to that of the Industrial Climate Change ( dry and warm ) .

BRISTOL , Tenn . -- Carl Edwards and Brad Keselowski left the NASCAR hauler after a Saturday morning meeting at Bristol Motor Speedway smiling but going in opposite directions .
Do they see eye to eye on everything that led Edwards to intentionally wreck Keselowski two weeks ago at Atlanta Motor Speedway ?
" No , but I think that they will give one another enough respect that we wo n't see another occurrence like that , " said Jack Roush , who owns Edwards ' No. 99 Roush Fenway Racing car .
" I think Carl is not likely to have incidental contact with Brad and cause a wreck , and I think Brad is not likely to have incidental contact with Carl and cause a wreck in the foreseeable future . "
The 35 - minute meeting began shortly after 9 a.m. ET and lasted through the start of Nationwide Series qualifying , forcing both drivers to push their start time back .
Roush , Penske Racing owner Roger Penske , NASCAR president Mike Helton , vice president of competition Robin Pemberton and Sprint Cup series director John Darby were among those who met with the drivers .
NASCAR called the meeting , according to spokesman Kerry Tharp , to make sure everybody " was on the same page . "
Safety also was a concern after Edwards ' bump sent Keselowski's car into an airborne flip .
Both drivers seemed satisfied with the result of the meeting .
" The biggest thing coming out of that is that now , I think , Brad and I understand one another a little better , " Edwards said .
" We 're gonna be able to just go forward and go racing , and that 's what this is all about .
" It was really cool to be able to talk with Jack and Roger and Brad all at once .
We laughed .
We cried .
In the end , I think it 's gonna be good . "
The incident drew a three - race probation , beginning Sunday at Bristol , for Edwards .
NASCAR opted not to further penalize him for fear it would diminish much of the aggressiveness and personality the governing body attempted to re-establish when it told drivers to " have at it , boys " before the season .
" We do n't want anything to lower that competitive edge , " Tharp said .
Keselowski said he did n't hear anything in the meeting that surprised him .
" I was hoping that I would be , to be honest , " said the second - year Cup driver , who expressed concern last week that Edwards ' action went much deeper than on - track conflict .
" You have to understand that Carl and I have a mutual respect because in a sense we 're almost the same people .
We were born with similar backgrounds and drive the same way .
I had a lot of respect for him before and after the accident . "
Keselowski has been criticized by many drivers for his aggressiveness over the past year .
Denny Hamlin intentionally wrecked him in the Nationwide season finale at Homestead - Miami Speedway for an incident that occurred the previous week at Phoenix .
" I think he 'll learn .
He 's going to say he 's going to race the same way , but I 'm sure he won't , " Juan Pablo Montoya said .
" And if he does , somebody else will wreck him again .
Race hard because you want to show you can get the job done .
But you 've got to learn to respect everybody . "
Edwards and Keselowski had several run-ins before an incident early at Atlanta that left Edwards 156 laps down .
Keselowski has been adamant that he wo n't change his driving style .
That 's not Penske 's intent , either .
" He 's a terrific talent , " Penske said .
" I do n't tell my drivers to run hard or run soft .
I think he knows what he has to do on the racetrack with his peers , and quite honestly , he is n't making any statements about what he 's going to do or not do .
" I think the media has taken some of that and moved it further and made him with a bigger circle around him .
What I want him to do is run fair on the racetrack and be competitive .
But again , the other drivers have to respect him . "
Keselowski and Edwards seemed to have put aside their differences during Nationwide qualifying , leaning over from opposite sides of Keselowski's hood to chat after Keselowski 's pole run .
" The guys agreed they 're going to race hard , fair and give themselves some room on the racetrack so we do n't become the poster boys every weekend on what 's happening , " Penske said .
" I said , ' Hey , at the end of races , if we 're racing for the lead with a lap or two to go , you 're going to have to run hard .
But try to stay out of each other 's way during the race . '
" It was a good conversation .
They 're both good guys .
It 's great to have an environment where we can sit down . "
Roush reiterated what he has said all along , that he did n't condone what Edwards did but understood why he did it .
" The ultimate responsibility that we all have -- that NASCAR has , the owners have and the drivers have -- is to keep everybody safe in this business , " he said .
" It 's a sport that needs to be contentious , but it needs to be safe too and we 've got to be careful to respect that line . "
Since the incident , NASCAR has ramped up its effort to find out why cars are going airborne .
Beginning at Texas all cars will carry a shark fin on the left rear window and deck lid to help break up the air when a spinout occurs at a high speed .
Edwards said the past week has been good for him to sit back and observe everything that has been written and said about the incident .
Some have portrayed him as a driver with anger issues , which he and others vehemently deny .
" It 's real easy to stand back and throw stones at someone and make little chirps and say things that make you feel better about yourself , " Edwards said .
" The people who know me know that I 'm a very fair person .
" I guess if my biggest fault is standing up for myself , I 'll take it .
They can fault me all day for that . "

The largest immigrant group in the United States is composed of people born in Mexico , according the Census 2000 .
This group is also growing rapidly .
And while Mexican immigrants are still settling in " traditional " destination states , such as California and Texas , over the last decade the foreign born from Mexico , like other immigrant groups , have begun moving to " non-traditional " settlement areas such as Georgia .
This Spotlight examines the size , growth , and geographic distribution of the foreign born from Mexico .

Close to 50 years of data show the Devon Island ice cap , one of the largest ice masses in the Canadian High Arctic , is thinning and shrinking .
A paper published in the March edition of Arctic , the journal of the University of Calgary 's Arctic Institute of North America , reports that between 1961 and 1985 , the ice cap grew in some years and shrank in others , resulting in an overall loss of mass .
But that changed 1985 when scientists began to see a steady decline in ice volume and area each year .
" We 've been seeing more mass loss since 1985 , " says Sarah Boon , lead author on the paper and a Geography Professor at the University of Lethbridge .
The reason for the change ?
Warmer summers .
The High Arctic is essentially a desert with low rates of annual precipitation .
There is little accumulation of snow in the winter and cool summers , with temperatures at or below freezing , serve to maintain levels .
Any increase of snow and ice takes years .
This delicate equilibrium is easily upset .
One warm summer can wipe out five years of growth .
And though the accelerated melting trend began in 1985 , the last decade has seen four years with unusually warm summers -- 2001 , 2005 , 2007 and 2008 .
" What we see during these warm summers is the extent of the melt is greater , " says Boon about the results of a five - year remote sensing study that ran between 2000 and 2004 .
The white surfaces of snow and ice reflect heat -- a process known as the albedo effect .
Retreating ice exposes dark soil and gravel , which absorb heat and increase the melt rate of ice along the periphery of the cap .
But it 's not only the edges of the cap that are losing ice .
At lower altitudes the ice is thinning as well .
Changes to the Devon ice cap , which covers approximately 14,400 sq. km , could have multiple impacts on everything from ship traffic to sea level .
There has already been an increase in the number of icebergs calving off from outlet glaciers that flow into the ocean .
Boon explains that melt water runs between the bottom of the glacier and the ground , creating a slippery cushion that allows the glacier to slide forward more rapidly than it would in colder conditions .
" There are a lot of things we need to consider .
One is the iceberg calving and its implications for shipping .
These things do n't just go away , they float out into the ocean , " says Boon .
A second area of concern is the contribution of increased glacier melt to rising sea level .
The work of Boon and her colleagues demonstrates the importance of long - term research .
Work on Devon Island began in 1961 with researchers from the Arctic Institute of North America , including long - time Arctic scientist Roy ' Fritz ' Koerner , who was part of the current study until his death in 2008 .
This ongoing research , which is continuing thanks to federal International Polar year funding , has created a comprehensive dataset that contributes to the understanding of the complex play between the ice cap , the atmosphere and the ocean .
" We all know long - term studies are important but they are really hard to pay for . "
Pink Floyd founding member Roger Waters is taking ' The Wall ' back on tour .
The former bassist in the psychedelic rock band has previously staged the band 's show - in which the album ' The Wall ' is performed in its entirety while a physical wall is built between the band and the audience - 31 times since it was recorded in 1979 , but is now about to embark upon a huge North American tour in support of the album 's 30th anniversary .
He told website Spinner : " 30 Years ago when I wrote ' The Wall ' I was a frightened young man .
" Well , not that young - I was 36 years old .
It took me a long time to get over my fears .
Anyway , in the intervening years it has occurred to me that maybe the story of my fear and loss with its concomitant inevitable residue of ridicule , shame and punishment , provides an allegory for broader concerns : Nationalism , racism , sexism , religion , whatever !
" All these issues and 'isms are driven by the same fears that drove my young life . "
The new production of ' The Wall ' - which includes the hits ' Another Brick in the Wall , Part II ' and ' Comfortably Numb ' - will be state of the art with a new production and backing band .
Waters also promised that despite being 30 years old , the show will still resonate with today 's audiences .
He said : " This new production of ' The Wall ' is an attempt to draw some comparisons , to illuminate our current predicament , and is dedicated to all the innocent lost in the intervening years . "
' The Wall ' was largely written by Waters and upon its release was accompanied by a film of the same name .
Pink Floyd toured the album in 1980 and 1981 but Waters left the group in 1984 .
He then staged a solo version of the show in Berlin , Germany in 1990 to commemorate the falling of the Berlin wall .
Water 's latest tour will take in dates across the US and Canada between September and December this year .

The first ever prime - ministerial debate will be remembered not - as so many predicted - for a gaffe or a scripted put - down or a bead of a sweat .
It will be remembered as a serious debate about serious issues and , I suspect , the first of many election debates to come .
Politically it is the emergence of Nick Clegg as a serious player in this election which will prove to be most significant .
The Liberal Democrat leader was given a great opportunity to introduce himself to the millions of voters who scarcely knew him and he took it with gusto .
The question is whether instant polls suggesting that he " won " the debate can be converted into increased support for his party .
If so , what matters is where will that support come from .
With a hung parliament a very real possibility , and with many voters saying that they like the idea of parties working together , the Lib Dems are certain to find themselves wooed , attacked and scrutinised with renewed vigour .
The dynamic between David Cameron and Gordon Brown , their personalities and their policies did not fundamentally change as a result of this debate , but there is now a third unpredictable factor at play with three weeks to go and two more debates .
Apple today is holding its iPhone OS 4.0 media preview event where it is expected to show off the next - generation operating system for its multi- touch portable devices and begin offering developers tools to build applications for the new operating system .
The event is scheduled to kick off at Apple 's Cupertino headquarters at 10:00 AM Pacific Time / 1:00 PM Eastern Time , or just about one hour from now .
Apple will not be providing live video or audio coverage of the event , and thus observers will have to rely primarily on text and photo updates coming out of the event .
Apple will likely post a video recording of the event later today for full analysis .

Interactive ads currently take you out of the app , but with iAd in the OS itself , you wo n't have to leave the app .
Users are more likely to click since there is no penalty . -
Apple will sell and host ads , giving developers industry - standard 60 % of revenue . - Demoing Toy Story 3 ad. Everything is done in HTML5 .

Original iPhone and 1st - generation iPod touch apparently left out .

End of presentation , with a short break before Q&A .
Q&A
- Q : How will multitasking affect AT&T network demands ?
A : Jobs says not sure that 's accurate ... background data usage will be minimal .
Data intensive tasks are things like video that require user attention .
- Q : Wireless app distribution is possible for all users ?
A : Jobs says no .
Forstall clarifies that it is enterprise - only , requiring signed certificates .
- Q : How will Game Center social network affect Ngmoco and OpenFeint ?
A : Forstall notes that developers have asked for a unified network , and that 's why Apple is providing it .
- Q : Will there be an ad approval process for iAd like the App Store ?
A : Jobs says that there will some boundaries , but hoping that nothing more than a " light touch " will be necessary .
- Q : Any changes to Apple 's stance on Flash / Java ?
A : Jobs says no .
- Q : Any development tools required for iAds ?
A : No , with HTML5 , they can use whatever tools they want .
- Q : No background APIs for things like monitoring Twitter in background ?
A : We think Twitter and related services work much better with push notifications .
- Q : Why no widgets on iPad ?
A : We just shipped it on Saturday , and we rested on Sunday .
Everything is possible .
- Further discussion of market for iAd and how users ' attention is n't occupied by apps on computers .
But on phone things are different .
Apple not looking to become worldwide ad agency .
Tried to buy AdMob but Google snatched it , so Apple bought Quattro , a smaller but great company .
We 're learning as fast as we can from them .
- Talking about iPhone OS 4.0 compatibility for older devices .
Earlier hardware just can't support some of the features like multitasking .
- Q : What are you doing to address distracted driving ?
A : Jobs says that they 've done more than most , with hands - free calling and integrated displays and controls for cars .
- Q : Any chance of running unsigned applications like on Android ?
A : Jobs says that because of that ability , there is a porn store for Android , and that 's not a place we want to go .
- Q : Any surprises on reactions to iPad ?
A : Jobs says they " still have butterflies " about it .
Reaction has been great ... a profound game changer .
Schiller is surprised by the quality of the applications coming out already .
Jobs says that competitors would be hoping for 3500 apps in the first year , and the iPad has that in a week .
Building on the base of 85 million existing iPhone OS users helps .
- Q : With so much in the App Store , how can developers get their apps discovered ?
A : Jobs says that the App Store is not part of iPhone OS , and so the server - side stuff can be enhanced constantly .
They 've added the Genius feature and a lot of third - party sites have sprung up to feature and recommend apps .
Game Center will also help the viral spread of apps .
And gifting .
- Q : Are you concerned that multitasking and other new features not compatible with older devices will alienate existing customers ?
Will it encourage them to upgrade ?
A : The growth curve for these products has been very steep , so most of the devices out there are the newer models .
The older models will get some great new feature , but will be missing some like multitasking .
If they upgrade because of that , fantastic .
- Q : How do you close apps when multitasking ?
A : You do n't have to .
Jobs says that if you see task manager , you blew it .
Users should n't have to think about it .
- End of Q&A
Grab it on the App Store .
The Japan Food Addict app is here !
The nanohana plant is entirely edible , and the plant it is also the source of healthy Canola oil .
Nanohana is a springtime flower , and in some areas of Japan you can find fields of the flower formed into mazes so visitors can wander through the blossoms and enjoy their beauty .
Nanohana bloom just before sakura here in Japan , so they are kind of a prelude to spring , even though they are beautiful in their own right .
Yield : 2 servings Time : 20 minutes Ingredients 4 oz nanohana ( not blooming )
1 cup dashi soup ( or 1 cup water with 1 tsp hon-dashi )
) 1 tbsp soy sauce Preparation Boil nanohana for 2 minutes then submerge in cold water Strain and blot with a paper towel to remove any excess water Chop nanohana into 2 ″ pieces

STROUDSBURG , Pa. --
Police say two East Stroudsburg University students helped stop a rape .
It happened early Tuesday morning in Stroudsburg , Monroe County .
Police say early Tuesday morning , a 22 - year - old woman was walking to her friend 's apartment when a man grabbed her and dragged her behind a dumpster .
Luckily two other women heard her cries for help .
The two friends then rushed outside ... to stop it .
" I remember pulling him and then pushing him on the ground ... like throwing him on the ground . "
The woman says he got up and started to run away ... she went after him ... while the other woman called 911 .
" I had no idea if he was armed or not .
I had no idea if he had a knife or anything . "
The man got away ... but the women were able to give police a description .
They say it was the same man who was making unwanted advances towards them earlier in the night .
" Just by judging the back of the man I knew it was the guy that was following us at the bar . "
" He made me feel really uncomfortable .
He made me feel really scared . "
I 've lost track of the number of times people have dismissed the seriousness of sexual harassment while claiming that women who have reported sexual harassment to the police or other authorities or who even make any claim of fear over sexual harassment are overreacting .
The most recent example of widespread dismissal came from the reaction to a Ball State University public safety notice after 3 female students reported being slapped by a man on a bicycle .
A Facebook fan page was created to mock this safety notice , but this mocking indicates deeper dismissive attitudes .
This dismissal is based on the premise that those who sexually harass women , including unwanted physical contact , are not a danger to women and are merely committing harmless affronts .
People who claim to support individual rights will declare that harassment or even groping are actions which should n't be banned by colleges sexual misconduct guidelines .
This premise , often marketed as fact , is undermined by a story about a recent stranger rape case case
This description of an attack matches what is often used to prove the contrast between the alleged non-dangerous sexual harassers and real rapists .
There 's just one problem .
This college student 's fear over being sexually harassed does n't seem so irrational when the same man is caught during an attempted stranger rape .
Yet again and again people who claim to be against all real sexual violence will dismiss reactions like hers as irrational unless this type of immediate connection can be made between those who are dismissed as harmless and those who are scorned as monsters .
The dismissal of sexual harassment most likely meant that these 2 women who intervened did n't feel they had a right to report this man when his actions and his manner caused the initial fear .
We as a society have no problem when people report a prowler who seems likely to be planning a property crime , but we do have a problem as a society when people report troubling or even illegal sexual behavior that could be described as sexual harassment .
If we are serious about preventing the sex crimes that nobody mocks then we all need to be serious about opposing the unwanted sexual behaviors which are now too often mocked .

For the second time in the past few months , conservative commentators see something sinister in an Obama administration logo .
Following a controversy in February over what some said was a “ Muslim crescent ” in the logo of the US Missile Defense Agency , some commentators are saying they see the same thing in the thin , white crescent that borders the logo of President Barack Obama ’s Nuclear Security Summit .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ That Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s weird Ã¢â‚ ¬Â¦ ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Nuclear Summit logo is an Islamic crest , ” writes Jim Hoft at Gateway Pundit .
The new talking point appears to have started with a New York Post column by Michael Goodwin published on Wednesday .
“ The crescent , often with a single or multiple stars , is the main symbol of Islam , ” Goodwin wrote .
“ So now there is something like it at an official presidential event , prominently displayed in photographs being beamed around the world . ”
Goodwin continued : “ No , I am not suggesting President Obama is a secret Muslim .
But I am certain the crescent - like design of the logo is not a coincidence , especially at an event where Iran ’s nuclear ambition and al Qaeda ’s search for a bomb are prime topics .
“ Obama has been open about his aim to improve America ’s relations with Muslims .
His bowing and apologies are nauseating , but they are consistent with his goal . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Naturally , Fox News jumped into the fray .
“ That ’s the same thing you see on the flags of Turkey , Algeria , Tunisia and Pakistan , ” Gretchen Carlson said on Fox & Friends Wednesday .
“ And what they do they have in common ?
They ’re all Muslim nations . ”
The claim that a crescent in a government logo proves an Obama agenda to court Muslim nations is nearly a word - for - word echo of February ’s controversy , when the Drudge Report ran images of the Missile Defense Agency ’s logo , claiming it resembled the flag of a Muslim nation .
“ The Obama administrationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s determined effort to reduce AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s missile defense capabilities initially seemed to be just standard Leftist fare , ” blogger Frank Gaffney wrote at BigGovernment , but the new agency logo “ suggests , however , that something even more nefarious is afoot . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
But in that case , the MDA logo ’s crescent faced the opposite direction of Muslim nations ’ flags , and resembled only the flag of the Nation of Islam .
And , as Matt Corley points out at ThinkProgress , an MDA spokesman called the claim “ ridiculous ” and said the logo had been in use at the agency prior to the 2008 election .

The following video was broadcast on Fox & Friends , Wednesday April 14 , 2010 , and uploaded to the Web by MediaMatters .
The latest food stamp data for January of 2010 shows that 39,430,724 Americans are receiving food stamps or are part of the supplemental nutritional assistance program ( SNAP ) .
If you make the acronym and name long enough and with a neutral undertone average Americans wo n’t fret that 40 million of their fellow neighbors are one government debit card away from being unable to eat .
Yet this is the new corporate funded recovery and somehow things do n’t seem to be improving for the middle class and definitely not for those at the lower rung of the socio-economic ladder .
In fact , we may have more than 40 million on food assistance today .
Since the start of the recession in December of 2007 , we ’ve added on average 474,000 people each month to SNAP .
Since the data lags a bit and we only have January 2010 data , it is likely we now have between 40 million and 41 million Americans on food assistance .
There is little to doubt where the trend is heading .
Even from 2000 , this number has been increasing showing that the supposed boom was nothing more than smoke and mirrors fueled by Wall Street debt :
Source : Food and Nutrition Service
You ’ll notice that starting in 2000 , the number of people on SNAP has gone up exponentially .
Last year the government provided $ 53 billion in food assistance ( compare this to $ 17 billion in 2000 , a tripling of cost in a decade ) .
Most of these Americans do not want to be on food assistance .
If anything , the above chart is a clear indicator of how the economy is feeling for millions outside of the Wall Street boom .
When we hear about thousands of people lining up at Wal - Mart just before midnight so they can enter and shop with their newly charged debit card , we know that something is amiss between Main Street and Wall Street .
Now some people would argue with the cost .
But $ 53 billion going to 40 million Americans makes more sense than giving a handout to Goldman Sachs just so they can increase their bonus pool .
Plus $ 53 billion is a drop in the bucket compared to the $ 13 trillion given to Wall Street .
You also have to remember that most of this money is being spent right back into the economy .
It is n’t like these folks are using the funds to pay for their Manhattan apartment or go purchase another yacht with the name of “ Big Spender . ”
On Wall Street all is well even though we are adding nearly a half million Americans each month to the food assistance program .
Apparently an economic recovery means a booming economy for everyone but the poor and middle class .
Since more and more Americans now use “ food stamps ” more stores are changing to adapt to this new economic reality :
“ ( Consumerist )
We ’re going to have to start offering tips for shopping with food stamps now that a record number of consumers — and stores — are using them .
EBT use has increased 20 % from last year and formerly reluctant retailers like Costco are getting in on the action .
The cards are so “ popular ” that some retailers are crediting them with their “ success ” in the current economy . ”
This is a large reason why stores like Wal - Mart have seen better performance during the recession .
You might not go to Circuit City ( now gone ) to buy a surround sound system but you ’ll definitely go shopping for food for your family .
I ’m not sure how we can say we are in a recovery with 40 million Americans on food assistance .
And of course , this is only the other end of the employment equation .
We have 16.9 percent of our population that is underemployed .
And many of the working poor are dealing with smaller paychecks but with higher taxes and fees thanks to crony banks and corrupt politicians :
“ ( Rolling Stone )
If you want to know what life in the Third World is like , just ask Lisa Pack , an administrative assistant who works in the roads and transportation department in Jefferson County , Alabama .
Pack got rudely introduced to life in post - crisis America last August , when word came down that she and 1,000 of her fellow public employees would have to take a little unpaid vacation for a while .
The county , it turned out , was more than $ 5 billion in debt — meaning that courthouses , jails and sheriff ’s precincts had to be closed so that Wall Street banks could be paid .
As public services in and around Birmingham were stripped to the bone , Pack struggled to support her family on a weekly unemployment check of $ 260 .
Nearly a fourth of that went to pay for her health insurance , which the county no longer covered .
She also fielded calls from laid - off co-workers who had it even tougher .
“ I ’d be on the phone sometimes until two in the morning , ” she says .
“ I had to talk more than one person out of suicide .
For some of the men supporting families , it was so hard — foreclosure , bankruptcy .
I ’d go to bed at night , and I ’d be in tears . ”
The recovery is invisible for the vast majority of Americans .
Most do n’t derive their income from the Wall Street casino but from actual work .
They get their money from actually working instead of selling toxic investment products to siphon off money from the productive economy .
If we look at personal income the rate of change has fallen for decades but only this recession put us into the negative realm :
Until average Americans are protected from the Wall Street gamblers , we can expect this Brazilian split in America .
We used to have three economic classes ; the poor , a large and healthy middle class , and a small elite .
Today , we are seeing the category of poor exploding while the middle class category shrinks and the wealthy remain the same but with more resources .
No wonder why this recovery is invisible to many .

2010 Cadillac SRX 2.8T : First Drive
The 2.8 - liter , turbocharged V6 in the 2010 Cadillac SRX 2.8T adds 35 HP and a whopping 72 Lb - Ft of … Read more
IT 'S nighttime and I 'm rather unnerved .
I 'm on the 101 halfway up some mountain outside Ventura , California in a 2010 Cadillac SRX Turbo that has just died in the narrow meridian .
Advertisement
I 'm barking at some nonplussed 9 - 1 - 1 dispatcher on the cell , OnStar 's on hold , and I 'm ready to jump the jersey barrier if some dazed motorist drifts my way .
They all seem to brush by at light 's speed .
This broken press car is one of Cadillac 's latest midsize crossovers – a plush , Lexus RX fighter – that had just lapped its two thousandth mile before the car 's engine bought the farm .

In no time at all I had dropped from a comfy 65 mph cruise into a sputtering stop with black smoke billowing from beneath the silver hood and a long oily trail in my wake .
And now I 'm awaiting rescue .
Minutes tick by endlessly .
But the state police do arrive .
The officer spies my precarious position and proceeds to snake his patrol car back and forth across the freeway - side - winder style .
Advertisement
Only then , does traffic slow to a grudging halt .
" If you can start your car , move it across to the right side . "
The officer coolly broadcasts over the loudspeaker .
Advertisement
Now , all of Ventura seems to be waiting behind him .
The cars are like greyhounds at the gate and I feel like the rabbit as – rattled and frozen – I climb behind the Caddy 's helm and press the start button .
Thunk - Thunk - Thunk - Thunk - Thunk - Thunk goes the mortally wounded motor .
Into drive .
We 're on borrowed seconds !
The SRX c - r - a - w - l -s across the freeway to the far side .
The go pedal 's level with the carpet .
Advertisement
I reach the right side and the Caddy quits .
Traffic resumes its F1 pace , a discussion with the officer ensues , and ten minutes later the tow truck shows .
Advertisement
The driver shakes his head and says that only days prior some poor guy had similar trouble with his bike .
When he tried crossing to the breakdown lane he got hit in roughly the same spot where I 'd landed .
He died .
So , what caused this fresh new Caddy to breakdown ?
The answer arrived yesterday afternoon in a conference call with GM .
Their findings are triggering a model - wide update to go into effect directly .

DAMAGE REPORT
On the phone is Tom Sutter .
Mr. Sutter is GM 's chief engineer for the automaker 's V6 engines .
Also on the line is David Caldwell , Cadillac 's press manager .
Advertisement
Mr. Sutter leads headlong into a thorough explanation of the wheels that were set in motion following the incident .
" We took this very seriously , " he says .
His tone is direct and earnest .
" As soon as it happened , we expedited the vehicle 's shipment back to our test center in Warren , Michigan .
We 've been at this 24 hours a day , 7 days a week . "
Advertisement
He and his team " tore down " the motor , analyzed the car 's black box data , and sent a fuel sample to a third party lab for analysis .
Additional tests on a dyno replicated the failure , but they 've yet to duplicate the incident in real life testing .
The SRX Turbo uses a 2.8 liter , 300 hp V6 .
This same engine has served for five years in Saabs including the upcoming 9 - 4X .
The engine also powers Germany 's Opel Insignia .

THE BREAKDOWN
Mr. Sutter is describing my incident as a " Mega knock event . "
" We have a high degree of confidence that we 've sourced the problem , " he tells me , getting down into the gory details .
Advertisement
What happened is as follows and was , apparently , a fluke :
The V6 in the Cadillac requires a minimum 91 Octane .
Lab tests had shown that the SRX was running on regular which meant that yours had inadvertently fed the car 88 Octane gas and not the factory mandated premium .
Advertisement
At some point during travel , between 2000 - 2500 rpm – or normal highway cruising speed – the engine 's management system had adjusted the air fuel mixture to work too lean causing a retarded spark – but crucially – it allowed for a simultaneous turbo boost which led to a catastrophic pressure build up in the cylinder chambers .
This caused cylinder six to fail quickly - leaving yours stranded .
Mr. Sutter 's team concluded that the resulting pressure in the chamber was four times greater than the stress during full throttle acceleration .
Advertisement
" We 've been working on a new calibration which should be implemented in coming days , " he says , indicating that this will ensure proper engine management going forward during what we might describe as " lean times " during the fuel consumption of a given SRX Turbo .
Mr. Caldwell stresses that what happened was an extremely rare event and that they 've had only a couple of incidents that resemble what happened to me in California .
Advertisement
He suggests that the low Octane gas could be considered a contributing factor and not the primary cause of the engine 's failure .
But not everyone is careful with their choice of gas ( as evidenced by this writer ) and high Octane gas is n't always available in some rural areas .
Surely the car must be engineered to compensate ?
Both acknowledge this aspect and say that the SRX's management system should have adjusted to accommodate for the lesser grade petrol and their system fix will ensure that it does going forward .
Advertisement
Nevertheless , Mr. Sutter maintains that the low Octane gas was the primary trigger in my car 's failure .
" Ever since we 've switched to low displacement , turbocharged engines , we 've noticed a sensitivity [ to Octane levels ] . "
Advertisement
The 2.8 liter , turbocharged V6 was created at GM's Pontiac , Michigan center in tandem with Saab staff in Sweden who engineered the turbo .
While most Saabs require only regular unleaded , the Cadillac SRX Turbo's V6 represents the highest output version of this particular powerplant , hence the requirement for higher grade fuel .
Advertisement
NEXT STEPS
As this article posts , GM is conducting field tests on six SRX Turbos in Death Valley to ensure that the recalibration they 've devised will prevent a repeat of the failure when the vehicle runs on regular unleaded .
Advertisement
Once finalized , Cadillac will implement the engine management adjustments to the SRX assembly line so that new SRX Turbo units rolling off the line going forward will benefit from the update .
Current SRX
Turbo customers will receive the update at their Cadillac dealer during service , though the company has not yet decided how it will inform customers on the need to getting their car updated .
Advertisement
We should receive word on their customer plan within the week .
Also , GM will provide Automobiles De Luxe with another press car to complete our review .
Expect our full take on the 2010 Cadillac SRX Turbo next month .
Here 's hoping for a smoother road test .

NEW DELHI — A man hospitalized for radiation exposure died Monday night from multiple organ failure , the first fatality stemming from a major case of radiation exposure earlier this month that forced authorities to temporarily cordon off an industrial area near the heart of the national capital .
The man , who used only a single name , Rajender , died in the intensive care unit of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences after blood transfusions and other treatments failed to reverse his deteriorating condition .
A hospital supervisor said the patient suffered from pneumonia , liver and kidney failure and other related problems .
Rajender , 35 , was one of seven people hospitalized after being exposed to radioactive materials at scrap metal shops in an industrial area known as Mayapuri , located barely 10 miles from India ’s Parliament .
Indian officials believe the source of the radiation was a piece or pieces of outdated medical equipment hidden in a shipment of scrap metal imported from overseas .

Alice 's very weird wonderland :
Why a behind - the - scenes row might see Tim Burton 's most fantastical film yet disappear from cinemas as fast as the Cheshire Cat
The word is that watching Tim Burton 's Alice In Wonderland is the closest you can come to falling down the rabbit hole yourself and into Lewis Carroll 's fantasy world .
Those who have seen the film , or clips of it , say that it is utterly breathtaking , a hallucinatory alternate universe completely realised in every detail , from the sun streaming in through the gills of the mushrooms to the light falling on the individual fuzzy hairs on the caterpillar 's back .
It cost £ 158 million to make and , with computer graphics mixed with live action and animation , it is more technically ambitious than anything Burton has done before .
And it is in 3 - D , putting it head - to - head with the sci - fi phenomenon that is Avatar .
Scroll down to watch the trailer ...
Fantasy : Alice
In Wonderland is said to be Burton 's most beautiful and most perfectly imagined world yet
But far more significantly , it is said to be simply Burton 's most beautiful and most perfectly imagined fantasy world .
The casting also has critical expectations rising .
Who else but Matt Lucas could play the twin grotesques of Tweedledum and Tweedledee ?
And Johnny Depp , with green fluorescent contact lenses , rouged cheeks and a frizzy orange wig , makes the most extraordinary Mad Hatter .
With typical attention to detail , Burton has enhanced Depp 's eyes with camera trickery , making them 15 per cent larger ; so it 's still Johnny Depp , but Through The Looking - Glass .
Oscar - winning costume designer Colleen Atwood has created a look for Depp which sees his clothes change colour as his moods come and go .
He is like a human mood ring , hung with ribbons and hatpins and thimbles which dangle from his fingertips .
The Cheshire Cat , who can appear and disappear at will and has what Burton calls a creepy quality , is voiced by Stephen Fry and taps into Burton 's hatred of cats .
Michael Sheen voices the White Rabbit , Alan Rickman is the caterpillar and Barbara Windsor the dormouse , Christopher Lee surfaces as the monstrous Jabberwock , Timothy Spall is a lugubrious bloodhound , Frances de la Tour is Alice 's Aunt Imogene , Michael Gough the Dodo and Paul Whitehouse the March Hare .
Forget special effects , as one of the few live action characters , Mia Wasikowska - who plays Alice in Tim Burton 's new movie - had to stand on a box to appear taller
Tim Burton says the Red Queen - played by wife Helena Bonham Carter - reminds him of the infamous New York property millionaire Leona Hemsley , known as the ' queen of mean ' , who , ironically , was a hatter 's daughter
Burton 's partner , Helena Bonham Carter , plays the Queen of Hearts as the acme of royal rage , with a plucked hairline , red wig , geisha - white face and uncontrollable ' Off with her head ! ' aggression .
On screen , her head has been enlarged to three times its size and the end result is quite grotesque .
' I can't rely on Tim to make me pretty , ' sighs Helena .
Alice
In Wonderland - created in the 1860s by Charles Dodgson , a mathematics lecturer at Christ Church , Oxford , under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll - is surely the literary masterpiece which Burton was born to interpret .
He has even worked in the studio once used by the English illustrator Arthur Rackham , whose illustrations for the 1907 edition ' produced the most iconic pictures of Alice that anyone has ever seen ' .
' I read the Alice stories when I was eight , and I 've seen the various TV and cinema versions , including the 1951 Disney cartoon .
But , to be honest , I 've never liked any of them , ' Burton says .
' There was always a silly girl wandering around from one crazy character to another , and I never felt a real emotional connection to that , so it was an attempt to try and give it some framework and emotional grounding that I felt I had n't seen in any version before .
White Queen : Anne Hathaway says : ' I wanted her to have the punk spirit of Debbie Harry , the etherealness of American artists Dan Flavin and the grace of Greta Garbo . '
The Mad Hatter : Before filming , Johnny Depp painted pictures of his character , which later proved almost identical to Tim Burton 's vision
' I think all of those characters serve to indicate some type of mental weirdness that everybody goes through . '
Burton says he wanted an Alice ' with gravity ' rather than the usual little girl skipping through the grass in her white socks and a blue pinafore dress .
Eventually , he settled on Mia Wasikowska , a young Australian actress .
' She had that emotional toughness ; standing her ground in a way which makes her kind of an older person but with a younger person 's mentality , ' the director says .
Having previously portrayed the equally weird and wonderful Edward Scissorhands and Willy Wonka for Burton , Johnny Depp was a shoo - in for the Mad Hatter .
' I read the Lewis Carroll stories over and over again , and I learned everything I could about Victorian times , ' Depp says .
' It would have been too easy , and not very believable , to have played the Mad Hatter as just a straightforward crazy guy .
New chapter : Tim Burton says he is n't trying to tell the old story in the film which will ' infuriate the purists '
' But I knew Tim would be wanting more than that - there had to be a reason why he was like that , because something had tipped him over the edge . '
Depp 's research revealed that the term ' mad as a hatter ' came from a truth - that hatters in Victorian times suffered from mercury poisoning , a side - effect of the hat - manufacturing process which would affect the mind .
' So now we knew why he 's mad , and after that , anything went , ' Depp says .
' The mercury would have also shown through his skin and his hair , so the Hatter would have looked as mad as he behaved . '
For screenwriter Linda Woolverton ( The Lion King , Beauty And The Beast ) , the positive early reaction has been a vindication of her vision .
' I was n't trying to re-tell the old story ; I was toying with the thought : what if Alice was older and she went back into Wonderland ?
Alice
In Wonderland - created in the 1860s by Charles Dodgson , a mathematics lecturer at Christ Church , Oxford , under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll - is surely the literary masterpiece Burton was born to interpret
Double - trouble : Matt Lucas plays the twin grotesques of Tweedledum and Tweedledee .
Tim Burton 's inspiration for them came from the creepy twins in the Stanley Kubrick horror film The Shining
' I had this mental picture of her standing at a very crucial moment in her life and having to make an important decision , but being distracted by the White Rabbit . '
In the film , Alice 's turning point comes as she receives an unexpected and unwelcome very public marriage proposal in a Victorian garden .
Seeing the White Rabbit - with his trademark waistcoat and watch , of course - she runs after him , stumbles and falls down a hole into Wonderland , which is in decline , overgrown and rather haunted .
She is taken to the hookah - smoking caterpillar , who tells her that according to ancient prophecy , she has returned to slay the Red Queen 's dreaded Jabberwock and bring about the end of her reign .
' There 's a lot that Lewis Carroll did n't write , but I 've based other scenes on things he did ' , Woolverton says .
' It will infuriate the purists , but this was never meant to be a remake .
This is Alice as a young woman . '
Breathtaking :
The film shows Alice as a young woman .
And , right , the Red Queen 's head has been enlarged to three times the size .
' I can't rely on Tim to make me look pretty , ' actress Helena says
But despite all this nurturing of Burton 's vision , his movie is under threat of being smothered at birth .
Quite extraordinarily , the UK's three largest cinema chains - Odeon , Vue and Cineworld - are threatening not to show it .
They account for 65 per cent of the UK 's cinemas , and 90 per cent of the 3 - D screens , so the threat is a serious one .
Given that the premiere is next Thursday and the movie opens on March 5 , it 's a disaster .
The cause of the angst is that Disney wants to release the film on DVD and Blu-ray only three months after it opens at the cinema , rather than the standard 17 weeks .
It wants to get the DVD into the shops before the midsummer doldrums , and to capitalise on the marketing of the movie while it is still fresh in people 's minds .
But the cinemas are afraid that people will just wait to buy the film on DVD rather than spend money on going to the pictures .
They are n't alone : four big cinema chains in Holland are boycotting the film and the Italians are rebelling , too .
White Rabbit : Animators visited a shelter for abandoned rabbits to observe their characteristics
Disney , which stands to lose upwards of £ 40 million because of this row , says that 97 per cent of box office takings happen within eight weeks , and argues that it is only asking for this flexibility in the case of perhaps two movies a year .
Last week the company sent two executives from Hollywood to try to find a solution .
Burton himself transferred filming from Cornwall , where a lot of exterior scenes were shot , to Los Angeles , where the technology would be brought into play .
Scenes were filmed in front of all - green backgrounds which were then overlaid digitally .
' The novelty of the green wears off very quickly , ' Depp complained during filming .
' It 's exhausting actually - we can't see what we are doing . '
Burton had lavender lenses fitted into his glasses to counter - balance the colour .
This way of working brought the director great freedoms , particularly when it came to playing with scale .
Glover 's Knave Of Hearts is half real , half digital .
In the film he is 71/2ft tall , so on set Glover wore a green suit and a pair of green stilts .
For the final film , his entire body , costume and cape were computer - generated - only his face was real .
The Cheshire cat , which can appear and disappear at will , is voiced by Stephen Fry
Special effects : £ 158 million was spent making the new Alice In Wonderland film
Depp is lost in admiration for Burton .
He says : ' He could n't have bitten off anything bigger to chew .
This is almost lunatic time .
To choose to grab Alice In Wonderland , that in itself is one thing , and then to do it to the Tim Burton level is madness . '
Burton , stuck between a rock and a hard place over the distribution row , is keeping his own counsel .
But there is no doubt he will be deeply disappointed if the film over which he has taken such care is available to only a fraction of its potential audience .
As he says : ' When Lewis Carroll wrote his Alice stories nearly 150 years ago , he was taking a big chance that people would understand and appreciate that he was trying to do something unusual .
' Now , it 's our turn to take our own chances - and I do n't think we 've let him down . '
• Alice In Wonderland has its charity premiere in London next Thursday and is released on March 5 .

The uTorrent team released the long - awaited version 2.0 of their popular application last month .
The overall reception has been very positive , but critics have labeled the new release as unfair , which has resulted in the client being banned from several private BitTorrent trackers .
One of the most significant changes in the new uTorrent is uTP , the ‘ micro transfer protocol ’ .
UTP is a new and improved implementation of the BitTorrent protocol which is designed to be more network - friendly than its predecessor .
With uTP , uTorrent has become more network aware as it will throttle itself if congestion is detected in the network .
The uTorrent teams hopes this improvement will eliminate the need for ISPs to throttle BitTorrent traffic , while its users should see less interference with other local applications .
The effectiveness of uTP is still being debated , but some people in the BitTorrent community have noticed another issue .
According to some owners of private BitTorrent trackers , uTorrent is no longer playing fair .
Since uTorrent users are the only ones using the new protocol , uTorrent favors its own kind over other clients .
This means that when connecting to other clients , uTorrent users will give preference to other uTorrent users , behavior that some have characterized as unfair .
As a result , several private BitTorrent trackers have refused to put the newer uTorrent releases on their whitelists , effectively banning the client and forcing their users to stick with the older versions .
Simon Morris , BitTorrent ’s VP of Product Management admits that the tracker owners have a point , but says that it is very hard to innovate without having to face such technical downsides .
“ This is part of the challenge of innovation … but hopefully a challenge we ’ll overcome , ” Morris told TorrentFreak .
“ We ’re well aware of these discussions and have been very receptive to the feedback we have received .
uTP is being constantly tuned and like any advanced technology on the internet there are edge cases where there ’s room for improvement , ” Morris adds .
BitTorrent Inc. has opened up the specifications of the uTP protocol and hosted a conference in their San Fransisco offices a few weeks ago to discuss uTP in detail with developers of some of the most popular Bittorrent clients .
According to Morris , other popular client developers have shown interest in implementing uTP into their own applications .
Widespread support for the new protocol would of course be the easiest way to get rid of the unfairness allegations , but uTorrent ’s major competitor Vuze has no plans to support uTP in the short term .
On the other hand , Vuze does n’t believe the unfairness will result in a noticeable disadvantage for its users .
“ In terms of speed , we do not buy - in to the ‘ threat ’ cited by some , claiming that uTP can result in slower downloads for non-uTP clients due to uTP clients favoring each other during the torrent cold start phase , ” Olivier Chalouhi , CTO told TorrentFreak .
Vuze is keeping a close eye on how uTP evolves and will consider adding it to their own client as the technology matures .
For now Vuze will continue to work on their own congestion solutions and speed improvements .
They have already added UDP transfer support , but not as the primary protocol .
“ Vuze added support for UDP transport a few years ago , as a fallback for when TCP connection attempts fail .
To date , Vuze chose not to implement UDP as a first - class protocol , as we consciously wanted to avoid claims of a Vuze - specific protocol bias , which we do not believe serves the BitTorrent community at large , ” Chalouhi said .
Whether uTorrent ’s choice to push uTP forward results in any significant disadvantages for users of other clients is still open for debate .
BitTorrent Inc. is , however , committed to play fair and will make the necessary adjustments where needed .
Thus far , only a few private trackers have decided to ban uTorrent and there are currently no signs that it will spread out to more .

Ex -Giants superstar Tiki Barber has dumped his 8 - months - pregnant wife , Ginny , for sexy former NBC intern Traci Lynn Johnson , sources told The Post last night .
The football star - turned - “ Today ” show - correspondent left his wife of 11 years , Ginny , for the 23 - year - old blonde , who also worked at 30 Rock , the sources said .
Ginny , who is expecting twins , found out about the relationship late last year , after the run-around running back moved out of their Upper East Side home .
Johnson , a model - thin bombshell , was photographed sitting next to Tiki last month at a Washington , DC , screening of a documentary on Senegal that he hosted for the Travel Channel .
Sources believe Johnson also accompanied Tiki to Senegal for the filming late last year , when Ginny was three months pregnant .
The affair is particularly stunning in light of Barber ’s long - standing disdain for his philandering father .
“ I do n’t give a [ bleep ] that the relationship did n’t work , ” he said of his parents ’ split in a 2004 Post interview .
“ Not only did he abandon her , I felt like he abandoned us for a lot of our lives .
I have a hard time forgiving that . ”
Barber ’s confidants were shocked .
“ He was always the nice guy with a million - dollar smile , ” a Barber family friend told The Post .
“ We were shocked to find out that he could walk out on his wife of 11 years while she ’s pregnant with twins .
He was with this girl in Senegal while Ginny was three months pregnant .
“ And we believe she was also with him in Vancouver while he was blogging about the Winter Olympics for Yahoo.com . ”
Barber , who is believed to have to have relocated to an Upper West Side bachelor paid , released a statement yesterday in response to a Page Six item announcing the split .
“ After 11 years of marriage , Ginny and I have decided to separate , ” Barber said .
“ This decision was a painful one , but we are moving forward amicably and will continue to work together to raise our children with the love and dedication they have always known . ”
A Tiki Barber spokesman declined to comment .
Ginny is a former fashion publicist and full - time mom to the couple ’s two sons , A.J. , 7 , and Chason , 6 .
She , too , declined to comment .
But she ’s been known to tout her caretaking role for Tiki .
“ I ’m sort of a traditionalist where I do n’t mind taking care of him , ” she said in a 2006 interview .
Johnson can be seen posing with a smiling gal pal in a pic on her MySpace page .
The two are wearing red short shorts and Giants jerseys emblazoned with Barber ’s No. 21 .
Tiki and Ginny began dating 16 years ago when both were students at the University of Virginia .
Barber , who turns 35 today , was hired by NBC just after he retired in 2007 — when sources say he first met Johnson , who was working there as an intern .
In his 10 - year NFL career , Barber set nearly every career offensive record for the Giants , and made three Pro Bowls .
His end run on Ginny with the much younger Johnson runs counter to the all - American Barber persona that fans and TV viewers know .
During Giants games ,
Tiki used to blow a kiss to Ginny in the stands every time he scored .
In his 2007 memoir , “ Tiki : My Life in the Game and Beyond , ” Barber described the example he wanted to set for his kids .
“ I want to be an honorable man , because that ’s what I want them both to be , ” he wrote , noting , “ My family is everything to me . ”

As a designer , you will eventually have to face a couple of unfortunate truths in your career .
Number one : just because you wear a bathrobe for most of your “ business ” hours does not actually make it business attire .
Number two : at some point in your freelance career , you will encounter a client who does not respect the work you do .
The most unfortunate part of this unfortunate truth is that it will all too often present itself in the form of a client who refuses to pay for your services once all of the work has been completed .
As a designer , you will eventually have to face a couple of unfortunate truths in your career .
Number one : just because you wear a bathrobe for most of your “ business ” hours does not actually make it business attire .
Number two : at some point in your freelance career , you will encounter a client who does not respect the work you do .
The most unfortunate part of this unfortunate truth is that it will all too often present itself in the form of a client who refuses to pay for your services once all of the work has been completed .
However , you can put some safeguards in place to guarantee that if this kind of client disrespects you and a dispute arises , that you are not left without any leverage to help you resolve the situation .
Because whether they admit it , some loathsome characters deal with freelancers merely because they believe these smaller independent businesses would have little recourse should they not hold up their end of the bargain .
They think that once we have taken the time to complete the work and deliver it , that they have all the power to control the outcome of the business transaction .
But now more than ever , this is not the case .
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
One thing these clients overlook is the community that freelancers have at their disposal via the Web and various blogs and social media outlets .
Freelancers have an established network of support and guidance through such connectivity that it almost feels effortless at times .
And we have been turning to the community for years now to improve the working environment of designers , by discussing methods and techniques of dealing with common issues that arise in the field .
This network has spawned some inspiring ideas for addressing these client - related problems .
In fact , we here at Smashing Media turned to our friends on Twitter for some ideas on dealing with this particular issue , and we want to thank everyone who replied with so many great suggestions .
Through the volume of answers we received , a staggering fact became quite clear : that too many people have been burned by this type of business interaction , which only reinforces the necessity of a post such as this .
So , armed with stories of clients who were not willing to pay for completed work and who were determined to leave freelancers reeling and damaged , we have compiled some helpful safeguards and talking points to help you steer these situations towards a more positive outcome for you .
First Things First
The main thing to remember if you find yourself in this position is that you are in the right , and you do not have to stand for being bullied by a client simply because they are a client .
You have the right to be compensated for the time and effort that you put into the project .
Even with no physical contract , the client knowingly entered into a verbal agreement and is therefore completely liable for upholding the terms of the agreement .
Sometimes — not always — you may find that the client has challenged the payment only to see if they can get away with it ; and once you stand up to them and demonstrate that you will not be undercut , then they go ahead and pay .
But this will not always be the case , and your situation may be cumbersome .
So , be sure to remain civil , consistent , confident and above all resilient to make it through this tiring ordeal .
By doing this and employing one or more of the strategies suggested below , you might not only keep your business comfortably afloat but also retain a bit more of your sanity .
Use A Contract
One standard safeguard is a comprehensive project contract .
This sets up a payment structure that usually prevents an unfavorable outcome , or at least prevents the client from withholding full payment for whatever reason .
Use the language and structures that most contracts follow .
Most contracts call for a deposit at the beginning , and partial payment at various stages of the project .
But this is not always preferred by the client , or even occasionally by the freelancer .
Pros
A contract is a clear and simple way to outline the specifics and expectations of a project for all parties involved .
It includes a timeline for completion and delivery , as well as other checkpoints .
The payment structure in the contract can ensure that you at least get paid something for your time and effort .
It also provides you with some measure of legal recourse in the event of a breach of contract , such as non-payment of the final invoice .
A contract also projects an air of professionalism and sets you up to be taken seriously .
Cons
While the payment structure in a contract can be a pro , it can also be a con , turning off many clients who are not comfortable paying a deposit .
Clients might also be turned off by contracts because they do n’t know what they want or how to describe it , and they feel a contract would lock them in too tightly and not give them enough room to revise later .
Another con is that if you are unclear in the language of the contract , you might actually leave yourself open to be taken advantage of , and by the time you realize it , you are contractually obligated to complete the project .
Overall
Long story short , with both pros and cons a plenty , the contract route can safeguard against clients not paying you in part and , in some cases , in full .
But it could also keep you from getting clients , so use with caution .
CSS Kill Switch
Another route that some freelance Web developers opt for when they design websites for clients is to install a kind of CSS fail - safe , in order to have leverage if payment disputes come up .
CSS Killswitch is a freelance coder ’s dream come true .
By simply linking to an external CSS style sheet , which can be activated with the simple click of a button , you can black out a website if the client refuses to pay — even if they have changed the password and locked you out of the back end , which is the only circumstance under which this should be done .
Pros
While it should be used only with the strictest caution and as a last resort , the kill switch has two major pros .
The first is that it gives the freelancer leverage , putting them in a position that they have not traditionally had access to .
This leverage could give the freelancer the upper hand and might get them paid in the end , as the client scrambles to make their website visible again .
Another pro is the ease of use and installation of the CSS kill switch , relative to some of the other solutions explored in this article .
Cons
Naturally , if and when you exercise this option , know that it wo n’t be a popular move with your already difficult and possibly volatile client .
Your results may vary , and it could further postpone final payment .
Another con is that all of these Web safeguards like the CSS kill switch , while easy to use , are also easy to detect and disable if the client ’s staff is knowledgeable enough .
And while you are merely taking steps to get paid for the work you have done , initiating a kill switch on a client ’s website could make things costly and litigious for you very quickly .
Overall
When all is said and done , the CSS kill switch definitely has its upside , even if it does reside in an ethically questionable gray area .
It offers the freelancer an effective tool to negotiate with difficult clients on more level ground .
But use it at your own risk .
Maintenance Mode
One workaround to temporarily “ disabling ” the website until payment is made — though not always as effective as the kill switch — is maintenance mode .
Switching the website to maintenance mode gives the freelancer a bit of leverage with stubborn clients .
While similar to the kill switch , maintenance mode is a milder course of action .
Pros
One pro is that maintenance mode is even simpler to install and activate than a kill switch .
You need access to the website itself in order to pull it off ; and if you do still have access , you are likely dealing with a client who does not have much background in the Web .
And so they may not be aware that you are actually able to pull their website down once it is up .
This gentle flexing of muscle may be all the push - back you need to let them know that you are no push - over .
Cons
Once again , this route could incite an already agitated client to take drastic action against you , even though they are the one who violated the terms of the agreement .
Also , if the client figures out how to get the website back and changes the password to lock you out , then you have lost your leverage .
Unfortunately , this tactic is much easier to fix than a kill switch , so your advantage may not last long .
Overall
While this may work with some less experienced or resourceful clients , others will not be put off for long and will get things back on track with a quick Google search .
Withhold Launch
If you pick up on signs early on that your client may be difficult , one surefire way to keep them from withholding payment is to do a little withholding of your own .
You always have the power to withhold the launch of the website until final or full payment is made .
But you cannot just decide to do this at any point in the project ; you would need to establish these terms at the beginning of the working relationship .
Image source
Pros
An obvious pro is that this tactic is more likely than others to preempt a client dispute .
If the client knows up front that the product will not be fully delivered until they have made all payments , then they are less likely to attempt avoiding payment .
It puts most of the power in your end and allows you to basically steer the project ’s outcome .
Cons
Just as a contract can be a deterrent for some clients , stipulating that you will withhold delivery until payment is made can have a similiar effect .
Some clients will not be entirely comfortable with the idea of paying for something that is not in their possession , especially if they are already operating outside of their element .
Overall
As far as your options go , this is one of the most effective .
By simply refusing to deliver the product to the client , you maintain the upper hand .
Send A Project Summary
One of the more diplomatic ways to handle a dispute is simply to send the client a complete project summary detailing the timelines and benchmarks that were established at the beginning .
Be sure to highlight in the summary just how you met or exceeded these expectations , and provide any reasons why certain deadlines may not have been met .
Being extremely professional , this tactic shows respect for your client , rising above the emotion of the moment to drive your point home .
Let them know how you have met your end of the agreement , and they should respectfully do the same .
Pros
As mentioned , this is a very business - like way to address the situation , even if the circumstances warrant a more aggressive response .
It could be a big boon to your freelance business .
Another pro is that you show the client how calm and collected you are in the face of disrespect , and this composure will do wonders for your reputation .
Cons
If you are dealing with a client who is already refusing to pay for completed work , chances are that this respectful reporting of facts will not move them to respond in kind .
If that is the case , then this is a double disadvantage , given the time that would be required to put this document together .
Another con is the time you would reasonably have to wait to see whether this has had the desired effect on the client , before you follow up or take other steps .
Overall
After all is said and done , and if time is not critical , this is one of the most professional approaches you can take .
It is also a very business - like way to start before trying more drastic measures .
Get Their Attention With Social Media
This approach is not as diplomatic as the last : that is , taking your gripe to social media to alert the client and others that this situation is unresolved and far from over .
Members of the community at large may want to hear about projects that have ended unfavorably for freelancers , so that they can avoid working with those clients in future .
Turn to Twitter , Facebook and other networks to share your tale .
Pros
One advantage to this approach is that it will likely elicit some kind of reaction from the client , whether positive or negative , especially if they have a competent social media staff .
Another pro is its accessibility to the freelancer .
Most of us already populate social media outlets , so this route to a resolution lies at our fingertips .
Cons
This course of action could have some unwanted repercussions , one of which is not so much the client ’s reaction as the reaction of potential future clients who are turned off by your open griping about others .
Also , those who follow you on social networks might believe that you are being unprofessional by airing your grievances this way .
Did we mention that it could reflect poorly on your business ?
Because it well might .
So again , use caution when going social .
Overall
While social media has given us an outlet with a long reach and has proven effective in getting responses from businesses that are plugged in , it is not always the best or most professional forum in which to address your problem .
But that may not be a concern for you .
Wrap -Up
Assess your client ’s temperament before deciding on a path to pursue in recovering payment .
Whatever the situation , you have options beyond costly legal action .

Perfect Rigor : A Genius and the Mathematical Breakthrough of the Century by Masha Gessen Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , 242 pp. , $ 26.00
Masha Gessen ’s Perfect Rigor is a fascinating biography of Grigory ( Grisha ) Perelman , the fearsomely brilliant and notoriously antisocial Russian mathematician .
Perelman proved the Poincaré Conjecture , one of mathematics ’ most important and intractable problems , in 2002 — almost a century after it was first posed , and just two years after the Clay Mathematics Institute offered a one - million - dollar prize for its solution .
Gessen herself grew up in the former Soviet Union , is roughly Perelman ’s age , and has a mathematical background , which facilitated her interviews with many of his classmates , mentors , teachers , and colleagues .
Not surprisingly , she did not interview the reclusive mathematician or his mother , with whom he currently lives .
But the others give a convincing picture not only of him but also of the strange world of Soviet mathematics , which was divided between the official , rigid mathematical establishment and the informal mathematical counterculture .
The former , because of its historical importance to engineering and military projects , was supported by the Party and the government ; the latter consisted of scholars who loved mathematics for its own sake and used it as a way to escape the stultifying influence of officious apparatchiks .
Born in 1966 to Jewish parents , Perelman came of age when this distinction was breaking down during the era of glasnost and perestroika .
By the time he was ten he began to show a talent for mathematics , and his mother , who had abandoned her own graduate work in the field in order to raise him , enrolled him in an after - school math club coached by Sergei Rukshin , a mathematics undergraduate at Leningrad University .
Rukshin was a troubled youth who became obsessed with mathematics and gradually developed a rigorous , distinctive , and very effective method of teaching problem - solving .
Over the last twenty years , approximately half of all Russian entrants to the International Mathematical Olympiad have studied with him .
Only nineteen himself when he met Perelman , Rukshin stayed in contact with him from his first after - school math club until , it seems , a relatively recent break .
He found that the not yet adolescent Perelman , described by Gessen as “ an ugly duckling among ugly ducklings … pudgy and awkward , ” was already unusually deliberate and precise in his thinking .
Alexander Golovanov , who studied math alongside Perelman , said that Rukshin ’s growing commitment to and love for Perelman came to give meaning to his own life .
Like many a competitive sports coach , Rukshin hated it when his charges engaged in anything other than his sport .
This was an unnecessary restriction in Perelman ’s case since from the beginning he seemed uninterested in girls or anything other than mathematics .
When Perelman was fourteen , Rukshin spent the summer tutoring him in English ; he accomplished in a few months what generally took …
War is a long series of battles that seem to inch one or the other side ahead – but from time to time , a battle ensues which completely changes its course .
This list looks at ten battles through history that have done just that – given the upper hand to the , apparently , losing side .
10 The Battle of Stirling Bridge
If you know only what you saw in the film “ Braveheart , ” you ’re still unfamiliar with what truly happened at Stirling Bridge .
The battle took place on September 11 , 1297 , during the Scottish War for Independence from England .
The Scots were led by Andrew Moray and Sir William Wallace , who hated the English so much that he sought out Hugh de Cressingham , the English second - in - command on the field and personally beheaded him , then had him skinned and made into a sword belt .
The rest of the Scots chopped Cressingham ’s skin up into tanned victory tokens .
But , whereas the film depicts the battle playing out comfortably on a flat , grassy field , the battle really played out on Stirling Bridge , which is still there today , and very narrow .
Only about 2 men on horseback , or 4 men on foot can pass in line - abreast formation , and because of this , as most famously demonstrated at Thermopylae in 480 BC , the English numbers meant nothing .
They had somewhere between 10,000 and 12,000 men , to the Scots ’ 2,000 to 2,300 .
Given the numbers , the English did not even bother considering what would happen when both armies collided , as they also had about 300 heavy cavalry , and the Scots had only one hundred lightly armored cavalry , no match for English knights .
The English also had a large contingent of longbowmen , who were the bane of spearmen .
Except for their light cavalry , the Scots only had infantry , but Wallace had come up with an ingenious plan to thwart the English cavalry : the schiltron .
It is a circular formation of pikemen , with pikes , or spears , pointing outward .
Wallace invented this idea , but it is no different in principle from the Greek phalanx .
Horses are very intelligent and will not run into a bristling wall of spearpoints .
So Wallace had his men charge the English as they exited the Scottish end of the bridge , and the Scots threw their spears into position at the last instant as the English cavalry arrived , thus devastating it .
Now the hard part .
The Scots were still ridiculously outnumbered , so Wallace ordered the infantry to charge the English and hold them on the bridge , where a stalemate would be reached .
Meanwhile , he ordered Moray to lead the Scottish cavalry around the left flank of the English , across the River Forth , and slam into their rear , which they succeeded in doing , trapping the majority of the English army on the bridge , where about 7,000 men were slaughtered , or at least 70 % of the English North Army .
This battle did more for Scotland than that of Bannockburn , since until Stirling Bridge , the Scots did not believe they could defeat the English in open warfare .
The latter ’s heavy cavalry was just too tremendous .
But with the schiltron , they began holding their own , and this battle gave them the confidence to take ground from the English , without which confidence , they might have fled from the field of Bannockburn .
9 The Battle of Gibraltar
The Spanish Armada that attempted to defeat the British navy was bested by Charles Howard and Sir Francis Drake .
The Spanish managed to rebuild a fleet of 21 galleons , the largest warships in the world at the time , and intended to use them against the Dutch , who began a revolt in 1568 against Spain , because of Phillip II ’s tyrannical hatred of Protestant Holland .
You would think the Spanish naval hegemony of the time would have destroyed any Dutch fleet , but it is not enough to be a great navy .
You also have to fight well .
On 25 April , 1607 , the Dutch fleet of 26 small warships and 4 supply ships surprised the Spanish fleet of 21 warships , anchored in the Bay of Gibraltar , and spearheaded their horizontal line , normally a bad move , as will be explained later , but a good one here , as most of the Spanish cannon were unmanned .
The result was annihilation .
All 21 Spanish ships were sunk in 4 hours .
Not one Dutch ship was sunk , and the Dutch lost only 100 men , to Spain ’s 4,000 .
Almost half of the latter were executed by Dutch lifeboat crews sent through the swimming Spanish mass of sailors to kill them with swords , spears , and muskets .
The Dutch admiral , Van Heemskerk bled to death early in the battle , after a Spanish cannonball took off his left leg at the hip .
This battle enabled the Dutch to bring about a 12 year truce with Spain , who now had very little naval power left , and thus could not reach the Netherlands or England without France ’s help , who would not give it .
When Spain was powerful enough to break the truce 12 years later , the Dutch still won .
8 The Battle of Leyte Gulf
It remains , and probably will for a very long time to come , the largest naval battle in history , in terms both of tonnage displaced , and area traversed .
The United Stated Navy slugged it out with the Imperial Japanese navy around the Phillippine Archipelago from 23 to 26 October 1944 .
Four battles were fought , the second of which , the Battle of Surigao Strait , remains the last time two surface fleets of battleships engaged in naval gunfire .
The first battle , in the Sibuyan Sea , saw American aircraft divebomb the Japanese Center Fleet , and sink the Musashi , one of two largest battleships in history , the other being er twin sister , Yamato , which survived this sub-battle .
The Musashi and Myoko , a heavy cruiser , were sunk , but the huge Center Fleet was n’t perturbed .
That night , the Southern Japanese Fleet attempted to pass through Surigao Strait and flank Leyte Island from the South , while Kurita closed the pincers from the North through San Bernardino Strait .
Unfortunately , he steamed right into the horizontal line of 6 American battleships , 4 heavy cruisers , 4 light cruisers , 28 destroyers , and 39 torpedo boats .
The American order to open fire was “ Pearl Harbor . ”
Half of the Japanese Southern Fleet was sunk .
The next morning , the final two battles took place , as Admiral Halsey made a severe error in leaving San Bernardino Strait unguarded to go North after Ozawa ’s decoy fleet .
Halsey caught him and dealt a hammer blow off Cape Engano with carrier versus carrier combat .
Halsey ’s fleet , however , was ordered to defend the Leyte beachhead , where the Marines were fighting for the island .
The Center Fleet , now unopposed , sailed through the strait and south for the beaches , where it would shell the life out of the Marines .
But it ran into the small fleet of escort carriers , destroyers , and destroyer escorts , supporting the invasion .
The ensuing battle off Samar Island was one of the worst David - versus - Goliath mismatches in military history .
The Americans refused to give way , largely inspired ( or required ) by Lt. Cdr. Ernest E. Evans , of the USS Johnston , a destroyer .
For the Johnston to storm the Japanese fleet would be like shooting a BB at a freight train , but that is what Evans ordered .
The Johnston lasted for 2 and a half hours of naval bombardment before sinking .
Evans was killed and awarded a Medal of Honor .
The rest of the American fleet joined in and suffered similar fates , losing 5 ships , but not before sinking 4 much larger ships , and frightening the Japanese fleet into retreating .
Leyte Gulf resulted in one extremely important advantage to the Americans , in that it deprived the Empire of Japan of all of its oil reserves .
Without the Phillippines , Japan was doomed much faster .
Some of its admirals argued later that they could have held out for another year or two , regardless of the atomic bombings .
7 The Ludendorff Offensive
The 1918 Spring Offensive of WWI , named after the German commander , Erich Ludendorff , was Germany ’s final attempt to shatter the miserable stalemate of the previous 4 years , and conquer the Allied army .
He was compelled to do this in an effort to gain control of as much as he could before the Americans got into it with all their industrial might .
Fresh off the Russian Treaty of Brest - Litovsk , which enabled 50 more German divisions to turn to the Western Front , Ludendorff began his assault on 21 March .
It did not end until 18 July , 5 months later .
He sent approximately 1,000,000 men into the French , British and American lines , stretched for 43 miles , from Arras to La Fere , France .
They were met by a fairly equal number of largely exhausted enemy soldiers .
From 1915 to 1917 , the Germans dug in and let the Allies punch themselves out .
The Germans pushed through the lines amazingly well , taking more ground than either side had taken since 1914 .
But the Germans could not hold this ground for long , as the Allies fought defensively , conservatively , and let the Germans punch themselves out , just as their roles were reversed before .
5 months later , the Germans were absolutely exhausted .
They had lost 688,341 casualties , to the Allies ’ 851,374 ( dead , wounded , and missing ) , marking this as one of the most lethal battles in human history .
The Allies , however , were bolstered by the arrival of the Americans , under General John “ Blackjack ” Pershing , who proved themselves in Belleau Wood , in June .
They immediately counterattacked and by the end of August had reclaimed all the land the Germans took .
They then quickly launched the Hundred Days ’ Offensive , which destroyed German morale and sent the German armies home .
Their empire collapsed and World War I was finished .
The Ludendorff Offensive was thus a Pyrrhic Victory for Germany , accomplishing its immediate goals , but destroying itself in the process .
Had Ludendorff not ordered the offensive , the war would have lasted years longer .
6 The Battle of Salamis
While King Leonidas and his brave 300 were making their stand against 250,000 Persian soldiers under Xerxes I of Persia , Xerxes had his navy sail around through the Artemisium Strait , near Salamis Island , in an attempt to land soldiers on the southwest coast of Greece and advance on Athens , bypassing Leonidas ’s men .
The date is not agreed on , but occurred in the first or second week of September , 480 BC , while the Spartans led their Greek allies in the pass of Thermopylae .
The Persian fleet had somewhere between 600 and 800 ships , or as many as 1,200 , depending on the history read .
The Greeks had about 370 .
The Greeks were led by Themistocles , who is now regarded as one of the finest naval tacticians in history .
Thou severely outnumbered , he had his men board their ships in line and wait for the Persians to sail to them .
The Persians did so , and the Greeks backed up , apparently afraid .
What they were doing was precisely the same thing Leonidas was doing in Thermopylae : drawing the Persians into a bottleneck where their numbers would be meaningless , and they could no longer surround or flank the Greeks .
The farther the Persian fleet entered the Strait , the narrower it became , until finally the Greeks sallied forth and rammed into them .
The technique of the day , since no one had cannon , was to ram the enemy ship at an angle and grind along its side , snapping off all its oars .
This would reduce it to half speed , all the while the archers on deck would rain fire arrows on it .
Or a ship could ram the enemy straight on with the bronze - plated prow and punch a hole in its hull .
If the enemy ship did not sink , the ships were grinding side to side and both sent their marines up top to board the other .
Unfortunately , the Persian marines were fairly lightly armed and armored , while the Greek ships all carried contingents of fully armed hoplites , trained and outfitted just the same as Leonidas ’s Spartans .
Add to this the Persian fleet ’s cumbersome size and the result was a decisive Greek victory .
The Persians ships got in each other ’s way , and the Greek fleet formed a wedge and split the Persian fleet in two , shoving them all back until they ran aground on the Greek coast .
They attempted to flee to Phalerum , where a Persian army was waiting , but were ambushed by Aeginetans , a Greek naval contingent of the battle , and more ships were sunk .
When they finally escaped , the Persians had lost about 300 ships , the Greeks only 40 .
With his fleet ransacked , Xerxes now had no way of transporting his men around Greece and could not hope to succeed with his invasion .
The next year he tried again , and faced 40,000 Greeks on the plains of Plataea .
Remember how unstoppable 300 Spartans were at Thermopylae ?
Well there were 10,000 Spartans at Plataea , with plenty of room to do their thing .
They slaughtered 10,000 or more Persians .
Herodotus claims 250,000 Persians killed there .
He also claims that only 159 Greeks were killed , but more likely 5,000 or so were .
The ships held about 50 men each , so about 15,000 Persians died .
Herodotus claims that the Persians lost so many soldiers because their sailors could not swim .
5 The Battle of Gettysburg
The largest battle in terms of casualties in the American Civil War played out from 1 to 3 July 1863 , in a small town just over the southern border in Pennsylvania .
It was an accident .
General Robert E. Lee was intent on marching to Washington D. C. , but first had to find shoes for his army .
He stopped in Gettysburg for this , and the Union army under General George Meade stumbled upon him .
The ensuing action left 3,155 Yankees and 4,708 Rebels dead , of 46,286 total casualties .
This battle saw more American dead than Iwo Jima .
The climax came on the third day , when General Lee ordered a full - scale infantry charge into the center of the Union line .
The Confederates had to march across one mile of open fields , under artillery and musket fire , before breaching the Union lines .
It was doomed .
General Longstreet knew this , but without General Stonewall Jackson , who had been killed by friendly fire two months earlier , he was unable to change Lee ’s mind .
General George Pickett ’s name is fixed to this action , but he was only one of several generals involved .
Pickett ’s Charge resulted in the annihilation of the Confederate forces committed to it , and the Union shouted at them , “ Fredericksburg ! Fredericksburg ! ” because at the battle of Fredericksburg , the exact opposite happened .
Losses were similar , but Lee ’s were much more difficult to replace .
He now had insufficient strength to attack Washington , and had to retreat .
Meade should have followed and destroyed him , but did not have the nerve to fight another such battle .
Lee ’s army never again had the strength to contest the war in the North , and had to fight defensively until the end .
4 The Battle of Britain
The most heroic aerial battle in history played out for 3 and a half months , from 10 July to 31 October 1940 , when the British Royal Airforce rose en masse to defend the British Isles , and hold on to Western Europe as much as it could , against the Nazi Luftwaffe , under Hermann Goering .
The Brits were outgunned 1,963 aircraft to 4,074 German aircraft , but had the finest radar system in the world at the time , and used it to detect incoming fighter and bomber squadrons in time to send up their own planes into dogfights over the Channel .
This lasted until about 11 August , by which time the Luftwaffe had pushed the RAF back well enough to attack the coastal airfields .
The RAF was very thin on planes , but refused to quit swinging , and battled desperately to save the airfields .
By 6 September , the RAF was losing this fight badly , and the Luftwaffe had only to continue pounding away at the airfields , but Hitler finally broke under the pressure , assuming that the British would never fold .
He changed tactics to bombing London , in order to destroy the British morale .
It did n’t work , and as a result , the RAF was able to reestablish air supremacy , use all its remaining airfields , and reduce the Luftwaffe to a wreck .
Goering demanded from his pilots what they needed to win the battle , and they all shouted in unison , “ Spitfires ! ”
As a result of this defeat , Hitler was unable to invade Britain , and thus control Western Europe .
He intended to invade the Soviet Union , but could not reduce the war to this single - front offensive , and could never hope to defeat both Britain and the Soviet Union at the same time .
3 The Battle of Trafalgar
Napoleon was one of the greatest generals in history , but he had nothing to do with the French Navy .
This was left to Pierre Villeneuve , who commanded the French and Spanish fleets in defeating the British Royal Navy , the finest in the world .
They met off the coast of Cape Trafalgar , Spain , on 21 October 1805 .
The British had 27 ships of the line versus a combined 33 French and Spanish ships of the line .
These ships each carried about 100 cannon , and one ship was thus more powerful than an entire land army , yet packed into an area of a few hundred feet .
Its sole purpose was to sail up broadside to another ship and unload the full complement of its grape and solid shot into the enemy , until the latter sank .
Lord Nelson , in command , found the enemy attempting to sail for England , and deliberately broke the rule of never letting the enemy “ cross the T . ”
When the T is crossed , the crossline is able to turn all its cannon on one side and fire at the bow of the enemy , who cannot fire back as there are no cannon in the bow .
But Nelson reckoned rightly on the French and Spanish still using matchlock and simple fuse cannon , instead of flintlock cannon , as the British had .
The ocean swells made accuracy extraordinarily difficult , as the cannoneer had to light the cannon , then wait for the fuse to reach the powder , during which time the target is moving , and the ocean is throwing both boats around .
Nelson ’s fleet received a few shots on the way into the maelstrom , nothing serious , then all Hell broke loose .
Every ship chose the nearest enemy , turned broadside and opened fire .
Nelson was shot dead by a French sniper in a crow ’s nest , but his fleet split the enemy lines and circled them into two piecemeal engagements .
The Spanish comander , Federico Gravina , was mortally wounded .
The French admiral , Villeneuve , was captured .
The British lost none of their ships , and sank one of the enemy ’s , capturing 21 others .
Ships captured could be used , and thus navies did not bother sinking one unless necessary .
7,000 Spanish and French sailors were captured , and 3,200 were killed .
Only 458 British sailors were killed .
This remains the most decisive victory of the British Royal Navy in history .
All other British naval battles have been judged according to it .
The French and Spanish did not muster a naval threat to Britain again during the Napoleonic Wars .
2 The Battle of Midway
Usually cited as the one and only turning point in the Pacific Theater of WWII , this was a desperately wanted American victory to keep up morale at home .
The battle played out from 4 to 7 June 1942 , 7 months after Pearl Harbor , as the result of a single Japanese recon plane attempting to radio in the American fleet ’s position .
His radio malfunctioned .
The Japanese now had no way of knowing where the Americans were , but the Americans found them , radioed home their position , and all the aircraft in the world rained down on top of them .
The Japanese had begun bombing Midway Island , with ordnance meant for such a task .
The attacking American aircraft suddenly forced them to switch to anti-naval ordnance , in order to drive off the carriers .
This switch cost them valuable time , during which the Americans divebombed and sank all 4 Japanese carriers , all 248 planes , and 1 heavy cruiser .
The U. S. only lost 1 carrier , the Yorktown , and one destroyer , USS Hammann , 150 of 360 aircraft , and 307 killed .
The Japanese lost 3,057 sailors and their best pilots , and never again possessed a mighty surface fleet to contest the United States of America .
1 The Battle of Stalingrad
The mightiest , most horrifying and awe - inspiring example of guts and stamina in the history of warfare , resulting in equally unsurpassed brutality and impudent disregard for human lives , raged for 200 days , from 17 July 1942 to 2 February 1943 , in Stalingrad , Russia , between a Nazi alliance of 1,011,000 men , and Soviet armies of 1,103,000 .
To attribute the Soviet victory to any one factor is impossible : Generals January and February played a major role , but the Soviets also seemed to have an inexhaustible supply of men and material , whereas the Nazis went had a fixed number that could not be reinforced once winter set in .
Even Soviet civilians joined in actively , although Soviet heroism can be called into question by Order 227 , of Stalin : “ Not a Step Back ! ”
Any Soviet soldier seen retreating was shot by his own officers .
The same applied to the civilians , whom Stalin forbade evacuation , believing that the army would fight harder to protect them .
The Soviets were not subhuman , as Hitler would have had the Wehrmacht believe , and the Wehrmacht knew this perfectly well by the time of the battle .
What the Soviets lacked in technology and generalship they more than made up for in numbers and courage .
But they also invented the T - 34 tank for the express purpose of besting the Panzers and Tigers .
They pulled this off , even inside the city , after a Nazi aerial bombardment turned it into a bombed - out moonscape .
90 % of the city was razed to the ground .
Brick , wood , stone and steel was heaped 35 feet high in many places , and the Germans could not maneuver tanks in these areas .
The Soviets simply held theirs in strategic squares and street corners , and inside the factories , and waited for targets .
The fighting throughout the city became world - renowned , as the Soviets adopted the principle of no longer retreating , however high the cost would grow , and anchored their defense in multi- floored apartment blocks , factories , warehouses , street corner residences , and office buildings , converting them into strongholds bristling with machine guns , anti-tank rifles , mortars , mines , barbed wire , snipers , and small 5 - to 10 - man units of submachine gunners and grenadiers prepared for house - to - house combat .
Bitter fighting raged for every ruin , street , factory , house , basement , and staircase .
The sewers became labyrinthine firefights .
The Nazis called it “ Rattenkrieg , ” or “ Rat War . ”
In such desperate chaos , all battle lines vanished , and the major , armor - supported mobility to which the German soldiers were accustomed degenerated into vicious , fast - paced skirmishes ranging through bombed - out remnants of residential neighborhoods , office blocks , basements , and apartment high - rises .
Some of the taller buildings , blasted into roofless shells by the German aerial bombardment , saw floor - by - floor , close - quarters combat , with the Germans on one level , Soviets on the next , Germans on the next , etc. , firing at each other through holes in the floors .
They grappled and bayoneted and threw each other out the windows onto tops of tanks .
The three factories in the City North became titanic struggles between tanks and anti-tank squads , while the Luftwaffe divebombed them into oblivion .
The Soviet snipers found it the perfect hunting ground , and Vassily Zaitsev shot at least 242 Germans , mostly officers , by the battle ’s end .
The life expectancy of a Soviet conscript sent into the city became 12 hours .
The Germans fared better in the first two months or so .
Then , Zhukov and Vasilevsky brought 1 million men from the surrounding steppes and Siberia , and besieged the besiegers .
Nazi General Manstein , the finest Germany had , attempted to break through the contravallation and relieve General Paulus inside , but was immediately forced to retreat .
The German 6th Army was doomed .
They called the city “ Der Kessel , ” or “ The Cauldron , ” and through the winter , they suffered starvation and frostbite so appalling that they resorted to eating the flesh off their own toes , which were so numb they could n’t feel the knife .
Supplies were flown in , and grossly insufficient .
The Nazis were so weak from hunger that they could n’t offload them .
Most of the cargo planes were shot down .
The Soviets had just the right clothing and know - how to survive in such weather , and when , at last , Paulus surrendered his army , the entire city had been destroyed .
Bone shards and rusty shrapnel can still be fished out of the grass on Mamayev Kurgan , a large hill in the city center , on which both armies wanted their artillery .
They fought one of the most monumentally atrocious contests of attrition in human history for control of this hill , sending a wave of infantry up , being beaten back , then shelling the other side when they charged up .
Two men were exhumed by accident in 1954 , 12 years later , on top of the hill , one German , one Soviet , who had bayoneted each other through the chests and died together , then been buried by a mortar explosion .
This was the first substantial defeat of the Wehrmacht on land , and with it went all the initiative into the hands of the Soviets .
Until this battle , the Soviets had known only ridiculous and dangerous failures .
Because they seized the momentum on the Eastern Front , Hitler was unable to concentrate on the Western Front , and never had a chance of winning a two - front war .
Slowly , and violently , the Soviet Union shoved the invaders home , and besieged Berlin .

We are told one thing , but the reality is quite another !
A friend had sent this on me ... This was his experience on Sunday afternoon
" I was just walking around the city enjoying the events of the 2010 Winter Games , when I came across city workers loading trash into a garbage truck .
This should not be unusual , however they were loading trash and recyclables all into the same truck which then were mashed it all together .
The city has spent a fortune places new garbage collections bins all over the city .
They have 2 bags ; 1 for regular trash , the other for recyclables .
They have signage trying to indicate how responsible the city it .. NOT ...
It appears this is just for the cameras as it appears to be all going to the same place .
The city worker questioned why I was photographing the garbage truck , I advised him he should n't be mixing the trash .
He said management was aware of this . "
David Suzuki what did it take to buy you off ???

A Vanderbilt University study has new findings on how psychopaths weigh risk and reward .
The study suggests that psychopaths may possess amped - up dopamine reward systems that compel them to pursue their goals regardless of personal cost .
Advertisement
Study co-author David Zald notes that previous studies of psychopathy focus on the personality traits of psychopaths rather than the way psychopaths assess incentives :
There has been a long tradition of research on psychopathy that has focused on the lack of sensitivity to punishment and a lack of fear , but those traits are not particularly good predictors of violence or criminal behavior [...]
Our data is suggesting that something might be happening on the other side of things .
These individuals appear to have such a strong draw to reward — to the carrot — that it overwhelms the sense of risk or concern about the stick .

In this National Institute on Drug Abuse - funded study , volunteers were given amphetamines ( a.k.a. speed ! ) and then subsequently had their brains analyzed .
As psychopathy is often correlated with drug abuse , those who displayed traits of psychopathy released four times the amount of dopamine in response to the amphetamines .
A second part of the study analyzed how volunteers ' brains reacted to a promise of a monetary reward .
Again , those with the psychopathic traits released heightened amounts of dopamine .
Sadly , the study did not delve into whether or not psychopaths produced more dopamine while listening to the music of Huey Lewis and The News .

The pilot suffered a dislocated arm and minor abrasions
A Red Arrows pilot has been taken to hospital after a mid-air crash between two display planes during a training exercise in Crete .
Flt Lt Mike Ling ejected from the aircraft following the collision over Hellenic Air Force Base in Kastelli during a pre-season exercise .
The second pilot Flt Lt Dave Montenegro from the RAF team , based at RAF Scampton , Lincolnshire , landed safely .
The planes were practising a manoeuvre when they collided at 1150 GMT .
The injured pilot , who ejected himself from the plane before it crash - landed on the runway of the base , has a dislocated arm and minor abrasions .
A service inquiry will be convened to identify the cause of the crash
RAF spokesman
His condition is not life - threatening , the Ministry of Defence said .
The runway was temporarily closed while the aircraft was removed .
The RAF said an investigation into the cause of the crash would be carried out and 2010 season training will continue as soon as possible .
A spokesman said : " We can confirm that an incident has occurred involving the Red Arrows whilst undertaking pre-season training at Hellenic Air Force Base Kastelli in Crete .
" A service inquiry will be convened to identify the cause of the crash . "
The Red Arrows team arrived on the Greek island on Sunday for the first stage of Exercise Springhawk .
Ten Hawks and a C130 Hercules left Lincolnshire on Saturday and travelled to Crete via France and Italy .
The Red Arrows was formed in 1965 and its pilots have completed more than 4,000 aerobatic displays in 53 countries .
Look closely , ladies and gentlemen , because the Republican party is the face of evil .
How could anyone in their right mind oppose unemployment benefits during the worst recession in living memory ?
Simple : Because when a Republican says people wo n't look for jobs because they 're on unemployment , he 's really complaining they still have too much dignity to accept slave labor at slave wages .
Because as always , the GOP is about cheap , disposable labor with no legal protections .
With the help of Blue Dog Democrats , they may eventually get their way .
But for now , they 'll try to strip away whatever shred of dignity a working person has left .
And really , we can't have that , can we ?
The little people might get ideas above their station :
Long time readers of this blog may remember DVDRSource and TVSource private torrent trackers .
These were two torrent sites that specialized in untouched DVDR movies and TV Shows , mostly scene releases .
However , both these trackers ceased to exist in January 2010 .
Why ?
They merged together to create a new scene tracker called XNT or Excellent .nu .
The merger has so far been a success with XNT being one of the fastest growing private torrent sites ( in terms of new torrents ) of 2010 .
Ever since it ’s inception , Excellent.nu has opened registrations only once – and that was around 4 months ago .
If you could not make it inside back then , here ’s another great opportunity - XNT administrators have opened site registrations exclusively for FILEnetworks readers for a limited time .
Just like DVDRSource and TVSource , XNT runs on SweDVDR ’s source code ( SweDVDR made their source public after the site shut down last year ) .
The interface is clean , fast and is easy to navigate .
There are multiple browse pages for new torrents ( Browse page ) , older torrents ( Archive page ) and another separate index for MP3/ 0 Day section .
This section is home to scene released MP3 music albums , software releases and is always on free leech .
However , XNT is not all about the looks .
The site has been growing fast and it ’s autouploader bots have been busy .
Since January 2010 , over 11500 torrents have been uploaded and close to 10000 members have signed up .
Although TVSource and DVDSource indexed only DVD movies and TV Shows , XNT ’s torrent index goes beyond that .
It indexes all sorts of content including software , MP3 , E - books , games , etc apart from movies and TV series .
Bulk of the uploads are scene releases .
P2P content does get added and there is a significant number of packs uploaded as well .
Some of these packs are exclusive to XNT .
Although a Sweden based tracker , Excellent.nu is full of English releases .
There are some DVDR releases for Nordic region but even these have English audio .
Pre times and download speeds on XNT are pretty good .
As mentioned earlier , tracker staff have agreed to grant FILEnetworks readers access to XNT through a special open signup .
Like most offers we conduct in our giveaways section , you are not required to provide any ratio proof , speedtests , go through interviews , etc – please do not abuse this and make sure to read the site rules , FAQ , allowed clients lists , etc after you get in .
Note that this special open signup will only be valid for a limited amount of time .
Site Name : XNT ( http://www.xnt.nu)
Signup URL : http://www.xnt.nu/signup.php
Important :
The above signup URL will only work if you access it from within FILEnetworks Blog .
If you want to tell your friends feel free to link to this article .
Special thanks to BethCooper and rest of XNT staff for the support given .

Our durability is because of you , the readers .
We would n't — could n’t — do this if we did n't think people were listening , helping us spread the word , and participating in and advancing the conversation .

While the traffic to a lot of the peak oil - related sites has waned a bit in the face of " stable " oil prices and an economy that seemingly makes no sense to anyone , we are doing all right .
Much more importantly than traffic , while we have no easy way to measure the quality of our , or our readers ’ , impacts on policy or their own communities , we can not but hope that we are a part of positive change .
At The Oil Drum , we have always tried to be the bridge between the doomers , the technopians and the cornucopians , to present as many sides of the myriad arguments as we can , so that we do not become too rooted in any mode of thought .
This allows us to be nimble , to test raw ideas through your eyes and critical thinking in a way that does n't happen most places .
We really try not to tell you what to think , we just ask that you actually do so — and do so critically and empirically .
As this post of Nate 's points out so eloquently , WE DON ’T KNOW , but we can learn .
I remain proud of this site for its perspective and willingness to take on these immense topics .
This is not easy to do , folks .
It is not easy at all .
I have made mistakes , but in that I am only reassured by the fact that no one gets them all right ; in the end , all we can do is try to do what we think is best as our inner spirit dictates .
If one thinks about it , SO much has changed since we started : the oil run-up , hurricanes , the economic debacle , the dynamic climate debate all have added even greater complexity to an already overwhelming topic .
It is hard to take it all in and digest to any comprehensive conclusion -- which is why we keep doing what we are doing .
Not only do we still aspire to make sense of it all , but we also know that it is going to take as many good minds dedicated to the task as we can possibly put together .
These are just some of the many reasons I am thankful for and care deeply for every single person on this staff -- they are an amazing collection of people : diverse , intelligent beyond bound , hard - working , personable and engaged .
The people of this group may not agree on everything , but we do understand that this site is something special that must be maintained for as long as it can be .
The efforts of Gail , Leanan , SuperG , and Nate ( and his recent absence is a loss to this community ) should be especially noted , as they are the folks who are here most days , slogging it out , making it work .
Without them , this site would not have persevered over the past months .
I do n't think many understand the cumulative toll that these people pay each day to keep this unique space up and running -- and they do so with only the compensation of attempting to do the right thing .
We are all fortunate for this .
I have never shared anything more than an email conversation with some of these people , but they have all joined together in this fight — all of them for their own reasons , all of them with their own perspectives .
When oil was rising in price , it became a signal that conventional thinking could accept as an indicator of scarcity .
Despite different skill sets , ultimate goals , pet concerns , etc. , our union of purpose remains a shared one .
In this period where demand for energy is outpacing geologic depletion , our interests , expertise and worldviews have become more disparate .
And that 's ok .
In this struggle to discuss energy and our future , the issues are likely to grow even more tense , more vitriolic , and tougher to handle , with all of the situations we face in this world , economic , political , energy , and otherwise .
I therefore ask that you , our readers , make every effort to treat each other with respect and understanding when these polemic topics arise .
I am compelled to remind you of one of my favorite quotes from someone I think a lot of , Jerry Michalski ; he shared a mantra with me a while back , which he learned from Quaker meeting : " Speak only if it will improve upon the silence . "
We thank you for continuing to improve upon the silence here at The Oil Drum .
No one knows what the future holds , no one holds all of the keys .
All we can do here is try to help educate and make that future a better one for as many people as we can , for as long as we can .
It is a unique model , based on social and community capital , and in turn it is itself a social experiment of the highest order — and one we need your help in perpetuating its norms , its impact , and its existence .
I hope that you will continue to join us in that purpose .

Over the years , the January transfer window has provided plenty of entertainment , as clubs frantically scramble to complete medicals and fax contracts as the minutes tick away on deadline day .
The January transfer window was first introduced by UEFA in 2003 , despite most Premier League sides being against it … and was intended to create “ stability ” in the game , allowing teams to focus on the second half of the season , rather than the marketplace .
One of the biggest issues is how it strips smaller clubs of their best talents and widens the gap between them and the biggest clubs — like when Liverpool signed Virgil Van Dijk from Southampton , or Wilfried Bony was taken from Swansea by Manchester City .
The Federal Government is believed to have scrapped the replacement scheme for its botched home insulation program .
The original $ 2.4 billion program was shut down in February after it was linked to four deaths , more than 100 house fires , and cases of rorting .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd commissioned respected former bureaucrat Allan Hawke to review the scheme and recommend changes for a revamped program , which Mr Rudd promised would start on June 1 .
Fairfax papers claim Dr Hawke 's report is highly critical about the policy 's development and implementation and that timelines for starting the revised program in June were insufficient .
It is believed that Cabinet ditched the replacement scheme yesterday to focus instead on fixing the 50,000 homes that have had foil insulation installed , and carrying out safety inspections for another 150,000 homes .
Assistant Climate Change Minister Greg Combet will not comment on the future of the replacement scheme and Mr Rudd is also keeping quiet about Cabinet 's deliberations .
" In terms of the report itself and where it 's up to , and the deliberations on it and its debate in the public domain , I 'll wait for Minister Combet 's statement on the above , " he told ABC local radio .
" Minister Combet has been re-evaluating all of these matters to make sure that these things are done properly and in the safest way possible .
I have absolute confidence that he 's doing a first - class job . "
Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner also declined to comment when questioned on Radio National this morning .
" I 'm afraid that I can't comment on Cabinet deliberations but we are focused very intently on dealing with the problems that have emerged with the home insulation program , " he said .
" [ We are ] dealing with the checking of people who are at risk and making sure that we fix those problems ; that 's our key priority in this area and that 's what we 're going to continue to focus on . "
Opposition Leader Tony Abbott says it is another example of the Government failing to keep its word .
" First of all the Government said there was going to be this program available , then when they suspended it they said that it would restart , now they 've said that it 's not going to restart , " he told Fairfax radio .
" So you 've had three different stories from this Government and everyone who 's relied on this Government at the earlier stages has been badly let down . "
Mr Abbott says the Government must compensate insulation companies .
" There 's also all the businesses that invested large amounts of money on the strength of what they thought was a commitment from the Government , " he said .
" The Government owes something to them as well and they 've got to be appropriately looked after . "
Opposition environment spokesman Greg Hunt says the Government has been considering scrapping the new scheme for a while .
" The Government 's been split for some time .
Greg Combet has wanted to drop the program , " he said .
" The Prime Minister , for reasons of pride , has wanted to keep the pink batts program going .
" We know that it 's been a disaster ; we think that Combet has stared the Prime Minister down with the evidence that this program is simply unsalvageable .
" Right now , we want a commitment that every one of the million homes will be inspected , so as we can find and fix 240,000 dangerous and dodgy roofs . "
Mr Hunt says the Government should release Dr Hawke 's report and there should be a judicial inquiry because the auditor - general 's inquiry is not enough .
" The auditor - general 's inquiry has excluded , at the Government 's request , an inspection into how the four deaths were linked or otherwise not linked to the program , " he said .
" But it 's absolutely clear there has been a pattern [ of problems ] , which was warned about as far ago as February 18th last year .
" And it beggars belief that the auditor - general 's inquiry has ruled out the discussion of the causes and consequences of the program in contributing to these tragedies . "

The Sun as you 've never seen it : Nasa reveals stunning footage from new satellite
Advertisement
Forget Iceland 's volcano .
If you want to see a really big eruption , you need to head to the Sun .
This astonishing image - captured by a new Nasa space telescope - shows a ferocious solar flare looping out the Sun with the power of 100 hydrogen bombs .
The ring of fire , heated to tens of millions of degrees , stretches out tens of thousands of miles - and is so big it could contain more than 100 Earths .
It is just one of the spectacular images from a new satellite which it says could give fresh insight into how the Sun works .
The pictures were taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory ( SDO ) , which is the most advanced spacecraft ever designed to study the Sun .
Scroll down for video report
[ caption ]
The clarity of the SDO images means that it will feed back to Nasa on Earth more comprehensive science data than any other solar observing spacecraft .
Every day it sends out 1.5 terabytes of data , equal to 500,000 songs on an MP3 player .
' These initial images show a dynamic sun that I had never seen in more than 40 years of solar research , ' said Richard Fisher , director of the Heliophysics Division at Nasa .
' SDO will change our understanding of the Sun and its processes , which affect our lives and society .
This mission will have a huge impact on science , similar to the impact of the Hubble Space Telescope on modern astrophysics . '
Some of the images show never - before - seen detail of material streaming outward and away from sunspots .
Others show extreme close - ups of activity on the Sun ’s surface .
The satellite was launched in February and chief scientist Dean Pesnell said it has already disproved at least one theory - but refused to give details .
' These amazing images , which show our dynamic sun in a new level of detail , are only the beginning of SDO 's contribution to our understanding of the Sun , ' he said .

Close - up :
These images show solar flares escaping from the Sun 's surface .
The one on the right ( top ) stretches almost halfway across the star , about 500,000 miles
These images are created by colour filters on the SDO that reveal different layers of temperates on the Sun 's surface .
Scientists hope that SDO will provide a better understanding of the role the Sun plays on the Earth 's weather patterns
MEASURING UP THE SUN
Nasa 's Solar Dynamics Observatory ( SDO ) , blasted off from Cape Canaveral , Florida in February 2010 .
It is on a five year mission which is expected to cost £ 550 million .
The spacecraft , orbiting 22,000 miles above Earth , is 7.2 ft by 14.8 ft .
The solar panels are 21ft across and produce 1450W of power .
Instruments on board have additional shielding because this is in the outer reaches of the Earth 's radiation belt where levels can be quite high .
The spacecraft carries three instruments that take ultra-high resolution images of the Sun every minute .
It is also able to study solar pressure waves generated on its surface .
During its five - year mission , it will examine the Sun 's magnetic field and provide a better understanding of the role the Sun plays in Earth 's climate .
It will determine how the Sun 's magnetic field is generated and converted into such violent solar events such as turbulent solar winds .
Scientists know that such solar activity plays a significant role on the weather we experience on Earth by interacting with our planet 's magnetic fields and upper atmosphere .
Recently UK researchers linked low solar activity and freezing cold winters in Europe .
However , the mechanism behind this is not fully understood .
It is hoped the SDO will help scientists learn the damage solar flares can do to communication satellites and power supplies .
Before it was launched Professor Richard Harrison from the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire said these type of missions could n't prevent solar activity , but could help us to prepare for them .
Companies could be warned in advance to switch off vital satellite circuits and technology systems could be improved on Earth .
' It 's like predicting the rain , ' he told Mail Online .
' You ca n't stop it but if you know it 's coming you can put an umbrella up . '
Nasa 's Mr Fisher said the satellite was operating flawlessly .
Since the launch , engineers have been continually been conducting testing and verification of the spacecraft 's components .
It carries three instrument packages , one built by the University of Colorado 's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics and two built by Lockheed Martin in Palo Alto , California .
The information is hoped to learn about the damage solar flares can do to communication satellites and power supplies .
The SDO spacecraft is prepared by Nasa specialists prior to its launch in February
Barry sez , " UVEX , the ski goggle maker , got a nastygram from an Olympics Committee IP lawyer , forbidding them from using any images — or even mentioning — that gold medal winner Lindsey Vonn uses their equipment . "
So UVEX turned to verse :
Blonde Who Uses Our Stuff Wins Downhill ( Last Name Rhymes With " Bonn " )
There once was a lawyer from the IOC ,
who called us to protect " intellectual property . "
" During the Olympics " , she said with a sneer
" your site ca n't use an Olympian 's name even if they use your gear . "
" No pictures , no video , no blog posts can be used … "
Even if they are old ?
" No ! " , she enthused .
While Olympians chase gold the IOC pursues green .

Ops is scheduled for release in November 2010 and sources indicate the game developed by Treyarch will be set in history , between World War II and present day .
It is also hinted that some of the missions will take gamers to Cuba and South America which hints at a Cold War and Vietnam based game .
In true Modern Warfare style , gamers will reportedly get a chance to play as a member of the Special Air Service ( SAS ) in which players will be involved in close combat during a mission in the Iranian embassy during the 1980’s .
The game is also hinted to feature the popular “ zombie mode ” where players will get to gun down forces of zombies which was made popular in Call of Duty : World at War .
For South African PC gamers and worldwide PC gamers alike , CoD7 is set to feature dedicated servers .
Gamers across the world should put their hands together for Activision who seem to be weeding out the problems with previous titles by re-adding dedicated servers to the franchise .
Demonic Possession & Oppression ; Exorcism Recent accounts in the media : Sponsored link .
Recent events : 2000 - APR : USA : Book published about computer possession : Reverend Jim Peasboro of Savannah GA has written a book " The Devil in the Machine : Is your computer possessed by a demon ? "
Some of the points raised in the book by the author are :
" While the Computer Age has ushered in many advances , it has also opened yet another door through which Lucifer and his minions can enter and corrupt men's souls . "
Demons can possess anything with a brain , including a chicken , a human being , or a computer .
" Any PC built after 1985 has the storage capacity to house an evil spirit . "
" ... most of the youths involved in school shootings like the tragedy at Columbine were computer buffs ... I have no doubt that computer demons exerted an influence on them . "
an estimated " ... one in 10 computers in America now houses some type of evil spirit . "
" Technicians can replace the hard drive and reinstall the software , getting rid of the wicked spirit permanently . "
Rev. Peasboro said : " I learned that many members of my congregation became in touch with a dark force whenever they used their computers .
Decent , happily married family men were drawn irresistibly to pornographic web sites and forced to witness unspeakable abominations .
Housewives who had never expressed an impure thought were entering Internet chat rooms and found themselves spewing foul , debasing language they would never use normally ...
One woman wept as she confessed to me , ' I feel when I 'm on the computer as if someone else or something else just takes over . ' "
The author had the opportunity to inspect an infected computer .
He found that an artificial - intelligence program started up automatically .
He said that : " The program began talking directly to me , openly mocked me .
It typed out , ' Preacher , you are a weakling and your God is a damn liar . '
Then the device went haywire and started printing out what looked like gobbledygook ... I later had an expert in dead languages examine the text .
It turned out to be a stream of obscenities written in a 2,800 - year - old Mesopotamian dialect ! "
2005 - JUN : UK : Fundamentalist Christians charged with horrendous abuse of a child during exorcism :
Some members of a local Fundamentalist church in East London believed that a ten - year - old girl in their family was a witch .
They allegedly beat her , cut her at least 43 times , rubbed chili - peppers into here eyes in order to drive out what they apparently thought was an evil spirit possessing her .
More details .
2005 - JUN - 15 : Romania : Crucified nun dies during alleged exorcism : Maricica Irina Cornici , 23 , visited an Eastern Orthodox convent in Tanacu in northern Romania in order to visit a friend .
She decided to stay .
She suffered from schizophrenia .
According to various media reports , she insulted Father Daniel Corogeanu , 29 , in front of the congregation .
He and the other nuns concluded that Maricica was possessed by Satan and had to undergo an exorcism .
They tied up her hands and feet and left he in the cellar of the convent for several days without food .
Then they crucified her by tying and chaining her to a cross .
She eventually died .
According to the local police , Father Daniel and four nuns have been charged with " depriving a victim of freedom , leading to death . "
This is a charge normally applied to hostage - taking terrorists .
More details .
2005 - SEP -08 ( approx ) : Bob Larson featured on Inside Edition and A&E : Inside Edition , a syndicated newsmagazine TV show , reviewed the ministry of Bob Larson .
In past decades , he specialized in attacking Neopagan religions and the occult .
But more recently , he seems to be switching to live exorcisms .
He states that he has done more than 6,000 exorcisms : " ... more than any living person on the planet "
He wanders through the audience at his weekend seminars looking for signs of the devil in the eyes of those possessed .
In a video made during the year 2000 , he is shown casting out demons , ordering them to come out of possessed persons and go to the pit of Hell .
One woman has been exorcised three times : twice in Texas and once in Alaska .
2
2006 - MAY - 16 : Good Morning America coverage of exorcisms : ABC broadcast a short article about deliverance ministries .
These are conservative Protestant groups who believe that they can drive indwelling demons from possessed persons .
The article featured Bob Larson of the Center for Spiritual Freedom in north Scottsdale , AZ .
The article is available on YouTube .
Larson said that the money he collects " ... goes to the ministry to teach people , to train people .
The evil that is taking place is happening because the Western world has lost its moral compass .
...
Some people have had their demons for so long , they think it ’s normal .
They think it ’s normal to live a dysfunctional confused life .
We tell people it ’s not . "
Gretchen Passantino is a Christian writer who has investigated deliverance ministries .
She said : " What he is doing is exploiting and manipulating people , [ and ] appealing to their fears their needs and sense of inadequacy . "
Father Gary Thomas of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego , CA , was interviewed briefly on the program .
He said that the Vatican is asking each diocese to have a trained exorcist on staff .

2014 - JAN - 20 : Germantown , MD : A 1 - year - old and a 2 - year - old were killed in a home in Germantown , MD .
A 5 - year - old and 8 - year - old were severely injured but are expected to recover .
The children 's mother , Zakieya Latrice Avery , 28 and a second woman Monifa Denise Sanford , 21 , have been charged with two counts of first degree murder and two counts of attempted first degree murder .
According to the police , the two women were attempting to perform an exorcism on the children .
Captain Marcus Jones , commander of the County 's major crimes unit , said : " This was all about what was in their minds .
They felt like there was something bad going on with the children , and they were trying to release it . "
Montgomery County Police Chief Tom Manger issued a statement saying : " Cases like this are heartbreaking .
Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the victims along with the 911 operators , police officers , evidence technicians , and fire and EMS personnel that responded . "
During 2011 - NOV
Avery had written on her Facebook page : " People are being deceived left and right every day and do n’t care to realize it .
They think it ’s safe and everything ’s a game when this world is owned by satan [ sic ] himself who wants to dumb us down to think there ’s no consequences for what we do .
Within two days , there were 67 comments placed by readers about this article in the Daily News .
Most criticized religions that taught about demon posession and exorcism as being responsible for this tragedy .
4,5
Major resource on the Internet :
The website " What 's the harm " lists 1,089 individuals who were harmed during an exorcism " ... by someone not thinking critically " See : http://whatstheharm.net/
2018 - JAN : The rise in demonic posession in Ireland : An Irish exorcist , Fr. Pat Collins , has asked the bishops in Ireland to train more priests as exorcists in order to meet the increasing demand among Catholic believers .
He notes that other exorcists across the world have noted a similar increase .
The surge was revealed by the International Association of Exorcists .
Catholic
Online states that : " Risk factors include secularism and atheism , as well as an ... interest in Satanism and the occult .
... Regular attendance at Church , prayer , reception of the Sacraments , including Reconciliation and Holy Communion help to keep evil at bay . "
6 The Catholic Church believes that most presented cases of exorcism are actually individual mental health problems .
Only a minority are real posession by demons .
2018 - FEB :
The rise in demonic posession in Italy : Reported demonic posessions are also in the rise in Italy .
Catholic leaders have concluded that the Church needs more and better trained exorcists .
Exorcist Father Cesare Truqui spoke at a weeklong training program for exorcists in the Vatican .
He said : " Today we are at a stage crucial in history .
Many Christians no longer believe in [ the devil ’s ] existence , few exorcists are appointed and there are no more young priests willing to learn . "
An exorcism course was held during April at the Pontifical Athenaeum Regina Apostolorum in Rome .
An exorcist from Sicily , Father Benigno Palilla , told Vatican Radio on February 22 that there are 500,000 alleged cases of posession or activity by demons in Itally each year .
The rate has tripled in recent years .
This is attributed to the increased popularity of fortune tellers and tarot cards .
He said : " We priests , very often , do not know how to deal with the concrete cases presented to us : in the preparation for the priesthood , we do not talk about these things .
And , consequently , a true evangelization is lacking . "
He emphasized the need for more exorcism apprentice programs , saying : “ A self - taught exorcist certainly makes errors .
I will say more : it would also take a period of apprenticeship , as happens for many professionals . "

It does figure that Andrew Breitbart and James OKeefe the turd are children of affluent ( effluent ? ) parents , does n't it ?
Being from the wrong side of the tracks myself and seeing people struggle everyday while I was growing up is probably why I 'm an unabashed liberal .
People like that always tend to look down on poverty with animosity .
Can you imagine what their parents are like ?
Just think of what Ward Churchill said after 9 - 11 that he was demonized for ( " little Eichmanns " ) .
The truth .

Another O'Keefe / Breitbart - like scam , hop all over this , Bradley !!!
The Republican Arizona governor Jan Brewer 's REAL agenda is to INTIMIDATE , BLOCK , & HARASS LEGAL HISPANIC VOTERS ... What moved GOP Governor Jan Brewer to sign the Soviet - style show - me - your - papers law is the exploding number of legal Hispanics , US citizens all , who are daring to vote --- and daring to vote Democratic by more than two - to - one .
Unless this demographic locomotive is halted , Arizona Republicans know their party will soon be electoral toast .
In 2004 , Arizona governor Jan Brewer , then Secretary of State , had organized a racially loaded purge of the voter rolls that would have made Katherine Harris blush .
Beginning after the 2004 election , under Brewer 's command , no less than 100,000 voters , overwhelmingly Hispanics , were blocked from registering to vote .
In 2005 , the first year of the Great Brown - Out , one in three Phoenix residents found their registration applications rejected .

Actually , lots of wealthy people are " liberal " in sentiment , if not in practice .
I 'm quite familiar with this , being from a once - wealthy family ( before my grandfather , bless his horny soul , squandered it on a playboy lifestyle ) .
However , it would be liberal in lip - service , while they live a resource - heavy lifestyle with wealth generated similarly to their " conservative " brethren .
So , the same body but a different face .
Liberal in lip - service and occasional charity auctions to alleviate conscience , and set the ground for lively debates at the country club .

Brad , Sorry for the typos .
1 ) It 's *** Mark *** Crispin Miller
and
2 ) I meant Thursday night ( not tonight ) when you host for Malloy .
AS long as I am posting , I might as well include my reply to John Fund 's article in the WSJ .
John is still shilling about non-existent " voter fraud " in Wisconsin , the favorite Republican bogus " voter fraud " state .
I guess the Bush - appointed prosectors are still running the show in WI .
Unlike the nine prosecutors ( CA , NM , etc. ) who Rove fired when they refused to bring bogus " voter fraud " charges prior to the 2004 election .
You might want to touch on this Thursday .
But that 's not what caused me to reply to Fund ( screen 4 ) .
It was his warning that we should avoid a repeat of Florida 2000 - implying that the mess was caused by voter fraud .
Of course John did not mention the 65,000 undervotes ( Dan Rather reported on the faulty punch cards purposely placed in FL Democratic counties ) ; or the 110,000 overvotes ( you know how that happened ) ; or the thousands of butterfly ballots ( thank that infamous DINO Teresa Lepore for that ) .
The Miami Herald determined that Gore won by at least 46,000 votes , after tot;ing up the undervotes and the overvotes by county .
I posted a link to there data in my second reply ( also on screen 4 ) .
Of course , the MSM has not said a peep about this for 10 years now .
http://online.wsj.com/ar...le%26commentId%3D1123784
I 'll be listening Thursday .

richard , altho the firing of the us attorneys was partially about non existinent voter fraud , carol lam was on to something much bigger , her name was added to the firing list the day after she served a search warrent on cia dude dusty foggo , who was convicted of bribing or taking bribes from another convicted felon , wade ... and get this , wades first govt contract was for 140,000 bucks of " office " furniture for dick cheney ....... here is copy from wiki , , , funny it doesnt mention carol lam anywhr ........
Kyle Dustin " Dusty " Foggo ( born November 21 , 1954 ) , is a former American government intelligence officer convicted of bribery in the awarding of a government contract and sentenced to 37 months in the federal prison at Pine Knot , Kentucky .
The executive director ( " EXDIR " , the number three position ) of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) until 2006 , Foggo was charged on February 13 , 2007 , with fraud and other offenses in the bribery case of convicted US congressman Randy Cunningham .
This indictment was superseded and expanded with an indictment returned on May 10 , 2007 , charging fraud , conspiracy and money laundering in relation to his dealings with defense contractor Brent R. Wilkes .
On September 29 , 2008 , Foggo pleaded guilty to one count of the indictment , admitting that while CIA executive director he accepted a bribe to steer a CIA contract to the firm of his lifelong friend , Brent R. Wilkes .
[ 1 ]
In a presentencing report filed by prosecutors in February 2009 , Foggo was also described as having a record of on the job corruption and off the job assaultive behavior stretching back 20 years .......................... i am not trying to take away from ur citizen audit work , i applaud you for that but if left in place carol lam might well of actually brought the last admin to justice

Import Caveats : Flaws in the Goldberg Bipolar Test
While the Goldberg Bipolar Spectrum Screening Questionnaire is one of the most popular on the web — having been around in one form or another since the early 1990s — it is by most accounts deeply flawed as a stand - alone test .
Why ?
The Goldberg test is deeply flawed for two reasons :
Assumption of a previous depressive episode
In the hands of a psychiatrist who has already directly taken a detailed clinical history , the fact that a screening instrument makes assumptions about that clinical history is not a problem .
In reality , however , most people taking a screening quiz on the internet are not sitting with a psychiatrist , do not know whether they have previously experienced an episode which would have been diagnosed by a psychiatrist as having been a depressive episode , and will take the test anyway !
Failure to check for mitigating factors which preclude the diagnosis of bipolar disorder
It is flatly , unconditionally , entirely wrong merely to link the presence of higher numbers of symptoms such as those described in this quiz to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder .
The diagnosis of bipolar disorder may be entirely precluded by certain factors which this test does not ask about .
Despite it ’s deep flaws , the Goldberg test remains popular , and we include it here in this section for the sake of completeness .
Go ahead , give it a whirl — just beware of its limitations .
For a more modern alternative , you may also want to try the “ Tri-Axial Bipolar Spectrum Screening Quiz ( TABS ) : Test for Bipolar ” .
Additional Information
The Goldberg Bipolar Spectrum Screening Questionnaire was developed by Dr Ivan Goldberg , MD .
While the American left and the mainstream media focuses on the Tea Party movement , a massive shift in politicized rightwing Christianity is now poised to have a significant electoral impact in the 2010 elections .
Ever since John McCain picked Sarah Palin as his running mate , my colleague Rachel Tabachnick and I have been collaboratively researching , as a top priority , the New Apostolic Reformation .
In a new Alternet story , Heads Up : Prayer Warriors and Sarah Palin Are Organizing Spiritual Warfare to Take Over America , Bill Berkowitz , who for many years has covered the religious right , interviews Rachel Tabachnick about this movement .
Why should Americans , or Daily Kos readers , care ?
Here is a partial list of where " apostles " of the New Apostolic Reformation have recently popped up :
Lindsay Lohan Banned From India ?
More drama for Lohan over claim she rescued kids from labor camp .
NEW DELHI , India , March 21 , 2010  --
The actress Lindsay Lohan may be banned from India , according to the British newspaper The Telegraph .
Lohan attempted to free herself from Hollywood cattiness by working on a BBC documentary on child labor last December .
But her trip was overshadowed by more drama when the actress tweeted about her role in a raid rescuing children from a sweatshop .
" Over 40 children saved so far ...
Within one day 's work ...
This is what life is about ...
Doing THIS is a life worth living !!! " she wrote .
The problem was that Lohan was not even in India at the time of the raid .
Perhaps even worse for the troubled actress , her false claims raised her profile to Indian authorities , who realized she had entered the country illegally on a tourist visa instead of a work visa for the documentary .
" During the course of filming , she visited one of our rehabilitation facilities , " Bhuwan Ribhu , an activist with the Indian organization Bachpan Bachao Andolan ( Save Childhood Campaign ) , told ABC News .
He added that Lohan spoke with children at one of the group 's Delhi facilities .
" We did not know about her visa status because we were working with the BBC , not her , specifically , " Ribhu said .
The actress , known for such films as " Mean Girls " and " Freaky Friday , " may not be able to enter the country again .
Officials are studying her case and will rule on the matter , according to the Telegraph .
The driver of a Toyota Prius who called 911 on Monday to report his accelerator was stuck finally got the car stopped after about 20 minutes with the help of the California Highway Patrol , officers said .
“ He was reaching speeds over 90 miles per hour , ” CHP Officer Larry Landeros said of the driver , James Sikes .
A Toyota spokesman said Monday evening that the company , which has recalled millions of vehicles because of reports of unintended acceleration , was sending a representative to investigate the cause of the incident .
The cellphone call came about 1:30 p.m. from the driver of the blue 2008 Prius eastbound on Interstate 8 in San Diego County .
“ He was driving near the La Posta Indian Reservation when he called 911 and said his gas pedal was stuck , ” Landeros said .
“ I pushed the gas pedal to pass a car and it did something kind of funny . . . it jumped and it just stuck there , ” Sikes , 61 , said at a news conference .
“ As it was going , I was trying the brakes . . . it was n’t stopping . ”
A CHP patrol officer caught up to the Prius about 20 minutes later and used a loudspeaker to tell the driver to apply his emergency brake in tandem with the brake pedal , Landeros said .
Once the Prius ’ speed dropped to about 50 mph , Sikes turned off the engine and was able to coast to a stop , the officer said .
Landeros did n’t know why the driver waited until his speed had dropped to turn off the engine , but the officer speculated that Sikes feared losing the car ’s power steering .
The officer drove in front of Sikes ’ Prius to block the car if necessary .
But the two cars never touched , Landeros said .
No one was hurt , the CHP said .
Toyota , the world ’s largest automaker , said it would look into the incident .
“ We ’re sending a field technical specialist to San Diego to investigate the car and find out what happened , ” Toyota spokesman Brian Lyons said .
“ We wo n’t be able to comment on what any possible problems with the car were until we take a look at the car . ”
Sudden unintended acceleration has allegedly been the cause of 56 fatal accidents involving Toyotas in the U.S. , going back as far as 2004 .
The Prius that Sikes was driving was one of more than 4 million Toyota vehicles recalled in November because of the reported acceleration problems .
But the company was unsure whether Sikes took his car into a Toyota dealer to comply with the recall , Lyons said .

People with vitiligo ' may have skin cancer protection '
One in 200 people have vitiligo People with the skin disease vitiligo may have natural protection against skin cancer , a study suggests .
The condition , affecting one in 200 , causes pale skin patches that lack pigment and burn easily - leading to an assumed increased risk of skin cancer .
But the University of London study of 4,300 people identified a common gene mutation that both increases the chance of vitiligo and cuts cancer risk .
The findings are reported in the New England Journal of Medicine .
However , study author Professor Dot Bennett , from St George 's , University of London , still warned : " Although this may provide some consolation for people with vitiligo , they should still be careful in the sun .
As they know , they sunburn quickly , and a lower risk of cancer does n't mean zero . "
Although this may provide some consolation for people with vitiligo , they should still be careful in the sun .
As they know , they sunburn quickly , and a lower risk of cancer does n't mean zero
Professor Dot Bennett , study author
The findings , reported in the New England Journal of Medicine , emerged from genetic testing of 1,514 patients with vitiligo and 2,813 without .
Seven genes in total were identified that were linked to vitiligo .
Some 70 % of the general population had the combination that increases the risk of vitiligo while reducing the risk of malignant melanoma , the most serious form of skin cancer .
The remaining 30 % had a different version that raises melanoma risk while lessening the chances of vitiligo .
Although everyone has one of the two variants , neither guarantees that either vitiligo or melanoma will actually develop .
Likewise , neither guarantees protection , the study added .
The genes identified were already associated with auto - immune conditions such as type 1 diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis and lupus .
This prompted suggestions the research may even lead to improvements in treatment for vitiligo .
There is currently no cure although the condition can be managed through steroid creams and treatment with ultraviolet light .
But the study said future therapy may involve some element of " calming down immune response " .

Are you a Creationist ?
Or an Evolutionist ?
Itâ€™s a legitimate question .
Creation and evolution are more than just theories on the origins of life on earth .
They also reveal truths about justification and sanctification everyone should understand .

Like any car enthusiast , I often find myself scouring eBay Motors for cars and trucks that I can’t have .
While doing so , I stumbled onto a fleet of Jaguars that looked noteworthy .
Apparently they were collected between 15 - 25 years ago , and have n’t really been touched since .
The thing that I find most impressive is that a bunch of them are “ racked ” up high in a warehouse of some sort .
You need to be a truly dedicated & motivated gearhead for those kinds of shenanigans .
I mean how cool would it be to be able to look up at project cars while you work on others ?
Anyway , the starting bid is $ 200,000 , so get out your wallets .
Here is what the auction includes along with misc parts :

[ digg- reddit - me ] Brent Bozell :
I have said many times that the greatest opposition to the Left can be found in conservative talk radio and every major conservative talk show host should concern himself , or herself , with what inevitably will be ferocious personal attacks …
It was only a matter of time before Sean Hannity would find himself with a big , fat target on his forehead , too .
Now that he is set to launch his new book , Conservative Victory , the left is going out of its way to smear him …
It ’s time for conservatives to rally around this man .
He is being attacked personally not just because he ’s trying to do something good for our military , but because he ’s got a message to tell America in this book , and the Left wants him stopped — by any means necessary .
We cannot allow them to succeed with this campaign of character assassination .
[ my emphases ]
I was curious as to what Hannity had been accused of – and Bozell did n’t think that either explaining that or providing a link to that would be relevant .
He did include a link to a refutation of the charges which did link to the source of these allegations – namely that Sean Hannity “ improperly benefited from [ the charity ]
Freedom Alliance by charging private jets , hotel stays and luxury cars ” and that the charity provided few benefits to the groups it was supposed to be benefiting , apparently children of fallen soldiers and injured soldiers .
Damn leftists , hating on soldiers !
But lo and behold the accuser is one Debbie Schlussel , “ Conservative political commentator , radio talk show host , columnist , and attorney . ”
A few isolated blog posts on the left have discussed this issue .
Following the links provided by Bozell and other conservatives blaming the left for this , I found a 2006 NewHounds story criticizing the charity but not alleging any illegality , a Daily Kos story from 2007 , a user post in True Slant from last week reporting on and evaluating Schlussel ’s claims , and a Huffington Post news story documenting Schlussel ’s allegations , a veterans ’ group ’s allegations regarding marketing practices of the charity , and a liberal watchdog ’s allegations regarding the charity .
The substance of the liberal complaints seems to be that the organization promoted concerts saying “ 100 % ” of donations made to a scholarship fund would go to scholarships – but that they ask the donations be made to the broader organization , leaving a much smaller amount of money going to the scholarship fund than the advertisements suggest .
These allegations were made some years ago .
Then Schlussel found them on her own and added a few allegations about impropriety by Sean Hannity – prompting a few liberal groups to make complaints .
In other words : A conservative attacked Sean Hannity and accused him of specific malfeasance .
Some liberal groups have complaints about the organization ’s marketing brought to light by the conservative ’s complaints .
Bozell asks his readers to rally against the left in defense of Sean Hannity .
In Bozell ’s defense , misleading his readers is probably easier ( and more effective ) than trying to explain the issues and evaluate what ’s going on , as this is how our politics now works : building coalitions based on ressentiment .
N.B. I sent a message to Bozell asking him for a comment – but he gave none .

Die Massen - Speicherung von Telefon - und Internetdaten zur Strafverfolgung ist unzulässig .
Das Bundesverfassungsgericht in Karlsruhe entschied am Dienstag , dass die Vorratsdatenspeicherung gegen die Verfassung verstößt .
Sie ist dem Urteil zufolge mit dem Telekommunikationsgeheimnis unvereinbar .
[ Update : Der Grundsatz der Verhältnismäßigkeit wird aus Sicht der Verfassungsrichter nicht gewahrt .
Außerdem mangele es an einer Sicherheit für die Daten und es gebe keine konkreten Angaben , wofür die Daten gebraucht werden sollen .
Ferner kritisierten die Richter eine mangelnde Transparenz des Gesetzes .
Das Karlsruher Urteil schließt eine Speicherung der Daten jedoch nicht generell aus .
Die deutschen Verfassungsrichter stellten nicht die Zulässigkeit der EU - Richtlinie in Frage , die Grundlage für das Gesetz in Deutschland ist .
Bei der Speicherung handele es sich aber " um einen besonders schweren Eingriff mit einer Streubreite , wie sie die Rechtsordnung bisher nicht kennt " .
Darum müsste ein derartiger Eingriff an strengste Bedingungen geknüpft werden .
Diese Voraussetzungen erfüllt das deutsche Gesetz laut dem Urteil nicht . ]
[ 2 . Update : Das Bundesverfassungsgericht hat die Vorschriften der Paragraphen 113 a und b TKG sowie 100 g Abs. 1 Satz 1 StPO im Hinblick auf die Erfassung von Verkehrsdaten insgesamt für nichtig erklärt .
Das Gericht präzisiert dies in einer Pressemitteilung noch : " Demzufolge können die Vorschriften auch nicht in eingeschränktem Umfang übergangsweise weiter angewendet werden , sondern verbleibt es bei der gesetzlichen Regelfolge der Nichtigerklärung . "
Für die Speicherung der Vorratsdaten fehlt damit eine gesetzliche Grundlage , die Speicherung ist also einzustellen , die erhobenen Daten unverzüglich zu löschen . ]
Die mündliche Verhandlung zu den Klagen gegen die Vorratsdatenspeicherung fand am 15 .
Dezember 2009 statt .
Nachdem das Gericht in der Vergangenheit Sicherheitsgesetze der Regierung deutlich beschränkt hat , war die Frage , ob die Richter einen ähnlichen Weg gehen – oder ob sie die Speicherung komplett für verfassungswidrig erklären .
In Eilentscheidungen hatten sie die Massen - Speicherung von Telefon - und Internetdaten zwar vorerst gebilligt , deren Nutzung zur Strafverfolgung aber deutlich eingeschränkt .
Nach dem Gesetz werden seit 2008 Verbindungsdaten aus der Telefon- , Mail - und Internetnutzung sowie Handy - Standortdaten sechs Monate lang gespeichert .
Abrufbar sind sie für Zwecke der Strafverfolgung sowie der Gefahrenabwehr .
Im umfangreichsten Massenklageverfahren in der Geschichte des Gerichts hatten fast 35.000 Bürger Beschwerde gegen das seit 2008 geltende Gesetz eingelegt , das eine EU - Richtlinie umsetzt .
Es gibt drei Klägergruppen .
Eine von ihnen vertritt der FDP - Politiker Burkhard Hirsch .
Der Berliner Rechtsanwalt Meinhard Starostik vertritt rund 34.900 Kläger .
Der Grünen - Politiker Volker Beck hat mit mehr als 40 Abgeordneten seiner Partei Beschwerde eingelegt .
Über gut 60 Verfahren wurde im vergangenen Dezember in Karlsruhe exemplarisch verhandelt .
Der Vorsitzende des Bundestags - Innenausschusses , Wolfgang Bosbach , hatte vor der Urteilsverkündung im ARD - " Morgenmagazin betont : " Es geht nicht um Übermut des Gesetzgebers , der Bürgerrechte einschränken will .
Die Nutzung von Telekommunikationseinrichtungen wird heute immer stärker zur Begehung und Planung von Straftaten genutzt . "
Der FDP - Innenexperte Hirsch sagte im Bayerischen Rundfunk : " Ich bin der festen Überzeugung , dass die jetzige Regelung verfassungswidrig ist und ich glaube , dass das Verfassungsgericht auch so entscheiden wird . "
Dem Radiosender NDR
Info sagte Hirsch : " Ich denke , dass der Staat jetzt schon die Möglichkeit hat , die Verbindungsdaten dann nachzuforschen und zu prüfen , wenn er gegen einen Bürger einen konkreten Verdacht hat . "
Die Grünen - Vorsitzende Claudia Roth hatte vor der Urteilsverkündung gesagt : " Man hat den Eindruck , dass der Staat sich mehr und mehr als Krake und Nimmersatt geriert . " ( anw )
No really , he said that yesterday .
Nothing like railing against Washington when you and your political party run it !
Here is the relevant , gag - inducing paragraph :
As we were driving in , I was saying , boy , it 's just good to be back in the Midwest , this is about as close as I 've been to home in a while .
And part of the reason it 's just good to be back is because Washington is a place where tax dollars are often treated like Monopoly money — they 're bartered and traded , and they 're divvied up among lobbyists and special interests , and where waste — even billions of dollars of waste — is accepted as the price of doing business .
When we proposed , by the way , those $ 20 billion in cuts last year , we were ridiculed by the press , said , " Ah , that 's just a spit in the bucket . "
Now , I do n't know about here in St. Charles , $ 20 billion , that 's real money , is n't it ?

HANGIN ' WITH DR .
LINUS
Same Song , Different Verse
Dr. Linus was relegated to detention supervisor instead of focusing on his pet project , the History Club – much in the same way that Island Ben was forced to pay undue attention to the pre-natal fatality issue instead of serving and protecting the Island .
Dr. Linus did n’t believe in , trust or care to follow his supervisor ( Principal Reynolds , who was focused more on budgets than beakers ) much in the same way that Island Ben could n’t buy into Charles Widmore ’s ruthless leadership style .
John Locke was “ substituting ” for Richard Alpert as the “ teacher ” who encouraged Ben ’s usurpation of his superior .
Ben used the sexual indiscretion of his superior as a wedge with which to supplant him .
Charles Widmore ’s off - Island affair was Principal Reynolds nurses ’ office tryst .
When Alex told Ben about this , I could n’t help but hear Ralph Wiggum say , “ Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me . ”
And in the most obvious example , Ben has a sincere , caring , fatherly relationship with Alex , despite an absence of biological connection .
On the Island , she ’s his “ daughter . ”
Off it , she ’s his prized student .
A Change of Plans
THE VARIABLE
Well then .
Now that we ’re super famous , I ’d better make this good .
If you ’re just joining us , I ’m going to recap last night ’s LOST offering , “ Dr. Linus , ” an episode that featured the best alternate reality storyline thus far , some killer Locke moments , a faithless Richard and Nudie Magazine Day .
Maggie did n’t love it .
I thought it was awesome .
Allow me to try to prove her wrong …
Last night ’s Island story began with Ben in a very Jack - ala - Season - One position : lying prone in the jungle , terrified .
He somehow survived Smokey ’s wrath in the Temple ( which I do n’t think is a coincidence because , well , this is LOST ) , and he tells Ilana , Frank , Sun and Miles that Sayid has killed Temple Headmaster Dogen , and Lennon , the Assistant ( to the ) Regional Other .
Of more importance , Miles uses his sixth sense to indict Ben as Jacob ’s killer , thus spinning Ilana into a new dimension of vengeful and pissed off .
Miles gets the line of the night here for his sarcastically - ominous , “ Uh oh ! ” which , for me , instantly recalled this classic Stewie moment from Family Guy ( the parallel happens at the :35 mark ) .
The happy travelers settle on a beachfront property , determining it the safest place to regroup .
Sun ( who somehow gets worse at acting every week ) pleaded with Ilana to find Jin .
Finally , we have a third party who is interested in making this reunion happen , as Ilana revealed that she was still tasked with protecting the candidates , of which Sun , Jin or both are still possibilities .
( Remember , the name on the cave and wheel simply said “ Kwon , ” and did n’t clarify which . )
Hopefully , Ilana ’s involvement will expedite a resolution of the Jin and Sun story , if only to spare us more scene - killing lines from Sun.
Ilana also confirmed that there are only six candidates remaining : Jack , Sawyer , Kwon , Hurley , Sayid and Locke , who she is apparently not counting out of the race quite yet .
Quick side note : did you notice what Ben found amidst Sawyer ’s old stash ?
No , not the issue of Badonkadonk Quarterly .
The other piece of literature .
It was “ The Chosen , ” by Chaim Potok .
Wikipedia informs us that , “ The Chosen ' tells the story of the friendship between two Jewish boys growing up in 1940 ’s Brooklyn .
Reuven Malter , who has a mind for mathematics , wants to become a rabbi and follows modern methods of studying Judaism .
Danny is a genius son of a Hasidic Rabbi , Reb Saunders , who expects him to take over his position as tzaddik eventually . ”
A predestined position of authority over a given people who follow with steadfast reverence ?
Methinks this makes a must - have addition to our summer reading list .
Meanwhile , on the other side of the Island , Jack contemplated his next move while visions of cheese curds danced in Hurley ’s head .
Begrudgingly , Hurley agrees to follow Jack back to the Temple , but not without a few attempts at obstruction .
They ’re subverted quickly , though , by the sudden appearance of Richard , who looks markedly different .
No , he still does n’t age .
But his haggard visage , his breathless , desperate instructions and his general listlessness were the marks of a man who had lost his faith .
And that ’s exactly what ’s happened to Richard .
As he later explained , he wants to die , because Jacob – the man he had followed for a majority of his ( unusually long ) life – was dead .
And when Jacob died , so did Richard 's chances for purpose , meaning , answers and direction .
The ageless wonder was now destined to an eternal life of meaninglessness , and he did n’t want to end up like the Man in Black – imprisoned in a hellish nightmare for the unforeseeable future with no purpose .
To that end , Richard takes Jack and Hurley to the Black Rock , hoping they ’ll assist him in his grizzly goal .
Why ca n’t he just kill himself ?
Because Jacob touched him , and Jacob ’s people are apparently not allowed to commit suicide .
( Side note : was Michael ( who also could n’t commit suicide ) blessed by Jacob ? ) .
Someone should write an essay on different cultural and religious attitudes toward suicide and what they might reveal about LOST .
Someone .
Not me .
I ’m busy .
Richard went on to explain that the “ gift ” of life from Jacob was really more of a curse .
Additionally , Richard dropped a hint that the Black Rock was his place of origin , saying , “ Of all the time I ’ve spent on this Island , today ’s the first time I ’ve ever come back . ”
I expect confirmation of this – one way or another – sooner than later , but I actually have an inkling that Richard ’s presence on the Island predates that of the Black Rock , which crashed there in the 19th century .
Eventually , Richard gets around to that whole assisted suicide bit , asking Jack to light a long fuse attached to some Black Rock dynamite and then run away .
Jack surprisingly obliges , but does n’t take Richard up on the second half of the offer .
Instead , he stays with Richard for a chat .
After lighting the fuse , they discuss Jack ’s purpose , and what Jack found at Jacob ’s lighthouse .
As the fuse shortens and the tension mounts , Jack ’s becomes almost maniacally convinced that he ’s invincible in this situation .
Faith - shaken Richard is n’t so sure , but just as the dynamite is about to be ignited , the fuse dies .
And Jack and Richard do not .
So Richard , now malleable and suggestible , decides to follow his new Man of Faith , Jack , back to the beach .
Or as Jack put it , “ back to where we started .
” Before Richard , Jack and Hurley can arrive , Ben Linus has some work to do on the beach .
Namely , he ’s been tasked by Ilana to dig his own grave .
Which she will soon fill .
With his body .
After she kills him .
And you think your job sucks .
Ben holds court with Frank , and even quickly invokes Faraday ’s “ Whatever happened , happened ” theory when Frank tells him that he was originally supposed to fly Oceanic 815 .
When Frank imagines how different his life would ’ve been had he not overslept that morning , Ben counters with the assertion that , “ The Island still got you in the end , did n’t it ? ”
This was a nice little nod to the idea of course correction – something I ’ll touch on later in my discussion of the alternate reality story .
As Ben digs into his grave , Miles digs into Ben ’s fragile psyche with the emotional dagger of a revelation that Jacob “ was hoping he was wrong ” about Ben right before Ben plunged that dagger into him .
At this point , I knew Ben was n’t going to die .
It was a confirmation that Ben was n’t done being important .
Not yet .
And if you needed further proof of that , guess who showed up next ?
FLocke , who played to Ben ’s feelings of worthlessness by suggesting that , when FLocke and his followers found escape , Ben would be a great candidate for Island Protector .
“ Hey , you want this Island ?
I ’m not doing anything with it . ”
FLocke essentially reiterated the insinuations that Jacob made about Ben ’s diminished importance last season , telling the downtrodden Linus that once he was done with Island , the table scraps were all his .
But hey , a purpose is still a purpose .
And Ben took the bait , with the intention of joining Team Flocke on Hydra Island for further instructions .
But after luring Ilana into the jungle and training a well - placed rifle right between her eyes , Ben Linus finally broke down .
He told Ilana that he killed Jacob because Jacob had robbed him of a meaningful life .
He explained that he had sacrificed his daughter – and everything else he loved – in the name of Jacob and the Island .
But Jacob did n't even care .
He went on to describe Ilana ’s “ father figure ” as a superficial , callous , uncaring manipulator .
When he stabbed Jacob , he was “ so angry , confused and terrified that I was about to lose the only thing that had ever mattered to me : my power .
But the thing that really mattered was already gone . ”
You could see these words pierce through Ilana , as she began to see chinks in the armor of her once - infallible leader , Jacob .
And in a rare moment of weakness , she caved .
She told Ben he did n’t have to settle for the exploitative acceptance that Locke was offering ; that she would take him in .
Things are n’t good right now for Jacob .
Last week , his two lead protectors were murdered by Sayid .
This week , his two most fervent admirers lost their faith in him .
First Richard , then Ilana .
And that ’s after he lost Ben ’s trust last season .
It would seem that our initial inkling to characterize Jacob as “ good ” and the Man in Black as “ evil ” was premature .
I maintain that their morality is not so black and white .
Both have good and bad qualities , as well as competing and morally ambiguous motives .
But I think the lesson here is to ask questions .
To not buy any one thing part - and - parcel – whether it ’s a person , an institution or a belief .
If that ’s the worldview that LOST ’s creators are purporting , it may seem like a cynical one .
But it ’s utilitarian realism at its finest : if the entity you idolize can’t truly improve your life , are they really worth sacrificing for ?
Last night , Richard and Ilana joined Ben in saying , “ Hell no .
” So as this darker portrait of Jacob emerges , we have to reexamine everything about him .
For instance : I would n’t have guessed that Jacob would align himself with one of the Island ’s most tarnished and flawed leaders .
But lo and behold , last night ended with the arrival of just such a man , Charles Widmore , in a submarine .
And remember , it was Jacob who warned that someone was coming to the Island .
Are we to believe that Jacob knew it was Charles ?
If so , Jacob ’s squeaky white clean garb has just been further besmirched .
Charles Widmore disgraced his people with an off - Island affair , and was banished by Ben Linus .
So why would Jacob want him back ?
Then again , Ben Linus ai n’t exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world .
Perhaps his exile of Widmore was misguided , and Jacob is now making amends by allowing Charles to return .
It all points back to the ambiguity of the motives and methods of the Island ’s keepers .
But Charles Widmore is at one knot and closing , and I can’t wait to see where this thing ends up .
I loved the alternate reality universe last night .
Loved it .
A warped - mirror Ben Linus , high school politics , an uncharacteristically attractive Alex Rousseau .
I mean , dude , we even got some Arzt on us .
The thing that struck me about Dr. Linus ’ life was how closely it mirrored every major element of his on - Island life .
In fact , right from the start , when Dr. Linus began by uttering the words , “ It was on this Island that everything changed , ” you knew this story arc was going to be a big , juicy metaphor .
Ben continued lecturing on Napoleon Bonaparte , saying , “ Exile was n’t the worst of his fate .
What was truly devastating to him was the loss of his power …
He might just as well have been dead . ”
Right .
What other vertically - impaired leader on an Island could this describe ?
Hell , even the assignment on the blackboard pointed to Ben ’s alternate shenanigans .
It said , “ Places to locate . ”
Here ’s some more :
The list goes on , people .
Hell , Ben even gassed his father in both storylines .
Except last night , the gas was used to save Roger Linus , not kill him .
Side note : Roger ’s revelation that , in this reality , they still go to the Island but choose to leave , was really interesting .
It ’s confirmation that the Island still existed , Dharma - and - all , but that Roger and Ben just left .
What happened differently in this iteration of the story to prevent Ben from seeking solace from Richard and the Others and ultimately massacring his own people ?
Again , I ’ll get to that later .
Do n’t you like when I say that ?
Over - promise , under - deliver .
That ’s how I roll .
But while all of Dr. Linus ’ life played out like a cover band reprising Island Ben ’s greatest hits , one song definitely sounded out - of - key , right ?
In this reality , Ben confronts his superior with the damning evidence of misdeeds that could lead to his demise .
But Principal Reynolds counters with a threat of his own : to prevent Alex ’s admittance into Yale .
Once again , Ben ’s loyalty to Alex was tested .
Would Ben once again choose to sacrifice
Alex to satisfy his own ambitions ?
Surprisingly , no .
This time , Ben took the high road , selflessly bowing out of his blackmail request and paving the way for Alex to get a kick - ass letter of recommendation from Principal Reynolds .
Interesting .
Dr. Linus – disguised as a ruthless , cardigan - clad history teacher – seemed destined to emulate his alternate Island self .
But when it came time to act in the best interest of the little girl he can’t help but love , he actually chose her over himself .
He did n’t spare her from Keamy ’s gun , but he did spare her from Principal Reynolds ’ spiteful wrath .
How was alternate reality Ben ( Dr. Linus ) suddenly imbued with this sense of goodness ?
For the answer , I ’ll turn to Daniel Faraday .
Whatever happened , happened .
You go back in time and you know how certain events will unfold .
But no matter how much you try to change them , you can ’t .
Because the universe has a way of course - correcting itself , and whatever is supposed to happen , will happen .
This was the battle cry of Faraday and his mother , Eloise Hawking , for a long time .
Last night , we saw Ben live that out .
It seemed his life was destined to present him with a certain set of challenges – whether they be set on a mystical Island or a public high school .
But last season , Daniel Faraday revised his socio- mathematical theory just a little bit .
He said that while certain important milestones were unavoidable , we did have the ability to change how they happened .
Or as he explained it to Jack : “ Whatever happened , happened .
All right ?
But then I finally realized ...
I had been spending so much time focused on the constants , I forgot about the variables .
Do you know what the variables in these equations are , Jack ?
Us .
We 're the variables .
People .
We think .
We reason .
We make choices .
We have free will .
We can change our destiny .
” That ’s it .
In the cosmic equations of our lives , certain events , people , feelings and predispositions are inevitable .
They are the constants in our personal equations .
For Ben , this includes everything I mentioned above that was common to his on - Island and Dr. Linus realities ( trouble with an authority figure , relegation to meaninglessness , a connection to Alex , a desire to dethrone those in charge in order to take power , etc . ) .
But , like Faraday , perhaps we focused too much on the constants and not enough on how our own free will can drastically alter the circumstances of our pre-ordained realities .
Last night , Dr. Linus altered the variable in his equation slightly .
He chose , on his own free will , to be selfless instead of selfish .
He chose to spare Alex , instead of sacrifice her .
And maybe this “ variable ” theory explains why Ben and Roger are off the Island in this iteration of time .
Whatever anger and vengeance Ben felt toward his father on the Island – this time he reacted to it differently and chose not to let it lead him to a dark place .
Or maybe Roger , in this iteration of time , chose not to hold Ben accountable for his mother ’s death .
Just a thought .
So the lessons of time travel constants and variables can be applied to the more relatable human experience .
For LOST , that carries heavy implications .
Specifically , Jacob has said that people have to “ want ” to do something .
He told Hurley that Jack had to discover what his purpose was on his own , that he could n’t be told .
He told Hurley , in the taxi cab , that he did n’t have to do anything he did n’t want to – that the decision to get on Ajira 316 was his and his alone .
In fact , it seems Jacob ’s entire philosophy centers on getting certain people to select the correct variables ; that is , to make decisions of their own accord .
But Jacob has motives .
He wants people to make the decisions that ultimately serve his grand purpose .
Based on what we know thus far , that purpose involves finding a replacement for his role as Protector of the Island .
So Jacob must prove that man is capable of progress using nothing but his own free will .
But the Man in Black believes that free will is man ’s downfall .
Will LOST choose to name a winner of this argument ?
That ’s a fairly deep discussion , and an ambitious one for a TV show to take on .
But in the end , maybe the show is intended to make us form our own opinions about this debate .
Ironically , the answer to this question in LOST might rely on our own free will to decide for ourselves .
Namaste .

Firefox is on a decline .
It may not be as steady as Internet Explorer 's death spiral , and it certainly has not been going on for as long , but if the last three months are any indication , Firefox will never hit that 25 percent market share mark that looked all but certain just a few short months ago .
Meanwhile , Chrome is still pushing steadily forward ; in fact , it was the only browser to show positive growth last month .
Between January and February , Internet Explorer dropped a significant 0.60 percentage points and Firefox slipped 0.18 percentage points .
Chrome jumped a sizeable 0.41 percentage points to 5.61 percent of the market while Safari fell 0.06 .
Opera , on the other hand , dipped from 2.38 percent to 2.35 percent , though we 're still hoping version 10.5 will turn things around for the browser .
Data source : Net Applications
As you can see from the chart above , Firefox 's decline is quite noticeable , and this is the first time in recent months that the browser has fallen three straight months in a row .
Keeping that in mind though , the cumulative drop has not yet even reached a full percentage point , so Firefox can always reverse this trend .
Mozilla failed to gain market share after the release of Firefox 3.6 two months ago ; the new version has 5.16 percent of the market already , meaning it will easily pass all of Chrome this month .
To fight back , Mozilla may have to start advertising its browser as much as Google does Chrome ( on Google.com , YouTube.com , and so on ) or even striking distribution deals with OEMs like Google did with Sony in September 2009 .
Data source : Net Applications
In contrast to Firefox , Internet Explorer 's decline is a much more noticeable trend .
Nevertheless , IE is still used by more than half of all users and since the start of 2010 , IE8 was being used by one in four users on the Web .
The importance of having a default browser on the dominant operating system is still the biggest factor in browser adoption .
IE7's decline is actually much faster than IE6's , which is unfortunate , and can be attributed to businesses still using customized intranet applications as well as the fact that XP 's share is much bigger than Vista's .
We think the debut of IE9 should shake things up a bit .
With Microsoft beginning to roll out the browser ballot in the EU , the months ahead are likely to see some more significant market share fluctuations .
Some users who know nothing but IE will be confronted with other browsers for the first time , and it's all but certain many of those will give one of the other options a spin , if only out of curiosity .
Do n't be surprised if IE sees a sharper market share drop in the months ahead .
You can see the market share pie for February 2010 , according to Net Applications , at the top of this post .
The graph just above shows how things at Ars are very different : Firefox continues to dominate , but the default browsers for Windows and Mac OS X still show their strength , and Chrome 's lead over Opera is much more significant at Ars.
Compared to last month , Firefox gained share , while Safari and IE both dropped .
Meanwhile , Chrome gained , as did Opera .
Once again , Chrome 's gain was the biggest change .

What Disasters Are We Creating Now ?
No one could have known .
That ’s what they always say after a disaster .
Well , it ’s what the establishment — a good ’60s word , let ’s bring it back ! — says .
“ No one could have known ” is the perfect excuse .
Do n’t blame us , we did the best we could , but we ’re not clairvoyant .
But it ’s rarely true .
Most of the time , the people in charge — the people responsible for what went wrong — were warned in advance .
They simply chose to ignore the warnings .
Why ?
In the case of government officials and corporate executives , it ’s typically because acting on such warnings would cost them money .
Sometimes it ’s because the man or woman who predicts the mayhem about to unfold does n’t have the status , title or connections to make themselves heard .
Mostly it ’s because scum rises to the top .
After hurricane Katrina destroyed New Orleans , Homeland Security secretary Michael Chertoff called the disaster “ breathtaking in its surprise . ”
“ That ‘ perfect storm ’ of a combination of catastrophes exceeded the foresight of the planners , and maybe anybody ’s foresight , ” Chertoff said .
It did n’t surprise everyone .
“ We certainly understood the potential impact of a Category 4 or 5 hurricane ” on New Orleans , Lt. General Carl Strock , chief of engineers for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , ” said the same week .
I had attended a journalists ’ convention in New Orleans a few years before that .
Probably half the New Orleans residents I met asked me to write about the “ big one ” that was sure to devastate their city someday .
Except for those who later claimed that nobody could have known , everybody knew .
Harry Markopolos , a Boston financial analyst , has a book out ( title : “ No One Would Listen ” ) detailing the eight years he spent trying to convince the SEC to go after Bernard Madoff , who was responsible for the disappearance of $ 65 billion .
The financial collapse that began in the fall of 2008 was attributable to the burst of the housing bubble , fiscal shenanigans at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and the longstanding practice of allowing investment banks to hire and fire rating agencies .
Economists , corporate insiders , and journalists had repeatedly warned about these problems since at least 2004 .
They were ignored , even ridiculed by those who claimed a “ new paradigm ” was in effect in the U.S. economy .
From the lack of WMDs in Iraq ( Scott Ritter knew ) to the losing quagmire in Afghanistan ( I knew ) to the recent mine disaster in West Virginia ( inspectors knew ) , nearly every calamity you can think of could have been avoided .
All the idiots in charge had to do was listen to the smart people who were n’t .
Adam Cohen writes in The New York Times : “ Predictions of disaster have always been ignored — that is why there is a Cassandra myth — but it is hard to think of a time when so many major warned - against calamities have occurred in such quick succession .
The next time someone is inclined to hold hearings on a disaster , they should go beyond asking why particular warnings were ignored and ask why well - founded warnings are so often ignored . ”
Cohen answers his own question , citing four causes for institutional resistance to doing the right / smart thing before it ’s too late : ideology ( reflexive thinking ) , change would threaten the powers - that - be , inertia , and incompetence .
No doubt , those factors all play a role .
I ’d like to add another : the fear to speak truth to power , which is intimately coupled with powers that tell truth to shut up .
In my long work history it was a rare workplace where management sought out new ideas , much less criticism .
It was rarer still that a contrarian voice was rewarded , much less heeded .
We see the same thing in politics .
Those who speak up are smacked down .
All too often , bosses and officials are insecure .
Worried more about losing face than doing a good job , they instinctively reject anyone and anything who threatens their prestige .
Better to lose a war than to lose face .
The problem is systemic .
As long as business schools crank out automatons and companies are willing to hire them , as long as voters reward the smarmiest and godliest over the straight - talkers , as long as playing it safe ( i.e. boring ) is valued more than taking chances , our society is going to keep screwing up .
And it ’ll all be perfectly avoidable .
Look around today .
What are we being warned about ?
Which smart people are we ignoring ?
They ’re everywhere .
Let ’s start with the economists who warn that the U.S. economy is at the end of its rope , that the federal government can’t keep increasing the deficit , that underpaying workers as the rich gets richer is a recipe for collapse and revolution .
For my money , the fact that we are ignoring the thousands of scientists who warn of rising floodwaters due to global warming , dust storms and mass famine due to excessive cultivation and overpopulation , and untold damage to our ecosystem as thousands of species go extinct , proves a terrible point :
As a society , we are nearly as stupid as our bosses and public officials .

Most travelers , whether adventurers or arm - chair tourists , are very familiar with Stonehenge , an ancient site in Wiltshire , England , best known for its unique megalithic circle of stones .
The term “ henge ” actually refers to the ditch and bank of earth that surrounds the stone circles , which date back to 2500 BC .
Stonehenge
Stonehenge is a popular site for locals and tourists both .
Its history remains largely unknown , leading to numerous theories about its construction and use .
These range from tales relating to King Arthur to an argument between a devil and a friar , and many more .
It is also a pilgrimage site for modern day druids and others interested in New Age beliefs .
What many do n’t realize is that Stonehenge is only one of a number of similar sites throughout the UK and Europe , where earthworks such as henges combine with stone circles or formations .
Avebury Henge and Stone Circles
Avebury is probably the second most famous henge site in the world , Like Stonehenge , Avebury is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and World Heritage Site .
The are very close ( about 20 miles or 32 km ) , as well , so if you visit Stonehenge , you can typically visit Avebury on the same day .
Avebury is approximately halfway between the towns of Marlborough and Calne .
The largest Avebury stone circle , the great outer circle , is older than the one at Stonehenge , dating back about 5000 years .
It originally had 98 standing stones , making Avebury one of the largest stone circles in all of Europe .
Other features in addition to the henge include long barrows , a causewayed enclosure , a stone avenue , and 3 stone circles .
Ring of Brodgar
The Ring of Brodgar is a stone circle in Scotland on the Mainland in Orkney , Scotland .
It stands on a small strip of land between two lakes , Loch of Stenness and and Loch of Harray .
The ring of stones originally had 60 large stones , but only 27 remain standing .
Legend maintains that Scandinavian inhabitants in Scotland called The Ring of Brodgar , “ Temple of the Sun ” , and several of the stones are marked with runic engravings left by the Nordic people .
“ One of The Devil ’s Arrows at Boroughbridge – geograph.org.uk – 1012380 ” by Terry Robinson – From geograph.org.uk
The Devil ’s Arrows
Near the River Ure at Boroughbridge in North Yorkshire , England are three naturally shaped stones known as The Devil ’s Arrows .
The unique grooves at the top of each stone were carved by years of rainfall .
The tallest stone stands 22 feet 6 inches high , taller than any of the stones at the more famous Stonehenge .
Legend tells that the stones were tossed by the devil at the nearby town of Aldborough , but fell short and landed at their present location instead .
It is believed that the site was originally home to five stones instead of the current three .
Another legend claims that walking 12 times around the stones anti-clockwise will raise the Devil .
“ The north section of the Rollright Stones – geograph.org.uk – 1411935 ” by Steve Daniels – From geograph.org.uk .
The Rollright Stones
The Rollright Stones are located on the border of Oxfordshire and Warwickshire in England .
The site consists of the Kings Men stone circle , the King Stone , and the Whispering Knights .
The Kings Men is a stone circle of 77 stones , made of oolitic limestone , that are heavily weathered , giving them a unique appearance .
The King Stone is a separate stone , across the road ( and in a different county ) from the Kings Men circle .
Its unique shape is n’t due to weather so much as a practice in the 1800s where people chipped off parts of the stone as a charm to ward away the devil .
The final structure , known as the Whispering Knights , is an arrangement of five upright stones about 400 yards from the Kings Men circle .

Beef produced in the United States contains dangerously high levels of natural and synthetic hormones , warns Dr. Samuel S. Epstein of the Cancer Prevention Coalition .
According to Epstein , more than half of all beef cows slaughtered in the United States each year have been treated with either the natural hormones estrogen , progesterone or testosterone , or the synthetic hormones melengesterol , trenbolone or zeranol .
Hormone - emitting pellets are implanted under each cow 's ear when it enters the feedlot , then again 50 days later .
After another 50 days , the cow is slaughtered .
The hormones cause the cows to rapidly put on weight , leading to approximately $ 80 more profit per animal .
"
Not surprisingly , but contrary to longstanding claims by the [ FDA ] and the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , residues of these hormones in meat are up to 20 - fold higher than normal , " Epstein said in a press release .
" Still higher residues result from the not uncommon illegal practice of implantation directly into muscle .
Furthermore , contrary to misleading assurances , meat is still not monitored for hormone residues .
" The FDA insists that hormone levels in U.S. beef are safe and normal , but does not require any testing to back up this claim .
According to Epstein , however , tests reveal that an eight - year - old boy eating two hamburgers in one day would be exposed to enough estradiol to increase his body 's levels of the hormone by 10 percent .
Exposure to external hormones is well known to increase the risk of cancer , reproductive dysfunction and other health problems .
" Increased levels of sex hormones are linked to the escalating incidence of reproductive cancers in the United States since 1975 - 60 percent for prostate , 59 percent for testis and 10 percent for breast , " Epstein said .
Women in the United States are five times more likely to get breast cancer than women in the European Community or other countries that have banned the production or importation of hormonal beef Sources for this story include : www.organicconsumers.org
Northrop Grumman Corp. said Monday that it was dropping out of the race for a $ 35 - billion Pentagon contract to build 179 aerial refueling tankers , leaving its rival Boeing Co. as the sole bidder for one of the largest military contracts in U.S. history .
The move could bring an end to the Pentagon ’s decade - long effort to replace its aging fleet of Eisenhower - era aircraft used to refuel U.S. fighter jets and bombers in mid-flight .
But it also represents a huge blow to California ’s struggling aerospace industry .
Northrop had said the contract award would have created more than 7,500 local jobs , even though the plane would have been assembled in Alabama .
Follow - on contracts could involve building 300 to 400 additional tankers valued at more than $ 100 billion over several decades .
The Century City defense contractor said it was abandoning the bid because it believed that the odds were stacked against its contender , a tanker based on the A330 commercial passenger jet built by European aircraft maker Airbus .
Advertisement
Northrop Chief Executive Wesley G. Bush said in a statement that the company was “ very disappointed ” at the specifications , which he said “ dramatically favors ” Boeing ’s smaller refueling tanker over Northrop ’s offering .
Chicago - based Boeing said last week that it was making a bid for the contract with an aircraft based on its 767 commercial jetliners , which is smaller than what Northrop would have offered .
The Pentagon ’s requirements “ now clearly favors the smaller tanker , ” Bush said .
Analysts said Northrop ’s move could help end the Pentagon ’s efforts to hand out a contract , which has been marred with delays and controversy since it was first put up for bid in 2001 .
The Pentagon has had to twice cancel contracts , first won by Boeing and then by Northrop .

“ There ’s one word to describe the history of this competition : Sordid , ” said Scott Hamilton , an aviation industry consultant in Issaquah , Wash .
“ It ’s been a complete national embarrassment . ”
Boeing won the first contract in 2004 , but it fell apart because of an ethics scandal that resulted in prison terms for a former senior Boeing executive and a former high - ranking Air Force official .
Despite facing political backlash , Ronald Sugar , Northrop ’s then - chief executive , decided to team up with Airbus parent European Aeronautic Defense & Space Co. to go after the contract when the Pentagon relaunched the competition in 2007 .
Northrop took home the contract in 2008 in a huge upset over incumbent Boeing , which had built all of the 415 tankers in the current fleet .

The decision was overturned after the Government Accountability Office found that the Air Force mishandled the yearlong competition by failing to credit Boeing for some of its proposed plane ’s capabilities .
The latest requirements were released Feb. 24 .
But Northrop in recent weeks complained that the so - called Request for Proposal , which outlines the terms for the tanker and how contenders would be judged , was slanted in favor of Boeing and its offering .
Still , Northrop ’s Bush said Monday that the company would not protest a contract awarded to Boeing .
“ While we feel we have substantial grounds to support a GAO or court ruling to overturn this revised source selection process , America ’s servicemen and women have been forced to wait too long for new tankers , ” Bush said .

Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn said the Pentagon was disappointed by Northrop ’s decision .
“ We strongly believe that the current competition is structured fairly and that both companies could compete effectively , ” Lynn said .
Loren Thompson , a defense policy analyst for the Lexington Institute , said Northrop ’s decision might have come down to math .
“ Wes Bush evaluates every opportunity by the numbers , ” Thompson said .
“ He did n’t see an opportunity here to reward the shareholders -- considering the way the [ Request for Proposal ] was written -- so he decided to walk away . ”
Advertisement
Bush has made significant changes at Northrop since taking over as chief executive in January .
On his first day on the job he announced that the company would be relocating its headquarters , which have been in Los Angeles since it was founded in 1939 , to the Washington , D.C. , area .
After Northrop spent about $ 200 million in the quest to capture its first contract , Bush did n’t think it was wise to spend an additional $ 100 million to go after a contract that seemed all but destined to go to Boeing , Thompson said .
The decision drew fire from some on Capitol Hill .
Sen. Richard C. Shelby ( R - Ala . ) , whose home state would have built the Northrop tankers , blamed the Air Force for Northrop ’s decision to drop out of the competition .
“ The Air Force had a chance to deliver the most capable tanker possible to our warfighters and blew it , ” Shelby said .
“ This so - called competition was not structured to produce the best outcome for our men and women in uniform ; it was structured to produce the best outcome for Boeing . ”
Advertisement
Sen. Patty Murray ( D - Wash . ) , a longtime Boeing supporter , said that despite the decision , “ Boeing still must bring a very competitive bid to the table that meets all the requirements the Pentagon has set forth . ”
But having only one offer could be bad for the taxpayer , said Michel Merluzeau , managing partner with aerospace consultant G2 Solutions in Kirkland , Wash .
Without any competition , Boeing could charge more for its tanker , he said .
“ From a price standpoint , it ’s a completely different animal , ” Merluzeau said .
“ It ’s a brand - new negotiation process .
The government has to talk to Boeing directly now . ”

InfoGear upgrades phone of the future
June 10 , 1999
Web posted at : 11:36 a.m. EDT ( 1536 GMT )
by David Needle
( IDG ) -- Last year , InfoGear Technology got plenty of oohs and ahs for its iPhone , a telephone that could let you surf the Web .
But the device 's slow modem , hard - to - read screen , and high price did n't attract many buyers -- only about 15,000 active users , according to InfoGear Chief Executive Officer Ed Cluss .
Enter the new iPhone , which addresses the most common complaints about the first model .
" This is the phone they should have built the first time out , " says analyst David Coursey , editor of the Coursey.com e-mail newsletter .
The iPhone features an integrated Web browser , tiltable 7.4 - inch gray scale touchscreen , an e-mail client , a 56 - kilobits - per - second modem , two phone jacks , a full duplex speaker phone , and a keyboard that slides under the phone to save space .
Hardware for a digital answering machine is also built in , although that functionality wo n't be available until later this summer via a software upgrade , available over the Internet .
The iPhone 's current fifth - generation software is much easier to install than PC software -- in fact , InfoGear says , there 's no real installation .
When a new application is available , an icon appears on the iPhone 's screen .
Press the icon and the new software is transferred to the system , a process that takes a minute and a half at most , according to Cluss .
InfoGear does n't set the price for the iPhone , but defers to its resellers .
For Internet service , InfoGear refers customers to Big Planet , but you can also go with your own service provider .
Big Planet is also InfoGear 's preferred online retailer ; it lists the iPhone for $ 299 , plus service plans .
Competition from cheap PCs ?
Even though the low end of the PC market is in the same price range as the iPhone , and threatening to drop further , Cluss says he is n't worried .
" The reason low - cost PCs are n't in more homes than they are already is ease of use and support issues , " says Cluss .
" People are worried about having to upgrade and breaking the PC .
We 're very focused on these issues and we 've tried to create a simple , reliable device . "
The market for information appliances like iPhone is set to explode , by some analysts ' reckoning .
" Consumers are looking to obtain the benefits of the Internet without the bulk , the complexity , and cost of the PC , " says Sean Kaldor , a vice president with research firm International Data Corporation .
" 1999 will be a formative year for Internet screen phones as numerous companies such as InfoGear come to market in response to consumers ' needs for fast , easy , and convenient access to the Internet . "
Not a WebTV wannabe
While some of the iPhone 's advantages sound a lot like a marketing pitch for WebTV -- it provides convenient , low - cost access to the Internet and e-mail -- Cluss says the iPhone addresses a different set of needs .
" PCs and TVs are things that people tend to sit down and watch for hours at a time , " says Cluss .
" The idea for the iPhone is that it sits in a heavily trafficked area of the house , like an entry way or the kitchen , and you typically will spend three to seven minutes on it , checking or sending off an e-mail , getting a weather report and so on . "
While WebTV tries to appeal to newbies , Cluss says most iPhone users already own a PC .
" The iPhone is for people who have an oven , " says Cluss , " and now they want a microwave . "
Cluss also argues the iPhone is a more private device because it lets you can dash off a short e-mail or read a message in private , whereas a desktop PC or a WebTV device uses a display that 's viewable by anyone in the room .
The iPhone can't handle streaming media or multimedia games .
" You can go anywhere you want to on the Internet using the iPhone , but you can't play Quake or run multimedia applications .
It was n't designed for that , " says Cluss .
While few people would expect every government policy to precisely reflect majority public opinion , it is hard to see what is democratic about a British foreign policy whose very fundamentals – agreed by both Labour and the Conservatives – are consistently opposed by voters .
Britain is not a totalitarian state .
It has regular elections and free speech , and its citizens have the freedom to organise politically .
So how is it that such a democratic deficit exists when it comes to the country 's role in the world ?
In February 2003 , more than 90 % of Britons opposed Tony Blair 's government joining the invasion of Iraq in the absence of a second UN resolution .
As we know , the invasion went ahead the following month without such a resolution being passed .
Three years later , 63 % thought Blair had tied Britain too closely to the Bush White House .
In the same poll , 61 % opposed the assault on Lebanon that Israel was undertaking at that time – an assault that was nevertheless effectively supported by Britain .
At present , both main parties plan to renew the Trident nuclear system , despite opposition from 63 % of voters .
Fifty - four per cent of Britons express support for the rule of international law yet , last week , Gordon Brown 's government began discussing " safeguards " to exempt suspected war criminals from the reach of British courts .
The de facto purpose of Britain 's foreign policy has traditionally been to advance the interests of various concentrations of social and economic power , not to reflect the will of the voting public .
Above all , it is the commercial interests of those best placed to influence the government that tend to be prioritised by policymakers .
This in turn is why Britain has supported the US - led maintenance of a global system seen as amenable to those commercial interests , and tried to maximise Britain 's influence within that system .
This picture needs to be placed in an historical context .
While we think of globalisation as a recent phenomenon , its roots go back to the imperial age of the 19th century .
Then , Britain presided not merely over an empire but over a global trading system , lubricated by credit from London 's banks , underwritten by its insurers , and imposed on weaker nations by military force .
The devastation wrought by the calamitous years of 1914 - 1945 dealt a fatal blow to the country 's capacity to perform this global management role .
The task was inherited by the US , whose view of how the world should be organised economically and politically was broadly consistent with that of British elites .
London therefore sought to protect its economic power and international status by placing itself close to Washington .
The instruction given by Blair 's chief of staff to Britain 's ambassador to the US , Sir Christopher Meyer , to " get up the arse of the White House and stay there " , was an expression of that longstanding policy .
At a time when taxpayers face spending a generation paying off the gambling debts of the City , the disproportionate influence of wealth over policymakers is not a difficult concept to understand .
This influence is exerted in myriad ways – some obvious , some less so .
Wealth is power .
It buys lobbying consultants , concentrates the minds of politicians in need of campaign donations , owns most of the media and is generally well - placed to make life easy or difficult for government depending to what extent its needs are being met .
The dividing line between public and private interests is in any case far from clear .
In a country with low social mobility , people in positions of state or corporate power are disproportionately likely to have come from wealthy backgrounds , and to have internalised the general values and outlook associated with that background .
The interests of this elite are diverse but broad consistency exists , and sets the framework for how the country is governed .
The public - private boundaries are particularly blurred when it comes to foreign policy .
As Anthony Sampson noted in his recent study of power in modern Britain , Who Runs This Place ? , " many [ British ] embassies now include temporary ' secondees ' from big corporations , including BP , Shell , banks and construction companies , who pay their salaries " .
Two years ago the Guardian reported that " the chief lobbyist of Britain 's biggest arms company [ BAE Systems ] was given an official security pass allowing him to wander freely around the Ministry of Defence " .
Access comes at all levels .
Sampson quotes former foreign secretary Robin Cook saying BAE 's chairman " appeared to have the key to the garden door to No 10 " , and that " certainly I never once knew No 10 to come up with any decision that would be incommodating to British Aerospace " .
Of Washington 's influence over Whitehall there is much that can be said , but one aspect is perhaps more telling than most .
Britain 's retention of an " independent nuclear deterrent " is probably the most obvious example of an attempt to bridge what the historian Paul Kennedy called " the divergence between Britain 's shrunken economic state and its overextended strategic posture " .
Yet British nuclear weapons have always been reliant on US management and technology .
The effect of this longstanding dependency is , in the words of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan 's permanent secretary , Sir Robert Scott , to " put us in America 's pocket " .
It is reasonable to assume that the 2004 renewal of the US - UK Mutual Defence Agreement was one factor in the minds of policymakers during the early years of the " war on terror " and in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq .
These are just some of the pressures that crowd the public 's voice out of decision - making .
Locating power and mapping influence with real precision is a complex task in relatively open societies like Britain's , and this article provides just a snapshot .
Nevertheless , evidence of a serious democratic deficit in British foreign policy is reasonably clear .
What remains then for the public is a choice : accept marginalisation , or use our political freedoms to change the balance of power .
I 'm a BBC employee , but these thoughts are my own and are not the official position of the BBC .
The BBC is world 's largest broadcaster .
We provide a wide variety of programming in a variety of areas .
For historical reasons , we collect a license fee from the public .
If you watch TV live in the UK , you currently have to pay £ 139.50 per year .
The UK Conservative and Unionist Party , more commonly known as the Conservatives , or Tory party , wants to force the BBC to give up part of its license fee to for - profit corporations which , unlike the BBC , can advertise to earn revenue .
Well , so what ?
What 's so special about the BBC that we should have a right to public money ?
Well , we have no intrinsic right to this money in the same way that , say , the police and fire departments do n't have an intrinsic right to public money .
However , like any public good , society cooperates to share certain resources for public gain .
The fee is mandatory if you watch TV live and that 's because voluntary cooperation leads to the free rider problem with public goods .
In other words , when you have a shared resource that everyone can enjoy regardless of whether or not they pay for it , then some ( sometimes many ) will refuse to pay for , particularly in times of economic hardship .
That 's why you pay taxes for police , even in a recession .
The presence of police will benefit you whether you 're paying taxes or not .
So the real question is , do we get what we 're paying for from the BBC ?
Just as a quick reminder , here are a few accomplishments of the BBC :
We were the world 's first national TV
We were doing radio relay from the US in 1924
In 1936 we launched the world 's first TV service , proving it was viable
1937 , we developed the first efficient speech microphone
1945 , " Woman 's Hour " was the first woman 's radio programme ( we already had the world 's first female radio announcer over a decade before )
1952 , we developed a video tape recorder
In 1962 , we were doing satellite broadcasting
1967 , we launched colour TV in the UK
1974 , we developed CEEFAX and gave subtitles to our programming .
1982 , we introduced the BBC Micro in an effort to bring computer literacy to schoolchildren
1995 Digital audio broadcasting
2007 iPlayer launched
People seem to forget that many of the communication initiatives in the UK came first from the BBC because we were able to take risks that a profit - driven organisation is less likely to take , or will take later after waiting to see if others become successful .
Many internal initiatives that we 're currently taking are fantastic things I want to see made public , but I can imagine that if I were to go to another media organisation , they'd be less likely to take those risks due to the cost .
Of course , most people do n't think about that .
They just care about watching telly or listening to the radio .
And what do we do there ?
Let John Cleese whinge about it .
So why do the Tories want to force us to give up part of our license fee ?
I do n't know .
Gosh , why would any politician want an organisation they have limited influence over to transfer power to profit - driven organisations whose corporate owners might hand that politician or their party lots of money or positive publicity ?
( Why would Republicans favour Fox over PBS ? ) .
One thing the Tories would like you to forget is that we 're already required to spend 25 % of our income on external suppliers and we exceed that amount .
So they want to force us to give up part of our license fee on top of our legal obligation to have a 25 % external spend .
I did n't hear that in the Tory speech I linked to above .
Inside the UK , we get beat up a lot by various media groups who are , to be fair , further right than we are .
( In fact , the Daily Mail is only a short step away from being the mouthpiece of the racist British Nationalist Party ) .
What people inside the UK often do n't seem to realise is the worldwide admiration for the BBC .
Many people outside the UK rely on the BBC to provide them " unfiltered " news they can't get elsewhere .
You 're simply not going to find profit - driven corporations forgetting what is needed to maintain that profit .
There are plenty of times you can read about major stories being toned down or eliminated due to concerns about advertisers pulling out .
Many people in the US are unaware of the history of PBS , a station which could have been the US counterpart to the BBC .
So what happened to them ?
In short , Richard Nixon .
Nixon was unhappy with the independent spirit of public broadcasting .
He felt they were too liberal and able to advocate for national causes that he did n't approve of .
As a result , in 1972 , he refused to sign H.R. 13918 , a bill which would have provided full funding for PBS .
That 's why many shows on PBS are " brought to you by the MAJOR CORPORATE INTEREST OF THE DAY " .
Specifically , he wrote :
There are many fundamental disagreements concerning the directions which public broadcasting has taken and should pursue in the future .
Perhaps the most important one is the serious and widespread concern -- expressed in Congress and within public broadcasting itself --- that an organization , originally intended only to serve the local stations , is becoming instead the center of power and the focal point of control for the entire public broadcasting system .
In short , public broadcasting should be about local interests , regardless of whether or not national issues fall within the scope of " public interest " .
PBS could have been so much more , but because it 's funded by taxes and major corporations and the periodic public begging for donations , it 's highly constrained in its ability to be independent .
Republicans are still trying to cut its funding further .
Right - wing news sources like Newsmax have pages describing why public funding for PBS should be eliminated .
PBS periodically refuses to show public interest content which might offend corporate interests who fund PBS .
In short , remaining independent is critical to ensure that the BBC is able to present innovative programmes and independent news and public interest stories .
The Tories want this independence to end .
Right - wing media in the UK would love to see us eliminated .
Yes , we present content that some people will find uncomfortable or unpleasant , but is the purpose of the BBC to present bland programming which does not provoke thought or debate ?
Is the role of the BBC constrained to not offending anyone ?
That 's an impossible goal .
As public and political attitudes shift , the BBC would have to constantly race to adjust all programming to be a bland morass of " feel good " shows which do little to make people think and does everything to avoid challenging their beliefs .
Many people argue that we already have 1984 in Britain .
Do we want Brave New World , too ?
For more background on how the media works , I highly recommend the book Unreliable Sources - A Guide to Detecting Bias in the Media .
Rather than have pundits tell you what is and is not biased .
Learn to recognise bias for yourself .
The BBC is not perfect , and perhaps our public funding does mean that we do n't present news which makes a white , heterosexual Christian world happy , but that 's what 's great about the BBC .
You may not always like it , but it 's going to make you think and it 's going to prompt debate .
UPDATE : CIA drone operators could be prosecuted for war crimes , lawyer tells Congress
The US ’s unofficial program of targeted killings against terrorist suspects could result in the CIA ’s drone operators being prosecuted for war crimes , a prominent law professor told a congressional hearing Wednesday .
Loyola Law School professor and former Navy officer David Glazier told a House foreign affairs subcommittee that , because CIA agents are not legally considered combatants in a war , the law could see them as being civilians who carried out killings .
ADVERTISEMENT
But “ the risks to US drone operators are at this point theoretical , ” writes Nathan Hodge at Wired.com .
“ Unless a judge in , say , Pakistan , wanted to issue a warrant , it does nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t seem likely . ”
Nor was there any explanation as to how foreign governments could learn the identities of CIA drone operators , another hurdle that would have to be cleared if any government wanted to launch a prosecution .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ It is my opinion , as well as that of most other law - of - war scholars I know , that those who participate in hostilities without the combatantÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s privilege do not violate the law of war by doing so , [ but ] they simply gain no immunity from domestic laws , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Glazier said , as quoted by Hodge .
“ Under this view , CIA drone pilots are liable to prosecution under the law of any jurisdiction where attacks occur for any injuries , deaths or property damage they cause .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Testifying before the committee , American University law professor Kenneth Anderson questioned why the CIA is involved at all in drone operations .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Why should the CIA , or any other civilian agency , ever use force ( leaving aside conventional law enforcement ) ?
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he said in prepared remarks .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Even granting the existence of self - defense as a legal category , why ever have force used by anyone other than the uniformed military ?
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
Human rights lawyer Joanne Mariner writes at CounterPunch that the issue of drone strikes has become more relevant because of the US military ’s increased reliance on them in recent months .
Mariner reports that while the Bush administration carried out 45 drone strikes in its entire eight years , the Obama administration carried out 53 in 2009 alone .
“ The pace of such attacks quickened even further in 2010 , ” she reports .

Targeted killings program could lead to ‘ foreign governments hunting and killing their enemies within our borders ’
The American Civil Liberties Union has sent a strongly - worded letter to President Barack Obama , asking him to end an alleged program that allows ‘ targeted killings ’ of terror suspects outside of war zones .
ADVERTISEMENT
In the letter ( PDF ) , the civil liberties group argues that the alleged program — which , according to news reports , is now targeting at least one US citizen — is unlawful and unconstitutional , and could set a dangerous precedent leading to foreign governments killing people on US soil .
“ The program that you have reportedly authorized appears to envision the use of lethal force not just on the battlefield in Iraq , Afghanistan , or even the Pakistani border regions , but anywhere in the world , including against individuals who may not constitute lawful targets , ” ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero stated in the letter .
“ The entire world is not a war zone , and wartime tactics that may be permitted on the battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq cannot be deployed anywhere in the world where a terrorism suspect happens to be located . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Romero ’s letter came the same day as a House foreign affairs subcommittee convened to probe the legal issues surrounding the use of targeted killings .
It also comes in the wake of a series of news reports suggesting the US ’s use of targeted killings has expanded significantly in recent months .
In February , Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair announced that the United States may target its own citizens abroad for death if it believes they are associated with terrorist groups .
“ We take direct action against terrorists in the intelligence community , ” Blair told the House Intelligence Committee .
He said US counter - terrorism officials may try to kill American citizens embroiled in extremist groups overseas with “ specific permission ” from higher up .
If “ we think that direct action will involve killing an American , we get specific permission to do that , ” Blair said .

Earlier this month , news reports indicated that Muslim cleric Anwar al - Awlaki , an American citizen , was added to the CIA ’s list of alleged terrorists the US has targeted to kill .
Al - Awlaki was born in New Mexico and served for years as an imam in the United States .
He has not been charged with a crime , but was linked by US officials to Maj .
Nidal Malik Hasan , the psychiatrist alleged to have killed 13 at an Army base in Fort Hood , as well as Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , the so - called “ Christmas day ” bomber who attempted to detonate a jetliner en route to Detroit .
“ Such a program of long - premeditated and bureaucratized killing is plainly not limited to targeting genuinely imminent threats , ” Romero wrote in his letter .
“ Any such program is far more sweeping than the law allows and raises grave constitutional and human rights concerns . ”
Romero argued that the alleged program could set a dangerous precedent for other nations , which could result in foreign governments killing US citizens on home soil .
ADVERTISEMENT
The program you have reportedly endorsed is not simply illegal but also unwise , because how our country responds to the threat of terrorism will in large measure determine the rules that govern every nationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s conduct in similar contexts .
If the United States claims the authority to use lethal force against suspected enemies of the U.S. anywhere in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ using unmanned drones or other means Ã¢â‚¬â€œ then other countries will regard that conduct as justified .
The prospect of foreign governments hunting and killing their enemies within our borders or those of our allies is abhorrent .
The ACLU is not alone in attacking the program as unlawful .
Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley said in February that the program raises serious questions .
“ This is something that President Bush developed , ” Turley explained .
“ We actually saw the Bush administration kill an American citizen named Kamal Derwish in 2002 with a Predator strike . …
The Obama administration , once again , seems to be morphing into the Bush administration . ”
TOKYO – Sick of the wife and kids ?
Time to throw the kitchen table at them .
Not really , of course !
That would be domestic violence !
However , you can act out this scenario harmlessly in a new arcade game called Cho Chabudai Gaeshi ! ( Super Table - Flip ! ) , released last fall by Taito .
For 100 yen , you can grab hold of a plastic table and flip it over , sending dishes and supper flying all over your bratty kids and henpecking wife .
Chabudai - gaeshi is used as a metaphor in the Japanese language .
Many gamers are familiar with it since Legend of Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma used it in a Game Developers Conference speech to describe what Shigeru Miyamoto would do to game design teams .
He 'd sometimes come in and disrupt the whole production process if he thought a game was n't going well , sending the team back to square one .
This was such a traumatic event that they likened it to a father flipping the tea table over , sending the whole family into disarray .
But anyway , the game itself is pretty simple – when the scenario begins , you can pound on the table with both hands to get your family 's attention and knock a few things off shelves .
As you cause things in the room to clatter to the floor , you score points .
When the game 's 60 - second timer nears its conclusion , you 'll want to grab the table - controller and send it flying .
Hinges keep it attached to the machine .
Four different scenarios are available : Besides the dad and kids , there 's a bride at a wedding , a guest at a host club and a frustrated office worker .
The interesting thing about the game design is how it tackles the central problem – that is , how do you create a full game experience around a concept that requires the player to do one single action , exactly one time ?
Cho Chabudai Gaeshi's answer is to build up the moment as much as possible , then replay the moment in several different ways after it happens .
We see the table - flipping in a freeze - frame , with Matrix - style camera rotation , allowing us to see the surprised expressions on everyone 's faces .
We see it from a side - on view to see the distance the table flew .
If we hit any of the bonus scoring areas – for example , clipping a mouse as it runs across the room – we see those in close - up .
A karaoke song about the table - flipping moment , with lyrics on screen , plays in the background .
All the ridiculousness of it definitely makes it worth the 100 yen ( about $ 1 ) price for a single play , although probably only once or twice .

As a cloud of skunky smoke wafted over a pro-marijuana rally across the street , lawmakers at the state Capitol on Tuesday battled over regulations for the medical - marijuana industry .
The debate inside , where the full state House ultimately passed a bill to create rules for marijuana dispensaries , focused largely on the nuts and bolts of the new regulations : licensing requirements , tax policy and signage rules .
The major changes the House made to the bill mostly rolled back concessions dispensary owners had won earlier in the legislative process .
Lawmakers restored language to the bill , House Bill 1284 , that would let local governments or local voters ban dispensaries in their communities .
They removed the ability for medical - marijuana patients to consume cannabis - infused products at dispensaries .
And they toughened criminal background - check requirements to bar anyone ever convicted of a drug - related felony from operating a dispensary .
At one point during the hours - long debate , a lawmaker argued against a proposal by saying it was unprecedented , to which Rep. Jack Pommer , D - Boulder , remarked : “ We ’re essentially setting up street - corner marijuana shops .
If the intent of this bill is not to break new ground , we ’ve already gone beyond that . ”
The bill still needs one more vote in the House before going to the Senate for debate .
The broader impact of the legislature ’s groundbreaking bill was most clear , though , across the street at Civic Center , where thousands of pro-legalization marijuana activists gathered for the annual April 20 rally , which this year took on a decidedly medicinal tone .
There were booths for dispensaries and fliers advertising doctor referrals and a speech by a researcher who specializes in the medical benefits of marijuana .
Legalization activists acknowledged how closely their cause has become entwined with the boom in medical marijuana , which has created not just new networks for activists but also legal revenue streams to fund them .
“ It has helped the legalization of marijuana 10,000 percent , ” said Richard Eastman , a medical - marijuana patient and cannabis activist from California who was one of the rally ’s speakers .
“ It ’s certainly familiarized the public to ( marijuana ) so it ’s not quite the villain they thought it was , ” said Dave Penny , a Colorado medical - marijuana patient at the rally .
Activists , though , said legalization proponents must be wary of riding medical marijuana ’s coattails too much , saying expanded medicinal access can only take their cause so far .
“ Medical marijuana does n’t get us there , ” Allen St. Pierre , the executive director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , told the crowd .
“ We have to change these laws .
We have to legalize marijuana . ”

Microsoft is going on the offensive against Google , accusing the search giant of creating a browser that does not respect user privacy .
The company posted a video , embedded below , on TechNet Edge with the following description : " Watch a demo on how Google Chrome collects every keystroke you make and how Internet Explorer 8 keeps your information private through two address bars and In Private browsing . "
Microsoft 's first criticism is Chrome 's combining the address bar and the search box into a single entry box ; IE8 keeps those fields separate .
" By keeping these boxes separate , your privacy is better protected and the addresses of the sites you 're visiting are n't automatically shared with Microsoft , or anyone else , " says IE product manager Pete LePage .
" As I start to type an address into the address bar , Fiddler [ a Web debugging proxy ] shows that for nearly every character I type , Chrome sends a request back to Google , " LePage says .
" I have n't even hit enter yet to load the website and Google is already getting information about the domain and sites I 'm visiting . "
Right after that , he shows how typing something in the address bar in IE8 is very different — nothing is shared with the search provider , according to LePage .
In the second part of the video , LePage demonstrates how Internet Explorer 8 has a privacy feature called InPrivate , a privacy mode to allow browsing without leaving a trace .
Unfortunately , he fails to acknowledge the existence of Google Chrome 's Incognito , which disables history tracking , which undercuts his argument .
It 's worth taking a closer look at LePage 's first accusation .
Even though he did n't really elaborate , the reason for the striking difference for IE8's and Chrome 's behaviors is really that simple : IE8 has two boxes and Chrome has one .
LePage makes an important mistake in his accusation against Google : his statement should not be " Chrome sends a request back to Google " but it should be " Chrome sends a request back to the search provider . "
He makes this distinction with IE8 but does not with Chrome .
The information is being sent so that the search provider can help the user choose a query right in their browser .
We downloaded Fiddler to make some comparisons of our own .
As we suspected , Chrome can be set to send information on every keystroke to Bing ( or any other search engine that supports Search Suggestions ) instead of Google .
The same behavior occurs in IE8 , but only in the search bar .
LePage is only correct in his assertion that IE8 does not send information to anyone when the user types into the address bar .
See for yourself : download Fiddler and type something into the address bar on Chrome and watch how Fiddler reacts when you have Search Suggestions on and off .
Then do the same in both IE8 fields .

Study area and sampling
The L'Atalante deep hypersaline anoxic basin ( DHAB ) was discovered in the Mediterranean Sea in 1993 during an expedition that was a part of the European funded project " Mediterranean Ridge Fluid Flow " .
The bottom of the L'Atalante basin is a relatively flat area bounded to the southwest by the Cleft Basin and it is characterised by a morphological escarpment that is several hundreds of metres high , which is the sea - bottom expression of the main back thrust of the accretionary ridge .
These characteristics originated from the dissolution of buried salt deposits ( evaporitic deposits ) , which remained from the hypersaline waters of the Miocene period ( 5.5 My before present ) .
The L'Atalante basin is characterised by the presence of a thick brine layer ( ca. 40 m ) with high density ( 1.23 g cm - 3 ) and high contents of Na+ ( 4,674 mM ) , Cl- ( 5,289 mM ) and Mg+ ( 410 mM ) [ 9 ] .
This layer limits the mixing with the overlying oxic deep - waters to only the upper 1 m to 3 m of the brine , and it additionally acts as a physical barrier for particles settling to the bottom sediments .
As a result , the inner part of the L'Atalante basin is completely anoxic since 53,000 yrs before present [ 32 ] and is characterized by elevated methane ( 0.52 mM ) and hydrogen sulphide ( 2.9 mM ) concentrations [ 9 ] .
Undisturbed sediment samples ( down to a depth of 30 cm ) were collected using a USNEL type box corer ( surface ca. 0.2 m2 ) , in 1998 , 2005 , 2006 and 2008 .
The samples from the DHAB sediment were collected in December 1998 ( at 3,363 m depth , 35°18.20 'N , 21°23.33'E ) , August 2005 ( at 3,600 m depth , 35°18.23 'N , 21°23.33'E ) , and June 2008 ( at 3,450 m depth , 35°18.18 'N , 21°23.35 'E ) .
In 1998 and 2008 additional sediment samples were collected outside the L'Atalante basin ( ca. 10 miles from the DHAB ; 35°11.84'N , 21°24.75 'E ) at ca. 3,250 m depth , for investigation of the characteristics of meiofaunal metazoans from the oxygenated adjacent systems ( three sampling sites per period with three to five replicated deployments per site ) .
In the northern - eastern Atlantic Ocean , oxygenated deep - sea sediment samples ( 55°29.87'N , 15°48.61 'W at 600 m depth ) were collected during the 2006 expedition .
Loriciferans retrieved from these sediments were used for the comparison of their body composition with loriciferan specimens collected in the anoxic sediments of the L'Atalante basin .
Sediments retrieved from the deep anoxic basin were immediately processed under strict anaerobic conditions .
Extraction and identification of benthic metazoans
For the extraction of metazoan fauna from the sediments , the samples ( top 15 to 20 cm of the sediment cores ) were pre-filtered through a 1,000 - μm mesh ( to remove larger debris ) , and a 20 - μm mesh was used to retain all of the multi-cellular organisms .
The fraction remaining on this latter sieve was re-suspended and centrifuged three times with Ludox HS40 ( density 1.31 g cm - 3 ) [ 33 ] .
All of the organisms isolated were counted and classified according to standard protocols [ 34 , 35 ] .
Only the organisms collected during the first expedition were stained with Rose Bengal ( 0.5 g L - 1 ) , a stain commonly used to highlight the body structures under light microscopy .
On average of all collected samples metazoan abundance was 2,075 ind. m - 2 in the L'Atalante sediments vs 21,548 ind. m - 2 in the oxygenated sediments surrounding the basin .
In the anoxic sediments of the L'Atalante basin , Loricifera accounted for 16.1 % of the total metazoan abundance .
No Loricifera were encountered in the oxygenated sediments surrounding the basin , where nematodes and copepods accounted for 95 % and 4 % , respectively , of the total metazoan abundance .
Identification of loriciferans to genus and species level with light and scanning electron microscopy
The extracted specimens were mounted on microslides in a drop of distilled water .
The water was progressively replaced by increasing glycerol concentrations ( 5 % , 10 % , 25 % , 50 % and 100 % vol water : vol glycerol ) .
Then the specimens were sealed with Glyceel .
The microslides were analyzed using a light microscope with phase contrast and Nomarski DIC optics .
Micrographs of the specimens were taken on an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a digital Olympus C-3030 zoom camera and on a Leica DMRXA microscope with a digital Leica DC200 camera ( Leica Camera AG , Solms , Germany ) .
Morphological details of the loriciferans were obtained by scanning electron microscopy .
Loriciferans extracted from sediments were carefully rinsed in distilled water and then dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol and acetone prior to critical - point drying .
The dried specimens were mounted on aluminium stubs and coated with gold prior to observation under scanning electron microscopy ( Philips XL20 , Philips Electronics , Eindhoven , The Netherlands ) .
Incubation experiments
Incorporation of ( 3H ) - leucine
For investigating the vitality of the meiofaunal metazoans , the top 5 cm of intact sediment cores were incubated with ( 3H ) - leucine [ 36 ] .
Replicate sediment samples ( n = 3 , internal diameter 5.5 cm , approximately 120 cm3 of sediment per replicate sample ) were kept in the dark at in - situ temperature and under anoxic conditions ( a N 2 atmosphere ) ; these were injected with 10 mL ( 3H ) - leucine dissolved in 0.2 μm filtered , autoclaved and degassed deep - sea water ( final concentration 0.2 mCi mL - 1 ) .
Controls for the incubation experiments were obtained as follows : additional sediment cores were frozen immediately after collection at - 80 °C , to kill all metazoans within the samples .
After thawing , when the samples reached the in - situ temperature , the sediments were incubated with an aqueous solution of ( 3H ) - leucine and then processed as described above .
We used deep freezing to kill animals , as previous studies have demonstrated that meiofauna fixed using chemical compounds ( that is , formaldehyde , glutaraldehyde and ethanol ) show a significant loss in the incorporated radioactivity [ 35 ] .
All samples were incubated on deck ( 101,325 Pa ) under anoxic conditions ( N 2 atmosphere ) for four hours in the dark , and at the in - situ temperature ( about 14°C ) .
At the end of the incubations , the samples were deep - frozen in liquid N 2 to stop any additional substrate uptake .
In the laboratory , the organisms were extracted from the sediment as previously described .
Due to the relatively low numbers of loriciferans in the sediment cores ( n = 3 both in the control and treated samples ) the organisms were analyzed individually .
Meiofaunal organisms were rinsed with 0.2 - μm pre-filtered seawater ( to minimise interference due to radioactivity incorporated by prokaryotes that were potentially present on the metazoan surface ) [ 37 ] and transferred to scintillation vials .
The samples were digested at 50 °C for 24 h using 1 mL tissue solubiliser ( Soluene - 350 , Packard Inc. , Meriden , Connecticut , US ) .
After addition of 10 mL scintillation cocktail , the radioactivity ( as disintegration per minute ; DPM ) in the loriciferans was determined in a liquid scintillation counter ( Packard , Tri-Carb 2100 TR ) .
DPM data were normalised per individual .
To test the accuracy and consistency of the radiotracer experiments carried out on sediments collected in the L'Atalante basin , additional experiments were performed on coastal sediments of the Mediterranean Sea .
Loriferans were not present in these samples ; therefore nematodes were used as model organisms .
After incubation with the radiolabelled substrate , the nematodes ( diameter : 20 to 30 μm and length : 200 to 900 μm ) were extracted from the sediments and analyzed individually or pooled together ( from 2 to 10 individuals ) .
These experiments demonstrated that the radioactivity incorporated into the nematodes is significantly higher than that found in organisms used as controls , even when a single individual is analyzed ( Table 1 ) .
Moreover , radioactivity measured from the nematodes incubated with radioactive substrates increased linearly with the increasing number of individuals analyzed .
Incorporation of Cell - Tracker ™ Green CMFDA
After sediment retrieval from the anoxic basin , the top 5 cm of the sediment cores and its anoxic overlying water were maintained under strict anaerobic conditions ( N 2 atmosphere ) and incubated on deck ( 101,325 Pa ) in the dark and at the in - situ temperature ( ca 14°C ) .
The samples were used for incorporation experiments with Cell - Tracker ™ Green CMFDA , fluorescent probe ( 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate ; Molecular Probes , Inc. , Eugene , Oregon , US ; 10 μM final concentration ) .
The Cell - Tracker ™ Green fluorescent CMFDA probe penetrates the cells and reacts with the intracellular enzymes , generating fluorescence [ 38 ] .
This molecular probe is specifically designed for testing the presence of metabolic activity and is therefore used here to support the evidence of viability of the metazoans present within the anoxic deep - sea sediments .
The sediment samples were incubated for four hours .
Controls for the incubation experiments were obtained as follows : additional sediment cores were frozen immediately after collection at - 80 °C to kill all metazoans within the samples .
After thawing , when the samples reached the in - situ temperature , the sediments were incubated with an aqueous solution Cell - Tracker ™ Green CMFDA , and then processed as described above .
At the end of the incubation , the samples were deep - frozen in liquid N 2 to stop any metabolic reactions , and the recovered loriciferans were placed on concave slides containing a drop of 0.9 % NaCl solution ( previously autoclaved ) .
The fluorescence of the organisms was examined using a confocal microscope equipped with Kr / Ar mixed gas laser ( Bio - Rad MRC 1024 UV ; Bio-Rad , Hercules , California , US ) using excitation wavelengths 488 nm and the emission has been detected after passing a bandpass filter of 522/35 nm .
The confocal laser images were acquired ( using the same laser emission power , iris and electronic gain for all acquisitions ) in the Bio - Rad PIC format using the Bio - Rad Lasersharp Acquisition software ( Release 2.1 ) .
The organisms were investigated using exactly the same magnification ( × 40 ) in order to allow data comparison .
Images were taken at depths of 3 μm for a total of 21 sections per animal and analyzed using the Bio - Rad Lasersharp processing tool .
This enabled merging all of the sections ( without any contrast manipulation ) and measuring the mean scale colour ( 0 to 255 ) of the entire animal body .
Images were sequentially acquired and stored as TIFF files .
The reliability of the control used in the experiment was previously tested by means of repeated ( n = 5 ) incubation experiments with Cell - Tracker ™
Green CMFDA performed on two nematode species cultured in the laboratory ( Diplolamelloides myily and Diplolaimella diewgatentis ) .
All of the specimens were analyzed by confocal laser microscopy , as described above .
X -ray micro-analysis of the elemental composition of Loricifera
After extraction from the sediment , loriciferans from both the L'Atalante basin ( undescribed species of the genus Spinoloricus , only adults ) and the deep NE Atlantic Ocean ( Rugiloricus cauliculus cfr ) underwent quantitative X - ray micro-analysis , after coating with graphite .
Specimens collected in the oxygenated sediments were used as a reference .
The selected parts were : abdomen , the posterior lorica and the whole organism ( Additional file 4 ) .
Spectroscopic infra-red determinations
Fourier transformed Infra-Red ( FT - IR ) spectroscopic determinations were carried out on loriciferans collected both from the anoxic sediments of the L'Atalante basin and from oxic sediments of the NE Atlantic Ocean .
Spectral data were obtained with a Perkin - Elmer Spectrum One FT - IR equipped with a Perkin - Elmer Autoimage microscope ( PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences , Shelton , Connecticut , US ) .
Spectra were measured from 4,000 to 400 cm - 1 at a spectral resolution of 4 cm - 1 with 128 scans .
The spatial resolution was 30 × 30 μm .
Background scans were obtained from a region of no sample and rationed against the sample spectrum .
The samples were deposited first on a steel support to collect reflectance spectra and on the centre of a BaF 2 plate for transmittance spectral acquisition .
Specific areas of interest were identified by means of the microscope television camera .
Baseline ( polynomial line fit ) was performed in all cases while Second Derivative , Fourier Self Deconvolution and Curve Fitting ( Gaussian character ) procedures were used to determine the absorbance ratio between the bands of interest .
All spectra were scaled for equal intensity in the Amide I band .
For data handling , the Spectrum v.303 ( Perkin - Elmer ) software package was used .
Analysis of the ultra-structure of loriciferans by transmission electron microscopy
For ultrastructural studies , loriciferans ( undescribed species of the genus Rugiloricus ) extracted from sediments were carefully rinsed in distilled water and then stored in glutaraldehyde ( 2 % final solution ) for transmission electron microscopy examinations .
After treatment with osmium ( one hour incubation ) and acetone dehydration ( two times at 60 % for one minute , and three times at 100 % for one minute ) , loriciferans were embedded in epoxy resin .
Ultrathin sections ( 78 nm ) were obtained using a microtome ( Model RMC MTX , Boeckeler Instruments Inc. , Tucson , Arizona , USA ) equipped with a diamond knife .
Sections were collected on carbon - coated formvar supports , stained with lead citrate , and examined by transmission electron microscopy ( Philips EM 208 ) .
Multifaceted miniamp
As someone who makes his living playing and teaching guitar , I love the tone and power that large , loud amplifiers provide .
But there are many times and places where a big amp just does n’t work .
Sometimes it ’s just carting it around ; sometimes it ’s space issues .
If you live in an apartment or townhouse , playing a large amp at supersonic volumes can make for some really bad neighbor relationships or even get you evicted .
You really ca n’t take a large amp camping either , unless you use a power inverter and drain your car battery .
Also , you have a difficult time taking it traveling on business or vacation .
What to do ?
For all those places , the MicroCube ( $ 150 ) is perfect .
This little amp has been around for about four years and is loaded with features closely related to its larger , louder cousins .
The controls on the top provide a wide range of sonic possibilities .
Along with a knob for tone , there are controls for gain ( think distortion control ) and volume .
Most importantly , the MicroCube uses digital modeling to make it versatile and good sounding .
What ’s digital modeling ?
That ’s where you take a bunch of great - sounding full - size amps and digitally sample the sounds they make and then apply that to the sound architecture of another amp .
The models on the MicroCube make it very versatile .
Models include Black Panel ( an early 60 ’s Fender amp style ) , Brit Combo ( a Vox AC - 30TB ) , Stack ( Marshall JMP1987 ) , R- fier ( think Mesa Boogie here ) , JC Clean ( based on the popular Roland Jazz Chorus amp ) and a setting for microphone and acoustic guitar .
There ’s a “ tuning fork ” switch that puts out a three - pitch tone to make tuning easy .
There are also various effects such as chorus , flanger , phaser , tremolo , echo , and reverb , which makes it sound as though you ’re playing in a big room .
On the back is a headphone output ( that shuts the speaker off when in use ) , an auxillary line input and power in for a 9 volt DC power source .
I love portable , and for such a small amp this thing puts out , and with great tone .
My favorite setting ?
Brit Combo with a little distortion along with my lapsteel .

Agave has become the sweetener of choice for many health enthusiasts .
It is appearing on store shelves everywhere , in many new products and being promoted in magazines and cooking shows .
One of the main benefits we hear is that it is lower in the glycemic index .
Is agave really a health food and something you should be including in your diet ?
No .
To understand why , let us take a closer look at the issues surrounding agave .
To begin with , to understand agave , we have to understand some things about fructose which is the main form of sugar in agave and High Fructose Corn Syrup ( HFCS ) .
Fructose is metabolized differently than other sugars .
Instead of going into the blood stream ( where it could raise blood sugar ) , most of it goes directly to the liver .
This is why fructose has a lower glycemic index ( GI ) as the GI is based on a food ’s influence on blood sugar .
While many promote this as a positive , as the consumption of fructose tends not to raise blood sugar , fructose , or any concentrated caloric sweeteners high in fructose , can cause elevated levels of triglycerides and increase someone ’s risk for heart disease .
It may also somewhat increase the risk of metabolic syndrome / insulin resistance .
And these effects are most likely in those who are insulin resistant , and / or overweight and / or obese .
It also may not affect the satiety mechanism as well as pure sucrose .
( 1 , 2 )
For the record , these are all many of the reasons we are being told to avoid HFCS as it has a higher level of fructose than regular table sugar or regular corn syrup .
Here is the real irony in all of this .
Because of this concern about the elevated levels of fructose in HFCS , some health food stores will not carry any product that has HFCS in it .
Yet on the other hand , they carry a full line of agave syrup products on their shelf and carry many products sweetened with agave syrup .
But realize agave syrup has a fructose content of about 70 - 90 % which is way higher ( worse ) than HFCS .
On the one hand , consumers , especially the health conscious , are avoiding HFCS like the plague because the level of fructose in it is higher ( 55 % ) than in regular table sugar / sucrose ( 50 % ) .
They consider the higher level of fructose a problem .
The fact that is has a lower GI than table sugar is ignored .
On the other hand , agave syrup has become a popular sweetener because it is said to have a lower GI .
They consider this to be a health benefit .
The fact that it has the highest level of fructose than any other sweetener is ignored .
So , are higher levels of fructose in a concentrated caloric sweetener good or bad ?
From my perspective , the glycemic index ( and glycemic load ) is a very poor indicator of how healthy a food is and I do not recommend choosing foods by it .
However , as agave is being promoted because of its low glycemic index , let ’s look at the glycemic issue .
Glycemic load ( GL ) amounts are also included ; GL is the total amount of sugar released into the blood .
Sweetener GI GL Notes Fructose 13 2 Sucrose 65 7 Glucose 100 10 Honey 61 12 Depends on variety ; range of 35 - 74 ( GI ) and 6 - 18 ( GL ) Agave syrup 13 2 Depends on variety .
HFCS would be similar to a honey that has a similar fructose / glucose ratio because the composition and ratio would be the same .
So , let ’s say a GI of 45 ( and a GL of 9 ) as a honey with the same ratio of fructose / glucose tested at 45 ( and 9 ) .
HFCS has a lower GI ( GL ) than table sugar because of the higher level of fructose .
The higher the percentage of fructose , the lower the GI is , with pure fructose being the lowest .
There are other concerns with HFCS and fructose and so potentially agave .
A recent study showed that when HFCS was exposed to warm temperatures , it forms hydroxymethylfurfural ( HMF ) , a potentially dangerous toxic substance , and killed honeybees ( 3 ) .
Some researchers believe that this chemical , HMF , may be a factor in Colony Collapse Disorder , a mysterious disease that has killed at least one - third of the honeybee population in the United States .
In the study , the scientists measured levels of HMF in HFCS products from different manufacturers over a period of 35 days at different temperatures .
As temperatures rose , levels of HMF increased steadily .
Levels jumped dramatically at about 120 degrees Fahrenheit .
They also mentioned other studies that have linked HMF to DNA damage in humans .
In addition , HMF breaks down in the body to other substances potentially more harmful than HMF .
The researchers said , “ Because HFCS is incorporated as a sweetener in many processed foods , the data from this study are important for human health as well . ”
In this study , it was the effect of heat on fructose that formed the toxic chemical , so heating anything high in fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) should be a concern .
However , remember , HFCS is about 55 % fructose and agave syrup is about 70 - 90 % fructose .
Therefore , heating agave would potentially create more of this toxic chemical .
Another strike against HFCS , but a bigger strike against agave .
There is more to the concern about heating fructose .
It turns out that when fructose is heated it can also create Advanced Glycogen End Products ( AGEs ) , which may be harmful as they may play a role in development of atherosclerosis , diabetes , aging and chronic renal failure .
One study compared the amount of AGE ’s formed between a subject following a traditional omnivorous diet and one following a more traditional vegetarian diet ( 4 ) .
( NOTE :
This was not the same type of vegetarian diet I would recommend ! )
What the authors found was that the AGE ’s levels were higher in the vegetarians .
Upon closer examination , they discovered that it was higher levels of fructose in the vegetarian diet that was the main contributor to the increased level of AGEs and stated , “ Comparison of nutrition and plasma AGEs in vegetarian and omnivorous groups shows that the higher intake of fructose in alternative nutrition of healthy subjects may cause an increase of AGE levels . ”
In the above study , most of the AGEs were formed from the fructose which came from honey .
As the authors stated , “ Furthermore , the intake of honey is three times higher in vegetarians . ”
Honey has one of the higher concentrations of fructose out of many of the typical sweeteners available and is around 55 % fructose depending on the variety .
Agave is 70 - 90 % fructose .
Therefore , substituting agave for any other sweetener would make the above results ( of a potential increase in AGEs ) more likely to occur .
This is one more good reason to avoid agave .
Two last points :
A recent study in the journal Environmental Health ( 5 ) , found mercury in nearly 50 percent of the tested samples of commercial high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) .
A separate study by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy ( IATP ) detected mercury in nearly one - third of 55 popular , brand name food and beverage products where HFCS is the first or second highest labeled ingredient .
The authors concluded , “ With respect to total mercury exposure , it may be necessary to account for this source of mercury in the diet of children and sensitive populations . ”
This concern would only relate to HFCS , not agave .
A recent study ( 6 ) measured the antioxidant acuity level of several sweeteners and found that refined sugar , corn syrup , and agave nectar contained minimal antioxidant activity , raw cane sugar was slightly higher , and dark and blackstrap molasses had the highest antioxidant activity .
Maple syrup , brown sugar , and honey showed intermediate antioxidant capacity .
Let ’s put all of this in perspective …
Are higher levels of fructose in a concentrated caloric sweetener good or bad ?
Well , if you think HFCS is bad because of the amount of fructose in it , then agave must be much worse than HFCS .
If you think agave syrup is good because it has a very low GI / GL , as a result of the fructose in it , than HFCS must not be that bad and at least better than table sugar because it has a higher level of fructose in it , and so would have a lower GI / GL than table sugar .
So again , are higher levels of fructose in a concentrated caloric sweetener good or bad ?
We just ca n’t argue it both ways .
Now , as we see from these recent studies ( 1,2 ) , fructose , in excess , can create problems as it goes directly to the liver .
However , these problems only existed when excess was consumed as there were no negative effects when less than 50 grams was consumed , even when it was pure fructose .
So again , the real issue is quantity .
If it takes a minimum of 50 grams of fructose to see any negative effect and at least 100 grams of fructose to see a significant negative effect , let ’s see how these numbers relate to potential intakes .
50 grams fructose would be the equivalent of consuming 100 grams of sucrose ( sucrose is 50 % glucose and 50 % fructose ) or consuming about 91 grams of HFCS ( HFCS is typically 55 % fructose and 45 % glucose ) .
100 grams of fructose is the equivalent of 200 grams of sucrose or about 182 grams of HFCS .
100 grams of sucrose is 400 calories
91 grams of HFCS is 370 calories
200 grams of sucrose is 800 calories
182 grams of HFCS is 740 calories
On a 2000 calorie diet , this would be 19 % ( at 370 calories ) to 40 % ( at 800 calories ) of someone ’s caloric intake .
The recommendation I give in my Label Reading talk is to limit consumption of all concentrated caloric sweeteners to no more than 5 % of calories which for someone consuming 2000 calories is 100 calories per day which is 25 grams or about 2 tablespoons .
The only exception I give is that if someone has elevated TGs , or at risk for CVD , then they may want to avoid those higher in fructose .
Therefore , limit your consumption of all refined and / or concentrated sweeteners and if heart disease , elevated triglycerides , insulin resistance , diabetes and / or weight are concerns of yours , avoid the ones higher in fructose , especially agave .

The steps taken at the nuclear safety summit in Washington D.C. will make the world a safer place , U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday .
" Today ’s progress was possible because these leaders came not simply to talk but to take action , not simply to make pledges of future action but to commit to meaningful steps that they are prepared to implement right now , " Obama said as he wrapped up the two - day conference .
Obama said the participants all agreed to the seriousness of the threat of nuclear attacks , a change from the beginning of the summit when there was a range of views on the issue .
" Today we are declaring that nuclear terrorism is one of the most challenging threats to international security , " Obama said .
He said all nations also endorsed the goal to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years time .
Obama said some important achievements were reached during the summit .
Canada said it would return its stockpile of enriched uranium to the United States , while Ukraine announced it will give up its entire stockpile of weapons - grade uranium by 2012 — most of it this year .
He said Chile and Mexico also announced they would give up their entire stockpile of enriched uranium , and that nations such as Argentina and Pakistan had announced steps to strengthen port security and prevent nuclear smuggling .
Co-operation questioned
Obama was asked by a reporter how countries that have been at odds over different issues will co-operate since everything to be done is on a voluntary basis without any binding commitment .
" The point is that we 've got world leaders who have just announced that , in fact , this is a commitment that they 're making .
I believe they take their commitments very seriously , " Obama said .
" If what you 're asking is , do we have a international one - world law - enforcement mechanism , we do n't .
We never have . "
Shortly after the opening of the conference , Canada , the United States and Mexico announced a plan to convert Mexico 's research reactor to low - enriched uranium from highly enriched uranium .
About 11 kilograms of highly enriched uranium will be shipped from the Mexican reactor to the U.S .
Canada will contribute about $ 5 million to the conversion project .
Obama also announced that the U.S. is joining with Canada in calling on nations to commit $ 10 billion to extend a global partnership that would strengthen nuclear security around the world .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper , who was among 47 world leaders gathered at the meeting said that Canada has not made that request , but there have been discussions among G8 partners about the initiative .
" Canada is not the originator of the request but obviously we 're going to be looking at this request very seriously and I know all our G8 partners will do the same , " Harper said .
China may join Iran sanctions
The G8 signed on to the program at its 2002 summit in Kananaskis , Alta .
Since then , the group has spent more than $ 600 million helping other countries decommission and secure their nuclear material .
Obama also said he is confident China will join other nations in pressing for tough new sanctions on Iran for continuing to seek nuclear weapons in defiance of the international community .
" Words have to mean something , " Obama said .
" There have to be some consequences . "
Hu and Obama met for 90 minutes on Monday after which U.S. officials said the two agreed to tell their aides to work on a tough new sanctions program .
However , a Chinese spokesman did not mention sanctions in his description of the meeting .

Today , Google launched a fascinating new feature listing requests from government agencies for removal of content on Google and YouTube and for corresponding user information .
Set up as a map , the Government Requests tool shows various countries around the world and lists the number of requests from that country between July and December of last year .
You can learn , for example , that Brazil is the most prolific sender of content takedown requests to Google , or that Google did not comply with any requests from Pakistan .
The information is far from complete , notably missing China , which considers any such requests a state secret .
The United States also restricts disclosure of some user information requests , such as National Security Letters .
Nevertheless , Google 's Government Requests tool is a tremendously important first step towards informing the public about the extent to which governments around the world seek information about them and we commend Google for creating it .
Historically , much of this information was tightly held by governments and service providers , and the public had little ability to review government encroachment into their private spaces .
As we push for strengthening the federal privacy law regulating government access to Internet communications and records as part of the Digital Due Process coalition , this information will be an important part of the ongoing debate .
Moving forward , we 'd love to see more detail .
It would be useful to know whether the takedown was due to allegations of ( for example ) indecency , hate speech , lese majesty , other something else .
Was the user information request seeking to identify a anonymous speaker or to gather further information about a known person ?
More detail for large countries like the United States would also be welcome , breaking down the countrywide number into each state or province .
To have a complete picture , we 'd also like to see statistics for how often Google disclosed data in response , broken down by jurisdiction .
As we move further into an era of cloud computing in which people entrust an ever - increasing amount of their personal , even intimate , information to corporations , other internet companies should offer improved transparency to help protect against government prying .
Google 's new Government Requests tool is a welcome start , an example we hope many more companies promptly follow .
Indeed , the best solution for transparency and openness might be a universal tool , including all the major service providers .
Sid Meier is known as the mastermind behind some of the most respected and influential video games of all time , such as Civilization , Railroad Tycoon and Pirates .
But in his pursuit of conveying a realistic experience for players , he says his logical mind was n't taking into account enough what was going on in players ' heads .
" Gameplay is a psychological experience , " Meier acknowledged during his GDC keynote .
Today he is director of creative development at Firaxis Games .
" By acknowledging that gameplay is actually a psychological experience we ... can end up with a better game . "
Meier outlined specific psychological elements that occur in players ' minds , such as " The Winner Paradox . "
Game designers are supposed to give gamers a challenge , but the gamer at the same time expects to win .
" In the real world you do n't always win , however in the world of games , you always win " in some capacity , Meier said .
Just like players expect Rambo to overcome the enemy in the end , or Sherlock Holmes to solve the mystery , there is a certain understanding between the player and the designer .
" ... The player is always looking for a satisfactory conclusion that does n't always involve winning the game , but often does , " Meier said .
They expect , like Rambo , to win in the end .
" ... Players are very much inclined to accept anything you give them and gladly feel it was their own incredible play or strategy .
...
You want the player to feel like they 're above average . "
The problem for game designers however , is that while gamers are happy to take credit for success , if they lose , the blame often falls on the game .
Rewarding the gamer often is also important , particularly in the opening moments of a game .
" You almost cannot reward the player enough " in the first 15 minutes of a game , in order to get them hooked , Meier said .
The " Unholy Alliance "
Meier described the relationship between the gamer and designer as an " unholy alliance " -- an unwritten agreement in which the gamer agrees that they 'll assume certain things about the game designer , while the game designer agrees to assume certain things about the gamer .
Meier said that game designers agree to assume that gamers are good at a game .
" They are the star of the game , " Meier said .
...
Keeping them feeling good about themselves is important . "
Gamers assume that game designers will maintain a suspension of disbelief within the game .
Meier said that some of the older , more experienced designers who worked with lo - fi graphics might have an advantage in this area , because they learned how to not rely on graphics to immerse a player .
" Having that experience was helpful in understanding the challenges in getting the player to suspend their disbelief , " he said .
There 's also the Cold War - like relationship between gamers and designers that Meier called Mutually Assured Destruction .
" There 's an amazing parallel to [ the Cold War ] .
...
The player can actually destroy the experience any time they want to . "
For example , they can quit in the middle of a game , or play it in a way not intended by the designer .
But game designers have the ability to " destroy " a game through questionable mechanics or bad design decisions .
" There are ways that we need to be careful to be true to the story of the game and value the player 's time , " he said .
Along the same lines as suspension of disbelief , Meier said consistent humor , style , music , and atmosphere is also expected by the gamer .
" If i'm playing a game that starts off happy and cartoony and all of a sudden terrible things start happening ... that 's when the player turns off the game and moves on .
...
Use things like [ humor , style , music and atmosphere ] to be consistent and keep the player in your world . "
There were some instances where Meier discovered unexpected psychological moments .
For instance , the original prototype for Civilization was a real - time strategy game , not turn - based .
But he found that players felt more like observers in a real - time strategy game , while they felt more like the star of the game with turn - based gameplay .
Meier also said , " Any kind of randomness needs to be treated with a lot of care .
Whenever something random happens to the player , paranoia sets in .
...
The player feels like the computer rolled that random number just to be difficult . "
Small doses of randomness , however can be helpful -- just make sure that it seems fair to the player so he does n't feel cheated .
While real civilizations rise and fall throughout the course of history , injecting that realism into a game like Civilization would be a mistake , although it was considered by Meier at one point .
Players do n't want peaks and valleys , they want constant progress -- that 's what the Civilization franchise is about .
" You cannot reward and reflect progress too much in a game , " Meier said .
Even recently he found an instance of surprising player psychology .
Firaxis is currently developing the Facebook game Civilization Network .
The development team tried allowing players to exchange gold with each other .
" What we found though is that nobody would give gold to anyone else , " totally defeating the purpose of a player - to - player currency exchange system .
Player Psychology And Cost Savings
Game designers can also use player psychology in ways that can actually save developers money , Meier said .
He suggested that designers use a player 's imagination .
" If the player can imagine what 's going on [ in a game ] ... we save a lot of money . "
In Civilization Revolution , for example , a message might pop up saying that royalty from a distant land has just gifted dancing bears to the player .
But Firaxis does n't need to create assets for the royal or the bears .
In fact , there are no bears , and players will never come across that royal .
But the gift feeds the player 's ego , improves the entertainment experience , and did nothing but play with the player 's imagination with just a few words on screen .
Meier also suggested that designers " tap into what the player already knows . "
In Pirates , he did n't need to invest time and money in giving an antagonist an intricate backstory .
He found that it was enough just to give the character a black curly mustache .
" Take advantage of what the player will almost automatically provide with their own imagination , " he said .
It 's also important to know the personality of your audience , and feed the player 's ego .
Meier 's certain what kind of person plays a game whose tagline is " Build an empire to stand the test of time . "
" Basically if you play Civilization , you are an egomaniac , " Meier joked .
Rabbi Yehuda Levin knows how to get press – emulate Pat Robertson .
Levin , the spokesman of the Rabbinical Alliance of America , issued a press release today warning that lifting the military ban on gays and lesbians serving open in the military is equivalent to the “ spiritual rape ” of the military :
When Americans are suffering economically and millions need jobs , it ’s shocking that the Administration is focused on its ultra-liberal militantly homosexualist agenda forcing the highlighting of homosexuals and homosexuality on an unwilling military .
This is the equivalent of the spiritual rape of our military to satisfy the most extreme and selfish cadre of President Obama ’s kooky coalition .
When it comes to “ kooky ” Levin knows his stuff .
His release goes on to mimic Robertson ’s past statements about gays and lesbians – and the alleged acceptance they are currently enjoying in the United States – as the cause of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes .
We have seen the underground earthquake , tsunami , Katrina , and now Haiti .
All this is in sync with a two thousand year old teaching in the Talmud that the practice of homosexuality is a spiritual cause of earthquakes .
Once a disaster is unleashed , innocents are also victims just like in Chernobyl .
Levin ’s release says that he represents “ 1,000 rabbis ” in this belief , but their own web site only boasts “ 800 + members ” but does not list specific affiliations .
The group of Ultra - Orthodox Jews have apparently been around since 1945 , and “ seeks to promulgate the cause of Torah - true Judaism through an organized rabbinate that is consistently Orthodox . ”
Levin says he agrees “ with Eileen Donnelly of the Center for Military Readiness that this will hurt the cohesiveness of the military , cause many to leave the army , and dramatically lower the number of recruits , perhaps leading to the reinstatement of a compulsory draft . ”
However , that belief runs counter to many studies already done that show lifting Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell would not adversely affect the military in any way .
In 1993 RAND Corp. concluded that openly gay people in the U.S. military do not negatively impact unit cohesion , morale , good order , or military readiness .
Several other military - commissioned and GAO studies have concluded that open service does not undermine military readiness , troop morale or national security .
In addition 24 countries , including Israel , allow openly gay service members without any adverse affect upon military cohesion or readiness .
As for natural disasters , Levin may want to study up on what causes earthquakes , tsunamis , and hurricanes .
I do n’t see “ gays and lesbians ” listed among the data .
But , fundamentalists of all stripes never let the facts get in the way of a good , scary , story .
” We plead with saner heads in Congress and the Pentagon to stop sodomization of our military and our society .
Enough is enough . ”
Indeed , it is .
This is my life - the things that interest me and the things I follow ..
Fox News said on Wednesday that it was dropping an interview with LL Cool J , right , the rapper and “ NCIS : Los Angeles ” star , from Thursday ’s debut episode of “ Real American Stories , ” a program hosted by Sarah Palin .
LL Cool J , whose real name is James Todd Smith , wrote Tuesday on his Twitter account that Fox News had “ lifted an old interview I gave in 2008 to someone else ” and was “ misrepresenting to the public ” in its promotion of the show .
Press representatives for LL Cool J said Fox News was repurposing an old interview without his permission .
Fox News said that it conducted an interview with LL Cool J about 18 months ago for a program called “ Real American Stories , ” and that it did not need his permission to use the interview on the new program .
In a statement Fox News said , “ As it appears that Mr. Smith does not want to be associated with a program that could serve as an inspiration to others , we are cutting his interview from the special and wish him the best with his fledgling acting career . ”
In addition to his “ NCIS ” role , LL Cool J has starred in the films “ Any Given Sunday ” and “ Deep Blue Sea ” and on the television series “ In the House . ”

This “ little ” post has come about as the result of a suggestion from regular reader , Peter Stindberg , which followed the concerns I raised about the “ Bye Bye Copybot ” prim being circulated by members of the Emerald team , and lauded by some content creators and others , despite its potential as a ToS violator .
Before I get to the nitty - gritty , I will point out that while what follows is a genuine attempt to timeline events and interrelations of events as accurately as possible , the degree of paranoia and misinformation surrounding content ripping means that a ) there is a possibility I may fail to mention some events ; b ) some may view things differently ( and may themselves not necessarily be correct ) ; c) I ’ve confused issues ( although I ’ve verified as much as I remember over the years with various sources elsewhere ) – in which case polite corrections welcomed !
libsecondlife
Up until 2006 , Second Life had largely been a closed universe : the code for both the server and client - side software was developed purely by Linden Lab .
There had been issues around copying content – tools like GL Intercept , which enabled the likes of avatars to be copied , and basic tools and scripts that enabled textures to be pulled from the local cache .
However , these tended to be somewhat obscure as far as the populace of SL at large were concerned , which somewhat mitigated their impact ( but did n’t excuse their use ) .
Then something happened : libesecondlife was created .
libsecondlife commenced , with Linden Lab ’s blessing , as group of Second Life residents attempting to back - engineer an open - source version of the Viewer ( client - side software ) .
Today , to avoid copyright issues in relation to the Second Life name the group is now called lib.openmetaverse.org .
CopyBot
As a part of this work , an automated tool was developed – CopyBot that could be used to replicate avatars – bots , and be used as a debugging tool .
The original CopyBot required that that target user actively give permission to be copied , and issued a disclaimer ( in the form of a drop - down ) prior to the copying taking place , specifying the fact that ownership / permissions pertaining to anything worn by the avatar would be lost in the copying process .
The software itself ( written in C# ) worked by intercepting the communications between the Viewer and server and replicating the information relating to objects ( prims , textures ) .
In doing so , and due the the way in which Viewer / server communications had been coded by LL , the copy process would lose the metadata relating to the original creator of the object and all permissions set against it – there was simply no way of including this information in the raw copy process as written in C# .
The original version of CopyBot was published as a part of the libsecondlife library of tools , where it became relatively easy for someone to remove the code asking for the target ’s permission to be copied and the disclaimer drop - down , and thus use the code to copy virtually anything in Second Life – with the exception of scripts , gestures and animation ( although later iterations of CopyBot could apparently grab animations and gestures from avatars ) – completely surreptitiously , giving birth to CopyBot as we know it today .
What made CopyBot different to earlier attempts to rip content was its relative ease - of - use , it ’s availability and – inevitably – the notoriety it quickly gained as a result of being made “ public ” .
From the start , the libsecondlife group were fairly unconcerned by the risk CopyBot presented to content creators , demonstrating a “ so what ? ” attitude , supported and repeated by other techies posing as “ journalists ” as the news broke .
Indeed , in one such interview , libsecondlife ’s Admin , Babba Yamamoto intimated the issue of metadata loss could have been overcome if the CopyBot code had been re-written in XML ( this is in fact how tools such as Second Inventory and Viewers such as Meerkat and Emerald “ legally ” export content ) – but no - one saw the point in doing so , since the “ flaw ” that lost the metadata lay with the way LL had originally coded Viewer / server communications , so those in the libsecondlife group felt justified in deflecting anger directed at them by pointing the finger at LL .
libsecondlife did eventually pull the CopyBot branch from their open source library as the wave of outrage reached the level of a tsunami – but again ( and to mix metaphors ) their action was that of not only shutting the stable door after the horse had bolted – but having ensured the horse had an open - ended ticket to any destination of its own choosing as it left the stable .
Protests and Response
The “ revised ” CopyBot code quickly started showing up as being for sale both in - world and on SL Exchange and immediately generated uproar as a result .
Protests were held , the forums were flooded and people were angry : stores were closed ; sims locked down , and calls were made to boycott Second Life .
While the libsecondlife group ’s reaction remained pretty much , “ so what ? ” , Linden Lab ’s initial response to the protests could best be described as lukewarm , with Robin Linden repeating the assertion that content copying is “ not necessarily ” theft – a meme initially rolled out by Cory Linden – himself an active supporter of libsecondlife .
While the meme is technically true ( it should be pointed out that Second Inventory , for example , effectively uses CopyBot - style coding with ownership and permission checking in place , to export objects from Second Life , for example ) , it was also was somewhat disingenuous to raise it in the context of content ripping .
Many were angered by this reaction from Linden Lab , which gave rise to a further round of protests .
Some of these made headline news in the likes of Business Week and News.com – prompting Linden Lab to take something of a more affirmative stance , revising their policy to make it clear the use of CopyBot and similar tools would not be tolerated .
While the move was in some ways welcomed , it was also felt that it was the risk of poor publicity , rather than a desire to help reduce the risk of Copybotting that prompted LL into “ action ” .
Nor was the revised policy that successful .
By referring to the use of such tools as CopyBot , the policy implied that the sale of such tools in - world was still OK – and so people kept right on selling it at up to L$ 1500 a pop , quite prepared to face the wrath of residents while the Lab again kept quietly to the sidelines .
At the same time as calls for tougher action against CopyBot and it users continued , so to did the counter - argument “ that nothing can be done ” to stop the matter ( an argument still heard today ) gained strength among techies .
People pointed to the code behind web pages being viewable and therefore copyable ; people pointed to the existence of tools such as GLIntercept that could copy avatars , people raised the issue of ripping MP3s over the Internet as reasons why CopyBot was not only “ inevitable ” , but should be more - or - less accepted .
While such statements are broadly true , they in no way justify the theft of Second Life content – or any theft for that matter .
Rather , they deflect discussion from the core issue that Second Life is promoted as a platform of commerce , and as such those encouraged to take up business opportunities on the platform should be offered a degree of protection that appeared to be somewhat lacking on LL ’s part .
Promises and Tools
Another reason people perceived Linden Lab as having little concern over the matter was the time taken to develop practical tools that could help in the identification of potentially ripped goods .
Conversations around such tools commenced in November 2006 , with Robin Linden ’s above - mentioned post .
However , it was not until April 2008 that the first really useful tool – the Object Inspector – finally made its debut ; 18 months after the initial furore .
Now , there could be perfectly legitimate reasons as to why such a tool took so long to develop and deploy .
However , during the 18 months it was in development , Linden Lab was largely silent on the matter of content ripping , giving rise to the perception that they “ were n’t interested ” in dealing with the issue .
Right or wrong , this perception was further reinforced by the fact it was not until August 2009 – nigh on three years after the original protests – that the Lab saw fit to outline updates to their IP Complaints Process , as outlined in their Content Management Roadmap .
Even then , insult appeared to be added to injury in that elements of the Roadmap appeared less concerned with the worries of current residents as they did in providing the perception of content protection for “ upcoming ” users of the Second Life Enterprise product .
In the meantime , CopyBot development continued among known hacker groups – such as the Patriotic Nigaras – who worked to make the tool more “ user - friendly ” and added further capabilities to it .
While the sale of the tool was banned from both in - world and on the likes SL Exchange / XStreetSL , CopyBot does continue to be available through various torrent sites – although I understand ( but have absolutely no proof ) that many of the advertised CopyBot downloads are , in an ironic twist , themselves riddled with viruses / Trojans .
Viewer Threats
Throughout 2007 and 2008 , CopyBot remained an issue .
Exactly how widespread its use was was difficult to assess : paranoia meant that many reports of copying came via “ friends of friends of friends ” rather than first - hand exposure , and the storm was further whipped up by merchants selling “ anti-Copybot protection ” tools that were little more than scripted placebos .
While such tools did little or nothing to stop Copybotting , their widespread proliferation in stores across the grid reinforced the perception that Copybotting was epedemic in proportions .
Then the landscape started to change .
In 2007 , the first fully - functional third - party Viewers began to appear .
Over a period of several months , a crop of Viewers showed up that offered people a genuine alternative to the “ official ” Viewer , which was regarded as poorly - written and crash - prone .
What was more , these Viewers not only offered improved stability , they also tended to offer features that users has been requesting from Linden Lab without any success .
As the popularity of these Viewers increased , so did the likelihood that the Viewer code would be maliciously hacked .
This likelihood became a reality in 2009 , when the first of the “ CopyBot Viewers ” appeared in - world .
This did raise content theft to a new level : now it was possible for anyone to grab content ( with the exception of scripts ) simply by using a modified Viewer – no other tools or add-ins required .
As with CopyBot itself , Linden Lab were initially slow to respond , despite the renewed outcry the appearance of these “ hacked ” Viewers caused .
It was not until February 2010 that their Third Party Viewer ( TPV ) Policy first appeared .
BuilderBot
In mid-2009 the matter almost took another very nasty turn when Jim Himoff of Rezzable suggested an in - house tool created by his company would be made available to the open source community .
This tool was Builderbot .
Based on the CopyBot code , Builderbot enabled entire sims to be “ backed up ” : land , buildings , content , textures – all in a single pass .
Like CopyBot , Builderbot was initially developed with a genuine function in mind : Rezzable had invested heavily in Second Life in terms of sim development and commissioning custom builds they have not only paid for , but have purchased the rights to as well .
When they opted to make a move from Second Life to their own OS Grid , they obviously wanted to take their investment with them : hence Builderbot .
However , Himoff ’s announcement of issuing Builderbot to the open source community as an unrestrained tool was alarming , and his very public claims that it presented “ nothing new ” as it was based on “ CopyBot ” and the “ CopyBot was already out there ” was an utterly disingenuous excuse .
Given the history of CopyBot , any release of an unrestrained version of Builderbot would have been worse than mischief making – it would have been as malicious as pulling the pin of a hand grenade and tossing it into a crowded room .
Fortunately , such was the outcry over the announcement that Rezzable quickly backpedalled away from their stated intent ( assuming said intent was n’t a stunt aimed at raising Rezzable ’s visibility and that of their new OS Grid offering ) , opting instead to develop a version of Builderbot that would include ownership and permissions protection .
So far as I ’m aware , no version of Builderbot has to date been released .
The Present
Most recently , Linden Lab again caused some consternation with the release of Viewer 2.0 – which had the invaluable Object Inspector completely removed .
Why this was done is anyone ’s guess , but it lead to some consternation on the part of residents using it – so much so that a JIRA was raised and LL reintroduced it with the first Viewer 2.0 update – although one has to ask why it was removed in the first place .
We ’re still awaiting further updates around the Content Management Roadmap – again nothing has been heard of on this subject since the August 2009 blog post , giving the ( potentially wrong ) impression that it has fallen of LL ’s radar in the rush to get Viewer 2.0 and all things “ Enterprise ” - related out the door .
Currently , the subject of content ripping remains contentious .
Not because it is n’t happening – it is – witness the recent XSL sale of ripped dances and Ishy Wingtips ’ highly - literate and thought - provoking flog posting on the subject as it affects the Teen Grid – but rather because the accepted perception is that copy ripping has reached pandemic levels in Second Life .
This perception has resulted in a lot of misinformation to enter circulation – some of it through simple misunderstandings , some of it to deliberately derail attempts to halt the further spread of the problem .
The waters have also been muddied by the subject of “ copybotting ” being used to promote other agendas .
Towards the end of 2009 , for example , a number of high - profile content creators used the subject of copybotting to float the idea that only a selected “ elite ” ( my term ) of content creators should be allowed to operate in Second Life .
Among other things , they suggested the criteria by which such creators should be selected should be related to in - world turnover – an idea that found its way into the Content Management Roadmap thus :
We are starting the process of planning a content seller program , and we would like your input on possible program criteria .
At a minimum , participation in the program will require that the selling Resident ….. 3. meet a minimum threshold for content transactions .
Quite how limiting the number of content creators to a “ selected few ” would stop content ripping ( given their own content would clearly become the target ) has never been fully explained – but the fact that their views , issued under the guise of concern about content ripping , found their way into the draft CM Roadmap is disturbing .
Beyond this , and in part due to the apparent lack of concern from Linden Lab on the matter , in - world tools to “ combat ” Copybotting have appeared over the years .
How effective any one of these tools is , I can not honestly say .
Some appear utterly useless and smack of cynical attempts to cash - in on people ’s fears .
More recent tools have appeared that seem to offer a degree of protection against the use of “ hacked ” Viewers , but even these are subject to considerable controversy , inasmuch as a ) they have been developed by former content rippers ( allowing their potential effectiveness to be undermined using the question of trust ) , and b ) the creators have been so secretive around the tools , entire rumour mills have been created around them - and not always positively .
And so we come bang up - to - date with things , and the post that initiated Peter ’s suggestion that I try to summarise (! ) things relating to Copybot , etc .
I think I ’ve covered all the bases and key events .
If I ’ve missed anything significant , I apologise , and will attempt to correct any omissions / inaccuracies that are pointed out to me .

Mayor : Some Las Vegas city jobs might have to be privatized City and unions still about $ 20 million apart in concessions to save 141 jobs
The city of Las Vegas might have to start considering hiring private contractors to replace more highly paid city employees in the future , says Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman .
" We look to privatization to replace city employees who are functioning , but at a salary level that is higher than perhaps the private sector would provide to us , " Goodman said at this morning 's Las Vegas City Council meeting .
" But we do n't have any choice but to look at that as an alternative .
It 's not a threat .
It 's just a fact . "
Goodman made those remarks after hearing a presentation from city staff about the status of talks with the four unions that represent the 3,300 employees concerning pay cuts that would help the city trim its budget for the 2010 fiscal year .
The city staff had just given a report detailing how far away the city 's four employee unions are to meeting the city 's request in concessions , which would save 141 employees ' jobs .
The city 's goal — which includes no cost - of - living increase for all employees , plus an 8 percent salary cut — is to trim $ 29.7 million from the budget .
However , the unions ' offers have amounted to only a $ 10 million cut , leaving a $ 19.7 million difference , according to City Manager Betsy Fretwell and Mark Vincent , the city 's chief financial officer .
After the presentation , Mayor Oscar Goodman urged the city 's negotiators and the unions to keep working toward closing that gap .
Goodman said the alternatives to employee groups not accepting an 8 percent cut are to reduce city services and eliminate the jobs of 141 employees .
The council has approved a tentative budget that includes the job reductions after employees did not agree to the city 's request of an 8 percent cut this year and next year .
A final budget will need to be made by May 18 and then submitted to the state on June 1 .
" The window is closing quickly , " Goodman said .
" The 8 percent is the number .
I 've been asked in press conferences , ' Is that in cement ? '
Nothing 's in cement .
But we have to get the 8 percent in order to make this into livable conditions , without losing the patient , " Goodman said .
Summary of offers
The summary of talks provided by the city staff , showed the following :
-- Las Vegas City Employee Association :
The city is asking it to reduce compensation by $ 16.7 million .
The LVCEA 's offer , which includes 196 hours of furlough and giving up cost of living , amounts to $ 8.7 million .
The difference is $ 8 million .
A LVCEA representative disputed how the city arrived at the figure for the union 's offer , saying the union is actually offering $ 10.2 million in concessions , or about two - thirds of what the city wants .
He said the union would like the $ 10.2 million to be used to retain the jobs of most of the 121 union member who would be laid off under the city 's tentative budget .
He estimated that could be about 100 people .
-- International Association of Fire Fighters :
The city wants it to cut $ 8.8 million in personnel costs .
The IAFF , which is in contract negotiations , has offered $ 900,000 .
The difference is $ 7.9 million .
-- Las Vegas Police Officers Association , which represents corrections officers :
The city 's goal is for it to cut $ 3.1 million .
The LVPOA 's offer would not save any money , so the difference is $ 3.1 million .
-- Las Vegas Police Protection Association , which represents city marshals :
The city 's goal is to cut $ 1.1 million .
The LVPPA 's offer amounts to $ 400,000 .
The difference is $ 700,000 .
Chris Collins , president of the LVPPA , said no one from the city has contacted him about the union 's offer in the last six weeks .
He said the union is not ready to give that much back .
Many of the employees recently bought homes and are underwater in those homes and can't afford to take those kinds of cuts , he said .
Fretwell said the city has not rejected any of the offers , but was still at the table , working through the process .
Deeper hole than expected
Fretwell told the council that the city would have to dig deeper into its reserves than was planned when the council approved the tentative budget on March 10 .
At that time , the $ 493 million budget included taking $ 38 million from reserves .
However , the new estimate will be that it will need to dip into reserves by $ 53 million , taking the rainy day fund down to 10 percent , Fretwell said .
The 10 percent level would give the city about five weeks of cash flow in case of an emergency .
" I do n't think any of us recognized how bad things were going to get , " she said .
Vincent said once of the reasons for the lower revenues is that , because of the economy , more people are cutting back on their own energy use , which means the city is taking in less funds from its franchise fees included in utility bills .
About 10 years ago , the council adopted a policy to keep 12 percent of its budget in the reserve fund .
Because of the economic downturn , that 's now down to 10 percent and will be at the 10 percent level for the 2011 fiscal year , Fretwell said .
She said 8.125 percent of the reserves are not subject to collective bargaining .
Fretwell said going any lower than 10 percent could mean the city would lose its bond rating , which would make the costs of public projects go higher .
Vincent said keeping the reserves at 10 percent would give the city more breathing room to plan for emergencies intelligently .
COLA confusion
Councilman Steve Wolfson said some people do n't understand how cost of living allowances , or COLAs , work and asked how many years employees have been getting them and whether the COLA always increase each year .
Fretwell said employees have been getting them for at least 15 years .
Vincent said the average Western States Consumer Price Index has gone up on average those years just under 2.8 percent .
He said it would be flatter than normal for this year , but will see an uptick in the 2012 fiscal year .
Fretwell said employee COLA increases , which are negotiated by the unions , have been exceeding the Western States CPI , plus employees have also received step increases in compensation for longevity .
Mayor Pro Tem Gary
Reese pointed out that over a long period of time , " that 's a huge difference , " in what employees make compared to the CPI increases .
Councilwoman Lois Tarkanian said the general public thought COLAs go up or down based on the CPI .
Fretwell said COLAs are fixed by the terms of the negotiated contracts .
Eating huge quantities of food is an unobtainable fantasy for some and an everyday luxury for others .
To Adam Richman , voracious host of Man V Food ( Mon , 9 pm , Good Food ) , it 's a career choice .
Man V
Food is obscene on many levels , but daft on several more .
The format could n't be much simpler : every week , Richman travels to a city ( Memphis this time ) and samples its most notorious " pig out joints " : the sort of quintessentially American restaurants where everything is charbroiled or smoked or sizzled to death in a deep fat fryer vat the size of a swimming pool ; places where each mammoth portion comes with a side order of type two diabetes .
Establishments of this kind often tend to have a " challenge " item on the menu – a dish so offensively huge , anyone who successfully manages to eat it has their portrait hung on the wall .
The end of each episode sees Richman taking on one of these challenges , hence the title .
That 's all there is to it .
Essentially this is Top Gear for food : a jokey , blokey exercise in excessive indulgence .
It 's all sensation , sensation , sensation .
Just as Clarkson emits orgasmic whimpers when his driver 's seat judders on acceleration , so Richman groans like a man having his perineum tongued by three cheerleaders as he ingests each warm mouthful of stodge .
If food is the new porn , this is an all - out orgy between wobbling gutsos and farmyard animals – a snuff orgy , no less , since the latter end up sawn in half and smothered in BBQ sauce .
Plenty of cattle get eaten ; at times Richman may as well lie down , open his gob and let a herd stampede directly into his stomach .
Entire carcasses are greedily consumed by overweight folk with juice dribbling down their chins , tearing flesh from charred bones with their glistening teeth .
It 's like sitting in Sawney Bean 's cave .
Meat and skeletons , meat and skeletons .
A sequence in which Richman peers inside an oven at Memphis 's premier rib joint to witness a landscape of scorched and smouldering ribcages almost resembles the aftermath of the Dresden firebombing .
This is definitely not a programme for vegetarians .
Things reach an insane peak ( or more accurately , trough ) , as Richman takes on the eating challenge .
This week he faces the 7 ½ pound " Sasquatch Burger " at the Big Foot Lodge .
1,300 people have attempted to eat one ; only four have succeeded .
This high failure rate is hardly surprising when you see the bloody thing : it 's the size of a sofa cushion .
The bun alone accounts for two pounds .
The burger itself is an ominous cake of mashed cow as thick as your thigh .
When he first tucks in , Richman is chirpy and cocky , shovelling handfuls of meat down his neck with the gluttonous abandon of a self - aware Homer Simpson .
Several minutes later , as it becomes clear he still has an immense mountain of food to get through , he appears sickened and woozy – presumably because his blood sugar levels have hit a dangerously narcotic high as his stomach desperately tries to break down the busload of beef that 's just appeared inside it .
This is the point at which the show stops being fun .
It 's like watching a man dealing with an instant , unexpected pregnancy .
But what I 'd really like to see is what happens the next morning , when the show presumably turns into Man V Poo , as Richman empties the dauntingly substantial , hopelessly compacted contents of his engorged colon , clenching the bathroom doorhandle between his teeth as he attempts to give birth to a leg - sized hunk of fecal sod without killing himself .
Cue footage of him sweating , shaking and sobbing like a man impaled on a clay tree , before eventually squeezing out a log with the dimensions and weight of a dead gazelle in a greased sleeping bag .
As he mops his brow ( and backside ) , he smiles weakly with exhausted triumph , whispers farewell , and the credits roll .
And we 've all learned something about the price of excess .
A medical marijuana patient was acquitted Thursday of charges that he possessed and sold the drug to undercover officers .
The not guilty verdict for Eugene Davidovich marked the second time this year that arrestees in 2008 raids on medical marijuana collectives have been acquitted of drug charges .
In January , Jovan Jackson was acquitted of possession of marijuana for profit .
A San Diego Superior Court jury acquitted Davidovich of possession of concentrated cannabis , possession of medical marijuana , sale of medical marijuana and possession with intent to distribute medical marijuana .
“ I think that today , the jurors saw through the politically driven prosecution , ” Davidovich said outside court .
“ They saw the truth .
They saw that the law does allow for collective cultivation .
They saw that the law allows for reimbursement , and they saw that the law allows for Prop 215 and SB 240 to remain as law . ”
Authorities alleged that Davidovich sold marijuana to an undercover detective in November 2008 and had baggies of the drug in his car when it was searched the following April .
The detective who bought the drugs from the defendant said he received a doctor ’s prescription for marijuana by using a false name .
Defense attorney Michael McCabe said his client fell victim to medical marijuana statutes where “ it ’s difficult to discern the line of demarcation ” between what is legal and what is illegal .

Veterans of World War II who sang war songs at a free concert last year have now been told that they must pay fees to copyright holders .
A collections society says they are owed money since the veterans sang the songs in public .
The controversy has prompted an announcement in Russia 's parliament .
Music played an important part during World War II .
It was used to boost the morale of both soldiers and civilians during the conflict and since then war songs have endured , particularly in the hearts of those that survived the fighting .
Although the casualties on all sides during World War II were absolutely horrendous , the losses suffered by the then U.S.S.R were staggering – almost 27 million people lost their lives .
Last September a World War II veterans choir held a concert in Samara , one of Russia ’s largest cities .
At the free event they sang those songs that helped them through the fighting and have provided them with nostalgia since .
However , the Russian Authors Society ( RAS ) has now filed a claim with the organizers of the concert .
It appears that since the war songs the veterans sang are copyrighted , fees have to be paid to RAS .
Understandably the veterans are pretty upset and many simply do n’t understand what is happening .
“ We sang to convey an educational message to our grandchildren , ” said one performer .
“ And we have to pay for that ?
Is this not a crime ? ”
In order for the songs to have been performed legally at the event , a licensing agreement should have been entered into with RAS , something which was not done , says RAS Deputy Director , Oleg Partin .
The controversy prompted an announcement in the lower house of the Russian parliament that the Arts Committee should be convened immediately .
Copyright is there to fight piracy , they said , not to fight veterans .
“ This is nonsense !
It is unacceptable that those who sing the wonderful songs of WWII will have to pay a bribe , ” said Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov .
“ I believe that in this case insanity grows stronger and stronger .
Now it has arrived at complete stupidity . ”
On May 9th 1945 , Russia celebrated the end of the Great Patriotic War .
The 65th anniversary of that day arrives in just a few weeks and it now seems that RAS is trying to make amends for the hurt caused earlier .
They are suggesting that changes should be made so that singing war songs on that day is a free activity .
Sgt Delroy Smellie confronted Nicola Fisher at the G20 protests A police officer accused of striking a woman with a metal baton at the G20 protest said he hit her because he felt threatened , a court has heard .
Met Police Sgt Delroy Smellie denies a charge of common assault on Nicola Fisher , 36 , of Brighton , at the G20 demonstration in London in April 2009 .
The officer told City of Westminster Magistrates '
Court he feared objects in her hand were weapons .
The court has been told Ms Fisher was holding a carton of orange juice .
The 47 - year - old officer told the court he initially struck the animal rights activist across the face in a move which he described as a " clearance strike " .
He said the clash changed the mood of others and he grabbed his metal extendable baton , known as an asp , as the crowd closed in and he was left isolated .
Experience does not negate your ability to feel threatened
Sgt Delroy Smellie
The court heard the senior territorial support group officer then struck Ms Fisher with it when she surged towards him again .
He said he feared objects in her hands could be used as weapons against him .
Asked how hard he hit Ms Fisher , Sgt Smellie replied he was aware she was " significantly smaller " .
" However it had to be enough to achieve the objective of negating the threat , " he added .
Sgt Smellie told the court he could not remember hitting Ms Fisher a second time , but said his reasons for doing so would have been the same as the first .
' Extremely good officer '
The prosecution allege Sgt Smellie went beyond his legal powers by striking Ms Fisher twice across the leg with the baton .
The clash was caught by several photographs and on video , which was posted on the website YouTube .
Sgt Smellie added : " Even though we have seen umpteen numbers of the video slowed down , it was not slow in reality .
" This was a real situation .
It was real time .
" This was fast moving and as much experience as I have , I still felt threatened within the short period of time .
" Experience does not negate your ability to feel threatened . "
Earlier , Sgt Smellie 's superior Insp Derek Renton described him as an " extremely good officer " .
The case continues .

Atrazine , one of the world 's most widely used pesticides , wreaks havoc with the sex lives of adult male frogs , emasculating three - quarters of them and turning one in 10 into females , according to a new study by University of California , Berkeley , biologists .
The 75 percent that are chemically castrated are essentially " dead " because of their inability to reproduce in the wild , reports UC Berkeley 's Tyrone B. Hayes , professor of integrative biology .
" These male frogs are missing testosterone and all the things that testosterone controls , including sperm .
So their fertility is as low as 10 percent in some cases , and that is only if we isolate those animals and pair them with females , " he said .
" In an environment where they are competing with unexposed animals , they have zero chance of reproducing . "
The 10 percent or more that turn from males into females ‑ something not known to occur under natural conditions in amphibians ‑ can successfully mate with male frogs but , because they are genetically male , all their offspring are male .
" When we grow these guys up , depending on the family , we will get anywhere from 10 to 50 percent females , " Hayes said .
" In a population , the genetically male females can decrease or wipe out a population just because they skew sex ratios so badly . "
Though the experiments were performed on a common laboratory frog , the African clawed frog ( Xenopus laevis ) , field studies indicate that atrazine , a potent endocrine disruptor , similarly affects frogs in the wild , and could possibly be one of the causes of amphibian declines around the globe , Hayes said .

Hayes and his UC Berkeley colleagues report their results in this week 's online early edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Last week , Hayes and colleagues published a review of pesticide 's effects on amphibians in the Journal of Experimental Biology , concluding that atrazine is a likely contributor to worldwide amphibian declines .
" These kinds of problems , like sex - reversing animals skewing sex ratios , are much more dangerous than any chemical that would kill off a population of frogs , " he said .
" In exposed populations , it looks like there are frogs breeding but , in fact , the population is being very slowly degraded by the introduction of these altered animals . "
Some 80 million pounds of the herbicide atrazine are applied annually in the United States on corn and sorghum to control weeds and increase crop yield , but such widespread use also makes atrazine the most common pesticide contaminant of ground and surface water , according to various studies .
More and more research , however , is showing that atrazine interferes with endocrine hormones , such as estrogen and testosterone -- in fish , amphibians , birds , reptiles , laboratory rodents and even human cell lines at levels of parts per billion .
Recent studies also found a possible link between human birth defects and low birth weight and atrazine exposure in the womb .
As a result of these studies , the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) is reviewing its regulations on use of the pesticide .
Several states are considering banning atrazine , and six class action lawsuits have been filed seeking to eliminate its use .
The European Union already bars the use of atrazine .

Hayes 's studies in the early 2000s were the first to show that the hormonal effects of atrazine disrupt sexual development in amphibians .
Working with the African clawed frog , Hayes and his colleagues showed in 2002 that tadpoles raised in atrazine - contaminated water become hermaphrodites -- they develop both female ( ovaries ) and male ( testes ) gonads .
This occurred at atrazine levels as low as 0.1 parts per billion ( ppb ) , 30 times lower than levels allowed in drinking water by the EPA ( 3 ppb ) .
Subsequent studies showed that native leopard frogs ( Rana pipiens ) collected from atrazine - contaminated streams in the Midwest , including from areas up to 1,000 miles from where atrazine is applied , often had eggs in their testes .
And many males had lower testosterone levels than normal females and smaller than normal voice boxes , presumably limiting their ability to call mates .
Hayes ' research also established that many frogs in Midwestern streams contaminated by atrazine and other pesticides have compromised immune systems , leading to increased mortality from bacterial disease .
Those early studies were hampered by the inability to easily distinguish genetically male from genetically female frogs .
Male frogs have two identical sex chromosomes ( ZZ ) while females have both a Z and a W -- the opposite of XX female and XY male humans .
But because all frog chromosomes look the same under a light microscope , it 's not simple to distinguish male from female .
To overcome this , Hayes ' colleague Roger Liu developed a line of all - male frogs so that the genetics would be unequivocal .
" Before , we knew we got fewer males than we should have , and we got hermaphrodites .
Now , we have clearly shown that many of these animals are sex- reversed males , " Hayes said .
" We have animals that are females , in the sense that they behave like females :
They have estrogen , lay eggs , they mate with other males .
Atrazine has caused a hormonal imbalance that has made them develop into the wrong sex , in terms of their genetic constitution . "
Coincidentally , another lab in 2008 discovered a sex - linked genetic marker in Xenopus , which has allowed Hayes to confirm the genetic sex of his frogs .
In Hayes ' study , where 40 frogs lived for about three years after hatching in water with 2.5 ppb atrazine , about 10 percent of the frogs appeared to be resistant to the effects of the pesticide .
In ongoing studies , Hayes is investigating whether this apparent resistance is inherited , as well as whether the sex - reversed males have more susceptible offspring .
Syngenta , which manufactures atrazine , disputes many of these studies , including Hayes ' , that show adverse effects of the presticide .
But Hayes said that " when you have studies all over the world showing problems with atrazine in every vertebrate that has been looked at -- fish , frogs , reptiles , birds , mammals -- all of them can't be wrong . "
" What people have to realize is that , just as with taking pharmaceuticals , they have to decide whether the benefits outweigh the costs , " he said .
" Not every frog or every human will be affected by atrazine , but do you want to take a chance , what with all the other things that we know atrazine does , not just to humans but to rodents and frogs and fish ? "
Hayes ' long - term studies of the effects of atrazine on frogs have been assisted by many UC Berkeley undergraduate students , including co-authors on the current paper : Vicky Khoury , Anne Narayan , Mariam Nazir , Andrew Park , Lillian Adame , Elton Chan , and graduate students Travis Brown , Daniel Buchholz , Sherrie Gallipeau and Theresa Stueve .
The work was funded by the Park Water Co. , Mitch Kapor , Freada Klein , the Mitch Kapor Foundation , the David Foundation , the Cornell - Douglas Foundation , the Wallace Foundation , the UC Berkeley Class of ' 43 endowed chair and the Howard Hughes Biology Fellows Program .

Introduction
This article attempts to give a relatively informal understanding of " free " structures from algebra / category theory , with pointers to some of the formal material for those who desire it .
The later sections make use of some notions from category theory , so some familiarity with its basics will be useful .
Algebra
What sort of structures are we talking about ?
The distinction between free structures and other , non -free structures , originates in abstract algebra , so that provides a good place to start .
Some common structures considered in algebra are :
Monoids consisting of A set An identity A binary operation And satisfying the equations
Groups consisting of A monoid An additional unary operation satisfying
Rings consisting of A set A unary operation
Two binary operations Distinguished elements such that is a group is a monoid
So , for algebraic structures , we have sets equipped with operations that are expected to satisfy equational laws .
Free algebraic structures
Now , given such a description , we can talk about the free structure over a particular set ( or , possibly over some other underlying structure ; but we 'll stick with sets now ) .
What this means is that given , we want to find some set , together with appropriate operations to make the structure in question , along with the following two criteria :
There is an embedding
The structure generated is as ' simple ' as possible .
should contain only elements that are required to exist by and the operations of the structure .
The only equational laws that should hold for the generated structure are those that are required to hold by the equational laws for structures of that type .
So , in the case of a free monoid ( from here on out , we 'll assume that the structure in question is a monoid , since it 's simplest ) , the equation should not hold unless , or .
Further , for all , and , and ( and these should all be distinct , except as required by the monoid laws ) , but there should be no ' extra ' elements of in addition to those .
For monoids , the free structure over a set is given by the monoid of lists of elements of that set , with concatenation as multiplication .
It should be easy to convince yourself of the following ( in pseudo - Haskell ) :
M = [ S ] e = [ ]
* = ( ++ ) i : S -> [ S ] i x = [ x ] -- i x = x : [ ] [ ] ++ xs = xs = xs ++ [ ] xs ++ ( ys ++ zs ) = ( xs ++ ys ) ++ zs xs ++ ys = ys ++ xs iff xs == ys || xs == [ ] || ys == [ ] -- etc .
The category connection
Free structure functors
One possible objection to the above description ( even a more formal version thereof ) is that the characterization of " simple " is somewhat vague .
Category theory gives a somewhat better solution .
Generally , structures - over - a- set will form a category , with arrows being structure - preserving homomorphisms .
" Simplest " ( in the sense we want ) structures in that category will then either be initial or terminal , [ 1 ] and thus , freeness can be defined in terms of such universal constructions .
In its full categorical generality , freeness is n't necessarily categorized by underlying set structure , either .
Instead , one looks at " forgetful " functors [ 2 ] from the category of structures to some other category .
For our free monoids above , it'd be :
The functor taking monoids to their underlying set .
Then , the relevant universal property is given by finding an adjoint functor :
, ⊣
being the functor taking sets to the free monoids over those sets .
So , free structure functors are left adjoint to forgetful functors .
It turns out this categorical presentation also has a dual : cofree structure functors are right adjoint to forgetful functors .
Algebraic constructions in a category
Category theory also provides a way to extend specifications of algebraic structures to more general categories , which can allow us to extend the above informal understanding to new contexts .
For instance , one can talk about monoid objects in an arbitrary monoidal category .
Such categories have a tensor product of objects , with a unit object ( both of which satisfy various laws ) .
A monoid object in a monoidal category is then :
An object
A unit ' element '
A multiplication
such that :
Where :
and are the identity isomorphisms for the monoidal category , and
and are the identity isomorphisms for the monoidal category , and is part of the associativity isomorphism of the category .
So , hopefully the connection is clear : we 've generalized the carrier set to a carrier object , generalized the operations to morphisms in a category , and equational laws are promoted to being equations about composition of morphisms .
Monads
One example of a class of monoid objects happens to be monads .
Given a base category , we have the monoidal category :
Objects are endofunctors
Morphisms are natural transformations [ 3 ] between the functors
The tensor product is composition :
The identity object is the identity functor , , taking objects and morphisms to themselves
If we then specialize the definition of a monoid object to this situation , we get :
An endofunctor
A natural transformation
A natural transformation
which satisfy laws that turn out to be the standard monad laws .
So , monads turn out to be monoid objects in the category of endofunctors .
Free Monads
But , what about our intuitive understanding of free monoids above ?
We wanted to promote an underlying set , but we have switched from sets to functors .
So , presumably , a free monad is generated by an underlying ( endo ) functor , .
We then expect there to be a natural transformation , ' injecting ' the functor into the monad .
In Haskell , we can write the type of free monads over Haskell endofunctors as follows :
data Free f a = Return a | Roll ( f ( Free f a ) ) instance Functor f =>
Monad ( Free f ) where return a = Return a Return a >>= f = f a Roll ffa >>= f = Roll $ fmap ( >>= f ) ffa -- join ( Return fa ) = fa -- join ( Roll ffa ) = Roll ( fmap join ffa ) inj :: Functor f => f a ->
Free f a inj fa = Roll $ fmap Return fa
This should bear some resemblance to free monoids over lists .
Return is analogous to [ ] , and Roll is analogous to ( :) .
Lists let us create arbitrary length strings of elements from some set , while Free f lets us create structures involving f composed with itself an arbitrary number of times ( recall , functor composition was the tensor product of our category ) .
Return gives our type a way to handle the 0 - ary composition of f ( as [ ] is the 0 - length string ) , while Roll is the way to extend the nesting level by one ( just as ( :) lets us create ( n+1 ) - length strings out of n- length ones ) .
Finally , both injections are built in a similar way :
inj_list x = ( : ) x [ ] inj_free fx = Roll ( fmap Return fx )
This , of course , is not completely rigorous , but it is a nice extension of the informal reasoning we started with .

Notes
Universal constructions
Initial ( final ) objects are those that have a single unique arrow from ( to ) the object to ( from ) every other object in the category .
For instance , the empty set is initial in the category of sets , and any one - element set is final .
Initial objects play an important role in the semantics of algebraic datatypes .
For a datatype like :
data T = C1 A B C | C2 D E T
we consider the following :
A functor ,
, F - algebras which are : An object An action
Algebra homomorphisms
These are given by such that
The datatype T is then given by an initial F - algebra .
This works out nicely because the unique algebra homomorphism whose existence is guaranteed by initiality is the fold or ' catamorphism ' for the datatype .
Intuitively , though , the fact that T is an F - algebra means that it is in some sense closed under forming terms of shape F --- suppose we took the simpler signature FX = 1 +
X of the natural numbers ; then both Z = inl ( ) and Sx = inr x can be incorporated into Nat .
However , there are potentially many algebras ; for instance , the naturals modulo some finite number , and successor modulo that number are an algebra for the natural signature .
However , initiality constrains what Nat can be .
Consider , for instance , the above modular sets 2 and 3 .
There can be no homomorphism :
but
but
but
This is caused by these algebras identifying elements in incompatible ways ( 2 makes SSZ = Z , but 3 does n't , and 3 makes SSSZ = Z , but 2 does n't ) .
So , the values of an initial algebra must be compatible with any such identification scheme , and this is accomplished by identifying none of the terms in the initial algebra ( so that h is free to send each term to an appropriate value in the target , according to the identifications there ) .
A similar phenomenon occurs in the main section of this article , except that the structures in question have additional equational laws that terms must satisfy , so the initial structure is allowed to identify those , but no more than those .
By the same argument , we can determine that 3 is not a final algebra .
Nor are the naturals ( for any modular set M , S( h ( M - 1 ) ) = S ( M - 1 ) = M , but h ( S ( M - 1 ) ) = h0 = 0 ) .
The final algebra is the set {0} , with S0 = 0 and Z = 0 , with unique homomorphism hx = 0 .
This can be seen as identifying as many elements as possible , rather than as few .
Naturally , final algebras do n't receive that much interest .
However , finality is an important property of coalgebras .
Forgetful functors
The term " forgetful functor " has no formal specification ; only an intuitive one .
The idea is that one starts in some category of structures , and then defines a functor by forgetting part or all of what defines those structures .
For instance :
, where is any category of algebraic structures , and U simply forgets about all of the n-ary operations and equational laws , and takes structures to their underlying sets , and homomorphisms to functions over those sets .
, where is any category of algebraic structures , and U simply forgets about all of the n-ary operations and equational laws , and takes structures to their underlying sets , and homomorphisms to functions over those sets . , which takes a group and forgets about the inverse operation to give a monoid .
This functor would then be related to " free groups over a monoid " .
Natural transformations
The wiki article gives a formal definition of natural transformations , but a Haskell programmer can think of a natural transformation between functors F and G as :

From the U.S. Treasury Department ’s latest numbers of major foreign holders of treasury securities , we see that China owned $ 877.5 billion and Japan owned $ 768.50 billion in February 2010 .
From their historical data , we see that China overtook Japan as the largest foreign holder of treasury securities as recently as September 2008 , the month that the world ’s economic system was thrown into turmoil by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the stock and real estate market .
However , Japan is n’t the second - largest holder of U.S. treasury securities — the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank of New York is .
That is , one of the 12 member banks of the illegal privately owned Federal Reserve System of the United States .
From their official numbers on April 21 , 2010 , they owned $ 771.57 billion in U.S. treasury securities — $ 3 billion more than Japan did in February .
Their parent organization , the Federal Reserve , lies about interest - free United States Notes , the currency that Congress issued to fund the Civil War , when the bankers were demanding 20 - 30 % interest .
While United States
Notes did n’t benefit the bankers , they clearly benefitted the American people , by not having to pay any interest during their entire lifetime , including to this very day .
On the other hand , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is receiving interest from their $ 771 billion in treasury securities , and as a member bank of the Federal Reserve , it receives a 6 % annual dividend on its stock in the Federal Reserve System , with the proceeds going to private interests .
Even calculating with the current all - time low Federal Funds Rate of 0.25 % on all the bank ’s $ 771 billion in treasury securities , that ’s nearly $ 2 billion a year in interest that could be saved by this and future generations , which will be compounded every year , and will reach $ 15 - 50 billion when annual interest rates reach a more historically recent level of between 2 - 6 % .

Digital radio station BBC 6 Music is one of those under threat Union leaders have warned of industrial action after reports that the BBC is planning to close two national radio stations and scale back its website .
The broadcasting union Bectu and the National Union of Journalists ( NUJ ) accused the BBC of bowing to pressure from politicians and commercial rivals .
According to the reports , BBC Asian Network and 6 Music will be axed as part of the cost - cutting proposals .
The corporation said details of the strategy review had yet to be agreed .
Leaders of Bectu and the NUJ said they met a BBC director on Friday and were told the reports in the Times newspaper were " largely correct " .
They expect to meet the BBC 's director general Mark Thompson next week .
' Political climate '
In addition to the reported closure of BBC Asian Network and 6 Music , the BBC is to reduce the number of its web pages by half and cut online staff by a quarter , the reports said .
The moves , according to the Times , are part of a strategic review which places quality ahead of quantity .
Imported TV shows and sport are also set to be cut .
These cuts will result not just in the loss of hundreds of jobs , but the loss of valuable , quality output aimed at young people and the Asian communities
Jeremy Dear , NUJ
' Leaked ' review - at a glance Reaction to rumoured BBC cuts
The proposals would reportedly yield savings of £ 600 m , which could be redirected to higher quality programming .
Some commentators have said the BBC 's plans were an appeasement to an anticipated Conservative government that believes the BBC should be cut down to size .
Gerry Morrissey , Bectu 's general secretary , said the union would oppose the closures and claimed the BBC was " being bounced by its competitors and by the political climate ahead of the upcoming general election " .
NUJ general secretary Jeremy Dear said the union would " fight the cuts with all its might " .
" If true , these cuts will result not just in the loss of hundreds of jobs , but the loss of valuable , quality output aimed at young people and the Asian communities , " he said .
" We will do everything that 's required , including taking industrial action , if necessary , to defend jobs at the BBC . "
' Cultural vandalism '
The BBC said speculation was premature and the proposals would be presented to the BBC Trust in the near future .
If approved , they are then expected to be put out for public consultation .
Despite the lack of confirmation over the fate of the digital radio stations , their supporters have spoken out against the leaked proposals .
Phill Jupitus , who was the first breakfast show host on the station , writes in Saturday 's Guardian : " Cutting 6 Music is an act of cultural vandalism , and an affront to the memory of John Peel . "
Sunny Hundal , editor of Asians in Media magazine , told BBC 5 live that cutting the Asian Network would deprive listeners of a valuable place where Asian content was integrated with mainstream output .
" There are a lot of people in Britain who produce hybrid British - Asian music and culture and they want to see some of that culture on display , " he said .
David Elstein , former chief executive of Channel 5 , said the corporation would face greater pressure after the general election , which is expected in May .
" I tend to regard this as trying to look smaller without ever actually being smaller , " he told BBC Radio 4 .
" The BBC 's income is n't actually going to go down .
" The bigger issue by far is that the BBC 's income continues to rise every year .
So the key issue that its critics have raised - which is the sheer size of the BBC - has not been addressed and I suspect that that will be addressed for the first time seriously after the election . "

Arizona may be the first state to criminalize illegal immigrants .
With an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants living in the state the prospect of criminalizing all of them is in one word " incredible . "
Over the years the state lawmakers have attempted similar laws but now with a new republican governor , this may happen .
The bill works by using the state 's trespassing law and by requiring police to try to determine the immigration status of a person when there 's reasonable suspicion they are in the country illegally .
The sponsor of the bill Republican Sen. Russell Pearce of Mesa explained that " The greatest threat to our neighborhoods is the illegal alien invasion , " He further stated that some illegal immigrants who are criminals bring violence and other crimes to the United States .
Supporters argue that the bill is necessary because of the lax enforcement of immigration was by the federal government .
Opponents say that the law appears to violate constitutional rights and woud lead to racial profiling .
Many of the state 's local police have long resisted the concept of conducting day - to - day immigration enforcement .
They believe that this new repressibility would overburden their staff and create distrust among immigrants , who would fear the police and not assist in any ongoing investigation .
" We are not anti-immigration enforcement , " said Kingman Police Chief Robert DeVries , who is against the bill .
" We are just concerned about some of the responsibilities that are being pushed on us and how it affects our ability to provide day - to - day services in our communities . "
According to Jennifer Allen , director of the Border Action Network , an immigrant rights group based in southern Arizona " Bills like this that cast a net so wide are guaranteed to trap U.S. citizens , "
First - offense trespassing by an illegal immigrant would be a top - tier misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail .
Subsequent violations would be mid-tier felonies that would carry a penalty of one - and - a - half to three years in prison .
The proposal would ban what anti-immigration groups call sanctuary polices — local rules that discourage or restrict officers from questioning immigrants .

WASHINGTON — With Democratic Congressional leaders and the White House struggling on Wednesday to finalize the details of major health care legislation , House Democrats were desperately trying to prevent another of President Obama ’s top legislative priorities – an ambitious overhaul of student loan programs – from becoming a casualty of the health care battle .
But Democrats in the Senate , where the private student lending industry has strong allies , predicted on Wednesday night that the education bill would not be part of an expedited budget measure containing the final revisions to the health care legislation .
Some Democrats said that such a move would stall the student loan changes at a minimum for several months , and perhaps kill the overhaul altogether .
Mr. Obama ’s plan would end a program in which the government pays private , for - profit student lending companies to make risk - free loans using taxpayer money .
Instead , the proposed overhaul would broaden the government ’s existing direct - lending program , saving billions of dollars that the president had proposed using to expand Pell grant scholarships for low - income students .
The House adopted a bill that included the president 's proposal in September , beating back an intense lobbying effort by the for - profit lenders .
But given the industry 's allies in the Senate it was clear the bill could not win the needed 60 votes .
Instead , legislative leaders had planned to use the budget reconciliation process to circumvent a filibuster and approve the education measure with a simple majority vote .
The White House wo n’t deny reports claiming that it authorized the killing of an American citizen who is purportedly involved in planning al Qaeda attacks and is said to be hiding out in Yemen .
The New York Times and the Washington Post reported late Tuesday that Muslim cleric Anwar al - Awlaki was added to the CIA ’s list of alleged terrorists the US has targeted to kill .
American forces have killed myriad suspected terror suspects using armed drone planes in Pakistan , Afghanistan and Yemen .

CBS News ’ Mark Knoller noted that the White House had issued no denial of the report by Wednesday morning .
al - Awlaki was born in New Mexico and served for years as an imam in the United States .
He has not been charged with a crime , but was linked by US officials to Maj .
Nidal Malik Hasan , the psychiatrist alleged to have killed 13 at an Army base in Fort Hood and Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , the so - called “ Christmas day ” bomber who attempted to detonate a jetliner en route to Detroit .
“ No WH denial to reports in NYT & WP that Obama Administration has authorized the targeting killing of American citizen tied to Al Qaeda , ” Knoller wrote on his Twitter feed .
The Times noted that the policy of killing Americans abroad is generally alien to US law .
“ It is extremely rare , if not unprecedented , for an American to be approved for targeted killing , officials said , ” the Times ‘ Scott Shane wrote .
“ A former senior legal official in the administration of George W. Bush said he did not know of any American who was approved for targeted killing under the former president . ”
Obama ’s Director of National Intelligence , Dennis Blair , announced in February that the United States may target its own citizens abroad for death if it believes they are associated with terrorist groups .

“ We take direct action against terrorists in the intelligence community , ” Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair told the House Intelligence Committee .
He said US counter - terrorism officials may try to kill American citizens embroiled in extremist groups overseas with “ specific permission ” from higher up .
If “ we think that direct action will involve killing an American , we get specific permission to do that , ” Blair said in response to questions from the panel ’s top Republican , Representative Pete Hoekstra .
Blair ’s comments came after The Washington Post reported that US President Barack Obama had embraced predecessor George W. Bush ’s policy of authorizing the killing of US citizens involved in terrorist activities overseas .

“ After the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , Bush gave the CIA , and later the military , authority to kill U.S. citizens abroad if strong evidence existed that an American was involved in organizing or carrying out terrorist actions against the United States or U.S. interests , military and intelligence officials said , ” the Post said .
“ The evidence has to meet a certain , defined threshold .
The person , for instance , has to pose ‘ a continuing and imminent threat to U.S. persons and interests , ’ said one former intelligence official .
“ The Obama administration has adopted the same stance .
If a U.S. citizen joins al - Qaeda , ‘ it does n’t really change anything from the standpoint of whether we can target them , ’ said a senior administration official .
‘ They are then part of the enemy . ' ”

An earlier wrinkle in the US drone policy published in the Nation alleged that the US has used the security firm Blackwater in its targeted killing program , as part of a US effort to deny it has on the ground troops in that country .

Ms. FERRIGNO :
The fact that the ice shelves are changing on the peninsula is a significant signal that global change , climate warming , is affecting the ice cover of Antarctica .
It ’s affecting first the area that ’s towards the north , that ’s slightly warmer , but the effect of the warming has traveled from the northern part of the peninsula to the southern part of the peninsula , where it ’s colder . …
“ RAZ : Give us a sense of how much ice [ on the Antarctic peninsula ] has been lost over the past , say , 10 years .
Ms. FERRIGNO : I think I ’ll go back 20 years , and in the last 20 years , I would say at least 20,000 square kilometers of ice has been lost , and that ’s comparable to an area somewhere between the state of Texas and the state of Alaska .
RAZ : So about the size of the state of Texas in terms of ice has been lost in the past 20 years . ”
It gets better .
Ms. FERRIGNO : Well , this is a fairly small amount of ice when you consider the whole Antarctic continent consists of about 13 million square kilometers of ice .
RAZ : I mean , it sounds so dramatic , the size of Texas , right ?
( Soundbite of laughter ) Ms. FERRIGNO : It is .
It is very dramatic , and it is larger than the size of Texas , but when you consider the entire Antarctic ice sheet , it ’s still a fairly minimal amount .
But the thing that we ’re really interested in seeing is that this is a sort of a red flag because if the warming continues , if the retreat continues , if the amount of ice on the continent starts to flow into the water , then there will be substantial impact to the sea level .
RAZ : That ’s Jane Ferrigno .
She is a scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey .
Jane Ferrigno , thanks for coming in .
Ms. FERRIGNO : Thank you .
Ms. Ferrigno might do well to have a look at this map of the USA and Antarctica compared at Texas A&M University ’s Polar Science program to get a sense of scale .
Here ’s the story on all the Southern hemisphere sea ice , which includes all Antarctic sea ice , from Cryosphere today :
Maybe Ms. Ferrigno will be embarrassed enough by her geographic ineptitude and will heed Gavin Schmidt ’s advice and stop trying to “ persuade the public “ .
======================================
UPDATE :
Statement from USGS :
The comment by Jane in the NPR interview was an honest mistake .
We are sorry for the delay in responding to your email , but Jane has been out of the office .
Below is an apology and clarification statement that will be posted on the NPR site soon .
Jane will be in the office later today , and if you have any questions , please let me or her know .
From Jane …
I want to apologize to NPR and the listening audience for my misstatement last Sunday , February 28 .
During the last 20 years , an area more than 20,000 sq. km. ( comparable to the size of New Jersey ) has broken off the ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula .
It is the Antarctic Peninsula , the source of the ice loss , that I meant to say was larger than the state of Texas but smaller than the state of Alaska .
Thank you ,

ALMATY ( Reuters ) - A browser that bypasses censors has become the most popular way to access the Internet in Kazakhstan , a Central Asian state where sites critical of the government are often blocked , a Web statistics firm said .
The Norwegian developed Opera browser made by Opera Software has increased its market share sharply in the ex-Soviet state since it began to allow downloads of compressed web pages via a server outside the country -- a feature designed to speed browsing .
The Opera browser is now the most popular in the country with a market share of 32 percent , beating out rival products from Google , Microsoft and Apple , according to statistics for March from Web analytics firm StatCounter .
The browser has increased its popularity by 60 percent in the past year alone , Opera Software said .
Kazakhstan introduced a law last year allowing local courts to block access to Web sites whose content has been deemed “ illegal , ” a step that human rights groups say amounts to censorship .
Some of the most popular blogging websites such as Livejournal.com and Google - run Blogger.com are now inaccessible to most of Kazakhstan ’s 3.2 million Internet users .
Both Livejournal.com and Blogger.com host blogs run by opponents of Nursultan Nazarbayev , Kazakhstan ’s leader for 20 years who wields sweeping powers and is never criticized by domestic mainstream media .
However , the new edition of Opera introduced last year , Opera 10 , allows users to view otherwise inaccessible Web pages using its Opera Turbo feature designed to speed up browsing over slow connections .
Kazakhstan ranked among the world ’s top 10 countries by the number of Opera Turbo users in January , according to a report by Opera Software .
The Norwegian software developer , however , does not advertise the “ anti-censorship ” feature of its product or see it as its key to success in Kazakhstan .
“ We link such growth to the release of several new versions of Opera 10.x within the last year that perform significantly better than our earlier products , ” Opera Software spokesman Vladimir Isayev said in an email .
“ As for accessing blocked resources -- we do not comment on that . ”

This is the iPhone cover my wife knitted for me .
I get comments on it all the time .
And the best thing about it ?
It 's larger on the inside than it is on the outside !
Plus , you always have extra time to talk on the phone , and if you lose it , you can go back in time to see where you left it .

Had Lloyd Blankfein not decided to become the chief executive of one of the world ’s most powerful and loathed financial institutions , he might ’ve been an actor .
Not only is he good at delivering powerful monologues , as we saw at yesterday ’s Senate hearing , but he has such an expressive face : a rubbery visage able to register an astonishingly wide array of emotions — anger , confusion , joy , horror , despair , contempt — instantly and seemingly effortlessly .
“ He is an excellent witness to photograph because his emotions come out of his face , ” says Chip Somodevilla , a photographer for Getty Images who took many shots of Blankfein yesterday .
“ I ’ve been working in Washington and photographing people for 10 years , and he is one of the best .
He gestures a lot , he has a lot of expressions .
He can become very animated and excited when he ’s talking about something that he likes .
And he ’s got this thing where he kind of squints his right eyes and cocks his left eyebrow .
Like he can’t believe you asked that question , but he ’s really listening so he can answer it .
He ’s a very animated guy . ”
To celebrate this underappreciated talent , our photo editor Jed has compiled a number of his expressions yesterday into an animated GIF , after the jump .
Lloyd : May he never get Botox .
For a while he seemed to be Barack Obama in reverse .
Whereas the American president was elected with such stratospheric expectations that the only way was down , South Africa 's Jacob Zuma came to power in a fog of anxiety and misgivings , ensuring that an early lack of gaffes or scandals would give his sceptics a pleasant surprise .
He made the right noises about dealing with township poverty and the political crisis in Zimbabwe .
He gave a speech on Aids that was hailed by campaigners for burying the ghost of former president Thabo Mbeki 's flirtation with denialism .
Even Helen Zille , the feisty leader of the opposition , had to admit that Zuma has charm .
So when he married his third wife in January , barely an eyebrow was raised .
South Africa seemed at ease with its polygamous Zulu president .
But a storm was brewing .
A few weeks later , the thunder came .
A Sunday newspaper revealed that Zuma had fathered a child in an adulterous relationship with the daughter of a family friend .
Zille and other opposition politicians were quick to seize on the discrepancy between Zuma 's Aids rhetoric and his unsafe sex practices .
This was his 20th child , as far as is known .
One columnist noted : " President Jacob Zuma risks being remembered as Father of the Nation , but for all the wrong reasons . "
The debacle was compounded when , like many politicians before him , Zuma misjudged the national mood by condemning journalists for probing his private life and " questioning the right of the child to exist " .
As criticism swelled and the lack of support from his party became telling , he was forced to back down and eventually issue a full apology for the damage done .
Then came Zuma 's state of the nation address to the South African parliament , rescheduled for prime time television on the 20th anniversary of Nelson Mandela 's release from prison .
It is not the first time that Zuma has sought to bask in the glow of the national saint .
Mandela himself was in the parliament building in Cape Town to hear the speech , which is a bit like trying to dazzle while George Washington is sitting in the front row .
Unfortunately , Zuma was now the one who had set expectations impossibly high .
His speech , in the view of most critics , was a lacklustre dud , as he stumbled over words and failed to provide either soaring poetry or meat in the sandwich .
The veteran journalist and political analyst Allister Sparks said : " The combination of ' Babygate ' and that hugely uninspiring speech has left our president looking like a pricked balloon – and the nation feeling deflated with him . "
Zuma 's party , the African National Congress , unites admirably at election time but currently resembles a fragile and fractious alliance .
The left is at odds with the right ; the trade unions and communists are clashing with the party 's outspoken youth league .
There are calls for a strong leader to impose discipline .
But Zuma , says Sparks , is already " a lame - duck president in the first year of his first term .
Will there be a second term , or will Zuma be dumped in 2012 ?
At this point the only certainty is continued uncertainty . "
Another commentator , Richard Calland , wrote in the Mail & Guardian newspaper : " Faced with a lame duck president , some are already reaching the conclusion : Zuma should go – and go now . "
So far , so familiar to any student of the warp and woof of western politics .
But every country has its own etiquette .
Before his speech , Zuma was led into parliament by an imbongi – a traditional poet – singing his praises with gusto from beneath a crown of porcupine quills .
­Winnie Madikizela - Mandela , according to one newspaper report , caused a major logistical headache by taking a seat reserved for Zuma 's first wife .
Then , with parliament last week responding to Zuma 's address , the opposition MP Mluleki George , of the Cope party , said : " It appears that the nation is being deliberately led to lawlessness , with absolutely no morals and respect for its people . "
The deputy speaker of the national assembly ordered him to withdraw the remark on the basis that it " creates the impression that the president or his government is inciting lawlessness " .
He refused and opposition MPs from both Cope and the Democratic Alliance staged a walkout in protest .
Among them was Dianne Kohler Barnard , so frustrated by events that she uttered the word " fuck " .
This is not the done thing in the house and she was suspended by her party for five days .
Another case of bad manners then transpired , with much harsher consequences .
Chumani Maxwele , a 25 - year - old sociology student at Cape Town University , was out jogging when he waved away , or showed a middle finger to , a blue - light convoy carrying the president .
Maxwele was allegedly bundled into a police vehicle at gunpoint , had a bag pulled over his head and was intimidated , threatened and taken to court on charges of crimen injuria – the common - law South African crime of " injuring dignity " – and resisting arrest .
Helen Zille , of the Democratic Alliance , said the police actions were " reminiscent of Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe , which the African National Congress is increasingly trying to emulate " .
It was noted that five years ago Mugabe amended Zimbabwe 's traffic legislation to make it a crime to swear or gesture rudely at his motorcade .
Zuma has more challenges to come .
Last week I was at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg for lectures by Madikizela - Mandela and Julius Malema , the president of the ANC youth league .
Malema 's rhetorical flourishes were greeted with cheers , applause , horns , dancing and revolutionary songs , which all felt like more fun than I remember in my university days .
He told the energetic young students : " The struggle is not over .
The struggle is starting now .
The struggle of fighting for the economic emancipation of our people .
The struggle to decolonise the economy of South Africa .
The struggle to take the commanding heights of the economy in the hands of white males into the hands of the people of South Africa . "
Malema has a gift for oratory and for tapping into populist sentiment with a direct and powerful message .
President Zuma is currently in drastic need of the same .
An amazing amateur achievement .
Robert Harrison managed to take extraordinary images of Earth using a cheap digital camera in a box suspended from a small helium - filled balloon .
He started off just wanting an aerial photo of his property but went much higher , up to 35 kilometres , capturing the atmosphere and curvature of the Earth .
A GPS device on the camera let him find where it landed after the balloon burst high in the atmosphere and a parachute deployed .

The further I get away from it , the more I love this post .
My love of claymation cartoons aside , the most important part of that post seems to be this :
There is a lot to say about this team , where they are strong , where they are weak and what these things mean .
However , I do n’t think we will really know what to think about them until everything is all said and done .
I have no idea where this season will end , but the more I think about it the more that ending is necessary to provide the proper reference point for evaluation .
It seems egotistical to gush about your own writing , but what I liked about that post is that I seemed to realize something new about being a sports fan .
It was something that had never come up like that : hindsight is necessary to properly gauge certain things about sports .
Game - by - game reaction is extremely useful and can reveal the true emotions of the season , but to properly grasp things you need to know the ending .
Now that we have that ending , we can really take a hard look at the last 88 games and tell the story .
I ’ll be honest : Monday night did n’t give me the sort of answers I was looking for .
I still do n’t understand Adam Mair or what happened to Tim Connolly , and I might not ever get why this team did n’t “ want it ” as much as Boston did .
I understand the Bruins ’ gameplan and how well it was executed , and I know rage towards Satan and Paille and Chara is pointless , but last night did n’t feel like the last chapter of anything to me .
In fact , since Game Four ended I ’ve been thinking less about the failures in this series and more about The System .
When most Sabres fans talk about The System they think of Lindy Ruff .
It ’s a term he uses to describe the defensive strategies and overall style of the team .
It ’s the gameplan on the ice , something the players have to buy in to and execute well in order for it to be successful .
As fans we often mock The System , especially when we see defensive breakdowns or uninterested players .
Still , the idea of a “ system ” is by nature infallible : it ’s merely the idea of perfect execution , and so anything short of that is the fault of those involved .
It can never be The System , but rather the failures of those unable to fulfill its ideals .
But that ’s not the “ system ” I ’ve been thinking about .
To me “ The System ” is the larger plan for the Sabres , and it ’s working like a charm .
It started with something Chris said to me a few days ago .
He said he could n’t wait to see what Gerbe and Ennis looked like in two years .
Thinking long - term , he figured that was the next logical run for this team .
I agreed with him , but the more I thought about it that statement struck an oddly familiar chord .
Is n’t that what everyone said about guys like Pominville and Roy and Stafford two years ago ?
“ I ca n’t wait to see how they look in two years . ”
That was all we heard once the shock of the Drury and Briere departures wore off .
In fact , the story going into the postseason was very similar to that .
The talk was that the former role players were ready to lead .
Pominville , Roy and Connolly were ready to make a big impact and lead the way .
Where three years ago they were the secondary threats , these players were grown up and ready to be the big guns .
You can argue how accurate that storyline was , but you ca n’t argue with the failures of those players .
The playoff veterans on this team failed to step up , and fringe guys like Tim Kennedy , Tyler Ennis and Nathan Gerbe simply outplayed them this postseason .
Dead end players like Mike Grier and Cody McCormick had more intensity than the big salaried , big name players we were excited about two or three years ago .
So now the Sabres are eliminated from the playoffs , and a lot of fans are disappointed .
They are tired of 9 , 19 and 29 and want to clean house .
They ca n’t wait to see what 13 , 42 and 63 can do in the future .
They are sad but feel there is hope for the future .
There is Miller , there is Myers , and maybe that ’s enough to make something happen if we get lucky .
The more you think about it , that ’s the real System , is n’t it ?
Get fans excited about young talent , and perpetual excitement about the future .
Sell potential rather than results .
This is n’t some tin foil hat theory about Tom Golisano , this is just how it works .
It ’s the same thing we ’ve seen the last couple of years , a cycle that has worked wonders for the organization and kept them afloat during a period where many other sports franchises have suffered huge losses .
It ’s the offseason now , and a lot of fans are angry .
They will demand change , talk about change for a few weeks , grow tired of it and wait to see what happens .
Think about all the fuss about Lindy Ruff last year .
For everyone that talked about firing him , nothing happened and we moved on .
The team signed Steve Montador and Mike Grier , fans complained Darcy did n’t do enough , then forgot about it once training camp started .
Then Miller went on a tear , Myers did n’t regress , and we were all back on board .
It happens every year .
That ’s the cycle we go through as fans ; the team knows that and it ’s only going to happen again .
People will yell and scream about getting rid of Ruff and Regier , but neither are going anywhere .
Darcy has set up the farm system nicely , Lindy does his thing and the team will draft well .
They will lose one UFA defenseman and bring up Weber , re-sign the RFAs and maybe make a mildly surprising UFA pickup .
We will complain they did n’t do enough , but once the season starts back up we will be right there .
Ticket prices will go up slightly , but not enough to completely turn you away from the gate .
The team will get new jerseys and celebrate the team ’s anniversary , and we have a banner to put up .
Ticket sales wo n’t go down , jersey sales will go up , and the team will make the playoffs again if Miller stays healthy .
The team makes a little extra on the home playoff games , and we see what the kids from Portland can do for us .
That ’s The System , and it ’s working quite well if you ask me .
This is a franchise that has learned its lesson in “ going for it ” with a salary at the cap limit .
It does n’t have to do that to be successful , and so it wo n’t .
Instead it will rely on great goaltender and the potential of youth , hoping for a perfect storm of things to win it all .
This is n’t a damning rant against the Sabres organization .
In a way it ’s a respectful tip of the cap to them for figuring out how to play the game .
The audience is captive , the product is sucessful , and they are doing a good job of capitalizing on it .
Still , it is important to understand how these things work .
The world of sports is split right down the middle .
On one side is being a fan .
The cheering , the spectating , the hoping beyond all rationality that this will be the year .
Then there is business of sports .
Providing a product , making money , perpetuating a brand .
Making sure that first side is attractive , then capitalizing on it .
In Buffalo both sides of the sports world do their jobs really well , but I think understanding that latter half of the world is essential .
It ’s not defeatist to say the Sabres are unwilling to spend to the cap ceiling and “ go for it ” every year .
In a way that ’s fiscally irresponsible .
Why waste the money and mismanage your other major asset ( players ) for the sake of one big push .
Now that ’s not to say the Sabres do n’t want to win the Stanley Cup .
Of course they do , they just are n’t going all in anytime soon .
For The System to get them there they need a lot of things to happen right .
It almost happened a few years ago , sure , but those moments are rare .
The goaltending needs to be there , players need to overachieve , and most importantly you need to get really , really lucky .
The Sabres are simply not set up to do what other teams do to improve .
They will not blow things up to get high draft picks like the Penguins and Capitals have done , nor will they sign high - value free agents .
Instead they will stay mediocre and rebuild from within , using the assets they evaluate and try to gain an advantage .
The smarter fans have grown to understand that the Sabres will not be drafting the next Sidney Crosby very soon , and that what Darcy does at the trade deadline has minimal real impact on the team .
Understanding these realities , however , makes me think understanding The System is n’t that far off .
In fact , I think it explains a few other things that have been lingering around this team as well .
When fan perception is that the front office is n’t willing to go “ all in ” year in and year out , they become unwilling to do the same .
The fact of the matter is that something really special happened in this area three years ago .
The Sabres had two very , very sucessful hockey seasons that ended in disapointment , but fan support was never better .
Darcy spent to the cap and the message was clear : this is our chance .
As a result , fans truly embraced this team in a way they have n’t supported a sports team in years .
But we all know how that ended , and how scarred it left some fans .
It is obvious the psychological trauma of losing in this town has left people cynical when it comes to sports .
Sure , you cheer for your team no matter what , but there is always that waiting for the other shoe to drop .
That playoff run the team made , however , felt different .
For some I think they truly forgot to wait for that shoe to drop , they got so caught up in the potential that they were sure “ this was the year . ’
So when it all fell apart , it hurt more than ever .
I think that fresh trauma has left a distinct mark on how fans have treated the Sabres since .
It ’s not that they are n’t as drunk or do n’t want to annoy their season ticket neighbors by cheering , they just do n’t know if the team has it and do n’t want to get too deep until they know for sure .
They ’re not going “ all in ” if they do n’t think the team is doing the same .
The problem is that they are n’t going to see those tell - tale signs that the team is going all out .
Darcy is n’t going to hire a big gun , and we have the players we are going to live and die with .
So we gravitate towards Ryan Miller and Tyler Myers and Thomas Vanek because they are great , and maybe we expect too much from Roy and Pominville and Connolly .
But honestly , what else do we have ?
We have to hope the “ core ” gets things together because we know they are n’t going anywhere .
We have to look at Portland and the rookies that can’t grow a proper beard to come up big in the playoffs even if they have no business leading the way on a professional hockey team .
Not yet , at least .
This post might be completely worthless , but the more I think about it all the more it makes sense .
We are not trapped as sports fans , and I did n’t just reveal that there is no Santa Claus .
Still , I think taking a long , hard look at how all this works is necessary .
What are we getting out of being Sabres fans , and what are they getting out of us ?
The two sides of the sports world can coexist peacefully if they are mutually satisfied .
The System is working for the business side of the Sabres , but are we as fans willing to wait for a perfect storm to get a true chance at something special ?
What happens upstairs and what happens on the ice are completely different , but they directly affect eachother .
This year ’s Sabres have wasted a Vezina - worthy season in net and a Calder winner on the blueline .
Is that okay if we get to see what they look like in two years ?
If The System really exists , is it fair to us ?

When I was growing up , my entire family had glasses , but I did not .
I remember when I was asked by my parents if I had trouble seeing anything , I said : “ yeah things are blurry ” .
I did n’t understand what they meant , but I knew I wanted to get glasses too .
Finally , I was talking to an eye doctor , where they confirmed that I did need glasses .
I was so excited !
Sadly , since then , wearing glasses has become a bit of a pain .
During my teenage years , I would get a new pair of glasses every other year .
That was when my parents ’ benefits allowed them to purchase new glasses for us , so we would update our prescriptions and get a new pair of frames and glasses .
I was always so surprised at how much they cost !
We were very limited by our choice of glasses because there were such a big difference between $ 159 frames and $ 219 frames , let alone $ 289 designer frames !
So we were stuck with about a dozen options , half of which obviously sucked and the rest were just “ meh ” .
But that was the only way to get glasses , and I needed glasses to see , so I always put up with it .
A couple of years ago in college , I found out that I needed to get new glasses , yet again .
At this point , I was no longer underneath my parental coverage , and as such , could not get them to cover the incredibly expensive cost of a new prescription and new glasses .
Even if I got “ cheap ” frames , at about $ 150 , I ’d still have to pay for the lenses , which would double the cost to about $ 300 .
That was money I simply did n’t have .
Luckily , I had been reading a couple of personal finance websites , and one of them mentioned buying glasses online for cheaper .
So I looked at a couple of websites , and wandered around online , cautiously collecting information .
I was hesitant for a couple of reasons .
First , this was a classic “ too good to be true ” situation .
Why would glasses that regularly cost hundreds of dollars be sold for so much cheaper ?
Something must not be right .
Second , even if they were legitimate , how could I guarantee that they would look good on me without trying them on first ?
Despite these hesitations , I decided I would rather invest $ 40 into a potential scam or a crappy pair of glasses rather than drop $ 300 for glasses I did n’t really like .
So I ordered a pair , and I ’ve been wearing them every day for the last two years .
They ’re awesome .
Last week my wife and I decided to get some new glasses yet again .
She had just updated her prescription , and my two - year - old glasses had gotten a little dinged up , so I figured I ’d just re-order the same ones that I already got .
Why not ?
They were only $ 40 !
While looking around at the website , I found another pair that looked interesting , so I ordered them as well .
For the frames and the lenses , they were $ 8 .
Eight dollars .
Not three hundred , not even two hundred .
Eight dollars .
I got them in the mail yesterday , and the prescription is perfect , and the frames look good .
How to order glasses online
The first thing to do is to figure out what kind of glasses you want .
If you ’re happy with the pair that you have , then you can stay at home , but if you want to shop around , hit up your local mall and check out what kind of glasses they have .
Try on a few pairs , find something you like , and then bust out your measuring tape .
When you order glasses online , you ca n’t try them on , but you can compare them to what you have in hand .
So if you find out what looks good on you , you can order a similar shape , and size , and be relatively confident that your new glasses will also look good on you .
Measure the lens width and height , as well as the width of the bridge .
Those three measurements will be the most important .
You can also look at the entire frame width , and the length of the temple arms as well .
All good online glasses retailers will provide the measurements of their products .
Second , you ’re going to need an updated prescription .
Sadly , that ca n’t be outsourced online , so you ’re going to have to go to an optometrist .
I ’ve had excellent luck at our local Costco , but if you have a family eye doctor or a wonderful local small business , feel free to support them .
Make sure that they do more than measure your prescription , as you ’ll want to be sure that your eyes are in a healthy condition .
Your new prescription will give you all the information you need to order new prescription lenses online .
Well , all except one thing .
Your pupillary distance .
So the third thing you have to do is figure out what your pupillary distance is .
This is the distance between your pupils .
It will affect how the lenses fitted to your eyes .
If the measurement is completely off , then you might experience headaches , and the world you see might not be exactly how it is .
But do n’t worry , it is very easy to calculate – as long as you have a friend .
Get a ruler , and have your friend / spouse / co - worker hold it up in front of your eyes while you stare into the distance .
Do n’t look at the ruler , and do n’t look at your friend .
That will bring your eyes closer together .
Measure , in millimeters , how far from the center of one pupil to the other .
The average is 62 mm , but it can range from 50 - 70 +.
Mine was 61 , my wife was 55 .
Fourth , go shopping !
The website we used was zennioptical.com .
If you want more options , the go - to resource for online glasses shopping is glassyeyes.blogspot.com .
He ’s been blogging about buying glasses online for years , and as such , has the best links / resources for shopping for glasses online .
Each website has its own positives and negatives .
Some provide more information but are harder to navigate , and others are cheaper , but less user friendly .
Find one that you ’re comfortable with , and get to ordering !
Fifth , once you found the frames that you like , fill out your lens information using your prescription .
It is all pretty straightforward , as you just copy and paste .
You ’ll also need to input your pupillary distance here as well .
Most websites will also offer you additional options .
For example , at Zenni Optical you have your choice of tinting the lens , adding an anti-reflective coating , or changing the thickness of the lens .
If you ’re ordering a backup pair of glasses , then do n’t bother with any fancy additional options , but once you ’re comfortable ordering online , you might consider getting a thinner lens , especially if you have a high prescription .
This is the “ index ” option .
The standard seems to be about 1.50 , and it gets thinner as the number gets higher ( 1.61 , 1.67 , etc ) .
The $ 8 pair that I got was 1.50 , and since I have a high prescription ( think - 6 in each eye ) , they are really quite thick .
Almost embarrassingly .
But my others are 1.61 , and they are n’t even noticeable .
Sixth , place your order , and wait !
Mine has come in the mail within a week or two .
Mine came in their own case , wrapped in a microfiber cloth for cleaning them .
Have you ordered glasses online ?
Cryptome , a whistleblower site that regularly leaks sensitive documents from governments and corporations , is in hot water again : this time , for publishing Microsoft ’s “ Global Criminal Compliance Handbook , ” a comprehensive , 22 - page guide running down the surveillance services Microsoft will perform for law enforcement agencies on its various online platforms , which includes detailed instructions for IP address extraction .
You can find the guide here ( warning : PDF ) .
not anymore .
Microsoft has demanded that Cryptome take down the guide — on the grounds that it constitutes a “ copyrighted [ work ] published by Microsoft . ”
Yesterday , at 5 pm , Cryptome editor John
Young received a notice from his site ’s host , Network Solutions , bearing a stiff ultimatum : citing the Digital Millenium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , Network Solutions told him that unless he takes the “ copyrighted material ” down , they will “ disable [ his ] website ” on Thursday , February 25 , 2010 .
So far , Young refuses to budge .
Cryptome is no stranger to controversy : last year , when it leaked a detailed surveillance guide from Yahoo , which , embarrassingly enough , included a pricing sheet tallying up the costs of its various services , Yahoo demanded its takedown , also under DMCA .
( The Microsoft guide does n’t contain a pricing list . )
Cryptome refused to back down , and the guide is still up .
Geekosystem swapped emails with Young about the situation , and he said that if Network Solutions follows through and takes Cryptome down on the 25th , “ we will set up elsewhere , arrangements are always ready for that . ”
He had this to say when we asked him what he found most repugnant about Microsoft ’s guide :
Most repugnant in the MS guide was its improper use of copyright to conceal from its customer violations of trust toward its customers .
Copyright law is not intended for confidentiality purposes , although firms try that to save legal fees .
Copyright bluffs have become quite common , as the EFF initiative against such bluffs demonstrates .
Second most repugnant is the craven way the programs are described to ease law enforcement grab of data .
This information would also be equally useful to customers to protect themselves when Microsoft cannot due to its legal obligations under CALEA .
There are other means to maintain confidentiality of legal obligations as lawyers well know .
Claims of copyright violation is merely the cheapest and quickest way to coerce a service provider , no expensive lawyers needed .
And it is a cheap and fast way to hide information from competitors as Yahoo intended with its false copyright claim .
There are many firms with similar obligations to law enforcement who do not use copyright to hide the compliance process —
Cisco for one puts its compliance procedures online , as do others .
We think all lawful spying arrangements should be made public , not necessary the legally - protected information under CALEA .
Microsoft should join the others who openly describe the procedures , and just may do so if there is a public demand for it .
We would like to aid that demand by publishing and refusing to take down the document which provides very important public benefits .
Microsoft ’s lawful compliance guide is one of a dozen or so ( below ) we have published recently and only Microsoft and Yahoo have behaved like assholes — probably because they are more afraid of the authorities than they are of customer wrath , having been burned repeatedly for not being sufficiently official ass - kissing .
So , briefly :
1. Microsoft ’s use of copyright rather than other mechanisms to try to take down the guide [ note that Yahoo tried to do the same thing ] ,
2 . The asymmetry of information Microsoft provides to consumers and law enforcement agencies under CALEA , or the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act , which Cryptome is meant to rectify , and , implicitly ,
3 . The strength and speed of Microsoft ’s response : this past weekend , Cryptome also published electronic surveillance guides from Facebook , AOL , and Skype , among others ( warning : all PDFs ) , but according to Young , none of those companies “ behaved like assholes ” by calling for a takedown , much less by using copyright law to do so .
Since the mid-’90s , Cryptome has been an unrelenting clearinghouse of information , and its all - text , minimalist look bespeaks the Wild West vibe of the early Internet days .
In 2007 , its ISP , Verio , booted it for some of its leaks .
At the time , Young wrote , “ Cryptome is now on a new ISP , Network Solutions , another US giant like Verio , closely linked to the authorities .
We ’ll see if it can take the heat or cave . ”
Well , with the Microsoft surveillance guide leak , the heat is on .
Whether Network Solutions backs down from its takedown threat or enforces it , it ’s not likely that February 25th will be the end for Cryptome : it ’s weathered bigger leaks and fallouts in the past .
Update , 1:47 pm EST : Young has received another notice from Network Solutions asking that he provide a counter - notification in compliance with the DMCA .
His response can be found on Cryptome .
Update 2 , 2:20 pm EST : Well , it looks like Network Solutions did n’t even wait for their February 25th deadline ; Cryptome is down .
They took the site down as soon as they received the counter - notification .
Young says there is a “ NetSol ‘ Legal Lock ’ on the domain name to prevent it being transferred to another ISP until the “ dispute ” is settled ;
All Cryptome pages other than the home page now generate a 404 message . ”
Currently , Cryptome ’s files are being transferred to a new domain , http://cryptomeorg.siteprotect.net;
Young says they will be transferred back when the lock is removed .
( Minor ) Update 3 , 4:30 pm EST : As one Hacker News reader points out , Network Solutions is 4 chan.org ‘s ISP registrar .
How about that .
Update 4 : Wikileaks has offered to host Cryptome for the time being , via Twitter .
“ We will host Cryptome on our multi- jurisdictional network - outside the US - if required . ”
They ’re currently hosting a copy of the surveillance guide .
( warning : PDF . )
Update 5 : Microsoft has withdrawn its copyright complaint against Cryptome , ReadWriteWeb reports .
Update 6 : This is hopefully the end of the Cryptome saga : Cryptome is now back up at Cryptome.org .
So is microsoft - spy.zip , along with brand - new “ spying guides ” for PayPal and MySpace .
Have a tip we should know ?

﻿﻿Thanks to all for the many thoughtful and insightful comments on Whatever happened to programming ?
Stupidly , I did n’t realise that comments would be held for moderation , so it ’s only this morning that I went through and OK ’d them all ( even the ones that say I ’m just whining :-) ) .
There are too many to respond to individually , but since some consistent themes emerged , I wanted to follow up on some of those .
Popular comments , distilled
1 . Poor you , your job must suck !
Sorry , I realise I did n’t really explain this properly .
In truth , I am lucky enough to have one of the relatively few jobs out there that really is largely programming .
I work for a small open - source software house , and what we mostly do is make tools .
So , actually , no , my job does n’t suck .
( Er , except maybe right now , when the dice happen to have fallen in such a way that I am in the middle of my third consecutive documentation project . )
I was aiming for a lament at the state of programming in general .
And of course since my employer actually creates and distributes libraries and web - service components , we have an obligation to make them simple and pleasant to use — to avoid leaving people with Library Fatigue .
You might say that our goal is to provide people with libraries that Just Work , and that provide narrow enough interfaces that you do n’t need a lot of glue .
2 . But you would n’t want to have to write printf ( ) !
No indeed .
I certainly did n’t mean to suggest that there is no place for libraries !
It ’s great to have a set of existing functionality that we can call on whenever we need it .
The problem comes when all you do is glue libraries together .
To put it another way , libraries make excellent servants , but terrible masters .
Somewhere along the line , we let the libraries take over the asylum .
Not good .
Here ’s a rule of thumb ( which , like all such rules , is often broken and should not be taken too seriously ) : beware of anything that calls itself a Framework .
Anything that , instead of providing stuff that you can call , takes over the wheel and tells you what code to provide for it to call .
Not always , but often , that marks the line where this stops being fun .
< rant class=” tangential ” >
In my experience of programming with frameworks — and this goes all the way back to writing Windows 2 GUI applications in raw C with the aid of the appalling Microsoft resource compiler — they do keep their promise of making things very quick and easy … so long as you do things in exactly the way the framework author intended .
The moment you go off - piste , everything goes Pete Tong , and what should be simple is suddenly not merely hard but often impossible .
The framework goes out of its way to prevent you from doing what you intended .
Strange side - effects hamper your efforts .
The hook that you need to get the functionality you want is n’t there .
Your attempt to work around it causes something else , apparently unrelated , to start misbehaving in subtle and unpredictable ways .
Congratulations !
You are now suffering from Framework Fever !
Doctor Taylor prescribes a period of complete rest before building up your strength by working through the exercises in K&R .
( Again : this is not always true of all frameworks .
I hope from the bottom of heart that when I start using Rails , it will prove to be among the exceptions .
But my experience so far does not make me optimistic . )
You know the real problem with frameworks ?
They demo too well .
Someone shows you their favourite framework and demonstrates how you can build 50 % of your application in half an hour !
Great !
That other 50 % ca n’t be hard , can it ?
But it turns out that what looked like 50 % is actually 5 % , and filling in the other 95 % gets exponentially more difficult as you approach the 100 % mark .
Frameworks are great for building toys , and that fools us — again and again — into assuming they ’re good for building products .
</rant >
3 . But libraries help us do things more efficiently !
If only it were that simple .
In the Reddit discussion on this article , Silversmith commented :
﻿﻿You have problem X , consisting of sub- problems X1 , X2 , X3 .
There are readily available solutions for X1 and X3 .
If you do n’t feel like being a bricklayer , code X . I choose to code X2 , plug in solutions X1 and X3 , and spend the rest of the day investigating and possibly solving problem Y .
I admit this sounds great .
Hut here ’s the fallacy : we all assume ( I know I do ) that “ plug in solutions X1 and X3 ” is going to be trivial .
But it never is — it ’s a tedious exercise in impedance - matching , requiring lots of time spent grubbing around in poorly - written manuals that tell you everything the code already told you ( because it was generated with JavaDoc or Rdoc or whatever ) , and none of the high - level stuff that you actually need to be told .
So maybe my initial complaint was not really so much “ whatever happened to programming ? ” as “ why do so many of our libraries suck so much ? ”
The good thing is that ( again , as others have pointed out ) , we are not just pawns in this game .
We are , if not kings and queens , then at least knights and bishops .
We are not , or do n’t need to be , passive consumers of others ’ libraries , but also makers of libraries for the benefit of others as well as ourselves .
We can and should raise the bar .
We need to make every effort to design our libraries in such a way that the programmer is in control and the library is his or her servant .
I think that ’s so important that I am now going to go and have it tattooed on the insides of my eyelids , so that it ’s always before me when I ’m sleeping .
And folks , let ’s write useful documentation .
I do n’t need a 900 - page document that is a recapitulation of the method signatures .
I need a three - page statement of what the library is for , what shape it is , how the bits fit together , why it uses italics so much and where to start .
4 . You sh﻿ould be using Ruby instead !
I ’m working on it !
Seriously , I absolutely agree that different languages , with their different expressive power and especially their different culture , yield very different experiences .
Especially , I have learned that anything that has “ Enterprise ” in its name is so incredibly boring that the people who use it had to shove the name of the Star Trek ship into its title just to keep themselves awake .
( I am convinced that this is the case . )
Better languages and better environments make for a better and more programmingy programming experience .
I ’m in favour of that .
The conclusion of the matter
What chills me to the core is this comment from ﻿﻿ ﻿Jesse :
﻿ ﻿I frequently create custom business and ecommerce applications , and I hardly ever get to do any copy / pasting .
There ’s always a custom report to create , a custom csv to parse , or a custom xml system to integrate ..
That , right there — that ’s what I ’m afraid of .
﻿ Eowyn : I fear neither death nor pain
Aragorn :
What do you fear , my lady ?
Eoywyn : A cage .
Lord deliver us from a career of creating custom reports , parsing custom CSV and integrating custom XML systems .
.
.
.
Addendum
I ’ve just found the discussion of the original Whatever happened … at Hacker News .
Lots of interesting perspectives .
And especially this , from jdietrich , which captures exactly what I ’ve been trying to say :
My biggest gripe with modern programming is the sheer volume of arbitrary stuff I need to know .
My current project has so far required me to know about Python , Django , Google App Engine and it ’s datastore , XHTML , CSS , JQuery , Javascript , JSON , and a clutch of XML schema , APIs and the like .
Do n’t get me wrong , I ’m grateful for all of it , but it just does n’t seem like what I was promised when I followed SICP for the first time .
It just feels like I spend most of my time scouring through documentation and trying to remember umpteen different sets of syntax and class names rather than actually thinking in code .
Back in ye olden days , most programming tasks I performed felt quite natural and painless , just a quiet little chat between me and the compiler .
Sometimes longwinded , sometimes repetitive , but I just sat and though and typed and software happened .
The work I do these days feels more like being a dogsbody at the tower of babel .
I just do n’t seem to feel fluent in anything much any more .
We talk about ‘ flow ’ quite a lot in software and I just have to wonder what ’s happening to us all in that respect .
Just like a conversation becomes stilted if the speakers keep having to refer to their phrasebooks and dictionaries , I wonder how much longer it will be possible to retain any sort of flowful state when writing software .
Might the idea of mastery disappear forever under a constant torrent of new tools and technologies ?
That ’s it exactly .
The UK's main public funders of food - related research and training will today ( 11 March ) join together to launch a new programme aimed at meeting the challenge of providing the world 's growing population with a sustainable , secure supply of good quality food using less land and fewer resources .
The organisations will work together through a new programme - Global Food Security - to coordinate and align their research interests .
By working together to develop strategy and identify shared goals the partners aim to harness the country 's world - leading research base to help to deliver healthy , sustainable food for all .
Already over one billion people globally do not have adequate access to safe and nutritious food .
The world faces a potentially even greater crisis in food security as expected global population growth to over 9 billion is coupled with increasing affluence and urbanisation in rapidly developing countries .
To meet this , the FAO forecasts that world food production will need to increase by 40 % in the next 20 years and 70 % by 2050 .
Global Food Security will bring together the research interests of Research Councils UK , Executive Agencies and Government Departments to deliver coordinated , multidisciplinary research including agricultural production , resource management , food economics , social sciences and nutrition .
Professor John Beddington , the Government 's Chief Scientific Advisor , who is speaking at a reception to launch Global Food Security in London tonight , said : " Food security will present a growing challenge in the decades ahead ..
Recent food price volatility highlights the impacts we will face if we do not respond effectively now to prepare our response .
There is the potential for a full food security crisis in the future .
The growing global population combined with changing consumption patterns and increased urbanisation , set against the backdrop of a changing climate , means we cannot continue with ' business as usual ' .
" Research is crucial to find ways to sustainably meet the increase in demand for food , and to support healthier diets .
This means we need multidisciplinary approaches , fostered through the Global Food Security programme , to increase production sustainably , to ensure a secure supply of healthy , affordable food from less land , less water , fewer inputs and producing less waste and emissions . "
Global Food Security sponsors and partners include five Research Councils , working together as Research Councils UK , the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills , the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs , the Department for International Development , the Government Office for Science , the Scottish Government , the Technology Strategy Board and the Food Standards Agency .
Global Food Security is overseen by a Programme Board that will ensure that its priorities are complementary and add value to other cross- government , third sector , business and international initiatives .
Prof Janet Allen , Chair of Global Food Security Programme Development Board and Director of Research at the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council , said : " By working together the Global Food Security Partners can ensure that we are coordinating a true national programme in food security research , one that cuts across the partners ' remits .
We will be able to address issues across the entire food supply chain , fostering multidisciplinary research and avoiding overlaps or gaps . "
Global Food Security will be made up of four themes : Economic resilience , including trade and competitiveness ; resource efficiency , including reducing inputs and improving efficiency ; sustainable production , including crops , livestock and farm systems ; and sustainable , healthy , safe diets , including food safety and accessibility .
Across all its activities Global Food Security will consider the sustainability of ecosystems related to food production and reducing waste and greenhouse gas emissions throughout the food system .
Prof Allen said : " Across the Global Food Security themes we expect the programme to deliver a range of impacts for the UK and beyond .
These include increased agricultural productivity , new crops able to withstand drought and disease , greater sustainability , reduced incidence of food borne diseases and a better understanding of socio-economic factors in the food chain . "
Prof Alan Thorpe , Chair of Research Councils UK , said : " Research Councils UK are investing in research that addresses the grand challenges for society enabling a more productive economy , healthier people and a sustainable world .
Global Food Security will work closely with our existing programmes such as Living With Environmental Change , Energy , Lifelong Health and Wellbeing and Global Uncertainties as many of the issues require contributions from right across the research base .
Research Councils will work in partnership with other research funders , policy - makers and other stakeholders to deliver the Global Food Security programme . "
Defra Minister Lord Davies said : " We know we need to produce more food in the future and we need to do it sustainably and in a way that is good for our health .
" The Government 's food strategy launched earlier this year made it clear that we need to make changes right along the food chain - from farm to fork - and need to support consumers in making informed decisions about food .
" Bringing the skills and experience of these research funders together will be important in putting in place the practical measures needed to feed the global population in years to come . "
Representing the UK farming community , Peter Kendall , President of the National Farmers ' Union , said : " UK farmers are very well placed to provide solutions to food security , globally as well as closer to home .
But farming can only deliver if the right research is funded and sustained long - term , and then translated into practice .
I am very pleased to see major funders coming together to coordinate the underpinning science .
Now that there is high level Government acceptance of the strategic importance of agriculture , the launch of Global Food Security shows a commitment by public research funders to work together on this critical issue . "

Malcolm McLaren , the former manager of The Sex Pistols and the man who claimed to have invented punk , has died aged 64 .
McLaren died in New York this morning after a long battle with cancer .
His spokesman , Les Molloy , said the impresario had been suffering from cancer for some time and he expected his body would be returned to the UK shortly .
An unashamed self - publicist , McLaren gained notoriety as manager of the Sex Pistols who were propelled to No 1 in the charts with God Save The Queen in 1977 .
Having brought together the roguish band members he went on to become a household name in his own right , entering into the public spotlight again in recent years when he stood for the newly created London mayoralty in 2000 .
His policies included the serving of alcohol in libraries .
Having dropped out of art school – McLaren said the experience taught him " that it is better to be a flamboyant failure than any kind of benign success " – he made a first foray into music management in the early 70s after convincing the New York Dolls to employ him as manager .
The band flopped at the time , but the experiment , complete with red leather and Soviet - style clothes , heralded the start of a career - breaking ground in fashion and music .
McLaren , who was born in North London , frequently professed to leading the capital 's avant garde art scene during the 70s .
He opened a shop in fashionable King 's Road 1971 with his then girlfriend Vivienne Westwood .
The shop was renamed SEX in 1974 and quickly gained iconic status drawing in the " young , sexy , assassins " who would become the Sex Pistols .
The couple had a son , Joseph Corre , the co-founder of lingerie shop Agent Provocateur .
His reputation was carved by the success of the Sex Pistols and an eye for publicity stunts which would grip the British and American culture scene through the 70s .
McLaren also managed a number of other bands , including Bow Wow Wow before producing his own records including the much - sampled track Double Dutch from the 1983 album Duck Rock .
He continued to be involved in the culture and arts scene up until his death , earning him in equal measure acclaim as a doyen of music and design and criticism for his marketing of pop culture .

This image shows the afterglow of GRB 090423 ( the red source in the centre ) and was created from images taken at Gemini -South and the Very Large Telescope
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Whenever you look up at the stars you are looking back in time , as light from even our closest neighbour , Alpha Centauri , started its journey to Earth more than four years ago .
It is a phenomenon that astrophysicists Professor Malcolm Bremer and Dr Ben Maughan from the Department of Physics grapple with daily in their research into deepest space .
As telescopes become ever more powerful , we are able to observe objects closer and closer to the Big Bang .
It is believed that the first stars formed when the Universe was very young - between 200 and 400 million years old - and the nearest we have got to seeing them is 630 million years from the Big Bang , when the Universe was less than five percent of its current age .
The not so elegantly named ‘ GRB 090423 ’ was discovered there , making it the most distant object yet seen in the Universe .
“ GRB 090423 is an example of a gamma ray burst , the brightest and most violent explosions in the Universe , ” explains Bremer , who was involved in the observations .
“ The explosion , which only lasted a matter of seconds , is thought to have accompanied the catastrophic death of a very massive star .
It would have been triggered by the centre of the star collapsing to form a black hole . ”
GRB 090423 was discovered in April 2009 by a robotic spacecraft called Swift that was launched into orbit in 2004 .
The discovery of such a distant gamma-ray burst confirms that massive stellar births - and deaths - occurred in the very early Universe .
Gamma -ray bursts release a tremendous amount of energy in a very short time , but despite GRB 090423 ’s brief appearance , light from the explosion still managed to get here even though it took more than 13 billion years .
However , as Maughan points out , while light years are a convenient shorthand to describe the vast distances to these objects , telling us how long their light has been travelling to reach us , the Universe has been expanding during that whole period , so the Earth and these objects are now even further apart than they were when the light we see was first emitted .
GRB 090423 is the most distant object yet seen in the Universe
Closer to home is the galaxy cluster JKCS041 .
Because matter is not evenly distributed across the Universe , stars form into galaxies and galaxies cluster into groups , which may consist of hundreds or even thousands of galaxies , held together by a gravitational field .
“ You can imagine them being a bit like a swarm of bees buzzing around but not flying apart because they ’re held together by gravity , ” says Maughan .
Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe and at a distance of 10.2 billion light years , JKCS041 - the most distant galaxy cluster yet discovered - beats the previous record holder by about a billion light years .
It sits on the cusp of the distance limit expected for a galaxy cluster , as physicists believe gravity could not have worked fast enough for them to cluster together much earlier .
JKCS041 was originally detected in 2006 in a survey using the UK ’s Infrared Telescope , but it was only identified as a galaxy cluster when data from this and other telescopes were combined with data from NASA ’s Chandra X-ray Observatory .
Galaxy clusters are composed of approximately 85 % dark matter , 12 % gas and 3 % star material .
The gas is very hot and , according to the laws of physics , it should evaporate unless there is a strong gravitational field holding it in place , in the same way that the Earth ’s mass provides the gravitational field that holds our atmosphere in place .
The fact that the intergalactic gas does not boil off into space is evidence that there is a massive amount of unseen material - dark matter - providing the gravitational field .
The hot gas emits strong X - rays and detection of these would confirm whether JKCS041 was an established galaxy cluster or one caught in the act of forming .
Maughan analysed the data and verified that the extended X - ray emission seen by Chandra meant that hot gas did indeed exist between the galaxies , as expected for a true galaxy cluster .
Further study of JKCS041 ’s characteristics - its composition , mass and temperature - will reveal valuable information about how the Universe took shape .
Light from the explosion still managed to get here even though it took more than 13 billion years
Maughan was also involved in tracking down a gigantic , previously unknown , assembly of galaxies , located almost seven billion light years away .
The discovery , made possible by combining two of the most powerful ground - based telescopes in the world , provides insight into the ‘ cosmic web ’ and how it formed .
The most widely accepted cosmological theories predict that galactic matter clumps together on a scale even larger than galaxy clusters .
In this ‘ cosmic web ’ , galaxies embedded in filaments of light stretching between inky voids form a gigantic wispy structure .
“ These filaments are millions of light years long , ” explains Maughan , “ creating enormous networks with massive galaxy clusters forming at the busiest intersections .
Lurking like giant spiders , these clusters grow ever larger by greedily consuming the material that is funnelled on to them via the filaments . ”
Astronomers have struggled to determine how these structures come into existence , for although massive filamentary structures have been often observed at relatively small distances from us , solid proof of their existence in the more distant Universe has been lacking .
Now , however , Maughan and the team have come a step closer to finding the evidence they need .
Following the discovery of a filamentary large structure around a distant cluster of galaxies , they used two major ground - based telescopes to study this structure in greater detail .
By measuring the distance from Earth to over 150 galaxies within it they obtained a three - dimensional view of the structure in which they identified several clumps of galaxies surrounding the main cluster .
Some of the clumps are already feeling the fatal gravitational pull of the main cluster and will eventually fall into it .
The filamentary structure is located about 6.7 billion light - years away from us and probably extends beyond the 60 - million - light - year field of view probed by the team .
It is the first time that such a rich and prominent structure has been observed in the distant Universe .
Future observations have already been planned to obtain a definite measure of its size .

The science behind global warming predicts that all the extra energy in the atmosphere will stimulate more extreme weather , both hot and cold .
Just because it is snowing now does n’t mean this has n’t been the hottest decade in thousands of years .
Likewise , just because it sometimes rains in the desert does n’t mean that deserts do n’t exist and are n’t ( generally ) dry .
Or as Colbert put it , “ It is dark outside , so we can only assume that the sun has been destroyed ” .
In related news , one of the scientists at the center of the “ climategate ” email scandal has been cleared of any wrongdoing .
One of his stolen emails mentioned a “ trick ” used to manipulate data , and this was claimed to be evidence of scientific fraud .
But the investigation concluded that “ The so - called ‘ trick ’ was nothing more than a statistical method used to bring two or more different kinds of data sets together in a legitimate fashion by a technique that has been reviewed by a broad array of peers in the field . ”
There was no falsifying of data .

Wrap-up
Here 's the thing about the inch - thick Edge – it 's large .
The size of a netbook large .
It 's not only thicker than most e-readers – three times thicker than the Kindle DX -- but it 's heavier too .
Holding up the three - pound device while lying on a couch was more of an upper body work out than we 'd care for , but we do assume most students will stand it up or lay it flat on a desk .
And like the Motorola Backflip , the Edge has taken some yoga classes : it can do the reverse clamshell and flip its screens so that they lie back to back .
We'd be lying if we said we thought the Edge was attractive .
When closed the glossy white and boxy design continually made us think that it belonged in a sterile hospital room , and its silverish gray trim does n't really do much for us either .
Entourage does plan to offer a variety of colors , but it 's still quite vanilla looking .
The other thing that makes the Edge look like a laptop is the number of ports that surround it : two USB , a micro-USB , mic and headphone jacks , and SIM and SD card slots .
A stylus is tucked into the side , and a curious three megapixel camera lives above the LCD screen .
We looked through Android menus for about 20 minutes before we realized there 's no way to use it -- a future software update will apparently enable camera functionality .
Like the Kindle DX , the Edge's 1200 x 825 - pixel , 9.7 - inch E- Ink screen is spacious and fits more text on the page than the average six - inch reader .
As usual , there 's a fairly long refresh when turning pages and zooming in on text , but we really found the overall reading experience to be pleasant .
It 's easy to page through a book using the physical forward and back buttons , though it would have been nice if finger swipes on the touch - enabled E Ink display did the same .
Speaking of the touch , it 's pretty nice : you can underline / highlight text and jot down notes in the margin or in a separate journal page with the included stylus , and you also can save a marked up page or journal document as a PDF and then easily transfer it to the LCD screen and email it to a friend .
Pretty impressive , but because the screen is E Ink based the writing experience is laggy ; there 's about a second delay until the text shows up .
Those worried about missing a word can always launch the Android audio recorder which uses the Edge 's dual microphones .
They picked up a bit of background noise when we recorded a meeting , but we could clearly make out the conversation .
As an e-reader the Edge is actually solid until it comes to buying books .
Though you can download books over the air from the Entourage Edge store , the selection is lacking compared to Amazon and Barnes & Noble 's e-book stores , not to mention quite expensive .
Entourage says there are over 225,000 trade books , 65 current New York Times best sellers as well and over 1,500 newspapers in its store -- we found some titles by our favorite authors including Nick Hornby and Jodi Picolt , but when searching for others like John Grisham we came up empty handed .
The company is really banking on people using the device to download free ePub books and PDFs from Google Books .
You can actually do this right from the Android browser on the LCD screen ; once you download a book the Edge automatically puts it in your library and will open it on the E Ink display .
You can also sideload content either using the SD slot or by transferring files to the 4GB of onboard memory directly from your desktop .
It 's when you start using the 10.1 - inch Android tablet on the right side that the Edge shows signs of weakness .
While the standard Android 1.6 apps are present and Entourage has also thrown in Docs to Go , the Edge does n't support the Android Marketplace .
Yes , this means no downloading your favorite Android apps , and yes , it sucks .
We felt lost without our go - to internet radio and Twitter apps .
As a consolation , we 're also told that the company is planning on launching its own Android app store for the device soon .
The rest of the Android experience is also quite mediocre .
To its credit the company has added a nice shortcut bar to the home screen with icons to the library , bookstore , browser and e-mail , but the resistive touchscreen gets in the way of smoothly navigating menus and browsing the web .
While we got the hang of having to press harder on the screen and on the virtual keyboard , we seemed to select the wrong links and letters more often than not .
There 's a trackball on the right to make up for it , but it just felt counterintuitive to switch between the screen and the ball .
In the end , the tablet is best used for light web browsing , checking email and listening to some music -- the speakers between the screens are actually fairly loud .
Oh and while the company promises Flash Lite support , we could n't get YouTube videos to play in the browser , and the YouTube app is n't preloaded .
As for performance , we do n't necessarily think the Edge is slow -- it 's just not fast .
It certainly is n't as fast as an Atom netbook or the Snapdragon - powered Nexus One , but the Marvell Armada PXA168 processor was fine for keeping open a few browser tabs and playing some music in the background .
However , it was sluggish when having to backtrack through menus .
WiFi browsing speed was decent ; it took 4 seconds to load Engadget.com .
There 's a SIM slot on the top of the device , but like so much else on the Edge , it has n't been enabled yet .
Battery life is really dependent on what you 're doing .
With WiFi and both screens turned on the Edge only lasted four hours .
That 's pretty awful for an ARM - based tablet like this , but if you turn off the LCD screen in settings – we wish there was a physical switch for this – it should get over 16 hours of standby .
( That 's still less than the Kindle 's three days . )
Oddly , when we closed the device it did n't go to sleep , but this will apparently be fixed in the first firmware update .
Still , you 'll have to charge the Edge quite frequently -- too bad the charger is larger and less portable than most laptop AC adapters .
Yes , the Edge is a combination e-reader and a Android tablet -- it just does n't quite work well as either .
For $ 499 there are just too many issues with it , including its chunky body , skimpy e-book selection , frustrating touchscreen , poor battery life and lack of Android apps .
While promised software updates may yet fix enough issues and enable enough features to perhaps make it a decent textbook replacement for some students , we just can't say that its worth the cash right now .
And so our wait continues .

A practitioner of Chinese medicine has pleaded guilty to selling a banned substance to a woman who went on to develop kidney failure and cancer .
Ying " Susan " Wu , 48 , of Holland - on - Sea in Essex , has been on trial at the Old Bailey for selling pills containing aristolochic acid to a civil servant .
The judge said he accepted Ms Wu had not meant to harm , and that the case highlighted the need for regulation .
Ms
Wu has now been given a conditional discharge .
Patricia Booth , 58 , took the pills , bought at Chelmsford 's Chinese Herbal Medical Centre , for over five years .
She was in her mid-40s when she first sought help from the centre in 1997 for stubborn patches of spots on her face .
The Old Bailey heard the products had been advertised as " safe and natural " .
But they contained a substance - aristolochic acid - which when she was first sold them , should only have been given under prescription , and which was later banned .
Traditionally this would be used maybe once or twice by a doctor who would know about its toxicity , but sometimes it might get into a formulation which is then used by somebody who does n't have this wealth of experience
Professor Monique Simmonds
The court heard Mrs Booth became ill months after she stopped taking the pills .
She was diagnosed with kidney failure , and later with cancer of the urinary tract - both allegedly caused by the pills .
The grandmother , who used to manage a government office of up to 60 people , currently goes to hospital three times each week for dialysis .
She had told the court that she had been advised to take about 30 tiny brown tablets three times each day , returning to the shop every two weeks to buy up to three bottles at a time .
She became friendly with Ms Wu , who was employed at the shop as a " Chinese doctor " until it closed in 2003 .
Ms
Wu , who had initially denied the charges , pleaded guilty to selling prescription only medicines without authorisation and to selling a banned substance .
But an Old Bailey judge ruled that , as the sale of traditional Chinese medicines was totally unregulated , there was no evidence that she knew of the potential harm .
A charge of " administering a noxious substance so as to endanger life or inflict grievous bodily harm " was therefore thrown out .
" Everybody accepts that you did n't know you were breaking the law , " he told Ms Wu .
He added that while the medicine watchdog , the MHRA , tried to make everyone aware of dangers attached to this herb , " it is not a foolproof system and I am certainly not blaming you for the fact you did n't know about these regulations " .
" This means the degree of culpability is very small . "
Regulating practitioners
The Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine , which represents more than 450 practitioners , said the case highlighted " the urgent need for the statutory regulation of herbal medicine in the UK " .
Statutory regulation would ensure that anyone who practises Chinese herbal medicine is suitably qualified and competent , and that all suppliers of herbal medicine are licensed
The Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine The Department of Health is currently considering recommendations for just such regulation , but it is unclear when such a framework will come into force .
Aristolochic acid was banned in July 1999 , having previously been available as a prescription - only drug .
It is a common feature of Chinese medicine , but experts say experienced traditional practitioners would only ever use it sparingly .
There have been recorded incidents of the acid - which has been used for a host of conditions from procuring abortions to treating indigestion - causing kidney problems and cancer in the past .
The most high - profile cases involved 100 incidents of renal disease among patients at a weight loss clinic in Belgium between 1990 and 1992 .
Most required either dialysis or transplantation , while a few died from consumption of the weight - reducing herb .
Professor Monique Simmonds , head of biological interactions at Kew , who examined the pills sold to Mrs Booth , said one of the problems with this substance was that it was unclear at what dose it began to build up in the human body and cause health problems .
The judge said there was no proof
Wu knew of the harm she was causing " Traditionally this would be used maybe once or twice by a doctor who would know about its toxicity , but sometimes it might get into a formulation which is then used by somebody who does n't have this wealth of experience , " she said .
" Traditional Chinese medicine does have a place in the cocktail of medicine available to us , but is is really important we have some kind of regulation - not just in terms of the plant but also the practitioner . "
Emma Farrant of the The Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine , said statutory regulation of all practitioners of herbal medicine " would ensure that anyone who practises Chinese herbal medicine is suitably qualified and competent . "
" Statutory regulation would also ensure that the quality and supply of herbs is tightly controlled under arrangements proposed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency . "
Tracey Brown , managing director of Sense About Science , said : " This case does not show that we need more regulations .
" What this case does show is the need to make a clearer distinction between therapies that are effective and deemed safe for use - medicine - and those which are n't .
It shows the need for proper medical training .
" This is why Sense About Science has objected to Department of Health proposals to introduce a professional registration scheme for herbalists and other practitioners of ' traditional ' medicine .
" Such a scheme would encourage further the idea that practising medicine does not need to involve proper medical training . "

Man charged over LA police ' ambush ' shooting
Deonte Lee Murray is accused of shooting two officers in their car , an attack that was caught on video .
Viacom has decided to pull The Daily Show , The Colbert Report and other Comedy Central content from Hulu at 11:59 PST on March 9 .
It 's presumably doing so because the income it receives from the online venture is n't good enough .
The Daily Show and The Colbert Report are two of the most popular shows on Hulu , so it 's a big loss for both the video site — which just posted about the " farewell " on its blog — and for consumers of web video , thousands of whom have daily turned to Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert for a bit of entertainment and news during their cubicle lunch breaks .
This is arguably Hulu 's first big programming setback , though other online entertainment services like Netflix Watch Instantly and GameTap have lost important content deals in the past .
Viacom says both shows will still be available at their respective websites ( thedailyshow.com and colbernation.com ) and at Comedy Central 's website , but many viewers prefer the clean TV experience they get at Hulu , so they wo n't be thrilled with that .
Of course , the shows will still air on Comedy Central 's cable TV channel each night .
Maybe Viacom is hoping that viewership on its own air and websites will improve if the shows are n't available elsewhere .
We 're not so sure it will , but we 'll be observing to find out .
We 're also not sure exactly what caused the arrangement between Viacom and Hulu to end .
Hulu simply said it was unable to secure the rights .
Viacom might have asked for a financial deal the site was unable to agree to .

In a finding that may speed efforts to conserve oil and intensify the search for alternative fuel sources , scientists in Kuwait predict that world conventional crude oil production will peak in 2014 -- almost a decade earlier than some other predictions .
Their study is in ACS ' Energy & Fuels , a bi-monthly journal .
Ibrahim Nashawi and colleagues point out that rapid growth in global oil consumption has sparked a growing interest in predicting " peak oil " -- the point where oil production reaches a maximum and then declines .
Scientists have developed several models to forecast this point , and some put the date at 2020 or later .
One of the most famous forecast models , called the Hubbert model , accurately predicted that oil production would peak in the United States in 1970 .
The model has since gained in popularity and has been used to forecast oil production worldwide .
However , recent studies show that the model is insufficient to account for more complex oil production cycles of some countries .
Those cycles can be heavily influenced by technology changes , politics , and other factors , the scientists say .
The new study describe development of a new version of the Hubbert model that accounts for these individual production trends to provide a more realistic and accurate oil production forecast .
Using the new model , the scientists evaluated the oil production trends of 47 major oil - producing countries , which supply most of the world 's conventional crude oil .
They estimated that worldwide conventional crude oil production will peak in 2014 , years earlier than anticipated .
The scientists also showed that the world 's oil reserves are being depleted at a rate of 2.1 percent a year .
The new model could help inform energy - related decisions and public policy debate , they suggest .

As the Holy See continues to respond to the latest uproar over pedophilic priests ( specifically the accusation that the Pope himself , when still Cardinal Ratzinger , was intimately involved in covering up the actions of serial molesters ) the matter has become strangely entwined with another of the Church ’s persistent headaches : the Jewish question .
First , on Good Friday , the Pope ’s personal preacher offered a homily in which sustained criticism of the Vatican ’s failure to stanch a hemorrhaging of child sexual abuse was equated with the persecution of Jews .
The orator , the Reverand Raniero Cantalamessa , left most of the heavy lifting to the text of a letter he had received from an unnamed Jewish friend , which he cited extensively : “ I am following with indignation the violent and concentric attacks against the Church , the Pope , and all the faithful by the whole world .
The use of stereotypes , the passing from personal responsibility and guilt to a collective guilt remind me of the more shameful aspects of anti-Semitism . ”
After this mind - bending comparison , it was perversely refreshing to read a statement that appeared a couple of days later on the Catholic Web site Pontifex , deploying the Jewish people on the battlefield of this scandal in the manner to which we are more accustomed .
Giacomo Babini , emeritus bishop of Grosseto , is alleged to have suggested that the “ powerful and refined ” nature of the assault on the Pope ’s character indicated it was part of a concerted “ Zionist attack . ”
For those unclear that “ Zionist ” in some minds is code not for the problematically successful movement toward Jewish self - determination , but rather for the fabled machinations of the Elders of Zion , the speaker continued : “ They do not want the church .
They are its natural enemies .
Deep down , historically speaking , the Jews are God killers . ”
Babini has since denied ownership of these words ( though the Guardian noted his legacy of “ accusing Jews of exploiting the Holocaust . ” )
Nevertheless , the Italian Bishops ’ Conference , with some predictable prodding from the American Jewish Committee , felt obliged to declare the remarks : “ entirely contrary to the official line and mainstream thought of the Catholic Church . ”
This comes , however , precisely at a time when “ the official line and mainstream thought of the Catholic Church , ” particularly with regard to the Jewish people , is a matter of some ambiguity .
Since the late 1960s , until quite recently , the mainstream of the Church had been undergoing a radical reconfiguration of its attitude toward Judaism .
This was the legacy of the liberalizing Second Vatican Council and its Nostra Aetate declaration , which exonerated the Jews of collective guilt in the murder of Jesus Christ and acknowledged that they might be adherents of a living , rather than fossilized , faith .
But in the five years of his papacy , which were sufficiently foreshadowed by the ideological stance of his prior career as a high - ranking cardinal , Benedict has endeavored to reestablish a firm conservative line in the Vatican .
Several of his moves in this campaign , though not intended primarily to do so , have had the effect of antagonizing organized Jewry .
His widening of the availability of the Latin Rite , a nod to liturgical traditionalism , reintroduced the “ Prayer for the Conversion of the Jews ” into the available Good Friday cannon , albeit in a rewritten form that dropped the adjective “ perfidious . ”
His reconciliation with Lefebvrist sectarians , intended to heal a rift within the Church ( though such healing would not have been imaginable were the Church itself not listing in the direction of these anti-Vatican 2 renegades ) bore as a consequence the recommunication of Bishop Richard Williamson , a vociferous Jew - hater .
Perhaps most aggravating to Jewish - Catholic relations is the seemingly implacable march of Pope Pius XII toward sainthood .
Benedict green - lighted the Holocaust - era pontiff for consideration last December , based in part on the argument that Pius ’ failure to publicly condemn the Nazi slaughter belied extensive clandestine work on behalf of individual Jews .
Many historians counter that any evaluation of this claim is impossible without access to a raft of documentation that the Vatican has yet to release .
In the meantime , the matter has become something of a battle of wills , with the Vatican asserting its right to offer a halo to whomever it chooses , over and against external objections .
Benedict refueled this flashpoint only last week , with his laudatory comments following the viewing of Under The Roman Sky — a new , hagiographic documentary about his controversial predecessor .
All of this provides context for the recent introduction of anti-Semitic discourse into the Church ’s response to pedophilia allegations , which represents a provocative new twist in the ongoing saga .
“ Babini ’s ” buffoonish accusations , incendiary but familiar , are not nearly as striking as the analogy Cantalamessa invoked between condemnation of Church hierarchy and Jewish suffering .
It is certainly not the first time that Christianity has played “ the Jew . ”
One could argue that the religion itself is founded on an appropriation of Jewish identity , with one Chosen People ( refined , rather than rejected by , Christianity ) replacing another , under a new dispensation .
Historically , however , it has been a triumphant church laying claim to the victor ’s mantle .
Here , in the heart of a wounded church , a play is being made for the shroud of the victim .
Victimization is , in fact , one of the mainstays of Catholic - Jewish relations .
The tone was set early , with the victimhood of Jesus , a Jew whose brutal death was blamed on his countrymen , and thus became the pretext for nearly two millennia of anti-Jewish doctrine and violence .
Then came the Holocaust .
Babini is not alone in complaining that the Jews “ exploit ” the Holocaust , though this is a rather vulgar way to speak of our response to the murder of one - third of the global Jewish population .
Compelling arguments have been made , by Jews , for the way that an intoxication of historical memory distorts the political horizons of the Israeli government , but when it comes to relations with the Vatican ( as I have argued here before ) , it seems that only an equal and opposite cataclysm was able to get the Jews off the hook for the murder of God Himself .
Christian guilt displaced Jewish guilt .
The heinous legacy of Nazi Jew - killing was reified and its implications elevated almost to the level of official Church doctrine , as evidenced by the way a certain stripe of Catholic clergy still reverently intones the word “ Shoah . ”
One of my congregants , a Jewish professor at the law school of Jesuit Fordham University , suggested it had achieved the status of “ the canonical suffering of the age . ”
Cantalamessa ’s homily seems to indicate another turning point .
His friend ’s comparison was strange on a number of levels .
The “ collective guilt ” of anti-Semitism is a function of ancient and persistent religious mythology , whereas the Church in our time is quite vulnerable to charges of a “ systematic , ” if not “ collective ” guilt , stemming from an administrative culture that shuffled abusers of children from one post to another ( and , to take it a step further , from a refusal to consider that the robust expression of adult sexuality might be good for the soul ) .
Beyond that , there is the fact that the Catholic Church itself is one of the all - time leading instigators and purveyors of anti-Jewish sentiment , though this circumstance has been blessedly altered over the past half century .
But , again in the words of my congregant , himself a passionate participant in Catholic - Jewish conversation , these new circumstances have given rise to a confusing sense of “ intimacy , ” in which Catholic representatives feel a certain kinship with Jewish experience — particularly Jewish “ canonical suffering ” — with varying degrees of recognition of their role in that suffering .
After all ( and these are my words ) , if the crucifixion is counterbalanced by the apocalypse of Jewish suffering , then the Church no longer has sole claim to being the body of Christ , but must take its turn playing the Romans , or , the way they used to tell it , the Jews .
This takes on another level of meaning , however , in the era of Benedict ’s decidedly post - Vatican 2 papacy .
Though he may not be intending to anger Jews , there is a good , equally systematic reason for why he keeps doing so : a resurgent Church is , among other things , precisely one that throws off some of its concern for Jewish sensibilities .
The Pope often seems to be steering Church doctrine away from Nostra Aetate — an affirmation of the validity of other religious traditions — and back toward a vision of the son as the only path to the father .
This is a kind of murmuring triumphalism , and may result in a Jewish anxiety , bordering on existential for some , about our place in the scheme of things .
We may suspect there are many silent Babinis , as petulant about doing what they see as our bidding as a fat cat who can no longer smoke a cigar in his favorite restaurant .
But Cantalamessa is far more intriguing .
In seeking victory for his Church , he mistakes a self - inflicted wound for the side - piercing spear , and describes his pain through recourse to the “ canonical suffering of our age . ”
Such is the tortuous career of the narrative of victimization .
Gearing Up For Gears Of War 3
by Binh Nguyen [ Tuesday , 13th of April 2010 - 03:33 PM ]
“ When we released Gears of War more than five years ago , we set out to tell the world an unforgettable story of bravery and sacrifice in the face of insurmountable odds , and a year from now , players will get the chance to experience the final chapter in the story of Marcus Fenix and his companions in Delta Squad , ” said Cliff Bleszinski , Design Director of Epic Games .
“ This is definitely the biggest and most dramatic chapter yet in the Gears of War saga , and we can't wait to deliver it ”
My Take :
After watching the trailer , I just hope that Gears of War 3 is about as epic as the trailer showed it to be .
They now have a female character !
Michael should be happy about that .
Plus with the announcement of a 4 - player co-op for the story mode , you can not go wrong with that .
I hope they show some gameplay at this year 's E3 .
Cliff Bleszinski mentioned last night that the game will drop around April 5th , 2011 .
So XBox 360 fans , just wait another year and the game will be yours .
Truly progressive legislation rarely gets voted down .
Truly progressive legislation rarely gets voted on at all .
We are told that we do n't have the votes , so we may as well not try .
We are told that watered down capitulations are the best that was possible , so no pressure is exerted to get something better .
But when it comes to the end game , plenty of pressure is exerted to get those watered down capitulations .
One wonders what would have happened if such pressure had been exerted , in the first place , to get something better .
One is left to wonder , because no such pressure ever is exerted .
It 's not complicated .
We know the process .
It happened with the top - down stimulus that is n't trickling very well , and it happened with the transmogrification of health care reform into a health insurance industry bailout , with just enough goodies thrown in to make it worth passing , on the margins .
Of course there 's no good reason we could n't have gotten more community health clinics without the accompanying health insurance industry bailout .
It 's for others to figure out the wherefores and whys .
I 'm not that smart .
We know how it works .
We know how it will work , going forward .
The best ideas wo n't even be considered .
The centrists will be put in charge , with the excuse that we need their votes .
Then , in the end , if they still wo n't support legislation that supposedly was crafted to appease them , we 'll figure out how to get the votes , anyway .
Not for truly progressive legislation , but for corporate - friendly legislation that supposedly was crafted with the centrists in mind .
Here 's a clue : it 's not the centrists that are undermining progress .
Hitchcock fans know a McGuffin when they see one .
So , as we move forward to new and wondrous sources of argument , browbeating , tearing of hair and rending of garments , I propose an easier and quicker way .
Just let Baucus and Lieberman and Nelson and Collins and Snowe craft legislation .
They still likely wo n't vote for most of it , but at least they can be used as sources of blame .
And that 's what it 's all about .
Blame .
Because that buck never stops , anywhere , anymore .
Armed men later ambushed a federal police patrol , killing five officers and wounding seven in the hotspot of drug violence .
State prosecutors said in a statement that six bodies and severed heads were discovered at the entrance to the Michoacan town of Acahuato .
The victims had not been identified .
Later , state Public Safety Secretary Minerva Bautista said a group of at least a dozen armed men attacked a federal police convoy , opening fire on the vehicles from a highway overpass near the city of Maravatio .
Two of the wounded officers were reported in serious condition .
Michoacan is the cradle of La Familia cartel , which authorities blame for a string of recent beheadings and the killings of police and soldiers .
Also on Friday , four severely beaten men were seen walking along a busy street in the Michoacan town of Zamora carrying messages signed by La Familia .
" Society , do n't judge us .
We 're cleaning your city , " read one note .
Last week , four men who had been beaten and tortured marched near Zamora 's train station carrying similar signs and yelling that they were rapists and thieves .
President Felipe Calderon first launched his crackdown against drug cartels in Michoacan , sending thousands of federal police and soldiers to his home state after taking office in late 2006 .
Drug violence has killed more than 15,000 people throughout Mexico since then .
SPRINGFIELD , MA— The Basketball Hall of Fame announced Monday that All - Star power forward and Los Angeles Lakers legend Karl Malone will be inducted into its hallowed halls this August .
" It 's an honor , it really is , " said " The Mailman , " whose well - documented tandem with all - time Laker great Gary Payton helped lead the team all the way to the Finals in 2004 .
" I never could have done this without my teammates . "
Malone , who averaged 13.2 points during his legendary run with the Lakers , heads a Hall of Fame class that also includes Portland Trail Blazers star Scottie Pippen .

Today the Times notices a little known and seldom enforced law that prohibits more than three unrelated people from living in an apartment or a house in NYC .
Chances are that includes you and pretty much everyone you know , except maybe those ex-roommates who 've broken loose and moved in with their significant others .
( They 'll be back ! )
So why would a city with such obscenely high rents try to deprive residents of an all - too - common necessity : non-familial cohabitation ?
Eric Bederman , a spokesman for the housing department , says the code was devised for residents ’ safety , to prevent people with multiple roommates from erecting barriers that would foil escape attempts during emergencies .
But Jerilyn Perine , a former city housing commissioner , tells the Times that the roommates limit was implemented in the ' 50s , as an attempt to convert boarding house brownstones and their " sketchy inhabitants " back to family homes .
Now we 're all sketchy !
And illegal .
And leaving our dishes in the sink .
( Sorry ! )
Thankfully , the law is rarely enforced , in most cases only when a neighbor complains or inspectors spot a violation while visiting for other reasons .
( Only three citations have been issued since July . )
In 2008 , almost 15,000 dwellings were occupied by three or more unrelated roommates , according to the most recent Census data .
But anecdotal evidence — plus the fact that pretty much everyone we know is reduced to living with roommates into senescence — suggests that number is a little low .
Instead of limiting the number of roommates in an apartment , maybe the city should start implementing roommate age limits .
Oh my .
The latest True Blood teaser from HBO features a pairing many fans have been clamoring for , but I do n’t know that seeing Eric and Sookie together like this is quite what they had in mind .
True Blood season 3 premieres Sunday , June 13 on HBO .
Are you excited yet ?
It 's come to my attention that Tonghua here has recently passed away .
He was 17 , which is considered old age for a tiger and during that time he helped bring the plight of his species to many guests .
He will definitely be missed .
Tigers are the largest of the big cats and are exclusively found in Asia from India to Vietnam , from Indonesia to the Russian Far East .
The tiger can be divided into 9 subspecies : 4 are currently critically endangered and 3 are already extinct .
Though estimations of tiger populations only a few years ago was 5,500 - 6,000 , today populations are likely closer to 3,500 and are still declining .
Dramatic declines of the tiger in India , thought to host the majority of the world 's tigers , have fallen to less than 1,411 .
Overall , the past decade has seen a 40 % reduction in tiger habitat , which now represents a mere 7 % of its historic range .
Poaching is a significant problem throughout the tiger 's range , the demand for its body parts in traditional medicines , tonics , and exotic dishes driving a lucrative trade that is wiping out entire populations .
Long - term threats include habitat fragmentation and prey depletion , which is accelerating the tiger 's demise and subsequently reducing the long - term genetic viability of many populations .
If you want to help , the best for you to do is to educate yourself ( www.savethetigerfund.org/ ) , never buy products made from tigers or endangered species ( www.wildaid.org/ ) , and tell others .

Why retiring from sport is so difficult
TOKYO — Aiming to rejuvenate sales of its hand - held game machines , Nintendo Co. plans to sell a new portable 3 - D gaming device that wo n't require special glasses .
For months , Nintendo has been rumored to be working with chip makers on a new portable gaming device to succeed the DS , the best - selling portable videogame system ever , with more than 125 million units sold since its launch in late 2004 .
Smartphones ...
They gallop and trot , whinny and neigh , capturing our imagination — and our hearts .
Indeed , horses are said to have done more to change human history than any other domestic animal , once upon a time carrying explorers to new frontiers and mighty armies to great conquests .
More than 50 million years ago , a small fox - sized animal crept through the forests of North America , browsing on fruit and leaves .
Its arched - back body was only about a foot high at the shoulder , and a long tail and short - snouted head probably gave it a distinctly dog - like look .
In fact , its feet sported pads like a dog ’s , except each toe ended in a tiny hoof instead of a claw .
Interestingly , in modern horses , one toe has become the hoof , and the others remain as vestigial bumps higher up the leg .
When fossil hunters first discovered the bones of this creature a century ago , they named it Eohippus — “ the dawn horse ” — and believed it was the first link in an evolutionary chain that led directly to today ’s horse .
Indeed , many museums and textbooks still have displays and pictures showing this neat , predictable progression , with horses gradually getting larger , shifting from many toes to modern hooves , and gaining longer teeth able to grind down tough prairie grasses .
These days , however , researchers have a far more complex picture of horse evolution — and they have given the dawn horse a much less colorful name .
While they agree that today ’s horse probably arose from that smaller ancestor , the path was by no means direct .
Instead , paleontologists have uncovered fossils that show that horse ancestors varied in size : some large early horses gave way later to smaller ones .
They also discovered that some lines of horse - like animals alternated between many and few toes over time .
In addition , some proto - horses once thought to be direct forefathers of the modern animals were revealed to be distantly related cousins — just one dead - end branch on a bushy family tree .
One branch , however , kept growing .
About a million years ago , it produced an array of small pony - sized animals that galloped across ancient plains around the world in large herds .
They probably behaved much as today ’s wild horses do , using their flowing tails as remarkably accurate fly swatters and signal flags , and snorting the air for the smell of enemies and the scent of food .
Less than 10,000 years ago , however , many of these horse - like species became extinct , along with other browsing animals such as mammoths .
Climate changes and over - hunting by humans may have been to blame , but no one knows for sure .
The only survivors were horses in Asia and several zebras .
In North America , however , horses were wiped out .
So where did the modern horses come from , the ones that spawned America ’s cowboy myth ?
Historians believe that Spanish explorers brought the animals with them on their voyages to the New World in the 1500s .
Let loose upon the land , they soon reclaimed the prairies that had once been theirs alone , producing vast herds of wild horses .
Even today , as HORSES shows , tens of thousands of wild horses roam the American West .
To prevent the herds from destroying their habitat , the U.S. government captures hundreds each year and puts them up for adoption .
For some of the proud new owners , the chance to ride a wild - born horse is a dream come true — and the continuation of an age - old relationship that has made the horse one of our most revered and fascinating animal partners .

Discovery 's Dawn

Explanation : On April 5 , visitors to Kennedy Space Center saw these colorful clouds , twisting and drifting through dawn skies .
Of course , the clouds were rocket engine plumes from the predawn launch of the space shuttle Discovery on the STS - 131 mission to the International Space Station .
Their layered colors are created as they reflect the reddened light from the still rising Sun .
Fittingly , denizens of the space center 's rocket garden are lit in the foreground .
At the far left is a 1960s vintage multistage Atlas - Agena rocket .
Together on the right , are Mercury - Redstone and Mercury - Atlas rockets .
The technology industry , an engine of innovation and U.S. prosperity for more than half a century , is accelerating its recovery from the recession with surging earnings that have spurred companies to sharply ramp up their hiring .
The latest evidence for the rebound came Thursday , when Internet giant Google Inc. posted a 37 % profit jump for the first quarter and chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported a 34 % revenue increase to record levels .
The results follow the strong showing of bellwether Intel Corp. , which Tuesday ...
Students at the University of Sussex in Brighton have occupied a campus building in protest over proposed cuts .
Up to 100 people have been staying in a lecture theatre since Thursday in protest at the plans to cut 115 jobs and create 20 new posts .
About 300 students are taking part in the occupation , with a third of that number remaining on site at any one time , according to a spokesman .
The university said the planned cuts were the subject of a consultation .
Members of the University and College Union at the Falmer site plan to hold one - day strike on Thursday .
' Same mantra '
A student called Tabitha , who is taking part in the protest , called on the university to rethink its plans .
She said : " What we want is for them to sit down with the facility , the staff and the students ' union .
" To sit down and actually listen to what we are saying , instead of repeating the same mantra they seem to have of 'oh there 's nothing we can do ' . "
The students are also calling for six students that were suspended by the university , following a previous sit - in protest against the plans to cut staff numbers , to be reinstated .
About 50 students barricaded themselves into the university offices in Falmer , near Brighton , on 3 March .
The university suspended six students after they were identified as having taken part in the sit - in , which led to two arrests .
Up to 100 students took part in wider protests around the campus against the proposed cuts .
Gotta Love Those Islands
Well , if we have a bunch of islands in the same Gulf Stream sending water from the Atlantic and the Caribbean over toward Europe , you would expect their trends to be similar .
Now it ’s true that the Bermuda Islands are closer to the Sargasso Sea than the Caribbean Sea and are only on the edge of the Gulf Stream , and it is equally true that Jamaica is on the “ Warmer Side ” from Cuba and away from the Gulf Stream .
But these are all nice warm places and they are all sitting in this giant bath tub of warm water together .
At least the trends ought to match .
How About The Bermuda Islands ?
Well , The Bermuda Islands come up a little short .
( Oh , quit groaning , you KNEW it had to be coming , just be glad I got it out of the way early ;-) .
The data cut off in 1995 .
Part of The Great Dying of Thermometers .
Wonder where it ’s “ filled - in ” from now ?
Not a whole lot of trend here either .
It ’s a 2.5 C range with a gentle downward slope .
As is often the case , the oldest readings are a bit more volatile , but it ’s a nice long series that just ends too soon .
It would be interesting to see if they have CLIMAT reports available that are just not quite making it into the GHCN data set .
I ’m sure they still have an airport and people go there all the time , so METARS are certainly available .
OK , well , lets head from Bermuda back over to Jamaica and see what ’s it looks like .
Whatever it is , it ought to be more or less like that one .
The place just does n’t change climate much .
Jamaica – a rolling gate with a swing to it
So what have we got ?
Jamaica .
I loved the place .
Doctors
Cove is to die for .
Had a room in an old house / hotel with a picture “ window ” that had no glass in it overlooking the beach .
86 F pretty much all the time day or night , and the water was the same .
Plants grew so fast you would swear the vines around the window were bigger at the end of the week than the start .
And the food … .
But I digress …
OK , the scale on this is fine grained so you can see some ‘ action ’ .
That ’s all of about 2.5 C variation over the decades .
In looking at the temperature data we find the “ usual suspects ” of Duplicate Number changes ( I ’m swapping over to using the NCDC name rather than Mod Flag , that I think is from the GIStemp code ) .
There are also a couple of thermometers that ‘ drop out ’ around the late ’ 60s / early ’ 70s .
The “ count ” of thermometers jumps from 2 to 4 in one year , 5 the next for a few years , then back down to 2 .
Then we start playing with the Duplicate Numbers again in about 1988 - 1990 .
Here is a little peek at them .
So we can see that there was a gentle downward drift , until someone got way crazy and stuck thermometers all over the place , then yanked a bunch of them out .
That caused a really big spike in the temperature anomalies .
Then lately we ’ve gotten a bit of a drift but not much as the Duplicate Number flags change again .
The Bahamas
Well , nice little string of Islands .
Stable water all around them .
A bit of the Caribbean mixing with some Sargasso as it heads for the Gulf Stream .
Just the place for the same thing we ’ve seen already .
But may as well stick it in .. :
Speaking of “ sticking it ” , looks like we got ourselves a Hockey Stick .
Now when you look at the data , there are a LOT of Duplicate Number flags again .
There are a couple of different thermometers that come and go too .
But at the end of the day , the “ Hockey Stick ” shows up when the older thermometers and Duplicate Number flags are dropped and they unmask this one lone record , and we get the stick .
The other records drop over a period of time , so I ’ve chosen to make this segment graph with a ‘ break ’ a bit late in the series of drops .
I did n’t want to be accused of picking cherries in Bahamas ( they need winter chill to make fruit anyway ;-) but here are what the trends look like with a break in the segments just after all the thermometer dropping :
We get two very different trends out of those two segments .
I think we need a new name for this “ uncover the newer Duplicate Number flag by dropping old thermometers ” process , er , excuse me “ trick ” ( I do want to sound like a Professional Climate Scientists so I ’d better learn to user their jargon properly . )
I think I ’ll call it an “ UN - splice ” .
Prior to the drop we had both sets together and this thermometer was masked by the others , as we UN - splice them , this trend can then dominate .
I think the UN - splice trick is rather clever , do n’t you ?
And just for Ruhroh who liked it so much the last time , here is the “ Hair Graph ” showing all the individual months data .
Again we notice the ‘ peak clipping ’ with excessive clipping of the down peaks during the transition ; though in this case we have the very interesting return of the down spikes lately .
It ’s that “ bald batch ” below zero sort of between 1990 and 1996 or so .
Almost as though someone thought they had enough “ trick ” in the bag and did n’t want to overcook it …
If you would like to know what ’s causing Global Warming , check out the thermometer changes in The Bahamas .
It is n’t CO2 .
Conclusions
Well , we can add The Bermuda Islands to the Carbon - Guilt - Free Club .
All residents of those Islands may resume driving , BBQ ing , running party boats , fishing and generally having a wonderful time .
Further , as a new Official Carbon - Guilt Policy :
All tourists headed to those Islands get a Carbon - Guilt Free Pass for the duration .
Clearly you have no impact on Global Warming when you are there .
For folks headed to Jamaica , you get a 70 % discount on your Carbon - Guilt .
They have played the Duplicate Number flag game , but only half heartedly , and they ’ve ended up more or less back where they started .
Furthermore , most of it came out of some thermometer changes when folks were playing around with them a lot in the ’60s and ’ 70s and , well , a lot of folks who went to Jamaica then do n’t remember exactly what they did , so just kind of cut them some slack , OK ?
Heck , someone probably tried to light one up when they ran out of ganja one weekend …
So feel at ease spending time on the beach , in the wonderful restaurants , and just touring the beautiful parts of the islands .
However , the fuel for the flight in , well , you will just have to suck it up and accept that part of the Carbon - Guilt Tax .
You are expected to leave 20 % tips for the staff in Jamaica as pennance for as long as you can remember what hotel room you are staying in .
However , all folks destined for a visit to The Bahamas , I ’m sorry to report , you must pay your full Carbon - Guilt Tax and feel miserable for the whole time .
I ’ll be establishing facilities for you to pay me to assuage your Carbon - Guilt shortly .
Until then , Hit the Tip Jar , go to Bermuda instead , or stay home .
Further , upon arrival in The Bahamas , all food is to be eaten as close to raw as possible ( think Sushi or Salad ;-) and travel is to be by those wonderful horse drawn cabs they have .
Hey , you do n’t HAVE to be completely miserable just because you feel guilty …
I ’ll be working my way around the world in further postings , so if you are looking for other types of Carbon - Guilt Free vacations , there are other options .
As a teaser , I ’ll just mention that Italy is probably a Carbon - Guilt Free destination as is Greece .
Pour the double cream into a cold , sterilised mixing bowl .
If it 's homogenised , it will still whip , but not as well .
If you 're using raw cream and want a more traditional taste , leave it to ripen in a cool place , where the temperature is about 8 °C ( 46 °F ) , for up to 48 hours .
Whisk the cream at a medium speed in a food mixer until it is thick .
First it will be softly whipped , then stiffly whipped .
Continue until the whipped cream collapses and separates into butterfat globules .
The buttermilk will separate from the butter and slosh around the bowl .

The Gnarled Bush of Authority
After centuries of pretending they were better than everyone else , the royal families of Europe became so intermarried that their family tree could be described as a gnarled bush .
The varied expressions of social , economic , and political authority share a similarly incestuous relationship with each other .
In Queens , NY , a 12 year old was arrested and taken in handcuffs to a police station where she was detained for several hours .
Her offense ?
Doodling completely non-threatening messages on a school desk .
In other words , she was treated like a criminal for attempting a modicum of self - expression within the confinement in which political , economic , and social control have placed her .
According to the New York Daily News article about this case , “ Alexa is the latest in a string of city students who have been cuffed for minor infractions .
In 2007 , 13 - year - old Chelsea Fraser was placed under arrest for writing ‘ okay ’ on her desk at Intermediate School 201 .
And in 2008 , 5 - year - old Dennis Rivera was cuffed and sent to a psych ward after throwing a fit in his kindergarten . ”
In Yelm , WA , an Iraq war veteran was arrested for abusing his daughter , which included dunking her head in a sink full of water for not reciting the alphabet .
What do these incidents have to do with each other ?
They are what happens when authoritarian values are pushed to the conclusion .
The principles become : those of inferior rank owe obedience and acquiescence to those above them , and those of superior rank are primarily accountable to their peers and to those who outrank them , not to those below them .
Witness police violence :
It ’s considered acceptable to frown upon police violence and get someone who outranks the cops involved to punish them , but when individuals physically resist or retaliate for police violence , they become transgressors .
Authoritarian practices are related to each other by their devaluation of the individual .
The individual life is not seen as a means to the achievement of the individual ’s personal values .
Instead the value of an individual will be judged by his ability to satisfy the demands of authority .
We are assigned a few choices to make , and once we pick a pre-made place we are expected to act the part .
Authority starts to gnaw on minds even before kindergarten lessons about brave soldiers taught by people who say that fighting for yourself solves nothing .
The state is the primary expression of authority .
It often provides the muscle , and usually provides the official face of domination .
It provides the structure to enforce the devaluation of individuals , and its ever - growing structure encourages the ruthless pursuit of individuals who assert their liberty .
Destroying tyranny begins with overturning the dominance of the ideas that enable it .
Spreading the values of liberty makes it easier to live by them .
Scientists say that it 's just pareidolia - a fancy word meaning that humans tend to see images or faces in random things , but surely they 're wrong .
Sure , you can shrug off religious sightings as overly active imaginations of fanatics , but what if these images come from the world of science .
Just think about it , people .
Science !
James Dacey of Physicsworld.com
Blog spotted two such phenomena :
Physicist David Fairhurst of Nottingham Trent University was working on a physics experiment involving droplet of polymer solution ( those wacky scientists ! ) when he saw the face of Michael Jackson !
The ugly - looking globular mound is a droplet of polymer solution , the kind of substance you might find in the ink cartridges of your printer .
As the solution began to dry , Fairhurst noticed a number of small “ spherulites ” begin to crystallise on the droplet surface revealing what appears to be a tiny human face . [...]
The physicist and his group of PhD students reckon the face looks like a small girl , or possibly even the King of Pop , Michael Jackson .
I ran the image through an online face - recognition programme and the names that came out included : Rachel Carson , the American environmentalist ; Marlene Dietrich the German - born actress ; and ( tenuously ) Iggy Pop .
Link - via Geekosystem , thanks Glenn !
It was whilst writing a story this afternoon about water - repellency in lotus leaves that I noticed something very strange .
Bizarrely , everybody ’s favourite mop -topped Liverpudlian seems to reveal himself in the high - speed photo images of water - droplets being ejected from the leaf surface .

Phil Baroni is the man fight fans love to hate , the self - styled New York Badass , but this bad boy image which promoters like to project is a million miles away from the real Baroni .
In person , he is warm , open , and quite brutally honest .
As Baroni reaches the twilight of his MMA career he is anxious to set the record straight .
" The whole New York Badass thing is a gimmick more than anything , but I am getting older now — I will be 34 when I next fight .
Being a punk at 24 is cool but now I think it 's tired .
I 'm not a punk or a wise guy I am a regular guy , a blue collar guy , and a hard worker and that 's my real personality , ” he says .
Baroni made his UFC debut in 2002 .
He was cut by the UFC in 2005 after losing four consecutive fights but seven years later , after a successful stint fighting in Japan , he found himself surprisingly recalled .
Since his return Baroni has already fought once , losing via decision to Amir Sadollah , and is desperate to get back to winning ways when he returns to the Octagon in four months time ,
“ I have a four - fight contract but I need to start winning or I know I will get cut .
I do n't want to get cut by the UFC because it took me six long years to fight my way back .
I have always wanted to finish my career in the UFC and I would n't want to be released now as it would be a long hard road back , ” he says .
Baroni is the eternal optimist but if he is unable to take advantage of his second opportunity inside the Octagon it is highly unlikely he will get a third .
When Baroni made his UFC comeback last November he found that much had changed in the intervening years , not least the attitude of the fans .
" I used to get booed by the fans and it definitely bothered me but I did n't realize it until I came back from Japan .
In Japan the fans liked me and they cheered for me .
Then when I fought Frank Shamrock in his hometown I got booed and it bothered me . "
Since returning to the UFC he feels that fight fans are finally starting to see him in a new light .
" I think people are starting to like me , even Jo Rogan seemed to want me to win my last fight .
Now I am just being myself and I think the real fight fans like that and appreciate me .
I never look for a way out in a fight , I am a real fighter I am not just an athlete who fights . "
Being just a regular guy does have its disadvantages for Baroni , who lives in Las Vegas with his wife and children .
" A lot of the problem is that I have never been part of a team , a lot of the most successful guys are on teams and they hang out together .
" My friends are all regular guys who go out and drink and gamble and do n't live at a gym or have a healthy lifestyle .
I need to get out of Las Vegas and hang out with people who are positive role models because hanging out with regular guys is not conducive to being a professional fighter . "
Baroni , who is currently training at Tiger Muay Thai in Phuket , admits that his last loss hit him particularly hard .
" Before coming here I was not doing what I should have been doing , I was living a bad lifestyle .
I spent three months drinking and gambling and eating .
I lost a lot of money and I realized I have an eating problem , you could call it a disorder . "
During this time Baroni also put on a lot of weight and coming to Thailand proved a profound culture shock .
“ When I first came here I could n’t go two rounds on the pads because I was so out of shape but today I managed eight rounds .
" I came here because I had a lot of stuff to figure out that I could n’t figure out back home but I decided to stay because the training has been so good .
I ’ve never trained Muay Thai in my life and it ’s a weakness which a lot of my opponents have exploited . ”
The last fight , against Amir Sadollah , was a prime example of this .
Baroni came out swinging and appeared to be on the verge of scoring a sensational first round knock out but faded badly down the stretch as Sadollah dominated him in the clinch to win a clear cut decision .
It was a huge blow to Baroni who says he is not prepared , either mentally or financially , to face the possibility of retirement .
“ When I first got in the UFC I thought I would quit aged 30 but that obviously has n’t happened and I would like to keep going as long as I can .
" I do n’t know what I will do when my career ends , I do n’t want to think about it .
I wanted to make enough money to be able to retire but I am going to have to win a lot of fights if I am going to do that . ”
This puts enormous pressure on Baroni to win his next UFC fight which he thinks will probably see him return to the middleweight division where he made his name .
“ I wrestled at 170 lbs in high school and I am almost 34 now so I do n’t want to be at the same weight I was at when I was at school .
" I think it ’s just a fad , everyone is going down in weight but I do n’t think it suits me .
I think guys like Kampmann and Swick have lost a little bit of power down at the weight .
I do n’t think being tall and skinny is the way to be . ”
Baroni thinks that the weight cut was a contributor factor in his disappointing performance against Sadollah .
" I cut 21 pounds in 36 hours for that fight and I feel like I lost a lot of power at 170 pounds .
It was my first fight in the UFC for six years and I was so stressed out and nervous .
It was a must win situation so all I did was punch , I did n’t use wrestling or any of my other skills . ”
Baroni hopes he will have more success fighting at 185 lbs because he is in urgent need of a win .
He thinks that the time spent training at Tiger Muay Thai could make the difference .
“ My attitude when I first got here was bad and I wanted to go home but now I do n’t want to leave .
I have learned so much and I have realized I have a lot more to learn .
The whole experience has been really good for me , both as a fighter and as a person , and hopefully that will be reflected in my next fight . "
Baroni , who holds victories over MMA stand outs such as Yuki Kondo and Ryu Chonan , has an overall record of 13 - 12 .
His last win inside the octagon came back in 2002 and was a highlight reel knock out over former UFC Middleweight Champion Dave Menne .
Baroni is perhaps better remembered for his reaction to the win than the emphatic fight finish itself , straddling the cage and screaming , “ I am the man , I am the best , the best ever . ”
I wondered it he might be embarrassed by this outburst but in fact Baroni looks back upon it with pride .
“ I do n’t regret it at all , that was an important fight for me and I was excited to win it .
It was a good moment and something I will never forget . ”
Baroni will need to summon up a similar performance in his next UFC outing because his livelihood is very much on the line .
A win could revitalize his career and cement his status as a UFC contender .
A loss could thrust him back into MMA obscurity and would be potentially devastating for a man who admits he has nothing else to fall back on .
If he does manage to roll back time and grab the victory he so desperately needs Baroni could be forgiven for another emotional outburst .
He is a man who wears his heart on his sleeve and what you see is very much what you get .
When Phil Baroni next enters the Octagon he will be probably be wearing his trademark New York Badass boxing robe and sun glasses .
Do not be fooled by his brash appearance though .
Behind the shades lurk the eyes of a man who has fought long and hard and , for whatever reason , still has too little to show for it .
He is clinging to the coat tails of his MMA career and needs to win his next fight if he is to hang on any longer .
Most athletes are meticulously clean living , circumspect and media savvy .
Baroni is a throwback to an older era , a real - life Rocky who is frank about his faults and his fight to overcome them .
We should enjoy seeing Baroni fight while we can because inside the increasingly competitive UFC he may very well be the last of his kind .

Before Sleater - Kinney went on indefinite hiatus in 2006 , Corin Tucker 's feral wail was one of the most righteous , powerful , earth - shattering sounds in all of indiedom .
But since then , we 've been largely deprived of that voice .
Tucker has sung backup on a few Eddie Vedder solo songs , but she 's mostly disappeared from the music world , taking time off to be a mom .
When we spoke to her Sleater - Kinney bandmate Carrie Brownstein last month , though , Brownstein mentioned that Tucker was at work on a solo album for Kill Rock Stars .
And now , lo and behold , Tucker has confirmed that she 's well into the process of recording that album , which she hopes to release in October .
The album does n't have a title or a release date yet , but Tucker 's been at work in a Portland studio , teaming up with Unwound 's Sara Lund and Golden Bears ' Seth Lorinczi .
In a Portland Mercury interview , Tucker about the process of getting back to music and how the album might eventually sound .
She mentions that she plays acoustic guitar on the record , and that " It 's definitely more of a middle - aged mom record , in a way .
It 's not a record that a young person would write ...
There 's some sadness , some reinvention , some rebirth .
I think the goal for me is to write some good stories . "
Musically , she says it may be " more traditional in some of the arrangements " than Sleater - Kinney .
A few intriguing reference points are mentioned : the Slits , the Raincoats , the English Beat , and Sinead O'Connor 's The Lion and the Cobra .
She does n't expect to do any full - scale international touring behind the project , though .
Tucker mentions that she 'll probably play a few shows on both coasts , as well as , hopefully , the odd festival : " We 're doing a creative project , with a really low budget , on a really small scale , and [ we 'll ] do a handful of shows to have people hear about the record . "
In an IFC interview last month , Brownstein mentioned that Sleater - Kinney could return in oh , say , five years .
In that Portland Mercury interview , Tucker seems to echo that noncommittal but awesome sentiment : " The door is open .
We ended things on a hiatus , so that it was always something that could happen in the future .
You know , I 'd love to live a long productive life and do a lot of different things .
This has been the challenge of trying different musical styles , and I 'd like to do more of that -- regardless of Sleater - Kinney or other projects . "

The WHOIS is here .
Paris , France ( CNN ) --
A winter storm named " Xynthia " battered the western coast of Europe Sunday , its high winds downing trees and power lines and leaving as many as 55 people dead , authorities said .
Hardest hit was France , where at least 45 people were killed , French Prime Minister Francois Fillon announced .
The extra-tropical cyclone whipped the country 's coastal regions and moved inland , bringing sometimes heavy flooding with it .
Are you affected by the storm ?
Share images and information with CNN iReport .
" It 's a national catastrophe , " Fillon said in a brief news conference following an emergency meeting on the situation .
" Many people drowned , surprised by the rapid rise of the water .
" Now the priority is to bring all the people left homeless and still threatened by the rising waters to safety , " the prime minister explained .
" All services are mobilized to reach that goal as soon as possible . "
French President Nicolas Sarkozy will visit the department of Charente - Maritime Monday , Fillon said .
Charente - Maritime and Vendee , on the French coast west of Paris , had severe flooding when the strong winds whipped up the water at high tide .
" At 3 o'clock in the morning , we heard the toilets backing up .
We got up to look and then we saw 80 cm ( about 31 inches ) of water in the garage , " a resident of Aiguillon - Sur - Mer , in the department of Vendee , told CNN affiliate BFM - TV .
" It was rushing in , it broke down the walls around the garden and the gate . "
Hundreds of people had to be rescued from their rooftops overnight .
" The water was up to the gutters , " said one woman , who spent the night on the roof with her children .
Residents of the village of Aytre , in Charente - Maritime , saw a wave of water measuring 1 meter high ( about 1 yard ) come into the center of town .
One couple told BFM - TV their children were airlifted and they were taken out by boat .
" It rose very high , very high , we were very scared , " another man told the station .
" It was unreal , " Aytre Mayor Suzanne Tallard told BFM - TV .
At least 1 million households were without power Sunday afternoon , Bernard Lassus of Electricite de France said in an interview on BFM - TV .
French Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux told BFM - TV that 350 soldiers and 3,250 firefighters have been mobilized .
About 10 helicopters are being used to airlift people , he said , and draining operations were underway .
The high winds -- at times spiking to 200 km/h ( 124 mph ) -- reached inland as far as Paris , where as many as 100 flights were canceled at the Paris - Charles de Gaulle International Airport , BFM reported .
Gusts up to 175 km/h ( 108 mph ) were measured at the top of the Eiffel Tower Saturday , reported CNN International Meteorologist Eboni Deon .
The hurricane - strength winds stretched from Portugal northeast to the Netherlands .
The system was moving toward the Baltic Sea , Deon said , and a second front was moving into the region of Portugal and Spain later in the day .
In Spain , three people were killed in the first band of the storm , Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Sunday .
Two children died in a car accident and another person was killed in northwestern Spain , the minister said in a news conference on CNN sister station CNN +.
At least 17 provinces were on high alert due to the strong winds , CNN + reported , and some flights and train services were canceled .
A 10 - year - old child was killed by a falling tree in the high winds in Portugal , Patricia Gaspar , National Operations Assistant with the Portuguese National Authority for Civil Protection , confirmed to CNN .
There are also some power outages in the country , Gaspar said .
Some residents have reported roofs blown off and smaller houses collapsing , she added .
Four people were killed in Germany as a result of the storm , officials said -- all four when they or their cars were struck by falling trees .
One of them , a 69 - year - old man , was a hiker in a group of about 20 , police said , but the others were evacuated to safety .
A man was also killed by a falling tree in Belgium , Peter Mertens , a spokesman for Belgium 's Interior Ministry , confirmed to CNN .
Eastern Belgium has seen the worst of the storm , Mertens said .
" They 've had problems with fallen trees , roofs blown off and electricity cables not working .
But it seems the worst part has passed now , " he added .
The storm also reached England , where one woman was reported dead when the vehicle she was driving became submerged and washed down a swollen creek in the northeastern part of the country .
The body of the 53 - year - old woman was recovered downstream , North Yorkshire Police said in a recorded phone message to the media .
CNN's Al Goodman in Madrid , Spain ; Per Nyberg in London , England ; Frederik Pleitgen in Berlin , Germany ; and Estelle Eonnet and Lorraine Gublin in Paris , France contributed to this report
BioWare has made a few announcements regarding the downloadable content for Mass Effect 2 , first , the FireWalker DLC which was expected to hit late March will be releasing March 23 , free of cost to members of the Cyberus Network .
This means those who have bought used copies of the game have to fork out $ 15 ( 1,200 Microsoft points ) for access to the network and to both the free DLCs ( all part of EA ’s $ 10 project )
The Firefly DLC adds the “ Hammerhead ” , a new hovertank for planetary missions .
The Hammerhead can be used in five new missions which are part of the DLC .
The other one is that Kasumi ’s Stolen Memory , the first paid DLC for Mass Effect 2 will be hitting April 6 .
Offering 90 minutes worth of gameplay , Kasumi ’s Stolen Memory mission marks the first of these paid additions .
Proficient in the art of thievery , Kasumi secures the 12th and final spot on the Normany , bringing Commander Shepardâ€™s intergalactic search of elite combat specialists to a close .
Without delving too far into spoiler territory , this mission will incorporate elements of stealth as Shepard and his band of cohorts embark on an undercover stint at the estate of crime lord Donovan Hock .
Holy smoke :
Bank worker saved from fire by divine intervention finds Jesus in his frying pan
When Toby Elles fell asleep while cooking a late - night snack , it really was a case of divine intervention that saved his bacon .
The 22 - year - old was ' miraculously ' woken after an hour as his lounge filled with smoke – and quickly had the revelation that he had left a frying pan on a hob .
While saying his prayers , the bank worker scraped the remains of crispy bacon rashers from the pan , but could not believe the vision that appeared before him - Jesus Christ staring back at him .
Jesus crust : Toby Elles found the image of the Son of God after falling asleep while cooking
The image , burnt into the base of the pan , shows eyes and a nose as well as the distinctive beard and long hair of the son of God .
‘ It ’s some kind of miracle ’ , the Halifax Bank cashier from Salford , Lancaster , said .
His culinary efforts may have been burnt to a crisp but Mr Elles said being saved from meeting the man upstairs was well worth it .
He added : ‘ I fell asleep cooking some bacon and it had burnt this face on to the pan .
‘ If it was n't for the smoke it could have been a very bad situation , perhaps someone 's looking over me .
Vision :
Toby discovered the image of Jesus when scraping the burnt bacon from the frying pan
‘ My housemates and I had a few beers earlier in the evening I thought I would snack before going to bed and as it was cooking I decided to take a rest on the couch .
‘ When I woke up about an hour later the room was full of smoke .
‘ Luckily we have an electric hob so I just turned off the heat , but then I lifted up the bacon and there was JC looking back at me . ’
Mr Elles has said he is going to keep the ' gift from God ' for good luck .
‘ I'm not going to scrub it clean though , just in case I get struck by lightning , it 's going to take pride of place on a wall instead , ' he said .
‘ It 's become quite a talking point for people who come round to the house and I have even thought I might get a glass cabinet to put it in .
" I 'm going to keep it for the rest of my life , perhaps it can watch over me . "
Despite the fact that this is essentially an ad for a Viacom product that also promotes a GE - sponsored celebration of nationalism , this Shepard Fairey poster for Stephen Colbert 's Olympics trip is pretty cool .
So go paper Vancouver with it , kids !

The new US Minerals Databrowser uses as its base the minerals data set found in US Geological Survey Data Series 140 .
This data set provides consumption / production , import / export , price and usage data for a large number of minerals used in manufacturing , construction , and agriculture .
Oil Drum readers may be interested in this data set , because many of the minerals are ones which have been described as being nearing or past their peak , or ones for which import dependence is an issue .
Many of you are familiar with Jonathan 's Energy Export Databrowser , which he created in 2008 , showing imports and exports of energy products by various countries around the world , based on BP 's Statistical Review .
Jonathan Callahan , a PhD chemist who has worked for almost 20 years as a data analysis / data visualization expert for various Federal science agencies ( NOAA , NASA , EPA ) , has created a new data browser , called US Minerals Databrowser .
The data , when it is complete , can go back as far as 1900 .
The most recent year varies , but is often as recent as 2008 for some data elements .
The Databrowser shows up to five graphics for each mineral :
1. US Production / Imports -
This graphic also shows US consumption and exports .
2. World Production / Price -
This graphic also shows US production .
3. Price Evolution - Displays price vs. world production , the way an economist might look at it .
4 . Usage history - ( Only for items without an *) - Shows how consumption by product has varied over time .
5 . Usage pie - ( Only for items without an *) - Shows consumption by product for the most recent year available ( often 2003 ) as a pie chart .
More detail describing these charts and their interpretation can be found on the About page .
Many of us use Jonathan 's Energy Export Databrowser very regularly .
This new tool promises to be very helpful as well , when questions come up about a mineral , and wether production is likely to hit a peak in the near future .
It is also helpful to know what a particular mineral is used for , and how that has changed over time .
To give an illustration how this databrowser can be used , I put this post up the same day that a Campfire post on potassium ( from potash ) and phosphorous ( phosphate ) is up .
Jonathan tells us he would like constructive feedback on his new databrowser .
So give him your thoughts in this thread , or contact him at jonathan .s. callahan [ at ] gmail [ dot ] com .
PARIS  A head - on collision between trains outside Brussels during the morning rush on Monday killed at least 18 people and injured 80 , a police spokesman said , in Belgium ’s deadliest railroad accident in more than 25 years .
Rescue workers were still pulling bodies from the wreckage on Monday evening , and the police estimated that the death toll could rise as high as 25 .
All of the survivors had been evacuated , said the spokesman , who declined to be identified , citing police policy .
The cause of the accident , which occurred around 8:30 a.m. in snowy conditions in the village of Buizingen , near Halle , about 10 miles southwest of Brussels , remained unclear .
Lodewijk De Witte , the governor of the province of Flemish Brabant , told reporters on the scene that one of the trains appeared to have disregarded a signal to stop , but the police spokesman would not confirm that .
The authors discovered that frequently the long - term damage done to the firm that is sued impacts its viability going forward , a factor that could have negative consequences for investors who are still exposed via their holdings with the company .
One way around this would be to target the suit to individuals most at fault  an idea that is more practical than ever in the era of multimillion - dollar compensation packages for high - level financial employees .
 Class actions hurt the reputation of the corporation , distract the attention of the management and , to the extent that settlement is reached , this money may come , at least partially , out of the corporations pocket , rather than the pocket of the insurance company ,  says Bai .
She adds :  The lawsuit may impose financial distress on the part of the corporation and hurt its financial well - being .
From the shareholders ' point of view , they have brought the action hoping to be compensated in the form of a large settlement , but they are ultimately the owners of the corporation and , as such , they bear the full negative consequence that the class action may bring to the corporation . 
The new paper by Bai , Cox and Thomas examines two competing views on class - action suits against the current backdrop of consideration of new financial regulation reforms .
One traditional school of thought says that the threat of such suits is a necessary deterrent that assures sound practices by financial firms .
The other adheres to a deregulatory philosophy that such suits place American companies at a competitive disadvantage in the global financial marketplace while doing little to help the overall position of investors .
Audio clip of Lynn Bai discussing investor impact from lawsuits
The research looked at the impact class - action suits had on 480 companies that were defendants in recent class action suits who had settled the litigation brought against them .
Those defendants were compared to companies in the same industries and of similar sizes on key financial parameters such as sales , operating income , liquidity , financial distress levels and stock market performances .
The study revealed evidence of deterioration in the defendants ' operating efficiency and short - term liquidity as well as a higher propensity of filing bankruptcy after the lawsuit , relative to their peers .
Moreover , stock prices plummeted upon the filing of the lawsuit and had not recovered even years after the lawsuits had been settled .
As one example of the kind of troubles these companies experience , consider what the study showed in regards to increases in risks of bankruptcy .
" The Altman 's Z - score is a measure of the overall financial distress level of a company and is widely accepted as a powerful predictor of bankruptcy in the near - future , " Bai says .
" We found that our defendents had significantly lower Z - scores than comparable companies that were not involved in class - action lawsuits , which was a new finding . "

BETWEEN 1992 and 2007 , according to Ian Hutcheon of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , in California , 17kg of highly enriched uranium was seized from smugglers around the world , along with 400 grams of plutonium .
In neither case is that enough for a proper atom bomb , but it is still worrying .
Presumably , more is out there .
Even if it is not , the material that has been found could have been used to make a “ radiological ” weapon , by blowing it up and scattering it around a city using conventional explosives .
Dr Hutcheon is one of those charged with analysing this captured material , to discover how dangerous it really is and where it came from — and thus whether it has been stolen from legitimate nuclear projects or made on the sly .
At the AAAS meeting in San Diego , he showed off some of the tricks of his trade .
His main tool is a device called a secondary - ion mass spectrometer .
This measures the flight path of ions ( electrically charged atoms ) through a magnetic field .
The lighter an ion is , the more the field bends its trajectory .
The spectrometer can thus distinguish between , say , 235U ( the fissile sort , from which bombs are made ) and 238U ( which has three extra neutrons in its nucleus and is much less fissile ) .
Natural uranium has only seven atoms per thousand of the former .
Weapons - grade uranium is 95 % 235U .
The “ depleted ” uranium used in armour - penetrating shells , by contrast , is almost pure 238U .
Uranium that has been in a reactor , though , has other isotopes in it , 233U and 236U , for example .
The quantities of these , plus isotopes of elements such as plutonium that are also created in reactors , vary from one reactor to another .
The isotopic signature is changed , too , by the centrifuges used to separate 235U from 238U during the process of enrichment , and radioactive decay after processing creates yet further elements that can be detected this way .
These give some idea of a sample 's age .
The result is a profile that is often characteristic of a particular type of reactor or centrifuge , and sometimes of an individual machine — and can also indicate how long ago the processing took place .
That enables the good guys to improve security in the case where something has been pinched , the bad guys to be admonished if they have been up to something they should not have been doing , and everyone else to sleep more easily in their beds .
When I envisioned the father in the first panel being shocked I imagined him being in the same pose as Rich Uncle Pennybags from one of the Community Chest cards in Monopoly .
Then I thought , “ Why not just use Rich Uncle Pennybags in the comic itself ? ”
And so I did .
Whenever I think about Halo sooner or later the idea of ‘ teabagging ’ comes to mind .
Have to thank VGCats for that .
Remember that big announcement I ’ve been mentioning ?
Well , I did n’t have all the pieces together for said big announcement until yesterday .
So I ’m polishing up the details and making it look a lot more professional before I post the information on Monday .
I ’m serious .
Monday is when I announce what I have been talking about announcing .
The announcement is coming then .
So announces me .
So I will see you on Monday .
Until then maybe this can tie you over in the interim .
The recent flurry of departures from F1 is set to continue this week with news that the letter F is considering its position within the sport .
The popular letter has been a part of F1 ever since the first Formula 1 race took place in 1947 and reports that it is considering its future within the sport will come as a blow to those who run the popular race series , in particular Bernard Ecclestone who is neither of those things .
‘ I ’m sure the sport ’s management will claim that F1 is bigger than the letter F , ’ notes Maurice Ital of Every Other Sunday magazine .
‘ But the truth is , F1 needs F more than F needs F1 , or “ 1 ” as it may have to become known ’ .
Sources close to F say that the multi-national sixth position in the alphabet letter has grown tired of the expense and complexity of travelling the world during the Formula 1 season , with its relentless and draining whirl of appearing on signs , headed notepaper and even napkins , plus the ongoing obligation to emerge from people ’s mouths throughout race weekends .
One insider close to the letter F also noted that in the current economic climate F has other commitments such as leading the way on phrases like ‘ fiscal meltdown ’ , ‘ fiduciary failures ’ and ‘ fucking hell I ’m frigging amazed Toyota did n’t fuck off four or five years ago ’ .
If , as seems likely , the letter F does leave F1 it ’s almost certain that the sport ’s governing body will seek a replacement to fill the gap at the front of its abbreviated name .
Speculation as to what that replacement will be was heightened this morning with news that the letter A , currently without a position in motorsport following the collapse of the A1 GP series , was seen leaving Formula 1 headquarters .
Like it is n’t enough that Condé Nasties ’ weight , clothes , and e-mail are monitored by their fellow employees .
Now , the increasingly KGB - like company is asking employees to keep tabs on each other in a new way .
According to Keith Kelly , chief financial officer John Bellando sent out a memo today announcing the company ’s establishment of a new fraud hotline , so that they can rat each other out about everyday things like exaggerated expense accounts , not declaring vacation days , leaking shirtless pictures of political candidates ’ baby daddies to online news sources , and even — horror — acceptance of freebies .
From the Post :
The Fraud Reporting Hotline will try to stop “ release of proprietary information , accounting / audit irregularities , falsification of company records , theft of goods / services / cash , ” and even “ unauthorized discounts / payoffs . ”
Jeez .
Are n’t they worried that by protecting the culture , they ’re ruining it ?
Working there is getting so unattractive , soon only unattractive people will want to work there .

Last week , Brookhaven National Lab hosted a press tour of their Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider , one of only two active particle colliders in the US .
The tour also included a briefing on the work that Brookhaven scientists are doing at CERN's Large Hadron Collider .
We 'll cover the information in more detail in the near future , but we wanted to share some of the great photos we were able to take during the tour .
Brookhaven 's Peter Steinberg , whose session at last year 's AAAS meeting received some coverage here , joined us for the bus ride out .
He described how RHIC , although lower energy than the Tevatron or LHC , remains relevant because it specializes in colliding the nuclei of heavy atoms — in this case , gold ions .
When they collide , the high density and energy creates a small area in which the components of the nuclei , the quarks and gluons , are liberated , forming a single high energy soup .
( The LHC is also scheduled to spend part of its time colliding lead nuclei to similar effect . )
Brookhaven is also the primary US center for the ATLAS detector at the LHC , and discussions of its role in building and running that detector bookended the tour of the RHIC .
Brookhaven is helping produce an LHC popup book that will go on sale at Amazon shortly .
The LHC resides below ground , and the popup book raises the French / Swiss countryside to scale using the access tunnels .
The book was a big hit with the press in attendance , and had some really nice graphics
A medium - sized bang leaps out of the pages .
Brookhaven helped with the design and construction of the ATLAS detector , and hardware similar to what 's soon to be back in operation were in the conference room .
A gridded metal detector like the one shown here will detect muons produced by the collision .
The energies of the particles produced by the collisions will be measured in ATLAS using a liquid argon - cooled calorimeter , which includes some basic signal processing hardware .
A model of the calorimeter and some of its associated electronics .
We received an extensive briefing from the US ATLAS program head , Howard Gordon , who was joined by some of Brookhaven 's staff at the LHC via videoconference .
So , I do n't know about where you live , but here in Utah , Jello is a big deal .
Seems like any get together involves someone bringing so ...

Misusing Wireless ISPs for Anonymous Communication
Most wireless communication techniques are broadcast media by nature on the physical layer , i.e. , the actual signal can be received by any party in a certain coverage area .
A common means to perform secure unicast point - to - point communication over such wireless infrastructures is by applying cryptographic protocols on higher layers : both communication end - points ( commonly user and carrier ) set up a session key , which is then used to build private and authentic unicast communication by means of encryption and message authentication .
As of today , a common assumption in the design and analysis of such communication protocols is that both end - points ( user and carrier ) behave correctly according to the cryptographic protocol , because they want to preserve security against outsiders .
However , if carriers have more power / resources in terms of bandwidth or coverage , users may not be interested in protecting their unicast communication against outsiders at all .
Instead , users may try to extend their communication power / resources by means of insider attacks against the communication protocol .
Therefore , such insider attacks pose new threats to these protocols and have , to the best of our knowledge , been neglected so far .
In this presentation we will present several insider attacks , which break the unicast communication imposed by the carrier of the infrastructure .
The most striking example of highly asymmetric resources are satellite ISPs : here the user normally has a terrestrial link to the carrier and no means to broadcast data at all .
On the other side , the carrier can broadcast its signals over huge footprints , covering thousands of kilometers .
Therefore , we will illustrate our attacks mainly in terms of satellite ISPs , but also discuss other examples such as WIMAX .
Our strongest insider attack allows any end - user to make the satellite ISP broadcast data as clear text , even if the downlink ( data sent from the satellite to the user ) is properly encrypted by the satellite ISP , thereby breaking the unicast communication structure imposed by the satellite ISP .
Finally , we discuss how the presented findings can be used to set up communication channels , achieving perfect receiver anonymity .

Cyber[ Crime|War ] charting dangerous waters
CyberWar has been a controversial topic in the past few years .
Some say the the mere term is an error .
CyberCrime on the other hand has been a major source of concern , as lack of jurisdiction and law enforcement have made it one of organizaed crime 's best sources of income .
In this talk we will explore the uncharted waters between CyberCrime and CyberWarfare , while mapping out the key players ( mostly on the state side ) and how past events can be linked to the use of syndicated CyberCrime organization when carrying out attacks on the opposition .
We will discuss the connections between standard warfare ( kinetic ) and how modern campaigns use cybersecurity to its advantage and as an integral part of it .

Binding the Daemon : FreeBSD Kernel Stack and Heap Exploitation
FreeBSD ( http://www.freebsd.org/) is widely accepted as one of the most reliable and performance - driven operating systems currently available in both the open source and proprietary worlds .
While the exploitation of kernel vulnerabilities has been researched in the context of the Windows and Linux operating systems , FreeBSD , and BSD systems in general , have not received the same attention .
This presentation will initially examine the exploitation of kernel stack overflow vulnerabilities on FreeBSD .
The development process of a privilege escalation kernel stack smashing exploit will be documented for vulnerability CVE - 2008 - 3531 .
The second part of the presentation will present a detailed security analysis of the Universal Memory Allocator ( UMA ) , the FreeBSD kernel 's memory allocator .
We will examine how UMA overflows can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the latest stable FreeBSD kernel ( 8.0 - RELEASE ) , and we will develop an exploitation methodology for privilege escalation and kernel continuation .

SCADA and ICS for Security Experts : How to avoid being a Cyber Idiot
The traditional security industry has somehow decided that they are the white knights who are going to save everyone from the horror of insecure powergrids , pipelines , chemical plants , and cookie factories .
Suddenly , every consultant is an expert and every product is loudly advertising how it solves SCADA SECURITY AND COMPLIANCY ISSUES !!!
And because they do n't know what the hell they 're talking about - ' fake it till ya make it ' does n't work - they 're making all of us look stupid .
Let 's sit down for a little fireside chat and discuss all things SCADA and ICS with an eye towards increasing our knowledge to the point where we can confidently say : " I 'm not an expert at everything , I can help some , may we work together on a solution ? "
It 's time to stop being a Cyber Idiot and start being a positive contributor .
Learn some truth , look behind the curtain , bust some FUD , Oh - and make government agents have kittens .
That 's fun for everyone .

Surviving your phone : protecting mobile communications with Tor
Tor is a software project that helps you defend against traffic analysis , a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy , confidential business activities and relationships , and state security .
Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world : it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit , and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location .
Unfortunately , with the new features of HTML5 and browser built - in geolocation being pushed into the Web2.0 world and on mobile phones and browser , it 's becoming harder and harder to keep the users ' privacy safe .
This presentation will describe the problems which are arising around the use of these new technologies and how they can be ( ab) used to attack Tor users .
It will also describe where the development is going to protect mobile phone users privacy and let them survive their own devices .

Fireshark - A tool to Link the Malicious Web
Thousands of legitimate web sites serve malicious content to millions of visitors each and every day .
Trying to piece all the research together to confirm any similarities between possible common group patterns within these websites , such as redirectors that belong to the same IP , IP range , or ASN , and reconstructing the final deobfuscated code can be time - consuming and sometimes impossible given many of the freely available tools .
I will present a web security research project called FireShark that is capable of visiting large collections of websites at a time , executing , storing and analyzing the content , and from it identifying hundreds of malicious ecosystems of which the data , such as the normalized , deobfuscated content within them can easily be analyzed .

SAP Backdoors : A ghost at the heart of your business
In any company , the ERP ( Enterprise Resource Planning ) is the heart of the business technological platform .
These systems handle the key business processes of the organization , such as procurement , invoicing , human resources management , billing , stock management and financial planning .
Among all the ERPs , SAP is by far the most widely deployed one , having more than 90.000 customers in more than 120 countries and running in Fortune 100 companies , governmental and defense organizations .
The information stored in these systems is of absolute importance to the company , which unauthorized manipulation would result in big economic losses and loss of reputation .
This talk will present an old concept applied to a new paradigm : SAP Backdoors .
We will discuss different novel techniques that can be deployed by malicious intruders in order to create and install backdoors in SAP systems , allowing them to retain access or install malicious components that would result in imperceptible - and - ongoing financial frauds .
After the description of these techniques , we will present the countermeasures that should be applied in order to avoid these attacks and protect the business information , effectively reducing financial fraud risks and enforcing compliance .
Furthermore , we will release a new Onapsis free tool that will help security managers to automatically detect unauthorized modifications to SAP systems .
Is your SAP backdoored ?
If your answer is " I do n’t know , " then you may consider attending to this talk .

Verifying eMRTD Security Controls
With the transition to RFID enabled travel documents ( including the ePassport and the eID ) in Europe , a correct implementation of the authentication and verification of passport technologies is necessary .
The complexity if the technology can cause a myriad of security issues in the identification .
Our presentation examines the eMRTD security controls and suggests correct implementations to enable identification as a mechanism .
We also examine the dangers of incorrect implementations and the resulting consequences .

Targeted attacks : from being a victim to counter attacking
This presentation is an analysis of a common sort of targeted attacks performed nowadays against many organizations .
As it turns out , publicly available remote access tools - RAT ( which we usually call trojans ) are frequently used to maintain control over the victim after a successful penetration .
The presentation and the white paper do not focus on a particular exploitation techniques used in these attacks .
Instead , they aim to get a closer look at one of the most popular remote access trojans .
The presentation describes a way to ﬁgure out which particular trojan has been used .
It shows the architecture , capabilities and techniques employed by developers of the identiﬁed trojan , including mechanisms to hide its presence in the system , and to cover its network trace .
It speaks about tools and techniques used to perform this analysis .
Finally , it presents a vulnerability analysis and a proof of concept exploit to show that the intruders could also be an object of an attack .

Practical Crypto Attacks Against Web Applications
In 2009 , we released a paper on MD5 extension attack ( [ 1 ] ) , and described how attackers can use the attack to exploit popular web sites such as Flickr , Vimeo , Scribd , etc .
The attack has been well - received by the community , and made the Top Ten Web Hacking Techniques of 2009 ( [ 2 ] ) .
In the conclusion of that paper , we stated that we have bexen carrying out a research in which we test - run a number of identified practical crypto attacks on random widely - used software systems .
To our surprise , most , if not all , can be attacked by one or more of well - known crypto bugs .
In this talk , we present the latest result of that research , where we choose another powerful crypto attack , and turn it into a new set of practical web hacking techniques .
We show that widely used web development frameworks and web sites are using encryption wrongly that allow attackers to read and modify data that should be protected .
It has been known for years in cryptography community that encryption is not authentication .
If encrypted messages are not authenticated , data integrity cannot be guaranteed which makes systems vulnerable to practical and dangerous chosen - ciphertext attacks .
Finally , we list several popular web development frameworks and web sites that are vulnerable to Padding Oracle attacks , including , but not limited to , eBay Latin America , Apache MyFaces , SUN Mojarra , Ruby On Rails , etc .
These are all 0 - day vulnerabilities .
We show that even OWASP folks can't get it right , how can an average Joe survive this new class of vulnerabilities ?
We strongly believe that this is just the tip of the iceberg , and the techniques we describe in this research would uncover many more vulnerabilities for years to come .

How to operationally detect and break misuse of weak stream ciphers ( and even block ciphers sometimes ) - Application to the Office Encryption Cryptanalysis
Despite the evergrowing use of block ciphers , stream ciphers are still widely used : satellite communications ( military , diplomatic ... ) , civilian telecommunications , software ...
If their intrinsic security can be considered as strong , the main drwaback lies in the high risk of key misuse wich introduces severe weaknesses , even for unconditionnally secure ciphers like the Vernam system .
Such misuses are still very frequent , more than we could expect .
In this talk we explain how to detect such misuses , to identify ciphertexts that are relevant to this misuse ( among a huge amount of ciphertexts ) and finally how to recover the underlying plaintext within minutes .
This may also apply to ( intendly or not ) badly implemented block ciphers .
To illustrate this technique , this talk will also deal with the technical cryptanalysis of encryption used in Office up to the 2003 version ( RC4 based ) .
We will focus on Word and Excel applications .
The cryptanalysis has been successfully and we manage to recover more than 90 % of the encrypted texts in a few seconds .
The attack is based both on a pure mathematical effort AND a few basic forensic approach .
In a more general cases ( e.g. satellite communications ) , we just need to intercept ciphertexts .
In the Office case , we will explain in our sense that the attack does not rely on particular weakness but in a setting that can be seriously considered and described as a possible intended trap .
We will develop this concept to explain how in a more general way such trap can be built .

Defending the Poor
The talk presents a simple but effective approach for securing Rich Internet Application ( RIA ) content before using it .
Focusing on Adobe Flash content , the security threats presented by Flash movies are discussed , as well as their inner workings that allow such attacks to happen .
Some of those details will make you laugh , some will make you wince .
Based on the properties discussed , the idea behind the defense approach will be presented , as well as the code implementing it and the results of using it in the real world .

Weaponizing Wireless Networks : An Attack Tool for Launching Attacks against Sensor Networks
The pervasive interconnection of autonomous sensor devices has given birth to a broad class of exciting new applications .
At the same time , however , the unattended nature and the limited resources of sensor nodes have created an equal number of vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit in order to gain access in the network and the information transferred within .
While much work has been done on trying to defend these networks , little has been done on suggesting sophisticated tools for proving how vulnerable sensor networks are .
This work demonstrates a tool that allows both passive monitoring of transactional data in sensor networks , such as message rate , mote frequency , message routing , etc. , but also discharge of various attacks against them .
To the best of our knowledge , this is the first instance of an attack tool that can be used by an adversary to penetrate the confidentiality and functionality of a sensor network .
Results show that our tool can be flexibly applied to different sensor network operating systems and protocol stacks giving an adversary privileges to which she is not entitled to .
We hope that our tool will be used proactively , to study the weaknesses of new security protocols , and , hopefully , to enhance the level of security provided by these solutions even further .

Hardware is the New Software
Society thrives on an ever increasing use of technology .
Electronics are embedded into nearly everything we touch .
Hardware products are being relied on for security - related applications and are inherently trusted , though many are completely susceptible to compromise with simple classes of attacks that have been known for decades .
Bolstered by the flourishing hobbyist electronics / do - it - yourself movement , easy access to equipment , and realtime information sharing courtesy of the internet , hardware is an area of computer security that can no longer be overlooked .
In this session , Joe will explore the hardware hacking process and share some recent high - profile attacks against electronic devices .

0 - knowledge fuzzing
Nowadays fuzzing is a pretty common technique used both by attackers and software developers .
Currently known techniques usually involve knowing the protocol / format that needs to be fuzzed and having a basic understanding of how the user input is processed inside the binary .
In the past since fuzzing was little - used obtaining good results with a small amount of effort was possible .
Today finding bugs requires digging a lot inside the code and the user - input as common vulnerabilies are already identified and fixed by developers .
This talk will present an idea on how to effectively fuzz with no knowledge of the user - input and the binary .
Specifically the talk will demonstrate how techniques like code coverage , data tainting and in - memory fuzzing allow to build a smart fuzzer with no need to instrument it in any way .

Adobe Reader 's Custom Memory Management : a Heap of Trouble
PDF vulnerabilities are hot .
Several AV and security companies , in their 2010 predictions , cited an increase in PDF vulnerabilities volume , possibly driven by demand from Cybercriminals , eager to leverage them in focused and large - scale attacks alike .
But how serious could it really be , and what 's the share of casual marketing FUD spreading here ?
After all , many PDF vulnerabilities out there are structure ( i.e. file format ) based ones , and essentially result in heap corruption situations .
And everybody knows that leveraging a heap corruption bug into actual exploitation , with execution of attacker - supplied code , is no piece of cake .
Indeed , MS Windows ' heap is hardly predictable , and is armoured with protection mechanisms such as safe - unlinking .
Yet , the main PDF reader software out there , called Adobe Reader , has a specificity that may lead us to revise our beliefs : for performance purpose , it implements its own heap management system , on top of the Operating System 's one .
And it turns out that , performance sometimes ( often ? nah ... ) being the enemy of security , this custom heap management system makes it significantly easier to exploit heap corruption flaws in a solid and reliable way .
Coupled with the very recent developments in DEP protection bypass in Flash ( eg : JIT spraying [ 1 ] ) , which we will briefly show to be also valid in PDF context , this makes heap corruption exploitation potentially consistent across a very large amount of setups ( a very interesting characteristic for the Cybercriminal , either for " blind - shooting " at a targeted system , or for compromising a large amount of systems at once ) .
This paper introduces Adobe 's Reader custom heap management system , dissects its mechanisms , and points out its weaknesses in order to shed light and awareness on the PDF vulnerabilities issue .
In addition , limitations will be discussed and possible mitigation leads evoked .

Universal XSS via IE8s XSS Filters
Internet Explorer 8 has built in cross -site scripting ( XSS ) detection and prevention filters .
We will explore the details of how the filters detect attacks , the neutering method , and discuss the filters ' general strengths and weaknesses .
We will demonstrate several ways in which the filters can be abused ( not just bypassed ) in order to enable XSS on sites that would not otherwise be vulnerable .
We will then show how this vulnerability makes most every major website vulnerable to XSS in affected versions of Internet Explorer 8 .

Changing Threats To Privacy : From TIA to Google
We won the war for strong cryptography , anonymous darknets exist in the wild today , and decentralized communication networks have emerged to become reality .
These strategies for communicating online were conceived of in anticipation of a dystopian future , but somehow these original efforts have fallen short of delivering us from the most pernicious threats to privacy that we 're now facing .
Rather than a centralized state - based database of all our communication and movements , modern threats to privacy have become something much more subtle , and perhaps all the more sinister .
This talk will explore these evolving trends and discuss some interesting solutions in the works .

Oracle , Interrupted : Stealing Sessions and Credentials
In a world of free , ever - present encryption libraries , many penetration testers still find a lot of great stuff on the wire .
Database traffic is a common favorite , and with good reason : when the data includes PAN , Track , and CVV , it makes you stop and wonder why this stuff is n’t encrypted by default .
However , despite this weakness , we still need someone to issue queries before we see the data .
Or maybe not … after all , it ’s just plaintext .
Wendel G. Henrique and Steve Ocepek of Trustwave ’s SpiderLabs division offer a closer look at the world ’s most popular relational database : Oracle .
Through a combination of downgrade attacks and session take - over exploits , this talk introduces a unique approach to database account hijacking .
Using a new tool , thicknet , released at Black Hat Europe , the team will demonstrate how deadly injection attacks can be to database security .

Abusing JBoss
JBoss Application Server is the open source implementation of the Java EE suite of services .
It 's easy - to - use server architecture and high flexibility makes JBoss the ideal choice for users just starting out with J2EE , as well as senior architects looking for a customizable middleware platform .
The pervasiveness of JBoss in enterprise JSP deployments is second to none meaning there is an abundance of targets both for the blackhat or the pentester alike .
JBoss is usually invoked as root / SYSTEM meaning that any potential exploitation usually results in immediate super user privileges .
A tool has been developed that is able to compromise an unprotected JBoss instance .
The current state of the art in published literature involves having the JBoss instance connect back to the attacker to obtain a war file that is subsequently deployed .
The tool that will be presented at Black Hat does this in - situ and ultimately uploads a Metasploit payload resulting in interactive command execution on the JBoss instance .
On Windows platforms , through the Metasploit framework a fully interactive reverse VNC shell can also be obtained and shall be demonstrated .
Depending on the platform that has been exploited and the level of access obtained , the tool is able to deploy the Metasploit payload as a persistent backdoor in conjunction with the Metasploit framework ’s antivirus evasion techniques .
Due to the cross platform nature of the Java language , we are able to compromise JBoss instances running on Linux , MacOSX and Windows .

Hacking Cisco Enterprise WLANs
The world of " Enterprise WLAN solutions " is full of obscure and " non-standard " elements and technologies .
Cisco 's solutions , from the early Structured Wireless - Aware Network ( SWAN ) to the current Cisco Wireless Unified Networking ( CUWN ) architectures , only partly differ here .
In this talk we describe the inner workings of these solutions , dissect the vulnerable parts and discuss theoretical and practical attacks , with some nice demos .
A new tool automating a number of attacks ( incl .
taking over the WDS master role , extracting WPA pairwise master keys from intra-AP communication etc ) will be released at Black Hat Europe .

Attacking JAVA Serialized Communication
Many applications written in JAVA make use of Object Serialization to transfer full blown objects across the network via byte streams or to store them on the file system .
While Penetration Testing applications communicating via Serialized Objects , current tools / application interception proxies allow very limited functionality to intercept and modify the requests and responses like in typical web applications .
I 'm trying to introduce a new technique to intercept such Serialized communication and modify it to perform penetration testing with almost the same ease as testing regular web applications .
For achieving this I have developed a plug - in for Burp Suite as a proof - of - concept .
What makes this technique unique is that it is completely seamless and gives the penetration tester the same control and power that an application developer has .

State Of Malware : Family Ties
Over the last few years malware has gravitated towards a few major families rather than the single or small - sized families of the past .
Families of hundreds or even thousands are not uncommon .
These families grouped together demonstrate the evolution of malware over time .
This evolution may originate in simple bugfixes and small enhancements or entirely new sets of functionality added over an existing code base .
Studying the ties between families , both within and across families , provides us with a context in which to study the development pace and technical improvements as they appear .
We will examine how families grow and change amongst the mass malware and targeted attack malware .
While examining how families grow and change we will attempt to identify features across all families that are both common and implemented in the same way .
This could lead to quick static identification of malware features as well as signaturing these features .
We hope to show how multiple families are derived from one code base , we will not just address mass malware , targeted malware but also rootkits and code sharing amongst them .

Next Generation Clickjacking
Clickjacking is a technique that can be used to trick users into performing unintended actions on a website by formatting a web page so that the victim clicks on concealed links , typically hidden within an IFRAME .
However , in comparison to other browser - based attacks such as XSS ( Cross- site Scripting ) and CSRF ( Cross- site Request Forgery ) , Clickjacking has hitherto been regarded as a limited attack technique in terms of consequences for the victim and the scenarios in which it can be used .
During this talk I intend to demonstrate that this assumption is incorrect , and that today ’s Clickjacking techniques can be extended to perform powerful new attacks that can affect any web application .
This talk will cover the basics of Clickjacking , quickly moving on to more powerful , and newly developed , techniques .
The presentation will explore further ways in which a user can be tricked into interacting with a victim site and how these can lead to attacks such as injecting data into an application ( bypassing all current CSRF protections ) and the extraction of data from websites without the user ’s knowledge .
The demo will show several cross - browser techniques , and newly released browser - specific vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer , Firefox and Safari / Chrome which can be used to take full control of a web application .
I will also be demonstrating and releasing a new tool that allows for easy point - and - click creation of multi-step Clickjacking attacks on any web application , by visually selecting the links , buttons , fields and data to be targeted .
The tool will highlight the need for improved Clickjacking defences in both browsers and web applications .

Security in depth for Linux software
In many designs , the slightest error in the source code may become an exploitable vulnerability granting an attacker barely or not at all restricted access to a system .
In this talk , using vsftpd and Google Chrome Linux as examples , we will firstly show how to design your code to be more robust to well - known classes of vulnerabilities and secondly , how to generically mitigate the consequences of such a vulnerability by dropping privileges and reducing attack surfaces .
There are a surprising number of options in Linux to manage privileges , but using them tends to be nuanced .
This talk will discuss the technical aspects of various options and explain how to mix them to raise the bar to a system compromise from a sophisticated attacker .
While Mandatory Access Control systems are readily available , three of them being merged in the current Linux kernel tree , the ability to drop privileges in a " discretionary " way has to often rely on ancient mechanisms ( which may not have been designed for security ) .
We will show the state of the art on Linux and how well - known mechanisms , such as switching to an unprivileged uid , using chroot ( ) and capabilities may or may not be suitable to achieve decent privilege dropping .
We will discuss their drawbacks , availabilities to non-root processes and how an incorrect usage could be exploited by an attacker to circumvent security measures .
We will then explain and demonstrate designs , some of them using novel ideas or obscure features that can allow developers to put error - prone parts of their code inside a sandbox , using vsftpd and the Google Chrome Linux sandbox as examples .
We will discuss their limitations and how further kernel support could improve them .

Hiding in the Familiar : Steganography and Vulnerabilities in Popular Archives Formats
Exploiting archive formats can lead to steganographic data hiding and to processing errors with serious forensic consequences .
These formats are very interesting as they are commonly found on every PC , Apple or Linux machine , and it is popularly believed that they are well understood and trusted .
Can exploits ever be present in file formats that have been in use for over ten or even twenty years ?
Through deep format analysis , beyond fuzzing , we look at what goes wrong when the format specifications are interpreted differently .
Can you trust programs that work with archives ?
Can you even trust your antivirus ?
We will answer these questions and disclose for the first time 15 newly discovered vulnerabilities in ZIP , 7ZIP , RAR , CAB and GZIP file formats revealing the impact they have on anti-malware scanners , digital forensic , security gateways and IPS appliances .
This talk will include demo of ArchiveInsider , a new forensics tool that detects and extracts hidden data and fully validates vulnerable file formats .
We will demonstrate file format steganography , file malformation , and even data " self destruction , " all with tools that you use and trust .

Protocol , Mechanism and Encryption of Pushdo / Cutwail / Webwail Botnet
After several months efforts , the pushdo / cutwail botnet author (s ) finally released a new pushdo advanced installer ( codename " revolution " ) which not only changed the protocol and encryption totally but also implemented " Services " mechanism .
Moreover , a new spam engine was in the experimental phase .
In this presentation , I will examine pushdo's brand new protocol and encryption , reveal their " Cyber Crime Services " vendors mapping and disclose the debug version of the new spam engine 's protocol and encryption .
Abortion bills vetoed by the governor last week became law today when the Senate successfully voted in favor of overriding the governor 's action .
Monday , the House voted to override the bills .
House Bill 2780 requires a health care provider to perform an ultrasound before an abortion could be performed and House Bill 2656 would make it illegal to sue a doctor claiming " wrongful birth " because the doctor failed to convince the mother to abort a child .
In votes of 36 - 12 on both bills , senators successfully did away with Gov. Brad Henry 's veto of the measures .
Within hours , a New York abortion rights group filed a lawsuit in Oklahoma County District Court to challenge the ultrasound law .
Listen , you Froyo freaks , you face - painters , you hoopheads of higher learning : Before you rush the court , storm the court , wreck the court rush your butts back to your seats while I explain something .
You 're doing it WAY too much .
This is n't karaoke Tuesdays .
It 's not a scheduled event .
True rushing the court happens to a school once every 20 years or so .
It should be , " Oh , there 's Professor Krumpke .
Let 's have him tell us about the time he rushed the court . "
It 's like walking down the aisle :
If you do it more than twice in your life , you 're doing it wrong .
It 's spontaneous , like a flash flood .
It 's unpredictable , like Publishers Clearing House showing up at your front door .
It 's as unstoppable as a sneeze and just as unplanned .
It carries you away like a tornado .
You suddenly find yourself on top of the rim and have no idea how you got there .
You people are treating it like it 's your weekly Spanish lab .
Or poker night .
You can't e-mail about it ahead of time .
It 'd be like penciling into your calendar " Make out with Halle Berry tonight after winning Oscar . "
And it can't be something to do just to get on TV .
You wanna be on TV , go bother Matt Lauer .
I 'm talking to you , Indiana .
You rushed the court this season after beating Minnesota .
Minnesota ?
Really ?
How is beating Minnesota cause for unrestrainable joy ?
It 's like pantsing the chess club .
The win clinched your spot in the tournament ?
Big deal .
Sixty - five teams make it .
It 's like making the white pages .
Cheer from your seat .
I 'm talking to you , South Carolina .
You RTC 'd after beating Kentucky both this season and in 2005 .
It 's supposed to be " Hats in the air !
War 's over ! "
Not " I really want a picture next to John Wall ! "
I 'm talking to you , Illinois .
You RTC'd when you beat No. 5 Michigan State this year .
Even Illinois legend Dee Brown was cringing .
He tweeted : " No no no no !
We are Illinois !
Winning should be normal . "
Sorry , Dee. Illinois has a new motto : " We are Illinois !
We really like to pregame ! "
I 'm definitely talking to you , Wake Forest .
You RTC'd when you beat North Carolina last season .
They were third in the nation .
You were fourth .
What 's going to make you storm the floor next ?
New nets ?
This has got to stop .
Therefore , here are the Ironclad and Unbreakable Rushing - the - Court Rules .
From now on , you can NOT rush the court if
• You 've won an NCAA title in the past 20 years .
• You 've been in the Final Four in the past five years .
• The team you just beat is not in the top three .
• Or is ranked within 15 rungs of you .
( Somebody do the math for Wake . )
• Or is really a football school .
This includes Florida , Texas and Ohio State .
Get over it .
• You 've beaten this same team in the past five years .
• You won the stupid game by more than 10 points .
There is no such thing as a PRTC ( Premeditated Rush The Court . )
• You 're a university and you just beat a college .
• Coach K comes to your coach 's clinic .
• You have a dead - mortal - lock lottery pick on your team .
• Your team has appeared in a recent " One Shining Moment . "
Or is it insanity ?... Full of metaphors with a touch of Stephen Hawking .

Please do n't steal .
I hate to break form in my usual titling of these posts , but I could n't resist this one .
Think of it as Guppeidolia , or Pareitilapia , if that makes you happier .
Whatever you call it , it 's , well , it 's Jesus on the cross .
Inside a fish .
Specifically , the skull of a catfish , and even more specifically the Gafftopsail catfish .
If you go to that website , that info is actually a bit hard to find , because the site is , um , well .
Go there and you 'll see .
Of course , the guy is selling these fish skulls , but says he 'll donate some of the proceeds to charity , which is nice .
Like a lot of religious pareidolia practitioners , he does make some unusual claims , such as ( layout and caps are all his ) :
Now the FREE BONUS for finding this page YOU WILL SEE Jesus Magically appear to you IN THIN AIR WHEN YOU DO
I looked around my room but saw no apparitions .
Maybe I 'm not looking hard enough .
I have n't studied all the grain in my desk , or the fiber patterns in my carpet .
Maybe I missed it .
I think this guy is sincere in his beliefs .
I also think he 's wrong .
While the bone does look like a cross , and even a guy on a cross , what we 're really seeing here is the convergence of two paths of evolution : one that shaped the fish skull this way , and the other that shaped our brains to interpret shapes into patterns that are n't really there .
But then , is n't all art pareidolia ?
You 're not really seeing a woman smiling in the Mona Lisa : it 's just paint .
David is just scratches and curves in rock .
But then , no one thinks those really are what they represent ; the art is in the representation .
So , the conclusion I come to ?
Sometimes a cigar fish is just a cigar fish .
Holidays can be soul crushing for people with depression .
In this Empowered Patient column from March , CNN 's Elizabeth Cohen offers effective ways to help someone who 's struggling .
( CNN ) --
For five days , Alexis Moore carefully planned how she would take her own life .
She 's not a violent person , so she knew handguns were out .
She settled on vodka instead , to be followed by a bottle of Xanax .
She did it methodically .
First , she says she drank the vodka for two hours .
Then she lined up the 20 pills on the kitchen counter , taking a few at a time , going to her bedroom to cry and then coming back for more Xanax .
After about six pills , just when she was beginning to feel woozy and lethargic , Moore heard a knock on the door and someone calling her name .
She ignored him , even though she recognized the voice as someone she 'd meet three days before at a business event .
Then the man came around and banged on her bedroom window .
She got up off the bed where she 'd been sobbing and let him in .
They sat down in her living room .
She talked .
He listened .
By the end of the evening , she decided not to take her life .
In the five years since , she 's never tried to commit suicide again .
" If it were n't for Ed ( Ed is n't his real name ; she 'd prefer he remain anonymous ) , I 'd be dead now , " says Moore , 35 , a second - year law student in Sacramento , California .
Some stories end tragically .
On Monday , a funeral was held for Michael Bryan , the 18 - year - old son of singer Marie Osmond .
Police in Los Angeles classified his death as a suicide .
Nationally , 91 people commit suicide every day , according to the most recent data from the American Association of Suicidology .
If you know someone who seems depressed or desperate , the first step is get professional help , therapists say .
If you see someone in immediate need , call 911 .
The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is another place to turn , and the AAS has a list of other resources when someone is suicidal .
Even with professional help , depressed people can still benefit from your support .
Often , it 's hard to know what to say .
" In many cases , you 're afraid of saying the wrong thing and making it worse , " says Dr. Nancy Rappaport , an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and author of " In Her Wake , " a book about her mother 's suicide .
But small words of kindness can go a long way , she says .
What did Ed say that made Moore change her mind about killing herself ?
It was n't actually what he said but rather what he did , she says .
" I was living in this really unkempt place , and he had to get through a lot of brush and tree branches to get to my bedroom window , " says Moore , who was 30 at the time .
" I know it sounds simple , but knowing that someone was going that extra mile was all it took for me to let him in . "
Once they talked , what Ed did not say mattered just as much as what he did say .
" After I let him in , he just gave me a hug .
He said , ' I was worried about you , ' " Moore remembers .
" When we talked , there was no judging me .
There was no fear in his eyes .
All I felt was comfort .
He just listened and that 's all I needed . "
Before her suicide attempt , Moore had just fled a physically abusive boyfriend and recently lost her job .
Others who 've been there have suggestions for how to help someone you know who 's suicidal or depressed .
What to say and do :
1 . Tell her you do n't want her to die
Traci Parks , a 42 - year - old photographer from Columbus , Ohio , was suicidal three times in her life .
The first two times , her husband saved her life with a sentence .
" He simply said , ' Please do n't kill yourself .
I love you so much and I do n't want you to kill yourself ' , " Parks remembers .
Five years later , when her husband , Eric , unexpectedly died , it was her friends who saved her life when she once again became suicidal .
" One person told me she and her husband did n't want me to kill myself , that they would miss me terribly and they thought I had a lot to offer the world even though she knew I did n't feel that way , " she says .
Saying something as simple as " my life would be less fulfilled without you " can be very powerful , says Nadine Kaslow , a psychologist and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine .
" You can help them think about their reasons for living . "
2. Send a card
Something as simple as sending a card shows suicidal people that even if they do n't think they 're worthy of love and attention , you do , Rappaport says .
" When someone 's suicidal , they feel expendable , " she says .
" They feel that no one 's going to care . "
When Moore 's friend beat through bush and branches to get to her bedroom window , it made her feel important and valued , she says .
" For him to bang on the window , begging me to respond , that 's pretty good stuff when you 're that low , " she says .
3 . Say , " I 'm here . "
" This gets an A - plus , " Moore says .
She says it lets the person know you 're ready to listen without judging .
4. Bring a meal
This serves two purposes :
It shows that you value the person ( see above ) , and it helps nourish someone who might be too depressed to be eating properly .
After her husband 's death , friends made sure Parks was eating properly and also helped clean her house , painting walls , fixing lights and planting flowers in the yard .
5 . Be good company
Let 's face it :
It can be depressing being with a depressed person , and avoidance sometimes seems like the best approach .
But Parks says it 's the last thing you should do , even if the depressed person seems to indicate he or she wants to be left alone .
" We know it 's hard to be around us , but do n't leave us alone , " she says .
Sometimes Parks ' husband would implore her to go out at night with him and their friends .
Most of the time , she did n't utter a word .
" The unspoken rule was I did n't have to talk or interact .
I did have to eat , and I did have to go , " she says .
What not to say and do :
1 . Do n't say , " I know how you feel . "
" You do n't know how I feel , " Moore says .
" Even if you 've been suicidal , you do n't know how I feel , because everyone 's situation is different . "
Sharing your own experiences of psychological distress is n't helpful , either , she says .
" The last thing anyone in that situation wants to hear is someone else 's story , " she says .
2 . Do n't say , " Just snap out of it . "
If they could , they would .
3 . Do n't say , " There was an earthquake in Haiti .
Your situation is n't that bad . "
You might think you 're encouraging your depressed friend to realize how fortunate he or she is , but you 're probably not succeeding , Rappaport says .
" The idea of counting your blessings does help , but it 's hard to hear , " she says .
" It can feel like you 're diminishing the psychic pain someone is in . "
4 . Do n't ignore it
If someone says he 's depressed or suicidal , take him seriously , because he's not just trying to get attention , Kaslow says .
" If someone is crying out for help , that means they need help , " she says .
5 . Do n't keep secrets
Sometimes depressed people will tell you how desperate they are , and then ask you to keep it a secret .
If you do n't tell anyone and they kill themselves , you 'll have to live with that the rest of your life , she says .
" If you break their confidence and they 're mad at you , well at least they 're alive and you 're not left with ' what if , ' " Kaslow says .
Moore says she has one more " do " : Do act on your instincts .
She says
Ed came to her house because at the business event she 'd told him about her difficulties -- the abuse , no job and a dying grandmother who'd been her rock .
They 'd communicated frequently , but the day she tried to kill herself , she did n't return his e-mails or phone calls .
" He told me he was worried about me and decided to come on over to see if I was OK , " she says .
Their friendship blossomed into a romance , and the couple now live together in Sacramento .
Moore has a restraining order against her former boyfriend and has started a group called Survivors in Action to support victims of crime , including domestic abuse .
She says she 'll be forever grateful to Ed for following the " do's " of talking to someone who 's suicidal .
" He 's my knight in shining armor , " she says .

The president ’s conviction seemed genuine in no small part because at his back , figuratively and literally , the president had Paul Volcker , the former Fed chairman and economic éminence grise .
Arguably the most respected man in all of finance -- and a lion held at bay ( or in a far away office ) over the past year by the president ’s closest advisers -- Volcker has devised two simple rules to defang our financial system .
First , no bank would be allowed to engage in “ proprietary trading , ” in which it takes risks using its own capital in ways that are completely separate from services provided to clients .
Second , there would be a cap on the size of our largest banks , relative to the size of total liabilities in the banking system .
“ Too big to fail ” would finally become “ too big to exist . ”
After a long struggle , it would seem the president has become convinced that our financial sector has grown dangerous and needs to be reined in .
It has long been clear that the framework in which bank executives are rewarded for taking huge risks during boom times , and taxpayers are punished for such excesses during bad times , is not sustainable .
And now , the hubris of top bankers -- spurning audiences with the president and paying themselves huge bonuses , despite White House protests -- has finally caught up with them .
Even Wall Street cannot moon the giant and get away with it .
The course of financial - sector reform is corrected .
Yet , for all of Volcker ’s good analysis , his presence does not necessarily change anything .
To determine if the Obama administration is serious about solving the underlying crisis in finance , we need to get past Volcker ’s totemic visage and examine the substance of his rules .
Burrowing a bit deeper , unfortunately , we find out how little would actually change .
The president is absolutely correct that our priority should be to limit the size of our largest banks and to reduce substantially the risks that can be taken by any financial entity that is backed , implicitly or explicitly , by the federal government .
As a result of the crisis and various government rescue efforts , the largest six banks in our economy now have total assets in excess of 63 percent of GDP ( based on the latest available data ) .
This is a significant increase from even 2006 , when the same banks ’ assets were around 55 percent of GDP , and a complete transformation compared with the situation in the United States just 15 years ago , when the six largest banks had combined assets of only around 17 percent of GDP .
If the status quo persists , we are set up for another round of the boom - bailout - bust cycle that the head of financial stability at the Bank of England now terms a “ doom loop . ”
Meet the gribble , once the scourge of seafarers because it loves to bore through wood , which it digests .
But now researchers from York and Portsmouth Universities say the gribble have a unique knack for turning wood cellulose into sugars - meaning they may be useful as natural biofuel producers .

This spring , the Air Force was preparing for a groundbreaking test of the X - 51 WaveRider , a hypersonic cruise missile that would reach speeds of up to Mach 6 .
But it looks like the WaveRider 's debut flight will have to wait while some technical issues are addressed .
Boeing spokeswoman Christina Kelly confirmed to Danger Room that the test would have to be rescheduled .
" We do n’t have a firm date , " she said .
" It ’s going to happen , but it ’s just going move to the right . "
The X - 51 program is a collaboration between Boeing Phantom Works and engine maker Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne to develop a new class of cruise missile that can reach targets much , much faster than current designs .
As this Air Force video explains , the X - 51 employs scramjet propulsion :
It collects air from the atmosphere to mix and burn with its fuel , but unlike a jet , it does n’t rely on a turbine to do the compression work .
Hypersonic flight was once considered too extreme for an air - breathing vehicle to handle in a controlled way .
But as Danger Room 's Noah Schachtman explained in Popular Mechanics a few years back , the X - 51 's unique shape uses the shockwaves created by hypersonic flight to create lift , and compress the air to mix with its fuel .
If the concept works ,
It fits neatly with the military 's " prompt global strike " concept .
The idea is to develop a new class of conventional weapon that can reach distant targets – say , a weapon of mass destruction , or an enemy command post – and hit it in a hurry .
But a conventionally armed ICBM or submarine - launched ballistic missile might not be the ideal solution :
You do n't want your global strike mission to be mistaken for a nuclear attack .
Testing the X - 51 is a fairly complex thing .
First , a B - 52 has to carry the WaveRider up to 50,000 feet , and then drop it away .
A solid rocket booster will then accelerate the aircraft to about Mach 4.5 .
After the booster drops , the scramjet is supposed to ignite , taking the WaveRider up to Mach 6 .
Lt. Col. Todd Venema , director of the Hypersonic Combined Test Force , said in this Air Force news item that the flight test would push the altitude limit for the B - 52 .
And tracking the flight will also require some orchestration .
" Telemetry has to be relayed to the Naval Air Station at Pt. Magu to a control room with about 35 people , all watching the various telemetry , " he said .
" So there will be a lot of team work aspects to the whole project . "

Paedophiles and other sex offenders are the subject of regular public outrage and demands for longer jail terms , but could " befriending " them be the best way to stop them committing more crimes ?
" I said to myself my worst nightmare is someone who offended against very young girls because my nieces are those ages .
Sure enough , that 's exactly what I got . "
FIND OUT MORE The Donal MacIntyre programme is on BBC Radio 5 live on Sunday 11 April at 1930 BST
Or catch up via iPlayer Sarah from London is a volunteer working with a category of former prisoners few of us would feel comfortable meeting at all , let alone on a regular basis .
Along with four others she regularly meets a man convicted of serious sex offences against children who has since been released back into the community .
She 's part of a " circle " which befriends but also monitors offenders .
The idea came from Canada where a survey by the country 's prison service found it reduced re-offending by 70 % .
The first circles in the UK were formed in 2002 and there are currently 63 running across England and Wales .
It is based on the premise that while some offenders have friends and family to return to when they come out of prison , others have not and the more isolated they are , the more likely they are to re-offend .
Your first instinct is to feel disgust and revulsion over what they 've done
Sarah Sarah says she was partly inspired to volunteer by the press coverage surrounding the disappearance of Madeleine McCann .
" There was a lot of press talking about paedophiles , lots of big splash front pages saying ' evil ' .
I started to think there 's got to be a way to stop this from happening in the beginning . "
Sarah joined her circle through child protection charity The Lucy Faithfull Foundation , one of several organisations which run circles in the UK .
Volunteers receive 20 hours of instruction and are supported by a liaison officer .
They meet offenders discreetly in local cafes where they talk about everything from what could lead to re-offending to finding work and fitting back into society .
Emotionally charged Before the first meeting , they are told a lot of detail about the crimes and background of the offender .
The meetings with the group - 4 - 6 volunteers plus the offender - are for about an hour , once a week , for the first few months , with the whole programme lasting one or two years .
Each member of the group typically speaks to the offender on the phone at least once a week .
Feeling against sex abusers often runs high , with demands for longer sentences Despite her initial concerns , Sarah has been able to work with two offenders , both of whom have been imprisoned for offences against girls under 14 .
Sarah found the first encounter was highly emotionally charged .
" There 's a lot of trepidation .
You never know how you 're going to react .
Your first instinct is to feel disgust and revulsion over what they 've done . "
Sarah believes by questioning offenders about their behaviour and helping them settle back into everyday life she has helped to keep them from re-offending .
In the case of the offender she is currently working with , Sarah believes her group has helped him turn round a long history of offending behaviour .
" I do n't consider myself a bleeding - heart liberal .
I 'm someone who looks at the big picture and tries to find a solution .
As far as the police tell us he has n't offended in five years .
He does n't want to re-offend again , he does n't want to create any more victims . "
Grooming spotted The Lucy Faithfull Foundation says of the 35 offenders who have taken part in their circles project so far , only three have been found to have re-offended .
In one of these cases , volunteers in East Anglia say they became suspicious of the offender 's behaviour .
Circle volunteer
Ian says from the start they felt there was something wrong .
Offenders may be without friends and family which hinders rehabilitation " He was telling us things which just did n't sound right .
We reported it .
The police reckoned he was grooming a young boy . "
The offender was subsequently sent back to prison .
Donald Findlater , director of research and development at The Lucy Faithfull Foundation , says great care is taken in choosing which offenders are selected .
A determination to change their behaviour pattern is key .
" Not all sex offenders are suitable for a circle .
Professional staff need to assess that the individual is committed to leading a good life and keen to get support in doing this . "
He feels in the vast majority of cases the circles have been effective .
" I have no doubt that circles are making a tangible difference to the lives that sex offenders lead and to the safety of the public . "
There are some who believe sex offenders can never be rehabilitated Circles are part of a wider programme to rehabilitate sex offenders .
The National Offender Management Service offers treatment to around 1,200 sex offenders a year in prison and the same number who have been released back into the community .
Many experts with experience in rehabilitating sex offenders agree circles have potential to stop re-offending , but they are only part of the overall effort to stop further crimes being committed .
" Circles have a lot to offer , particularly in cases of very socially isolated sexual offenders or offenders , " says David Middleton , professor of community and criminal justice at De Montfort University , and former head of the government 's sex offender strategy and programmes .
" However they are not a substitute for experienced and well trained professionals . "

The circles projects are part funded by government money channelled through local police , probation and offender management budgets .
This frustrates some victims group who feel more money should be directed at those who have been abused .
Many are also highly sceptical that sex offenders can be rehabilitated .
Peter Saunders , chief executive of the National Association of People Abused in Childhood , feels while circles may have some value , there are more reliable ways of monitoring offenders .
" Abusers can not be trusted at their word .
We tend to favour the idea that these kind of offenders need to be electronically tagged for a very long time . "

Here is a selection of your comments .
Get real .
With the exception of rapists and sex offenders , paedophiles are some of the most gregarious people .
How else do you explain their ability to attract and ensnare their prey ?
Any success this program may have is because they have been identified and watched .
Tajima7 , Ohio , US Ostracizing sex offenders has a detrimental effect that ultimately encourages re-offending .
Do n't follow America 's bad example !
www.oncefallen.com
The One , Cincinnati , Ohio , USSA No .
Befriending them is not the way .
Life imprisonment is the way .
Too many times we have seen jail " terms " do nothing .
They only commit offences yet again .
Me , Swansea , UK I believe this is a very practical approach to a problem that will not go away .
It is my view that the isolation created and felt upon re-entering this free market society leaves many people exposed to unsavoury people and ideas , where otherwise people would lead respectable lives - the recent case of the nursery children being a prime example .
Kevin , London
At last someone / some organisation is addressing the problem in a positive way .
It may work , it may not work , but it is being addressed .
After 30 years in law enforcement dealing with the victims and offenders , it was good to listen to the interviewee 's positive approach and opinion
Glynn Jones , Norwich UK
Is n't the surest way to ensure that sex offenders do not repeat their crimes - and destroy the lives of others - to make sure that once they are caught and convicted , they are locked away for a very , very long time .
We should protect the innocent and worry about the feelings of the guilty afterwards .
TQ , London
No matter how much time is spent talking to these sex offenders they will always revert to type .
They have the instincts of a predatory animal , and possibly even less self control .
Castration at birth is the only solution that I can see , but , as this is not possible , issue them with a permanent facial mark so that they can be identified in public places .
John Wren , Norwich " while circles may have some value , there are more reliable ways of monitoring offenders . "
My understanding is that these circles are not just about monitoring offenders but supporting them in making choices , which are healthier for them , and which avoid creating further victims .
An electronic tag wo n't provide the sort of support that a circle can .
In fact it may be that a tag on its own simply emphasises the separateness of an already isolated individual , and may lead them more quickly towards re-offending .
David Bates , London , UK
If the difference between " us " and " them " is that " they " abuse children whilst " we " do not , then unless we make room for " them " to join " us " , " we " perpetuate and contribute to the problem .
John Flynn , Yorkshire I take my hat off to ' The Lucy Faithfull Foundation ' .
It sounds like they do a fantastic job ; very few people have the compassion , integrity , courage and open - mindedness to fulfil this role .
It also emphasises the importance of community : when we have friendship and accountability , others cease to be objects for us to use , and become people with cares , concerns pasts and futures .

NEWARK --
Six women from the Essex County area who wanted fuller bottoms ended up in hospitals after receiving buttocks - enhancement injections containing the same material contractors use to caulk bathtubs , officials said .
The women checked into hospitals in the county after their procedures , apparently administered by unlicensed providers , went horribly wrong , state health officials said .
The women underwent surgery and were given antibiotics .
No arrests have been made .
Different from medical - grade silicone , the substance used in the botched procedures was believed to be a diluted version of nonmedical - grade silicone .
" The same stuff you use to put caulk around the bathtub , " said Steven M. Marcus , executive and medical director of the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System , who learned about the bizarre procedures through a committee he sits on that monitors outbreaks in the metropolitan area .
" What a tragedy , " said Gregory Borah , chief of plastic surgery at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick .
Using over - the - counter silicone can cause abscesses that he said resemble " a big zit . "
Borah , also president of the New Jersey Society of Plastic Surgeons , said the botched procedures underscore the need for patients who seek augmentation to have it administered by a licensed professional in a sterile setting .
A plastic surgeon doing buttocks augmentation would make an incision to develop a pocket underneath the muscle and shape the buttocks with inert medical - grade silicone , Borah said .
He noted it is a relatively uncommon procedure in most practices and that he has done only two in his 24 - year career .
By the time he tells patients of the potential risks — from anesthesia , scarring and silicone shifting when patients sit down — they often change their minds .
Breast and cheek augmentations are the most common procedures , he noted .
Borah said buttock augmentation is more popular in some cultures than others .
The state Department of Health and Senior Services did not identify the women or release any details about their ethnicity .
It also did not say where the " unlicensed medical provider or providers " performed their procedures .
" Fortunately , these women are being treated and are recovering , " said Tina Tan , the state epidemiologist .
" But there is the potential for more serious complications if these infections are not treated early and properly . "
Investigators have not determined if the six cases , which began to be reported in mid-February , are related , but they have stoked concern among officials that such injuries are more common than previously thought .
Health officials issued an alert to state hospitals and doctors about the cases and the potential for more victims .
Marcus said there have been other incidents over the past couple years of providers providing implants of nonmedical - grade silicone , then getting put out of business — only for other shady providers to surface .
" Caveat emptor : Buyer beware , " Marcus said .
" If it looks too cheap , there ’s probably a reason it ’s too cheap . "

Only about 300 apes survive in Nigeria ’s Cross River National Park on the Cameroon border .
Poaching from nearby poor villagers searching for food or meat to sell has reduced the rare apes ’ numbers to about one - tenth of their population a century ago .
“ These are some of the most endangered apes in Africa , ” says James Deutsch of the Wildlife Conservation Society .
“ The people are poor and protein is hard to find , so they will eat gorillas . ”
Over the past six months , though , a pilot effort has trained and equipped eight poacher families to farm African giant snails , a local delicacy about 5 inches across , with funding from the Arcus Foundation of Kalamazoo , Mich . , a great - ape conservation group .
“ Hunters will eat anything they find , ” Deutsch says , but the likely profit from snail farming , about $ 413 a year , exceeds the profits from bushmeat trade , for which one gorilla ’s meat earns poachers about $ 70 .

Sexually Suggestive Star Wars Candy Marketed To Children !
The Sick Mind of George Lucas !
The new Star Wars movie is n't even in theaters yet , and already George Lucas is up to his usual hijinks .
Our lone Christian mole ( who has been working undercover at the Skywalker Ranch in California ) informed us that Lucas is planning to re-release the disgusting Jar Jar Binks candy sex tongue toy he created a few years ago in his secret laboratory .
The self - contained private laboratory where Lucas performs evil experiments with miniature characters from his Star Wars films is located one mile below the surface of the earth , directly under his Skywalker Ranch .
" When that pervert unleashes those demonic candies on this world again , expect a public outcry so loud that Christ in in Heaven will drop a handful of sinners
He was about to toss into Hellfire to cover
His ears for the noise !
Glory to God ! " said Pastor Deacon Fred .
" We intend to stop this depraved atheist maniac before he turns everyone in America into a homosexual ! "
The Jar Jar Binks candy sex toys contain a 10 inch push - up tongue made of strawberry flavored candy .
" The tongue is shaped like a male sex organ , " reports one Pastor .
" It is hard , and has a flushed red color , suggesting a youngster wrap his or her mouth around a fully aroused genital .
Parents across the country are once again going to start purchasing this ' innocent ' novelty for their youngsters , completely unaware of it 's demonic nature . "
" This toy was created for one purpose , and one purpose alone ! " says Pastor Deacon Fred , " That is to train a generation of children in the ways of carnality !
One need only glance at the toy to see it 's true intent !
If you can't see it , then you are just as perverted as this so - called director , George Lucas , who is really nothing more than a mad- scientist !
As an institution ordained by God it is our responsibility to expose this Christian Nation to the absolute truth ! "
As we intend to do with the release of each Star Wars film , we ask you to please use the list below to contact National toy stores , and toy distributors .
Tell them that you will no longer shop in their sickening , disgusting , perverted stores until the abomination is removed from the shelves !
Tell them they have push - up candy sex tongues for sale and you wo n't shop there until they take them off the shelves !

A Texas Tea Party candidate and novice politician trounced incumbent GOP State Rep. Delwin Jones of Lubbock in a Republican primary run-off :
“ The long legislative career of state Rep. Delwin Jones is over .
And for accountant Charles Perry a new day has dawned .
Jones , who has served in the Texas Legislature for nearly 30 years , including eight as a Democrat from 1965 to 1973 , lost decisively to Perry in Tuesday ’s Republican primary runoff .
With all the votes counted , Perry got 57.6 percent of the vote and Jones 43.4 percent .
Perry , who ran a shoestring campaign compared to attorney Zach Brady , who also challenged Jones but finished third in the March 2 primary despite raising more than a quarter million dollars , did what conservative GOP operators and hundreds of thousands could n’t do for years – defeat Jones . ”
Lubbock made history tonight .
Not only was Jones the oldest member of the Texas Legislature but Perry may be the Texas Legislature ’s — and perhaps the nation ’s — first Tea Party winner since there is no Democrat or Libertarian candidate on the ballot .
Perry ran on a platform of fiscal responsibility but he was n’t given much chance to make the run-off , let alone win .
Political analysts were especially doubtful of his chances after he pledged to work to rescind in - state tuition for illegal immigrants .
— DRJ
UPDATE : The excerpt above is from the online version of the Lubbock Avalanche - Journal .
Since I posted , the A - J has updated its story to revise the vote totals —
“ With all 80 precincts counted , Perry received 57.8 percent of the vote and Jones 42.2 percent in the five - county district ” — and add this :
“ And now that there are no more elections in District 83 this year , it also means that for the first time in more than two decades the Panhandle / South Plains region will send at least three freshmen legislators to Austin .
The two other House districts in the region that will be represented by rookies are neighboring District 84 and District 87 in the Panhandle .
The possibility of a fourth freshman representing the region exists because in District 85 two - term incumbent Joe Heflin , D - Crosbyton , is expected to have a tough challenge from Plainview Republican Jim Landtroop .
The Republican Party considers Heflin vulnerable because he is one of about a half - dozen House Democrats representing GOP - leaning districts . ”

Rail bosses said they " neither endorsed nor supported " the note French national rail operator SNCF has apologised for a note that singled out Romanians over baggage thefts and triggered accusations of xenophobia .
The note asked employees to bring " all activities of Romanians " to the attention of rail security services .
The note was distributed at the end of January in the Midi-Pyrenees region .
SNCF said the note was a " regrettable individual initiative " and had been recalled as soon as regional train officials learnt about it .
An SNCF spokesperson told the BBC that the official responsible for the note had been summoned along with their superiors , and had been reminded of the " obligations and culture of the SNCF " .
She said the matter was being dealt with internally .
' Racist '
The note was published on the French news site Rue89 after one of their contributors noticed it on a local train on 1 February .
It read : " In the last few weeks concerns have arisen about Romanians .
Indeed , numerous baggage thefts have been noticed .
" We ask you to redouble your vigilance .
In addition , all the activities of Romanians should be brought to the attention of the PCNS [ rail security services ] . "
The Sud-Rail trade union was quoted by local media as denouncing the note as " racist " .
" These ideas , in a general context in which xenophobia and the stigmatisation of immigrants is becoming more intolerable each day , have to be condemned in the strongest manner , " the union said .
SNCF issued a statement on Tuesday saying the note had been intended to draw attention to " an increase in thefts committed on certain trains " .
It apologised for the note , saying it had been drawn up in a way that the company " neither endorsed nor supported " , adding that the duty of SNCF staff was to protect goods and persons " without distinction of origin , social class or nationality " .

Saman – formerly Farzaneh – Arastu takes male role in Anahita a year after playing a woman in another film
She earned her acting credentials playing female characters in a host of hit films and television dramas .
Now one of Iran 's best - known screen actors has ditched her previous persona to embark on a new career playing male roles .
But Saman – formerly Farzaneh – Arastu 's gender transformation has little to do with dramatic talents .
Instead she has turned into a he by becoming the first known Iranian actor to undergo a sex change operation .
Following a career as a female actor , Arastu , 42 , has already played one role as a man after taking advantage of surprisingly liberal laws that make Iran second only to Thailand for carrying out the most sex change operations .
The cameo role in Anahita , a recent film about a group of students doing research into water molecules , came only a year
This section gives an overview of my shellcode .
Most shellcode is completely coded by hand by me ( I use the free nasm assembler ) , but some shellcode has also been generated with the help of a C - compiler .
I worked out a method to generate WIN32 shellcode with a C - compiler .
By using special constructs in C and avoiding incompatible constructs , the C - compiler will emit position - independent code for the C functions designed to be converted to shellcode .
The shellcode is extracted from the compiled EXE - file when the program is run .
Not only is it easier and faster to code shellcode with C in stead of assembly language ; this method makes it also possible to debug shellcode with Visual C++2008 Express ’ integrated debugger .
I ’m currently writing a tutorial for this method .
The shellcodes presented here do not use hardcoded WIN32 API function addresses , they use the PEB method to dynamically lookup the addresses ( code published in The Shellcoder ’s Handbook , you can find it in the include file sc- api- functions.asm ) .
Note that shellcodes available for download here are not restricted in the byte - values they may use .
Most of them will contain 0x00 - bytes .
If this is an issue , I ’ll provide you with a couple of decoders I developed to exclude specific byte-values .
ShellCode With a C - Compiler
I wrote an article in Hakin9 magazine how to write shellcode with a C - compiler .
Download :
ShellCodeLibLoader_v0_0_1.zip ( https )
MD5 : F6D4779097A8A11C412BDD47B7B1C8AE
SHA256 : 3294A4322926476562AF34A80B8155638EFEEF38E401E69D6DB9BBB652C3EB58
ShellCodeMemoryModule
The DLL - loading shellcode I used in my cmd.xls spreadsheet was generated with my C - Compiler method .
You can download Joachim ’s code , converted to shellcode with this method , here :
Download :
ShellCodeMemoryModule_V0_0_0_1.zip ( https )
MD5 : CEABB3A8A9A4A507BA19C52EE2CC5DA9
SHA256 : 284344C909E623B0406BB38A67F5A7A1AEE2473721244EED52CCEBB8846B0500
The shellcode is in file ShellCodeMemoryModule.exe.bin ( it contains the shellcode with an appended DLL that displays a MessageBox ) .
Finally , after extensive testing of this shellcode , I disassembled it with ndisasm and optimized it for size ( 2297 bytes in stead of 2634 bytes ) .
But this step is only necessary if you want assembly code for your shellcode .
This assembly code will be released when I ’m done tweaking it 😉
MessageBox Shellcode
Per request , I release my assembly code I ’ve used in my previous blogposts to display a message box when the injected shellcode gets executed .
It ’s nothing special , but it will save you some time when you need a similar program .
Assemble the code with nasm like this :
nasm -o sc-mba-hello.bin sc-mba-hello.asm
I use the DLL locating code published in The Shellcoder ’s Handbook , you can find it in the include file sc-api-functions.asm .
MessageBoxA is located in user32.dll , this dll has to be loaded in the process you ’re injecting with sc - mba - hello .
sc-ods.asm is a similar program , calling OutputDebugStringA in stead of MessageBoxA .
The shellcode :
Winexec Shellcode
Another requested file ( sc- winexec.asm ) was added to my - shellcode_v0_0_3.zip : shellcode to launch calc.exe via a WinExec call .
After that , the shellcode will exit with a call to ExitThread .
If you want this shellcode to launch another program than calc.exe , edit the last line of the assembly code to replace calc.exe with the desired program :
COMMAND : db " calc.exe " , 0
Ping Shellcode
2 other requested files ( sc- ping.asm and sc- ping - computername-username.asm ) were added to my - shellcode_v0_0_3.zip : shellcode to perform a ping .
First one does a ping with a static payload , second one has dynamic payload ( computername + username ) .
Tweet Shellcode
Shellcode to send a Twitter Update was added to my - shellcode_v0_0_4.zip .
Before using / assembling the shellcode , you need to provide Twitter credentials and the text for the status update ( url - encoded ) .
; Customize the following 3 TWITTER_ values according to your needs ; Notice that your Tweet has to be URL encoded !
; USER_AGENT is another value you might want to customize % define TWITTER_CREDENTIAL_NAME
" user " % define TWITTER_CREDENTIAL_PASSWORD
" password " % define TWITTER_TWEET_URL_ENCODED
" This +is+a + Tweet+from+shellcode "
. NET Shellcode
Shellcode to load a .NET assembly in the current process was added to my - shellcode_v0_0_5.zip .
Before using / assembling the shellcode , you need to provide your own assembly , class , method and a parameter .
; Customize the following 4 DOTNET_ values according to your needs % define DOTNET_ASSEMBLY_VALUE " C:\HelloWorldClass.dll " % define DOTNET_CLASS_VALUE
" DidierStevens.HelloWorld " % define DOTNET_METHOD_VALUE
" HelloWorldMessageBox " % define DOTNET_ARGUMENT_VALUE
" Call from shellcode sc- dotNET "
Example of a C# class :
using System ; using System .
Windows .
Forms ; namespace DidierStevens { public class HelloWorld { public static Int32 HelloWorldMessageBox ( String message ) { MessageBox .
Show ( message , " Hello World from . NET " ) ; return 1 ; } } }
x64 Shellcode
I ’ve also started to write x64 shellcode , like this example .
Look for filenames starting with sc - x64 in the zip file ( my- shellcode_v….zip ) .

Sometimes questions are better left unanswered .
Like how a sport called “ extreme ironing ” has circumnavigated the globe , fascinating folks from France to Fiji .
Described on the official website as the “ latest danger sport that combines the thrills of an extreme outdoor activity with the satisfaction of a well pressed shirt , ” it ’s an activity that is as much a sport as it is a hilarious performance art .
Here are the most unique incarnations of this increasingly popular international craze .
Get ready to be amazed and amused as participants from around the world make a new name for this mundane household chore :
1. England : Multi-Disciplinary Extreme Ironing
Since the thrilling sport of extreme ironing was born in the United Kingdom , it makes sense that they ’ve mastered the art .
This guy has more than one trick up his sleeve when it comes to finding ridiculous places to get the wrinkles out of his duds .
I ’m just not sure they always score that high when it comes to productivity …
2. Japan : Speed Ironing on a Mountain Board
Short and sweet – this guy knows how to get the chores done .
In speedy fashion he gains ground heading down a grassy hill , iron in hand , and takes a bold turn right in time to graze the shirt awaiting him on his ironing board .
Who says you ca n’t extreme iron in a city park – at least that works when adventuring in Japan .
3. USA : Ironing in Transit , on Road and over Water
At first you think these crazy guys are just tied in to the side of a moving van attached to a soldered ironing board , but after they round a few curves the “ van ” takes to the water …
Magically , this dual - purpose craft allows for two extreme forms of ironing , and to these Massachusetts pranksters that means double the pleasure .
I know the state has much more to offer than this ironing activity .
4. Scotland : Street Level Emergency Ironing
Apparently in Edinburgh there are circumstances under which emergency ironing is necessary .
But luckily this popular pastime has quite a following in these parts , including this fellow who ’s one call in case you need him to run down the street after your dress clothes , iron in tow .
Just try and block out the corny chase scene music track .
5. Austria : Rappel - Ironing
I made an exception for this Austrian guy who did n’t have a video camera – the video collage he got his friends to help him make shows just how much time they ’ve got on their hands .
Extra points for the matching spandex outfit and brightly - painted house off which he rappels .
I ’m assuming he likes to chat with neighbors passing by while he irons shirts , but I ca n’t imagine he wears suits much at all .
6. England : Sky Dive Ironing Championship Training
You can sky dive in England , and you can iron , but you can also to both at the same time .
In fact , there are leagues dedicated entirely to the sport and regularly compete on points of style and creativity in extreme sky dive surf ironing , or whatever the league calls themselves .
Watch as the teams prep for the big dives , there are a lot of clothes ready to hit the board .
On your next trip to the UK look out for local Extreme Ironing competitions , they actually exist and can be attended !
7. Egypt : Ironing Underwater in the Famous Blue Hole
It is n’t at all the first thing I ’d think of when talking up Egyptian travel , but the famous Blue Hole , an incredible geographic asset in the middle the desert , has more possibilities than meets the eye .
To this gal it was extreme ironing , and she succeeding in reaching her goal of being the first and only diver to iron at the bottom of this aquamarine - blue body of water .
8. England : Extreme Ironing Skydive
You think these two are just jumping out of a plane with snowboards attached to their feet , but before too long you see they ’ve got other plans , to use the bottom of the board at the ironing surface for their own form of extreme ironing .
I ’m sure if you get in a few jumps on your next extreme sports adventure to England , that the instructor might let you try out some of these moves if the spirit moves you .
9. New Zealand : Extreme Ironing on a Mountaintop
I can picture these Kiwi guys arguing all the way up the mountain about who would carry the ironing board , but however they managed to drag it up there , it is one incredible place to iron .
The view of snowy crags and a sea of rocky peaks makes for a nice ambiance , I ’m just not sure it would be my first choice of activity after mountaineering to the top of this exquisite New Zealand Peak , but hey , that ’s just me .
A group of gamers from around the world created a 100,000 + keystroke script for speedrunning The Legend of Zelda , which was used by a blind gamer in Ontario complete the game .
Jordan Verner , who is blind , posted a video of himself playing Zelda and asking for help to complete the game .
This inspired other gamers to spend two years composing a script that Verner could follow , and at last he did :
So Williams and thee other diehard gamers each took different parts and copied down every single move .
" Every time we make a move , we roll , jump , do anything , we type down on the computer exactly what we 're doing , " said Williams .
Verner would then take the script and have his computer read it to him as he played .
An average gamer will take about a week to play through the entire thing , but this project took almost 2 years and more than 100,000 keystrokes .
Finally , Jordan beat the entire thing .
" I felt great , " said Jordan .
" I felt strong .
I felt like the sky 's the limit . "
" I 'm glad everyone can see and learn from this that just because a person has a disability does n't mean they can't do a normal thing , like play a video game , " said Williams .
* That ’s because we get up reasonably early and work all day .
Becuase in good times we always spare a thought for the bad times .
Becuase we have good firms whose products are in demand around the world .

Diamond is one of the most expensive physics facilities ever built in the UK
The UK government is promising to put in place measures to protect the future funding of physics and astronomy .
The body responsible for overseeing the disciplines has had to withdraw from some projects and cut research grants because of pressures on its budget .
One key problem is the low value of the pound , which has made UK involvement in international science very expensive .
Ministers say they will continue to provide compensation payments while implementing a longer - term solution .
The Science and Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) is one of a number of research councils charged with routing public funds into British scientific activity .
The STFC looks after UK interests in major astronomy and physics experiments , such as the Large Hadron Collider at Cern in Switzerland , and the Very Large Telescope in Chile .
It is critical that whoever forms the next government prioritizes investment in science
Nick Dusic , Case
It also leads British participation in space science at the European Space Agency ( Esa ) .
More than half of the council 's budget is tied up in the " subscriptions " it pays to participate in these science " clubs " ; and it also has a large fixed - cost element at home from managing big physics centres such as the Diamond X - ray light source in Oxfordshire .
Factors such as a weakening in sterling have conspired with the organisation 's particular structural arrangements to put a squeeze on on those areas of its activities that are more flexible - the actual science and scientists it funds in the big facilities and clubs .
In December , the STFC executive announced that the UK would be withdrawing from major projects , such as the operation of the Cassini spacecraft in orbit around Saturn , and from the Gemini eight - metre telescopes ( in Hawaii and Chile ) the UK helped to build .
It also indicated there would have to be a cut - back in grants .
Currently , it is envisaged there will be a 13 % reduction next year in the money available to support PhD students in physics , space and astronomy .
Treasury discussions
The government announced on Thursday that it was putting in place new arrangements for the STFC " designed to ensure that it can plan with greater predictability and provide its community with more stability " .
These plans include what it describes as " better management of pressures arising from international subscriptions , and longer - term planning and budgeting for large domestic facilities " .
The UK pays a subscription to take part in the LHC venture
This includes getting the other research councils - like the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the Medical Research Council - to agree to better organise their use and funding of facilities operated by STFC .
Science minister Lord Drayson said : " There is no doubt STFC faced a difficult situation .
A lot of work has gone in to finding ways of preventing such pressures rearing their heads again in future .
" The better management of international subscriptions through measures to manage exchange rates , and longer - term planning and budgeting for large domestic facilities will allow STFC 's grant - giving functions to be managed with a higher degree of predictability . "
None of the planned efficiencies announced in December will be affected by the new arrangements .
The managed withdrawal from ventures - such as the Alice Collaboration , which seeks to exploit data acquired by the LHC ; and nuclear physics projects such as Agata and Panda - will proceed as outlined .
Discussions are currently under way between the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills and the Treasury to find a sustainable strategy to protect UK science from currency fluctuations in the years ahead .
The STFC should shortly be relieved of a major part of this problem anyway when the new UK executive space agency is formally established .
This agency will take over the funding and policy for space science previously dealt with by STFC .
' Staunch the flow of blood '
The immediate reaction from the physics and astronomy community to the announcement appeared positive but with reservation .
Professor Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell , president of the Institute of Physics , and Professor Andrew Fabian , president of the Royal Astronomical Society , issued a joint statement .
They said : " We have been particularly concerned about the way in which unforeseeable rises in international subscriptions due to the falling value of the pound have put extreme pressure on the funding available from STFC both for research grants and the running of UK - based facilities .
Today 's announcement demonstrates that the problem has now been recognised and we look forward to seeing how it will be addressed . "
Space activity in the UK will soon be coordinated by an executive agency
But they added : " Looking at the science base as a whole , we remain concerned about the overall impact on science funding as the pressure on the public purse becomes increasingly acute .
We urge that the government continues to recognise the value of investment in the science base and funds accordingly . "
Peter Coles , professor of astrophysics at Cardiff University , wrote on his blog : " The Drayson review may have staunched the flow of blood , but the patient will remain dangerously ill unless additional measures are taken . "
And Dr Dave Clements , an astronomer from Imperial College , wrote on Twitter : " Our competitors are still boosting science funding at a time when the UK is cutting it - no fix for that here . "
Nick Dusic , from the Campaign for Science and Engineering ( Case ) , told BBC News : " Today 's announcement shows that the government has identified potential solutions to the STFC 's structural problems , which should give a glimmer of hope to those that depend on STFC for funding or look to its research for inspiration .
" However , we will not know the full implications of the proposals until the outcome of the next spending review .
It is critical that whoever forms the next government prioritises investment in science . "

The gift of making players play is beyond language .
In the few weeks that this year has run , Guus Hiddink , the Dutchman , has coached in Russia , has been offered jobs from the Ivory Coast to England , and has decided his next post will be in Turkey .
He is a man for all regions .
After the 2002 World Cup , during which he had turned doubting South Koreans into a unified nation behind a team that went as far as the semifinals , Hiddink was guest of honor at a celebratory ball .
He arrived late , in jeans and an open neck shirt , picked up a microphone and sang to the bewildered Koreans : “ I did it my way . ”
His Frank Sinatra impersonation was n’t bad , either .
The Koreans offered him the earth to stay .
They gave him honorary citizenship , a villa on the resort island of Jeju , free flights to and from the country for life .
But his job was done ; helping South Koreans to realize the talents in themselves , making them as fit as soldiers to outrun and knock out Poland and Portugal , Italy and Spain , was a two - year mission in a 50 - year span that , so far , has taken Hiddink from a junior player in his hometown , Varsseveld , to work and play on four continents .
It understates him , but only marginally , to suggest that Hiddink ’s Midas touch is based on three tenets : keep the game simple ; communicate through actions , not words ; and demand that others work as hard as you are prepared to do .

Hello everyone ,
This is a heads - up that we will shortly start landing patches for a new WebKit framework that we at Apple have been working on for a while .
We currently call this new framework " WebKit2 " .
WebKit2 is designed from the ground up to support a split process model , where the web content ( JavaScript , HTML , layout , etc ) lives in a separate process .
This model is similar to what Google Chrome offers , with the major difference being that we have built the process split model directly into the framework , allowing other clients to use it .
Some high - level documentation is available at Â [ 1 ]
http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKit2
Currently WebKit2 is available for Mac and Windows , and we would gladly accept patches to add more ports .
We 're more than happy to answer any questions you might have , and we hope that this will be a topic of discussion at the WebKit Contributors Meeting .
Thanks , Anders Carlsson and Sam Weinig .

Week :
Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva declared martial law in the capital after protesters stormed parliament , testing the army ’s willingness to break up four weeks of mostly peaceful demonstrations .
About 3,000 people entered the gates of Parliament for about two hours and thousands more occupied Bangkok ’s commercial district for a fifth day .
The emergency decree bans gatherings of more than five people , allows detention without charge and gives soldiers immunity from prosecution .
“ The law does n’t mean we aim to crack down or hurt people , especially innocent people , ” Abhisit said in a televised address .
“ The nation has been severely affected by the protests and the government needs to rectify the situation . ”
The protesters , many loyal to exiled former premier Thaksin Shinawatra , grew in confidence after police and soldiers abandoned attempts to disperse them yesterday .
Army Chief Anupong Paojinda enforced orders from Abhisit a year ago to break up rallies by the same group that turned violent , something he may be reluctant to do this time .
“ Declaring martial law may backfire on Abhisit , ” said Michael Nelson , a lecturer at Bangkok ’s Chulalongkorn University .
“ If Anupong sees this as a political problem , an emergency decree may not prompt the military into action . ”
Abhisit , who has been living in an army barracks , said protesters have breached the constitution and he declared the demonstration illegal .
The law would also prevent misinformation and help stop sporadic grenade attacks that have hit the capital over the past month , he said .

Zurich photographer Bruno Helbling has sent us his photos of a house on a hillside in Switzerland by Swiss office Felber Szélpal Architekten .
Called House Szélpal , the two - storey building is located in Riedholz .
A band of windows wraps round the upper floor of the concrete residence .
The information below is from the architects :
HOUSE SZELPAL
The narrow form of the property together with its descending topography has amazing architectural consequences on the house itself .
The result is an elongated cube with two floors on the basis of an S - shape in section .
Because the plot is inclined lengthwise , the interior corresponds with the spaces outside on opposite ends of the building depending on the floor .
The entrance on the ground floor is on a level with the site to the east front , whereas the garden can be reached to the west from the terrace above .
A marvellous view on the entire alpine panorama can be caught on the upper floor , a quality which brings a hierarchy in between above and below .
Beside the entrance and the carport , the ground floor consists of other serving rooms like the office , the utility rooms and the cellar .
All the main rooms for living are situated above , they are almost entirely oriented towards the view .
The monolithic concrete body has an elegant attitude , it appears clear and hard outside , while it is soft and warm inside .
By its internal insulation , the construction can be adapted to changing needs of the family in a simple and economical manner also later on .
The statics can easily be recognized outside , a long strip of a ribbon window relates the house to the panoramic view .
The building is inserted into the site without effecting much earthworks .
Surrounding plants , flowers and trees create a powerful contrast between figure and nature .

The rules about what types of content can and can't be in Apple 's App Store are still fuzzy , but one thing 's certain : Steve Jobs does n't want to sell porn .
Despite yesterday 's iPhone debacle , Jobs was still in a chatty - enough mood to respond to a concerned customer 's e-mail questioning Apple 's role as " moral police " of its App Store .
The customer , Matthew Browing , was referring to the App Store 's initial rejection of an app containing Mark Fiore 's Pulitzer - winning editorial cartoon , as well as the company 's recent porn ban .
In his reply , Jobs admitted that rejecting Fiore 's app was a mistake , and he was n't shy about advertising his biggest competitor 's product as a phone for porn lovers :
Fiore ’s app will be in the store shortly .
That was a mistake .
However , we do believe we have a moral responsibility to keep porn off the iPhone .
Folks who want porn can buy and [ sic ] Android phone .
TechCrunch 's MG Siegler , who originally reported the e-mail exchange , noted the " and " typo in Jobs ' response , but he said he verified the sender by checking the e-mail 's IP headers .
Jobs ' purported e-mail response is believable , as it comes in line with a statement the CEO made during a question - and - answer session at Apple 's iPhone OS 4 event earlier this month .
A journalist asked whether Apple would consider allowing customers to load apps through means other than the App Store , and Jobs again noted Android as an option for porn fans .
" You know , there ’s a porn store for Android , " Jobs said .
" You can download nothing but porn .
You can download porn , your kids can download porn .
That ’s a place we do n’t want to go , so we ’re not going to go there . "
Jobs ' opposition to porn is loud and clear , but Apple 's crackdown on sex - tinged apps can be described as a " semi- ban " at best .
The Playboy app remains in the App Store , as does the Sports Illustrated app , because they come from " more reputable companies , " according to Apple 's vice president of marketing , Phil Schiller .

English spelling mistakes made by Emirati students result from a lack of importance placed on spelling lessons said the dean of education at the British University in Dubai ( BUiD ) .
In a study , Dr Mick Randall collected Arab learners ' tests from the Common Educational Proficiency Assessment ( CEPA ) given at the UAE higher education institutions .
He used the tests to analyse common writing mistakes in relation to orthography ( the study of letters and spelling in language ) and word recognition in English by Emirati students .
The CEPA tests are taken by students for placement at Zayed University , the Higher Colleges of Technology and UAE University .
Differently wired
" The way we read words is determined by the sounds of the language or the orthography of different scripts .
[ This is why ]
Arab students have such enormous problems reading and writing English , " said Randall .
" In psychological literature people are very unaware that when it comes to linguistics , it is n't universal how brains are wired , " said Randall .
This is due to the variations in languages in terms of sounds and scripts .
" [ Arab students ] have different [ word ] search patterns because their linguistic language affects their perception , " he added .
He said for native English speakers the letters of an English word identified phonetically formulate a picture in the brain associated with a meaning .
However , for Emirati students this is not the case as Arabic spelling does not work in the same way .
" Brains do get framed in a different way for other languages [ besides English ] , " he said .
" European languages dominate the world and most research is conducted in English so nobody questions ... other languages , " Randall added .
" I think teacher training colleges do a bad job of teaching phonology , " said Randall .
" For the last 20 years learning English has been about meaning whereas rhyme is critical to teaching English spelling . "
( Phonology is the study of speech sounds and the rules of pronunciation in a language . )
Randall explained that instead of teaching Arab students to recognise the sounds of English words , teachers concentrate on getting students to speak properly .
" This is an impossible task — to make people in their late teens or early twenties change their pronunciation , " he said .
Finding solutions
Instead , Randall believes emphasis should be placed on training teachers to become aware of the different systems based on contrasting analysis and how they affect spelling and reading .
" Each country should have a different programme to focus on particular English language learning problems of that country , " he said .
" In order to produce students who speak better English , people must be made aware of the different language systems and how they affect English spelling and reading . "
However , this must begin with phonology being incorporated as a module in teacher training courses said Randall .
" I firmly believe phonology courses should be included in teacher training as a feature of the English language that is important for spelling , " he said .
My hero of the week is star knitter Doris Godfrey who has bashing out jumpers for needy children for the last two years .
Doris , 89 , of Chester - le - Street , has rattled off 300 jumpers for children in Boroudha , a little village in Bangladesh and home of the Wear Surma Clinic established by Sunderland health visitor Carole Elliott .
“ I get a lot of enjoyment out of knitting these jumpers as I know they are going to a good cause and will help keep the children of Boroudha nice and warm , ” says Doris .
Good for you Doris .
While the cynics amongst you may question why children in a country where the average temperature is in the high 80s Fahrenheit would need woolly jumpers , I say good on you Doris .
“ It ’s a delight to see the smiles on their little faces , ” she added .
And the delight on their faces is clear for all to see in the photograph of the youngsters in their fetching jerkins that accompanied the story in the Sunderland Echo this week .
Well done Doris , and we wish her well in her next venture in aid of the Inuit children eking out an existence on the fringes of the Arctic tundra .
She ’s making them Bermuda shorts .

China will tomorrow start ramping up preparations for typhoons , dust storms and other extreme weather disasters as part of a 10 - year plan to predict and prevent the worst impacts of climate change .
Improved warning systems , new emergency drills and bolstered infrastructure will form the backbone of the new regulations , which are the country 's most advanced measures yet to deal with natural disaster .
China has a long history of devastating floods and droughts , but officials said the problems were intensifying .
" It is necessary to respond to the new situation under climate change to avoid and mitigate the losses caused by meteorological disasters , " said Gao Fengtao , deputy director of the state council 's legislative affairs office , as he unveiled the new policy .
In recent years , he said , disasters were characterised by " sudden occurrence , wider variety , greater intensity and higher frequency in the context of global warming " .
Officials warned this posed a threat to human life and a huge challenge to China 's sustainable development .
Zheng Guoguang , head of China 's meteorological administration , said natural disasters caused economic losses each year of up to 300bn yuan ( £ 29bn ) , equivalent to about 2 % of the country 's gross domestic product .
He cited the unusually severe snow storms that engulfed southern China in 2008 and the worst drought in a century that is now afflicting Yunnan , Guangxi and Sichuan provinces .
The new regulations for the prevention of and preparedness for meteorological disasters will establish a legal framework for disaster response , risk assessment , evacuation measures and public education .
They will cover terrestrial phenomena – such as extreme temperatures , dust and sand storms , lightning strikes , fog , typhoons – and " space weather " , such as solar storms .
Officials said the move was part of a 10 - year national plan that clarified the government 's response to climate change and stipulated what measures regional and local governments should take in terms of infrastructure investment , reporting mechanisms and disaster drills .
But it was unclear how much the central government would spend on the programme and the proportion of the costs it would bear .
Local authorities in poor areas often neglect Beijing directives that they cannot afford to implement .
Despite its developing nation status , China has an advanced meteorological monitoring system , using weather satellites and a global network of 158 radar stations .
Zheng said the government has invested 10bn yuan in the system in recent years , with the budget rising 15 % annually .
" The large sums that China invests in its meteorological infrastructure are rarely seen in the world , " he said .
London , England ( CNN ) -- A British soldier who went absent without leave rather than return to fight in Afghanistan was jailed Friday for nine months by a military court , officials said .
A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed that Lance Corp .
Joe Glenton had been convicted by a military judge at a court martial in Colchester , southeast England ,
Glenton , who completed a seven - month tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2006 , became an outspoken critic of British military operations in the country during his absence , frequently appearing at anti-war rallies and on television .
In an interview last July , the 27 - year - old told CNN that he was not a conscientious objector , but was refusing to return because he felt the 2001 invasion and subsequent conflict against Taliban militants was not a legitimate use of force .
" The situation in Afghanistan and our involvement is further antagonizing the Muslim population of the world , " Glenton said .
" I think the conflict has become part of the problem , not part of the solution . "
Update October 2010 : It looks like Leaf have stopped messing with the phones .
I have a Vodacom Desire and it does n’t have any Leaf stink on it .
Maybe someone at Leaf read this post ?
My mobile phone has a weird bug .
The wifi works perfectly and then I leave the house and it never switches over to 3G unless I reboot the phone .
That ’s a pretty annoying bug , but what makes it even more annoying is that the problem was actually fixed 8 months ago with the release of Android 1.6 .
There are also a whole bunch of cool updates as part of that 1.6 release , but still , I ’m stuck with version 1.5 .
So why not upgrade ?
Well , the problem lies with a company called Leaf .
Leaf are the HTC importers for South Africa .
Sadly , if all Leaf did was import the phones we ’d be fine , but the over - reaching company gets involved in the process of managing the software on the phones and this is a job they fail at miserably .
When I phoned Leaf to ask when there will be an update made available they said that they were busy “ testing ” and that I should wait 3 to 4 weeks …
This sounds reasonable but unfortunately I can’t believe them .
You see , Leaf have a long history of completely stuffing up Android phones in South Africa .
This dates back to many many months ago when Leaf first launched the HTC Magic ( my phone ) .
Regular Android phones have an application called “ Market ” which contains thousands of applications ( much like the Apple App Store ) .
You can find all kinds of things like Google Sky Map ( hold it up to the sky and it shows you which stars you ’re looking at ) to apps that make farting sounds .
Great stuff , generally .
But when Leaf launched the Magic it came bundled with an app called “ Open Market ” and no regular “ Market ” .
Open Market had a few ( ie , like 30 ) really really bad applications on it …
I think the top rated app was something with wallpapers of dogs .
When pressed for an explanation Leaf said that Google did n’t give them permission to use the Market app .
After chatting to some people from Google who work on Android it sounds like this “ permission ” excuse was made up .
The more likely explanation is that Leaf were hoping to start selling applications via their Open Market app .
Yes , Open Market is developed ( used losely ) by Leaf .
Once they realised that nobody cares about them they buckled and said they were working on an update that included Market … they suggested we wait 3 to 4 weeks while they tested the new version .
This was in May .
Eventually , late in August , 5 months after promising something in 3 to 4 weeks , Leaf quietly released an update on their website .
The phone was finally what I ’d paid for … a fully fledged Android phone … but only for a few weeks as Android released version 1.6 a few days later .
One of the big attractions of Android , and certainly why I bought my phone , is the Open Source and constantly evolving platform …
The idea that your phone ’s operating system is n’t frozen in time for 2 years and can get updates ( automatically if you want ) …
Unfortunately Leaf are just plain incompetent and do n’t seem to care that they ’re selling a device that is n’t quite what the customer paid for …
Our phones are stuck in time … and , when pushed for an answer we ’re told again “ 3 to 4 weeks ” .
When I eventually lost my cool and tracked down Peter , Leaf ’s marketing person , he said I should send him an email and that he would get me some answers in a few days …
He then got his PR agency to phone me and promise that they would get me some answers the next day …
Perhaps ironically it has been 3 weeks and I ’m yet to get anything out of them .
So here are the questions I asked Peter in that email 3 weeks ago .
When will the HTC Magic get a 1.6 ROM
Why has it taken so long ?
( 8 months and counting )
What is Leaf doing to correct the problems with the process and how are they going to convince consumers that buying via Leaf is a good idea ?
Until Leaf can answer these questions I would advise against buying any HTC products in South Africa .
You ’re just not getting what you paid for .
The end .
ps . I heard that Leaf are bringing in two new HTC phones , the Legend and Desire … Both look like sweet phones , it ’s a pity that if Leaf will probably ruin it for anyone who buys the phone by never releasing any updates .

UPDATE ( July 7 , 2010 ) Daniel Herding sent me a story about his adventures with Avira ’s latest version .
Looks like they ’ve just paved over the problem .
We ’ve been seeing a number of reports that our DotSpots Chrome extension is being reported as infected with the HTML / Crypted .
Gen malware .
There ’s not a lot of information on Avira ’s site about this malware , except that it ’s a ‘ trojan ’ with ‘ low damage potential ’ .
I previously submitted a sample of the false positive which solved the problem until we pushed out a new version of our code .
Since we ca n’t submit each of our builds ahead of time to Avira for approval , I had to spend some time figuring out exactly what was causing them to think our code was malicious .
I started by downloading a trial version of their anti-virus product .
Immediately after restart , it detected the HTML / Crypted .
Gen malware in the Chrome extension that was already installed .
I extracted the script from the extension to my desktop and it continued to pop up infection warnings on the file .
Now that I had a reliable reproduction case , I could start working on narrowing down what triggered the alert .
I loaded up the file in my trusty analysis tool , Notepad .
Starting from the original file , I deleted large swaths of code until it was no longer detected as a virus , then restored those pieces and deleted smalled chunks .
Eventually I reduced it down to a couple of lines , which were then reduced down to a few strings of characters .
At the end , a file with only a few hundred characters would trigger the signature :
.fromCharCode .charCodeAt for eval 0,0,0,0,0,0 Math.min
Aside : my original set of pattern strings included “ nodeValue ” rather than “ eval ” .
The patterns are all case - insensitive and do n’t ensure matches happen on JS token boundaries .
When I went character - by - character to simplify the triggers further , I discovered that it was the ‘ eVal ’ in ‘ nodeValue ’ causing issues .
When I create a file with those six strings in it on a website , Avira will attempt to block the download .
This appeared to be the most specific components of the signature .
Putting those keywords into Google , I found a few references to the malware it detected .
The malicious script seems to construct an iframe from an array of characters , then inserts it into the document to download malware from a third - party site .
Unfortunately , these keywords also end up in the compiled Javascript of nearly every Google Web Toolkit application , giving Avira anti-virus users false - positives when viewing many of these applications .
I posted a report to the GWT contributor Google Group with my findings .
I had expected that since I posted the offending signature in the message , Avira would warn me that the web page I was reading was malicious .
It did n’t .
I ran the message page through the same process that I used to figure out what triggered the signature , this time looking for the smallest piece of text that disables detection of the virus .
It turns out that this text is the phrase google .
So , the heuristic looks for the presence of the six character strings above , but also the absence of the word Google .
It ’s a little disappointing to see how poorly this anti-virus product implements heuristic detection of this particular scripting pattern .
It was trivial for me to figure out the pattern .
I could have worked around any number of ways - by adding whitespace to the array of zeros , using Math [ ' min ' ] , or String [ ' from ' + ' CharCode ' ] , all of which breaks this pattern recognition .
Having the phrase ‘ google ’ disable detection of the virus made my job even easier .
It ’s possible that there are a set of other safewords that do the same thing .
If I were writing malware or viruses , I ’d definitely spend time altering it to work around this sort of heuristic .
Considering that the risk of false positives is so high ( and users might be trained to ignore other , potentially valid virus warnings ) , I ’d say that users are worse off with this virus definition than they are without .

If California legalizes pot , will D.C. follow ?
If they are n't already , elected officials in the District should be keeping close tabs on this year 's election in California .
On Wednesday , advocates for legalizing marijuana officially secured enough signatures to put a referendum on the California ballot this November asking voters to legalize and tax pot .
And , judging by recent legislation in the District , what starts in California often eventually makes it way to the left - leaning District .
San Francisco 's decision in 2007 to ban plastic bags , for example , was one impetus for the District 's recently enacted bag tax .
And San Francisco Mayor Gavin
Newsome launched the modern same - sex marriage movement when he issued marriage licenses to gay couples in 2004 -- long before the District took up the issue .
And California voters approved a referendum allowing for the medical use of marijuana in 1996 - two years before voters in the District approved a similar referendum .
The District 's medical marijuana law is only now being implemented because it was tied up for years on Capitol Hill .
But if California voters approve the legalization of marijuana - which remains an if , because polls show a potentially close election - how long will it be before pro-pot advocates seek to petition a similar measure onto the ballot in the District ?
Allen St. Pierre , executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , estimates it would be six years or less before the marijuana legalization debate makes its way to the District .
" California , like it or not , really pushes American politics and business in one direction or another , " said St. Pierre , noting the issue is also expected to soon land on the ballot in Nevada and Oregon .
" I am going to guess four to six years after the citizens of California pass something like this , there is either an initiative here or the city council takes it up . "
Already , D.C. Council member Marion Barry ( D - Ward 8 ) has been grumbling publicly that some of the District 's drug laws need to be reformed because too many residents are being locked up for drug possession .
But Council member David A. Catania ( I - At large ) , the chairman of the Committee on Health , and other council members have made it clear they do not want the medical marijuana legislation pending before the council to spiral into a debate over outright legalization .
A Washington Post poll conducted in January found District residents were split on whether they supported legalizing small amounts of marijuana for personal use .
Forty - six percent of residents favored the idea , but 48 percent opposed .
But while 60 percent of whites supported legalizing marijuana , only 37 percent of African - Americans felt that way , largely due to strong opposition among older black women .
A debate over marijuana legalization would n't be entirely new terrain for the District .
In 1977 , the city council approved legislation to decriminalize possession of one ounce or less of the drug .
But then Mayor Walter E. Washington vetoed the measure , citing the possible effects the law would have on city youths .
And even if legalization advocates won a referendum over the issue in the District , Congress would ultimately have the power to block it from taking place .
It 's hard to see Congress staying out of that debate .
But who would have guessed six years ago that the debate over whether to legalize same - sex marriage in the District would have been such a snooze this year on Capitol Hill ?

Political reporter , BBC News
Even before official campaigning begins , one thing seems clear - this election is going to be fought in cyberspace as well as on the doorsteps .
Many MPs and candidates are using sites like Facebook Social media websites , like Twitter and Facebook , are now seen as crucial battlegrounds , as well as potential forums for political gaffes .
The influence of bloggers too , free as they are to support or attack the various parties , also seems to be growing by the day .
Now one company , Yomego , says it can put some numbers on the effect of all this - with what it calls " social media reputation scores " ( SMRs ) for the parties and their leaders .
These give a rating for someone 's online popularity by looking at both the " noise " surrounding them - just how much are they being talked about online - and " sentiment " - whether the talk is positive or negative .
The higher your sentiment score , the nicer the things people are saying about you .
Out of the 100 , Gordon Brown 's popularity score is 68.20 , David Cameron 's is 58.98 and Nick Clegg 's is the highest at 68.49 .
Within that , Mr Brown 's noise component is up at 87 , but his sentiment is just 47 and slipping .
A lot of people seem to be talking about him , but not very favourably .
Mr Cameron 's sentiment score is better , about 58 , but people seem to be talking about him much less - with noise down to 48 .
Of the three , Mr Clegg appears to be talked about in the most positive terms , with a sentiment rating of 62 .
' Air - brushed ' poster Steve Richards , managing director of Yomego , says : " The trend has been that Nick Clegg has been steadily rising , without doing anything particularly spectacular .
" David Cameron 's personal score has gone down recently .
He took a big knock around the whole airbrushed poster campaign .
There were a lot of spoofs , particularly from influential bloggers , and that really seemed to hurt him .
" Finally , Gordon Brown 's score has risen recently , but largely due to noise , not because of any growth in positive sentiment . "
LEADERS ' SOCIAL MEDIA SCORES Gordon Brown - 68.20 ( out of 100 ) David Cameron - 58.98 Nick Clegg - 68.49 Source : Yomego Looking at the parties as a whole , however , the picture is quite different .
Labour 's score is 63.56 , the Tories ' is 73.12 and the Lib Dems ' is 62.04 .
The Tories are miles ahead in terms of noise , with a figure in the nineties , but are also doing better than the government in terms of sentiment .
The Lib Dems have the best sentiment but not much overall noise - according to Yomego , the main talking point is whether Vince Cable could become chancellor in a coalition government .
PARTIES ' SOCIAL MEDIA SCORES Labour - 63.56 ( out of 100 ) Conservatives - 73.12 Lib Dems - 62.04
" The Tories have made more effort so far than the other parties to use social media and that shows .
Things like their iphone app have gone down well , " Mr Richards says .
Comments , good or bad , that are being made by so - called " influencers " - in the political context that tends to be certain bloggers , columnists or correspondents - have a bigger weighting than an average person .
" If someone with a million followers on Twitter is saying something negative then that could potentially have a big influence , " he adds .
Younger voters
But does any of this really matter ?
Should the party leaders actually take it seriously ahead of the election ?
" Well , Obama certainly did , " says Mr Richards .
" A huge part of his campaign was directed towards social media and influencing younger voters who might well take a steer from their peers rather than traditional media outlets .
" And it 's very immediate .
Just last week Labour took a hit over the lobbying stuff and David Cameron saw his sentiment ratings improve because of his wife 's pregnancy . "
Yomego also works with corporate clients - recently Mr Richards says he has seen the social media reputation of big brands like Toyota and Eurostar " fall off a cliff " thanks to a product recall and tunnel breakdowns respectively .
It 's a sort of early warning system for negative sentiment
Steve Richards , Yomego " If you look at Eurostar , they were getting a huge amount of negative chatter , but in the crucial first 48 hours of that there was nothing from them .
There 's a lesson there for politicians .
" If there 's a particular detractor out there who is running a story and is generating a lot of traffic then it would be worth their while reacting to that . "
This sort of cyber - space reaction could provide almost instant feedback to the leaders ' performances during the televised head - to - head debates scheduled to take place during the campaign .
" They 'll be able to see exactly how people are reacting .
It 's a sort of early warning system for negative sentiment . "
Tories ' on message '
Other groups are using social media in other ways to test the political waters .
Mr Cameron might have made it clear last year that he is no fan of Twitter but nevertheless , a group of computer science students at Cambridge University has developed a programme that analyses the tweets of individual politicians .
It compares them with a 250,000 - word database of material from their party 's manifestos , speeches , and so on and can work out how on or off message any one person is .
All that is displayed on a website , tweetguv.co.uk , and one of its founder 's , Oliver Chick , said : " The Conservatives have consistently come out a lot higher in terms of allegiance , with Labour quite a way behind and the Lib Dems even further . "
He says about one politician a day is signing up to Twitter and the allegiance between them and the party line does seem to be affected by wider goings on .
" The Tories had a bit of dip earlier this month when their polls ratings started to drop , but they seem to be back on message now , particularly around the Budget . "

The proposed tax had been rejected by the Constitutional Council
The French government has signalled that it is dropping a plan for a tax on domestic carbon dioxide emissions .
Jean - Francois Cope , parliamentary leader of the governing UMP party , was quoted as saying the tax " would be Europe - wide or not ( exist ) at all " .
Prime Minister Francois Fillon told parliament that the government should focus on policies that increased France 's economic competitiveness .
France had been rethinking the tax after a court rejected it last year .
The Constitutional Council said there were too many exemptions for polluters in the tax plan , and that a minority of consumers would bear the burden .
But President Nicolas Sarkozy 's government had still been planning to push through a revised version of the measure later this year .
German competition
Had the plan been approved , France would have been the largest country to impose a carbon tax as part of efforts to tackle climate change .
" We have to amplify measures that help reinforce the competitiveness of our economy , " Mr Fillon was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency .
" In that spirit , I would like to indicate that the decisions we are going to take regarding sustainable development have to be better coordinated with all European countries , so as not to widen our gap in competitiveness with our neighbour Germany . "
Environmental agencies expressed dismay on Tuesday , while the head of the French business federation Medef expressed relief .
The European Commission said earlier this month that it was planning an EU - wide minimum tax on carbon as part of the EU 's green energy agenda - though the UK opposes such a move .
I ca n’t understand what ’s being said in these commercials , but they make me happy .
Our beloved Android mascot dancing about to some hot music all for the sake of showing off the awesomeness that is him ( and , in turn , his operating system ) .
SK Telecom has launched a massive Android campaign – which I understand may have been running for a few weeks now – to market their smartphone offerings and it makes me wish the US market were just as creative with their marketing efforts .
Here are just a few of the videos featuring the adorable little robot :
That little guy has some moves !
I ’ve always loved Asian media : they always seem to create the stuff that gets people feeling all warm inside .
SK Telecom : please ring up AT&T , T - Mobile , and Sprint to offer your creative services .
I ’d mention Verizon , but they seem to have hit their own unique stride with the Droid marketing .

Great Proofs as Great Art
Can we view and appreciate great proofs as great art ?
Leonardo da Vinci was not a complexity theorist , but according to our friends at Wikipedia he was just about everything else : a painter , a sculptor , an architect , a musician , a scientist , a mathematician , an engineer , an inventor , an anatomist , a geologist , a cartographer , a botanist and a writer .
If he was alive now , I wonder what brilliant things he would be doing .
Today I want to discuss a question related to Leonardo as an artist : can we view great proofs as great art ?
I think we can , and I would like to explain why .
Connecting proofs and art reminds me of a legend I heard at Yale , many years ago , concerning the beginning programming class , CS 101 .
I do not believe the legend , but this will not stop me from repeating it .
The legend goes there was once an exam given to a 101 class , containing the question :
Evaluate the following expression : where and .
The correct answer was , not , since the operator “ ” has higher precedence than the operator “ ” .
But , the legend is one student “ evaluated ” the expression as follows :
The expression has a pleasing horizontal symmetry , and a near left - to - right central symmetry , and is also
You must remember Yale was filled with very bright students , but their main interests were often in the liberal arts , not in mathematics .
The student was right , the expression does have some nice symmetries
Studying Great Art
How do we study great art ?
Consider Mona Lisa as an example — perhaps the best known painting in the entire world .
We may , if in Paris , go to the Louvre and wait in a long line , and eventually get a glance at the famous painting .
Or we may study reproductions of the Mona Lisa in art books , in other reproductions , or even on - line today .
Most of us look at the Mona Lisa and see different things .
We may like it , we may love it , or we may prefer more modern paintings , but most are amazed at Leonardo ’s achievement .
Our goal in looking at and studying a great work of art , like this , is not to reproduce it ourselves — that is impossible .
Our goal is not to even try to understand how Leonardo achieved his great painting , how he captured her famous smile — that also is probably impossible .
Instead our goal is one of enjoyment , of pleasure , of the excitement in seeing the work of a master .
We come away with a impression , a general feel , a holist view of what he did .
We do not understand each brush stroke , we do not understand how he made his paints , we do not understand how he captured her look , we do not understand how he created the masterpiece .
But , we do leave with something .
Studying Great Proofs
I have wondered if we could do something similar with the great proofs .
Many read and study a great proof in an attempt to really understand them .
If there is a masterpiece in your area of research you may need to understand the proof line for line — you may need to be able to reproduce the proof to be considered an expert in your area .
However , most of us do not even look at the masterpiece proofs , ever .
We may know their statements , but most of us — I claim — have no idea of how they work .
Nor do we need to understand them line for line .
But my thesis is this :
We can learn from a study of the great proofs , even if we do not follow the proofs in detail .
We should study the great proofs , not to understand them completely , but in the same way people study the Mona Lisa .
For enjoyment , for enrichment , for seeing a master at work , and for getting something out of the study .
Not to be able to reproduce the Mona Lisa .
What we learn may be intangible , but still invaluable .
Again , we can leave with something .
Some Great Proofs
Here are some sample great proofs — there are many others , these are just a few to make our discussion concrete .
The same comments will apply to many other of the great proofs .
One property of many of the great proofs — not all — is they are long .
The opposite is not true : there are plenty of long proofs of relatively unimportant results .
Length is no measure of greatness , just as the length of a book or the size of a painting is not a measure of its greatness .
However , many of the great proofs are long , some are very long .
One reason is : a great proof often requires several new ideas and it is reasonable to expect weaving these ideas together can be difficult to explain ; hence , the great length of the great proofs .
Feit - Thompson ’s Theorem : Walter Feit and John Thompson proved in 1962 : Every group of odd order is solvable .
Cohen ’s Theorem : Paul Cohen proved in 1962 : The Axiom of Choice and the Continuum Hypothesis are independent from Zermelo– Fraenkel ( ZF ) set theory .
Obviously , 1962 was a very good year for great proofs .
Szemerédi’s Theorem : Endre Szemerédi proved in 1975 : Every dense enough set has arbitrary long arithmetic progressions .
Wiles ’
Theorem : Andrew Wiles proved in 1994 : Fermat ’s Last Theorem .
What Can One Learn From This Study ?
I would like to run a class on the study of great proofs as great art .
I would have students “ read ” each of the great proofs , and we would have discussions about them .
I would not expect , even the top students , to be able to understand the proofs fully , or even partially .
I would not expect anyone to understand the proof at any deep level at all .
They may , even should , understand parts of the proof completely — a lemma here , or an argument there .
I would expect students to learn some appreciation for what it takes to create a masterpiece — a great proof .
I believe we can learn a great deal from reading great proofs , even without understanding them in the usual sense .
Let ’s look and see what we might learn from reading these proofs in this way .
Previous Work
Great proofs usually do not arise out of a complete vacuum .
They are almost always based on previous work : they may extend an earlier argument , they may use techniques developed by others , they arise in a complex context .
Feit - Thompson :
They used a great deal of machinery of group theory .
One of the great previous results was due to William Burnside , who had proved every group of order with and both prime is solvable .
Cohen :
He used Kurt Gödel famous proof of the relative consistency of the AC with ZF .
Weave Many Ideas Together Great proofs often need to use much of the existing machinery .
This is similar to the last point , but a bit different .
Here the point is the creation of a great proof usually requires the mastery of many tools and techniques .
Feit - Thompson :
They used almost all aspects of group theory : local analysis , character theory , and relation definitions of groups .
They also needed to use non-trivial number theory .
At the very end of their proof they could have saved a large amount of work if they could have proved this conjecture : there are no distinct primes and so that Since they could not , they needed to use even more group theory tricks to get the contradiction they needed .
Wiles :
He used much of modern number theory , especially the theory of modular forms and Galois representation theory .
The famous number theorist Enrico Bombieri said that he would need at least a full year to understand Wiles achievement — this is because of the diverse tools used in the proof .
Golden Nuggets
Great proofs often contain new ideas and methods , sometimes these can be more important than the theorem being proved .
Note , I have talked all through this discussion about proofs not theorems .
This is one reason for this : often the proof is much more important than the theorem itself .
Cohen :
He created an entire new way of constructing models of set theory .
This method , called forcing , is now a standard tool used by set theorists everyday .
When Alfred Tarski heard about Cohen ’s new method he said :
They have a method , now they will get everything .
Szemerédi :
He needed to prove a certain lemma to make his great proof work .
This lemma is the now famous Regularity Lemma .
Strategic Plan Great proofs almost always have a plan of attack .
If someone tells you they have solved a long standing open problem by “ just an induction ” — it is pretty unlikely to be true .
Usually , great proofs have a complex strategic plan for the attack of their proof .
Feit - Thompson :
Their proof is divided into six chapters : each has its own abstract and they give a coherent overview of what each chapter does and how they all fit together .
With every seat filled in the Los Angeles City Council chambers Wednesday , Anita Edwards had one minute to make her case before the buzzer cut her off .
“ I ’m here because I ’m fighting for my job , ” said the 51 - year - old city child - care director , one of hundreds of employees expecting a pink slip by July .
“ I love what I do and that ’s why I ’ve stayed dedicated to this city for 18 years . ”
For as long as anyone can remember , city leaders have neatly balanced their books by eliminating vacant positions and shifting money between accounts .
But now the first of as many as 4,000 job cuts are underway to keep the city solvent .
And that has thrust into public view what is usually a very private process .
Confrontations between vulnerable workers and their elected representatives have begun to roll out on a live telecast of the council ’s meetings each week and on the city ’s website , lacity.org .
A week ago , council members listened uncomfortably from their leather swivel chairs as half a dozen technicians from the city ’s public access channel begged for a last - minute reprieve .
On Wednesday , in an effort organized by labor unions , council members faced a stream of city employees such as Edwards , who urged them not to go through with layoffs that would virtually shut down the city ’s licensed child - care programs and curtail hours at libraries and recreation centers .
The lineup included young patrons such as Zachary Novakovich , who said that if council members closed his child - care center in Glassell Park his mother could no longer hold her job .
“ If she does n’t go to work then we ca n’t stay in our house , ” he said .
Moments later , Arthur Jackson , who works at a recreation center in South Los Angeles , warned against cutting jobs like his .
“ We work in some of the toughest parts of the city , and I do it without a gun or a badge , ” he told the council .
“ If you think we have a gang problem now , watch what happens if we close these parks . ”
Councilman Tom LaBonge said city employees facing layoffs have buttonholed him in the hallway .
Last week he got a sheaf of drawings from elementary school children urging him not to fire their favorite librarian , Hillary George of the Will & Ariel Durant Branch Library in Hollywood .
“ Ms. Hillary ” appeared Wednesday before the council in a swishing lime skirt and bubble gum - sized pearls urging members to find a more “ creative ” solution .
Of the 20 librarians on the layoff list so far , George said , she would be No. 12 in seniority .
“ This has been a long drama , but it ’s just gotten a lot more dramatic , ” LaBonge said .
“ You ca n’t save every job . ”
Those pressures have led to messy scenes that could play out again and again in the months ahead .
The task of drawing up the layoff list belongs to the department heads , who answer to the mayor , leaving some council members feeling powerless about which jobs are cut .
Last week , after hearing from the technicians at the city ’s public - access channel , Councilman Bill Rosendahl shouted at the general manager of the Information Technology Agency , demanding to know why she had chosen those jobs .
This week , City Clerk June Lagmay , who is grappling with diminished staff due to layoffs and early retirements , appeared on the verge of tears as she explained that she simply did not have enough employees to handle all of the department ’s responsibilities .
And reinforcing the notion that no layoff notice is final , several council members have seemed to pluck money out of the air to save certain positions .
After Councilwoman Janice
Hahn publicly questioned the dismissal of a curator at the Point Fermin Lighthouse in San Pedro Bay , the job was quietly restored .
Hahn and Councilman Herb Wesson have promised to dip into their discretionary accounts to temporarily rehire three arts instructors .
With those kinds of maneuvers , Councilman Tony Cardenas worries about picking “ winners and losers ” and creating false hope for hundreds of employees down the line -- many of whom will get pink slips on July 1 when a labor deal no longer protects them .
“ They ’re going to look to us and say ‘ save my job , ’ ” he said .
“ At that time we ’re going to be in a worse position to try to save even two or three jobs . ”

I am pleased to be here today at the first meeting of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform .
The President has assigned Chairman Bowles , Chairman Simpson , and their colleagues the very substantial task of charting a path to fiscal sustainability for the United States .
The deliberations of this commission are especially timely because some of the fundamental sources of long - term fiscal imbalances are no longer distant forecasts , but instead are unfolding in the here and now .
The task of developing and implementing sustainable fiscal policies is daunting , but meeting this challenge is absolutely essential .
History makes clear that failure to achieve fiscal sustainability will , over time , sap the nation 's economic vitality , reduce our living standards , and greatly increase the risk of economic and financial instability .
Long - Term Fiscal Challenges
Our nation 's fiscal position has deteriorated appreciably since the onset of the recession and the financial crisis .
The exceptional increase in the deficit has in large part reflected the effects of the weak economy on tax revenues and spending , along with the costs of policy actions taken to ease the recession and steady financial markets .
As the economy and financial markets continue to recover , and as the actions taken to provide economic stimulus and promote financial stability are phased out , the budget deficit should narrow over the next few years .
However , even after economic and financial conditions have returned to normal , in the absence of further policy actions , the federal budget appears set to remain on an unsustainable path .
A variety of projections that extrapolate current policies and make plausible assumptions about the future evolution of the economy show a structural budget gap that is both large relative to the size of the economy and increasing over time .
Moreover , as debt and deficits grow , so will the associated interest payments , an obligation that in turn further increases projected deficits .
Unfortunately , we cannot grow our way out of this problem .
No credible forecast suggests that future rates of growth of the U.S. economy will be sufficient to close these deficits without significant changes to our fiscal policies .
Among the primary forces putting upward pressure on the deficit are rapidly rising health - care costs and the aging of the U.S. population .
Federal spending for Medicare and Medicaid has increased substantially as a share of our national income over the past several decades , spurred both by the rising number of beneficiaries in these programs and by ongoing increases in spending per beneficiary .
Under policies in place prior to the recent enactment of the health - care bill , budget projections showed that spending for Medicare and Medicaid would roughly double as a share of national income over the next two decades and would continue to rise significantly further in subsequent years .
At this point , the effects of the recent legislation on federal health - care spending over the long term are uncertain , in part because they depend importantly on implementation .
But we do know that continued increases in health - care costs at the rate seen in recent decades , together with the aging of the population , would put enormous pressures on the federal budget in coming years .
Controlling health - care costs while still providing high - quality care to those who need it will be critical not only for budgetary reasons , but for maintaining the dynamism of the broader economy as well .
The aging of the U.S. population will also strain the Social Security program , as the number of individuals expected to be working and paying taxes into the system is rising more slowly than the number of people projected to be receiving benefits .
This year , there are about 5 individuals between the ages of 20 and 64 for each person aged 65 and older .
By the time most of the baby boomers have retired in 2030 , this ratio is projected to have declined to around 3 .
The projected fiscal imbalances associated with the Social Security system are notably smaller than those for federal health programs , but they still are significant and thus present an important challenge for policy .
Elsewhere in the budget , noninterest spending for programs outside of Medicare , Medicaid , and Social Security has comprised roughly half of total outlays over the past couple of decades .
These expenditures support national defense and homeland security , education , transportation , and income - security programs , along with many other activities .
The commission will have the difficult job of weighing the economic , social , and other benefits of these programs and comparing the implications of cuts in these areas against other means of closing the fiscal gap .
Choices regarding Medicare , Social Security , and other spending programs cannot be made in a vacuum but must be combined with decisions about how much revenue the government will raise and how it will raise it .
No laws are more basic than the laws of arithmetic :
For fiscal sustainability , whatever level of spending is chosen , revenues must be sufficient to sustain that spending in the long run .
At the same time , economic vitality is enhanced when taxes are not excessive and are collected through a system that is economically efficient , equitable , and transparent .
At present , a broad consensus exists that the U.S. tax code does not satisfy these criteria and is in need of reform .
I suspect that it is too much to ask the commission to review the tax code in detail , but a full picture of our budgetary dilemma will require attention to the strengths and weaknesses of our current system of raising revenue .
The Path to Fiscal Sustainability
The ultimate goal of the commission 's efforts should be to put us on a path to fiscal sustainability .
One widely accepted criterion for sustainability is that the ratio of federal debt held by the public to national income remain at least stable ( or perhaps even decline ) in the longer term .
This goal can be achieved by bringing spending , excluding interest payments , roughly into line with revenues .
Unfortunately , most projections suggest that we are far from this goal , and that without significant changes to current policy , the ratio of federal debt to national income will continue to rise sharply .
Thus , the reality is that the Congress , the Administration , and the American people will have to choose among making modifications to entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security , restraining federal spending on everything else , accepting higher taxes , or some combination thereof .
Achieving long - term fiscal sustainability will be difficult , but the costs of failing to do so could be very high .
Increasing levels of government debt relative to the size of the economy can lead to higher interest rates , which inhibit capital formation and productivity growth -- and might even put the current economic recovery at risk .
To the extent that higher debt increases our reliance on foreign borrowing , an ever - larger share of our future income would be devoted to interest payments on federal debt held abroad .
Moreover , other things being equal , increased federal debt implies higher taxes in the future to cover the associated interest costs -- higher taxes that may create disincentives to work , save , hire , and invest .
High levels of debt also decrease the ability of policymakers to respond to future economic and financial shocks ; indeed , a loss of investor confidence in the ability of a government to achieve fiscal sustainability can itself be a source of significant economic and financial instability , as we have seen in a number of countries in recent decades .
Neither experience nor economic theory clearly indicates the threshold at which government debt begins to endanger prosperity and economic stability .
But given the significant costs and risks associated with a rapidly rising federal debt , our nation should soon put in place a credible plan for reducing deficits to sustainable levels over time .
Doing so earlier rather than later will not only help maintain the U.S. government 's credibility in financial markets , thereby holding down interest costs , but it will also ultimately prove less disruptive by avoiding abrupt shifts in policy and by giving those affected by budget changes more time to adapt .
Conclusion
The path forward contains many difficult tradeoffs and choices , but postponing those choices and failing to put the nation 's finances on a sustainable long - run trajectory would ultimately do great damage to our economy .
I thank the members of the commission for their willingness to serve and urge them to demonstrate to the American people that serious , well - intentioned citizens can come together to craft credible and sustainable solutions to our budgetary challenges .
Last week we reported that our favorite piece of sandhog hardware , the massive Tunnel Boring Machine [ TBM ] , would soon be put to work digging the Second Avenue subway .
Well , the stories are true !
Here 's a look at the TBM cutter head that will be delivered to the Upper East Side in pieces over the next three weeks .
The TBM blade head is 22 feet in diameter and with all its back - up equipment , excavation material haulage system and removal equipment , it will be over 300 feet long and weigh 485 tons , according to a community letter obtained by the Upper Green Side .
The MTA says it 's so big they 'll need to close down part of Second Avenue during delivery , so get your earplugs ready , locals :
All lowering of the TBM and back - up components will take place at the deck opening between 92nd and 91st Streets .
A large crane will be located south of this deck opening to perform the lowering operations .
Due to the size of the machinery and DOT oversize load restrictions , the delivery of this equipment will need to occur at night between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. , on weekdays only .
Lifting the equipment off the trucks and lowering into the launch Box will require up to three lanes of Second Avenue to be closed to traffic for two weeks ( April 12 through April 23 ) and one lane for one week ( April 26 through April 30 ) between the hours of 11:00 pm and 6:00 am .
In addition , all lanes will be shut down during the actual pick of the equipment for safety reasons .
Speaking of the Second Avenue subway project , did you know that in the late ' 60s / early ' 70s the MTA seriously considered routing the elusive subway line as far east as Avenue C? Second Avenue Sagas recalls the MTA once planned to divert the line east at 17th Street toward Stuyvesant Square ( near Stuyvesant Town ) , under 15th , 14th and 13th Streets to Avenue A , south to Essex Street along East Broadway and across Chatham Square .
This Avenue A extension would have cost an additional $ 57 million .
Then the MTA planned an additional loop to Avenue C , between 14th and Houston Streets , for an extra $ 55 million .
By 1974 , these plans had gotten so expensive the whole project was shelved .
Below , more on this particular TBM ( which has quite an illustrious history ! ) , plus a gorgeous photo of what the entire TBM rig looks like once it's down in the hole with all the " trailing gear " attached .
The TBM " Trailing gear " is a long set of equipment attached to the TBMs , seen here on the 7 line extension .

A spokesperson for the MTA tells us , " The Second Ave Subway TBM was originally manufactured by Robbins about 30 years ago .
It is a main gripper , hard - rock machine that has been used on at least 4 other projects and it has been reconditioned to be ' like new . '
Schiavone rebuilt the machine in their Newark , N.J. , yard where it was assembled and tested , and it has now been disassembled for shipment to the site where it will be reassembled again in the Launch Box .
" The last project that the TBM was used on was the Fall River CSO Project in Fall River , Mass .
It was first used to dig the 63rd Street Tunnel in the late ' 70s .
The cutterhead for the TBM has a diameter of 22 ft . "
Republican state Sen . Roy Ashburn of Bakersfield has taken leave from his elected position until at least Monday after his arrest on suspicion of drunken driving started a firestorm over his sexual orientation .
Ashburn , 55 , has served in the Legislature since 1996 and consistently has voted against bills that would expand legal protections for gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender Californians .
The single father of four is among lawmakers with the staunchest records against those issues .
Ashburn was arrested and booked into Sacramento County jail on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol just after 2 a.m. Wednesday .
A Sacramento television station cited unnamed sources in reporting that Ashburn had spent the evening at Faces , a large gay dance club a few blocks from where police stopped him .
Ashburn was driving his state - issued vehicle .
Sacramento station KOVR reported there was another man in the car with Ashburn .
There has been no confirmation of Ashburn being at the club that night , which drew large crowds for a Miss Gay Latina Sacramento competition .
But , three sources have told The Chronicle that they have seen Ashburn regularly at gay clubs and bars near Faces .
Capitol staffers say it is an open secret that Ashburn frequently visits Sacramento 's gay establishments .
One person who said he has seen Ashburn out on several occasions is Christopher Cabaldon , the mayor of West Sacramento , who came out as gay while in office in 2006 .
Cabaldon said he has seen Ashburn at Badlands and the Depot , two gay establishments across the street from Faces , on multiple occasions and as recently as in the past few months .
" From my own experience I totally understand the fear and issues of being out in politics , " said Cabaldon , adding that he did not know Ashburn 's sexual orientation .
But , he said , " The hypocrisy - that 's what 's problematic .
The notion that you think it 's OK to live in the community and expect that you 're going to be safe and protected when you are , during the daytime , doing everything to deny those protections . "
Ashburn could not be reached for comment .
His staff said they have not had contact with him since the day before the arrest , although the office did release a statement from the senator regarding his arrest that read : " I am deeply sorry for my actions and offer no excuse for my poor judgment .
I accept complete responsibility for my conduct and am prepared to accept the consequences for what I did . "
In 2004 , a reporter with the Bakersfield Californian asked Ashburn directly about his sexual orientation , and the senator said only , " I 'm surprised you 're asking that , " according to the newspaper .
A columnist there asked him again last year and he said , " I think there are certain subjects that are simply not relevant and this is one of them .
It has no bearing on the job I do . "
Ashburn has voted against bills establishing same - sex marriage , banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in businesses , and strengthening anti-bullying and harassment protections for gay youth in public schools .
Equality California , the state 's leading gay rights lobbying organization , has consistently given Ashburn a zero- percent rating in its annual scorecard of lawmakers ' votes on gay rights .
Geoff Kors , the executive director of Equality California , said Ashburn has " one of the worst records of anyone in the Legislature " on expanding rights for LGBT people .
" It 's sad for him on a personal level and it's frustrating that someone who is clearly comfortable with gay people would vote against the very rights of the people he associates with , " Kors said .
He said the organization had requested multiple meetings with Ashburn to discuss legislation but always had been turned down .
Charles Moran , spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans , a national gay Republican organization , said it is common for conservatives who are not out about their sexual orientation to vote against expanding gay rights .
" A lot of people who are closeted homosexuals think it will give them cover , but instead it increases the heat , " Moran said .
He said Ashburn needs to " be honest with his family first and his constituents about what is going on .
It 's not a crime that he was at a gay bar .
The scandal will continue as long as he continues to be dodgy about personal aspects of his life . "
The tragedy of the Haitian earthquake continues to unfold , with slow delivery of aid , the horrific number of amputations performed out of desperate medical necessity , more than a million homeless , perhaps 240,000 dead , hunger , dehydration , the emergence of infections and waterborne diseases , and the approach of the rainy season , which will be followed by the hurricane season .
Haiti has suffered a massive blow , an earthquake for which its infrastructure was not prepared , after decades — no , centuries — of military and economic manipulation by foreign governments , most notably the United States and France .
Haiti was a slave plantation controlled by France .
In 1804 , inspired by Toussaint L’Ouverture ( after whom the now barely functioning airport in Port - au - Prince is named ) , the slaves rebelled , founding the world ’s first black republic .
Under military threat from France in 1825 , Haiti agreed to pay reparations to France for lost “ property , ” including slaves that French owners lost in the rebellion .
It was either agree to pay the reparations or have France invade Haiti and reimpose slavery .
Many Haitians believe that original debt , which Haiti dutifully paid through World War II , committed Haiti to a future of poverty that it has never been able to escape .
( While France , as part of the deal , recognized Haiti ’s sovereignty , slave - owning politicians in the United States , like Thomas Jefferson , refused to recognize the black republic , afraid it would inspire a slave revolt here .
The U.S. withheld formal recognition until 1862 . )
The U.S. Marines occupied Haiti from 1915 until 1934 .
In 1956 , Francois “ Papa Doc ” Duvalier took control in a military coup and declared himself president for life , initiating a period of brutal , bloody dictatorship , with U.S. support .
Papa Doc died in 1971 , at which point his 19 - year - old son , Jean - Claude “ Baby Doc ” Duvalier , took over , maintaining the same violent dictatorial control until he was driven into exile by popular revolt in 1986 .
Jubilee USA , a network calling for elimination of debt owed by poor countries , estimates that Baby Doc alone diverted at least $ 500 million in public funds to his private accounts , and that 45 percent of Haiti ’s debt in recent decades was accumulated during the corrupt reign of the Duvaliers .
Loans from the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the Inter - American Development Bank ( IDB ) imposed “ structural adjustment ” conditions on Haiti , opening its economy to cheap U.S. agricultural products .
Farmers , unable to compete , stopped growing rice and moved to the cities to earn low wages , if they were lucky enough to get one of the scarce sweatshop jobs .
People in the highlands were driven to deforest the hills , converting wood into salable charcoal , which created an ecological crisis — destabilizing hillsides , increasing the destructiveness of earthquakes and causing landslides during the rainy season .
Haiti ’s first democratically elected president was Jean - Bertrand Aristide , a Catholic priest committed to the poor .
He was elected in 1990 , then ousted in a military coup in 1991 .
In 1994 , with Haitian refugees flooding into Florida , the Clinton administration was forced to restore Aristide to power , but only with additional structural - adjustment demands .
Aristide was re-elected in 2000 , only to be deposed again in a U.S. - backed coup in 2004 , Haiti ’s bicentennial .
The destruction of Haiti ’s rice industry , which was replaced with U.S. government - subsidized rice that Haitians refer to as “ Miami rice , ” as well as the sale of critical state - owned enterprises , like Haiti ’s sole flour mill and cement factory , have left the country dependent on foreign trade and aid , keeping Haiti at a permanent disadvantage .
It is critical now to cancel Haiti ’s ongoing foreign debt , so that the country can devote its scant resources to rebuilding and not to repaying debt .
The G - 7 finance ministers met in Canada this week and announced the forgiveness of the bilateral debt between member states and Haiti .
But the World Bank , IMF and IDB debts remain ( the IMF controversially promised a $ 100 million loan after the earthquake , eliciting condemnation , and has since pledged to convert it to a grant ) .
Earthquakes alone do not create disasters of the scale now experienced in Haiti .
The wealthy nations have for too long exploited Haiti , denying it the right to develop in a secure , sovereign , sustainable way .
The global outpouring of support for Haitians must be matched by long - term , unrestricted grants of aid , and immediate forgiveness of all that country ’s debt .
Given their role in Haiti ’s plight , the United States , France and other industrialized nations should be the ones seeking forgiveness .

Apple has been very busy on the mobile front , with the iPad launching in two weeks and iPhone OS and hardware upgrades expected this summer .
However , Apple has n't forgotten about its Mac business — sources for AppleInsider report that long overdue updates to Apple 's Cinema Display and Mac Pro will be also appear by June .
Expected to join the 24 " LED Cinema Display that Apple launched in October of 2008 is a 27 " LED Cinema display based on the same panel currently used in the 27 " iMac .
Issues with the panels caused problems for Apple that resulted in shipping delays for the 27 " iMac , though those problems have been rectified .
The 27 " LED Cinema Display has the same resolution as the current 30 " Cinema Display , though it is 16:9 instead of 16:10 .
Its introduction should finally lay to rest the 30 " model , which has n't been updated in three years .
Apple is also said to be wrapping up an update to its Mac Pro workstation towers , which have only gotten a slight speed bump since they were introduced well over a year ago .
Apple has been waiting for Intel to release new 32nm Xeon parts , codenamed " Westmere - EP , " which were officially launched this week .
These 5600 - series Xeons have six cores compared to the quad - core parts used in current Mac Pros .
The process shrink from 45nm offers a 60 percent performance boost while maintaining the same power requirements of previous Xeons .
A Core i7-980X Extreme Edition processor , codenamed Gulftown , may be used in the lower - end single processor Mac Pro model .
However , there are slight architecture differences between the Core i7 and Xeon variants .
Apple may simply offer a single Xeon option as it does now .
Apple is also dealing with the issue that MacBook Pros have also not been updated in some time , despite the fact that mobile Core i3 , i5 , and i7 parts have been available since January .
The delay may be due at least in part by licensing issues .
These issues have prevented NVIDIA from building integrated controllers , like the 9400 M used in all of Apple 's current portables , for Intel 's newer processors .
However , NVIDIA 's Optimus platform may provide the solution to work around the problem and maintain the MacBook Pro 's seven - hour battery life .
Additional delays may also be caused by constrained supply of Intel 's mobile processors .
Intel is reportedly giving priority to " major clients , " according to sources for DigiTimes , so our hope is that Intel counts Apple on that category .

For the first time ever in a statewide Field Poll , a majority of state voters expressed support for legalizing and taxing marijuana .
A poll released last week showed 56 percent of Californians support legalization .
Earlier this year , Assemblymember Tom Ammiano ( D - San Francisco ) introduced legislation that would tax and regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol .
The Marijuana Control , Regulation , and Education act ( AB 390 ) would create a regulatory structure similar to that used for beer , wine and liquor , permitting taxed sales to adults while barring sales to or possession by those under 21 .
“ With the state in the midst of an historic economic crisis , the move toward regulating and taxing marijuana is simply common sense .
This legislation would generate up to $ 1.3 billion in much needed revenue for the state , restrict access to only those over 21 , end the environmental damage to our public lands from illicit crops , and improve public safety by redirecting law enforcement efforts to more serious crimes , Ammiano said .
“ California has the opportunity to be the first state in the nation to enact a smart , responsible public policy for the control and regulation of marijuana . ”
The poll bolstered the call for legalized marijuana that has stirred since Ammiano introduced his legislation and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the government would no longer raid and prosecute legal marijuana medical dispensaries .
“ One of the most respected research firms in the country has confirmed other recent polls and our sense of the groundswell that followed the introduction of AB 390 by Assemblymember Ammiano , ” said Stephen Gutwillig , California State Director of the Drug Policy Alliance .
“ Californians are ready to end decades of failed and wasteful marijuana prohibition .
Just as we led the nation in the compassionate adoption of medical marijuana , this state will set the standard for common - sense regulation , generating substantial new revenue for California and enhancing public safety . ”
Though Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has said he would not sign legislation legalizing marijuana , the state ’s ongoing billion - dollar fiscal crisis is making the idea of taxing legal marijuana to raise revenue , while reducing the strains of the grossly overcrowded prisons , more worthy of consideration for other legislators and voters .
“ We are seeing a real sea - change in public attitudes ; public opinion has reversed itself ; this year marks the first time that polls have shown a majority for legalization ; the economic crisis is making people question whether it makes sense to spend more money on marijuana prohibition , ” said Dale Gieringer of NORML .
Last month a San Francisco supervisor said the time had come for the city to consider legalization as well .
– Article from The Examiner on May 4 , 2009 .
Larry King sold his suspenders .
Anderson Cooper and Sanjay Gupta saved young Haitians .
And Jessica Yellin made a terrible earthquake - related pun .
Welcome to the strangest night yet of CNN 's unrelenting prime - time Haiti coverage .
CNN has been generally excellent in their Haiti coverage .
While Fox and MSNBC have used the tragedy to pimp their political ideologies and the Today Show 's Ann Curry and Al Roker flew in to be useless for a day , CNN has kept up a steady stream of on - the - ground reports and compelling pictures .
But things got weird tonight as the news / newsmaker barrier was dramatically breached .
On AC360 , Anderson Cooper and Sanjay Gupta played a team of roving superhero reporters , covering the news but only after saving everyone 's lives .
( Imagine if somebody could be Clark Kent and Superman at the same time . )
Here 's a gripping report from Anderson " AC " Cooper on looting , which ends in him picking up a bloodied kid and dragging him to safety .
Then , Sanjay " Doc " Gupta — the brains of the operation — performed aircraft carrier - based neurosurgery on a young girl after no other qualified doctors could be found .
Taking a break from saving lives on the dusty streets , Anderson Cooper turned briefly to America 's petty political squabbles .
The Massachusetts senate race was put into perspective by political correspondent Jessica Yellin , who should probably think twice in the future before trying to get cute with the geological puns :
Anderson , first of all , compared to what you are seeing in Haiti and what people are going through there this does seem insignificant to some extent , and that really does put things in perspective .
That said , I can tell you , here in Massachusetts , this election , what is about to happen tomorrow could be tectonic for American politics .
TOO SOON .
Having dispensed with pretending to care about politics , AC began to berate a wimpy Belgian medical team that abandoned its patients overnight because of " security concerns " .
Said Cooper :
I do think some of these big organizations , plans are made in some other country — back in Geneva or something — and by the time it gets filtered down and the bureaucracy gets involved and there 's a million sheeps involved , days have been wasted , when , you know , you could just get some folks and get out there .
Roll up your sleeves and start doing it .
" Back in Geneva or something ! "
Is Anderson Cooper going rogue ?
AC and The Doc sounded ready to call everything off , bulldoze into the thick of it and turn AC360 into a sort of humanitarian aid reality show .
Meanwhile , back on the home front , actual reality TV star Ryan Seacrest tweeted in the Tweet Suite and Larry King sold his suspenders to Jared Leto during a two - hour telethon called " Haiti : How You Can Help . "
J. Lo , Pete Wentz , Mick Jagger , Benicio Del Toro , Snoop Dog , Ben Stiller and many , many others manned the phones and talked about the Time They Went to Haiti and How Nice and Poor Everyone Was .
( Gawker .
TV's got the lowdown on the absurd show which raised an equally absurd amount of money for the Red Cross . )
This is mostly great .
CNN is doing good !
But there 's also something off - putting about Anderson and Sanjay running around Port - Au - Prince , performing heroics on camera , while Larry King and his buddies from American Idol auction off his suspenders back at home .
( And Campbell Brown looks tearfully on . )
At what point does this go from " CNN's Excellent Haiti Coverage " to " CNN's Excellent Haiti Adventure ? "

Example ?
A teen in Carbondale was busted for bringing some of his dad 's medical marijuana to middle school and selling it to students .
Tony Hershey , deputy district attorney for Colorado's 9th Judicial District , who prosecuted the case , sees the potential for more incidents like this one .
" I 'm concerned that this issue came up , " he says .
" I think this was an unintended consequence of the medical marijuana statute .
That 's how the child got it . "
Not that Hershey tried to make an example of the boy .
Instead of sticking to a distribution and possession charge , he asked for a deferred judgment , and got it .
The boy has since been released from home detention .
Hershey thinks the punishment was appropriate .
" In juvenile court , the purpose is to protect the community while at the same time acting in the best interest of the child , " he says .
" So my major goal was to get services in place that were appropriate for him . "
As medical marijuana becomes more prevalent in Colorado , so do incidents involving MMJ and children .
Earlier this month , we told you about two happenings that occurred within days of each other : an eleven - year - old who shot himself in the foot while guarding his parents ' grow and a baby who had to be hospitalized after ingesting some of his folks ' marijuana edibles .
As for the prospect of additional cases like the one in Carbondale , Hershey says , " I can't predict what 's going to happen -- but I would n't be surprised to see more . "
Neither would anyone else .
After all , this is America .
" If your child is a young man , he does not have to wear a dress or skirt , as there are many time periods where women wore jeans , pants and trousers , " the letter reads .
" However , each child must be able to express what time period their outfit is from .
Most of all , your child should have fun creating their outfit and learning about how women 's clothing has changed ! "

SAN FRANCISCO —
As Google awaits approval of a controversial settlement with authors and book publishers , the company ’s plan to create an immense digital library and bookstore may face yet another hurdle .
On Wednesday , the American Society of Media Photographers and other groups representing visual artists plan to file a class - action lawsuit against Google , asserting that the company ’s efforts to digitize millions of books from libraries amount to large - scale infringement of their copyrights .
The lawsuit , in some respects , mirrors the complaints filed in 2005 by the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers when they first opposed Google ’s library project on copyright grounds .
Those groups have since agreed to a sweeping $ 125 million settlement that , if approved , would allow Google to make available and sell digital copies of millions of out - of - print books .
The settlement would also give authors and publishers new ways to make money from digital copies of their work .
In a statement issued Thursday , Senator Mikulski said : “ One of my hearings revealed that a woman was denied coverage because she had a baby with a medically mandated C-section .
When she tried to get insurance coverage with another company , she was told she had to be sterilized in order to get health insurance .
That will never , ever happen again because of what we did here with health care reform . ”
Peggy Robertson , 41 , who lives in Centennial , Colo. , is the woman to whom Senator Mikulski referred .
Ms. Robertson was interviewed by The New York Times in June 2008 and testified at the hearing last October .
Her husband , a chiropractor , is self - employed , so they rely on the individual market to cover them and their two sons .
In 2007 , they had insurance , but considered switching companies when a broker suggested they might find a better deal .
They applied to a company called Golden Rule , which is based in Indianapolis and owned by UnitedHealthcare .
The company rejected Ms. Robertson because of her Caesarean , explaining in a letter that she would have been eligible if she had been sterilized .
When Ms. Robertson went public with her story , the word “ sterilized ” seemed to provoke particular outrage , she said .
Golden Rule later began offering coverage to women who had had Caesareans , but by charging extra if they wanted maternity coverage , or issuing policies that excluded maternity care .
In a telephone interview on Friday , Ms. Robertson said : “ Barbara Mikulski told me , she promised me , ‘ This will never happen again . ’
She did it .
It ’s wonderful . ”
Ms. Robertson ’s only disappointment was that some of the new rules would not take effect until 2014 .
But Ms. Greenberger said that while it is true that the specific requirements will be delayed until 2014 , some changes should actually happen much sooner , because the law ’s overarching ban on sex discrimination takes effect immediately .
The legalese outlawing sex discrimination is not easy to find or to parse , but it refers to existing laws , like the Civil Rights Act and Title IX , to say that the same protections apply to people seeking health care and insurance .
One of the world 's leading economists has urged Gordon Brown to reject " fiscal fetishism " , defy the markets and maintain , or even extend , the fiscal stimulus of the British economy .
Joseph Stiglitz , who won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2001 and has served as chief economic adviser to President Clinton and chief economist at the World Bank , warned that the financial markets were like a " crazy man " that could not be appeased with cuts to public spending .
" You 're dealing with a crazy man .
You 're asking what I can do to placate a crazy man ?
Having got what he wants he will still kill you , " he said .
In an exclusive interview with The Independent , Mr Stiglitz rejected the idea , put forward by David Cameron , that some symbolic trimming of the budget deficit in the current year might regain the confidence of the financial markets .
He also said that it was " unconscionable " for the ratings agencies to threaten to downgrade Britain 's creditworthiness , given their poor record in the crisis .
" Fiscal fetishism is really dangerous , " he said .
If the financial markets refused to buy British government bonds , or gilts , as Mr Cameron has suggested they soon might , the Bank of England could buy them instead , Mr Stiglitz said , as it did during its recently paused programme of quantitative easing , which mopped up about £ 200 bn of gilts .
His intervention adds to the growing criticism of Mr Cameron 's economic policy and will be seized on by Gordon Brown as evidence that Labour 's policies are being backed by the world 's leading economists .
Mr Stiglitz said that Mr Brown should make plans for how he might administer a further boost to the economy , in case the economic recovery proved to be even slower .
" The likelihood is of a marked slowdown from current growth , which is very weak , " he said .
" Whether that means negative territory or stagnation will depend on what the Government does .
If there is a premature withdrawal of stimulus it is more likely that there will be a ' double dip ' . "
He added : " You want to show a sensitivity towards the deficit but also sensitivity towards the timing [ of a withdrawal of stimulus ] , and the fact is that recovery is not robust . "
Mr Stiglitz said that European governments should offer the Greeks and other economies currently " under attack " much more support , to help restore confidence in their efforts to restore stability and help prevent the financial crisis spreading .
Mr Cameron has argued that comparatively small , but immediate reductions in public spending and the budget deficit , perhaps as small as £ 1bn out of a total deficit of around £ 175bn , could persuade the markets that an incoming Conservative government was getting the public finances under control .
Mr Stiglitz however , stressed the continuing threats to recovery .
The UK has emerged more slowly and more feebly than any other advanced economy from recession , and must be presumed to be the nation most at risk of a relapse into recession .
Mr Stiglitz , who dined with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor yesterday evening , said that the current Obama plan to break up the banks and restrict their ability to undertake proprietary trading – that is , trading on their own accounts – " does n't go far enough " .
He criticised the US President for " muddling through " his response to the financial crisis , but said he was encouraged by the most recent developments in reforming regulation .
However Mr Obama wants to extend the scope of US financial regulation both in the US and abroad to encompass the types of securities that are traded .
Some especially complicated securities – which the boards of the banks that issued them famously could n't understand – were held to be partly at fault for spreading and escalating the scale of losses seen during the credit crunch .
The boost to the US economy from President Obama 's near $ 800 bn package of tax breaks and public spending plans was also criticised by Mr Stiglitz for taking insufficient account of the decline in spending by individual states , which he argues has negated much of the federal initiative .
' Bizarre ' disappearance ... Australian nuclear scientist Lachlan Cranswick has vanished without trace in Canada .
‘‘ Every bit of information that we have received has been followed up on .
We ’re at the stage now where we have no new information , we have no leads , no tips and no explanations whatsoever , ’’ lead investigator Darin Faris , of the Deep River Police Service , said .
Mr Cranswick moved to Deep River , a town of 4200 people , to start work at the facility seven years ago .
The reactor , which was used in the Manhattan Project during World War II and is home to about 2700 employees , is both a research site and production centre for medical radioisotopes .
On the question of foul play , Officer Faris said a thorough search of Mr Cranswick ’s computer records , storage devices , laptop and house uncovered ‘‘ nothing that points to him either looking at suicide or anybody that would like to do harm to him ’’ .
‘‘ This guy ’s got more [ gigabytes ] of storage device than anybody I ’ve ever seen and we found nothing ... [ W ] e’ve got no evidence that he wanted to take his own life or somebody wanted to take it for him , ’’ he said .
‘‘ If he went out in thick pair of boots , a heavy coat , fur hat and probably gloves and was hit by a car on the street and you wanted to take the body , would you be smart enough to think , ‘ Oh my god , I ’ve got to get him out of here ’ , and look for the hat that came off his head or the boots that came off his feet ?
It ’s highly unlikely you ’d look for the hat .
‘‘ Or if you ’re in the bush and the wolves and coyotes got to you and physically ate you , they ’re not going to eat your coat or your boots .
‘‘ We found nothing .
We did n’t find a hat .
We did n’t find a glove .
We did n’t find boots .
We found nothing .
That ’s the part that ’s puzzling us . ’’
Chris Knight , president of the Deep River Curling and Squash Club and the person who found Mr Cranswick was missing , said the scientist was a committed , long - term member of the club executive .
He said he and Mr Cranswick had been in close contact over many years and there was nothing in his recent behaviour or frame of mind that foreshadowed his disappearance .
‘‘ That ’s the part that really mystifies all of us who knew him well , ’’ Mr Knight told .
‘‘ There were no signs that there was anything strange going on or that he was n’t up to the tasks that he normally performed . ’’
He said Mr Cranswick worked at a function at the curling club the weekend before his disappearance and emailed Mr Knight the following day to say everything went well .
He then deposited the money in the bank on Monday , but failed to show up for a curling meeting at the end of the week .
‘‘ That ’s when I went to the house to find it unlocked and nobody there .
I then rang the police , ’’ Mr Knight said .
‘‘ I went out on a snowmobile on that first night to look along ski trails and there were just no signs .
In fact , police brought in sniffer dogs to try and find the scent and they did n’t come up with anything either . ’’
Rupert Cranswick , Lachlan ’s Melbourne - based brother , spent two weeks in Deep River speaking to residents and claims police wasted time searching the surrounding forests and ski trails .
He said Mr Cranswick , who was last seen on Monday , January 18 , after taking the company bus back into town and then walking home , would never have gone hiking at night during winter .
His car was still in the garage , his keys , wallet and passport had not been stolen , nor was his home disturbed .
" It just looks like he went to put out his bins and he vanished from there , " Rupert said .
" I talked to lots of the locals there and they think something extraordinary happened to him .
" He loved his work .
He lived for his work there .
He loved it so much he did n’t want to come back to Australia .
‘‘ It ’s just such a strange thing .
It ’s like he ’s been taken off the planet . ’’
However , Mr Knight said it was not unusual for Mr Cranswick to be out of contact for a number of days , adding that the reactor where he worked was being repaired .

‘‘ With the reactor down , it ’s not unusual for those guys to take a few days off and do other things .
I understand he had vacation leave and needed to use some up . ’’

The Government has been having high - level discussions on introducing internet blocking , writes KARLIN LILLINGTON
THE GOVERNMENT has had extensive private discussions on introducing internet blocking – barring access to websites or domains – according to material obtained under a Freedom of Information ( FOI ) request .
The approach is used by some internet service providers ( ISPs ) and mobile network operators to block access to child pornography .
But increasingly , governments and law enforcement agencies are pushing for much broader use , ranging from blocking filesharing sites to trying to tackle cybercrime and terrorism .
Critics say internet blocking creates many problems with little real effect on illegal activity .
For example , internet users and businesses have complained about the side - effects of domain blocking , where barring access to domains can shut down hundreds of personal and business websites as well as e-mail addresses associated with them .
The exact nature of the Government discussions cannot be determined as many of the requests for key documents were refused by the Department of Justice .
However , the ongoing high level of discussion on the subject is indicated in the detailed description of each refused item in the list of materials returned by the department .
The FOI request , made by privacy advocate Digital Rights Ireland and seen by The Irish Times , contains eight pages of listed documents .
One refused item details a June 2009 meeting between the department and Vodafone on the “ introduction of internet filtering in Ireland ” .
Another is an e-mail from mobile operator 3 listing filter technologies it is using .
Another refused item details minutes of a meeting between the Office for Internet Safety and the Garda “ re proposed introduction of blocking technology ” .
Discussions on the international use of blocking and on proposed European legislation were also refused .
Possible interest in the wider use of such technologies is indicated by a refused document in which an e-mail and note on blocking child pornography sites was forwarded to the official in the Department of Justice in charge of casino gaming regulation .
Proponents of internet blocking argue that it removes offensive and illegal material from the internet and can make it more difficult for child pornographers and their customers to operate .
But critics say it is a blunt instrument that does little to combat pornography or other activities , while causing headaches for networks and ISPs .
It can also cause inconvenience and costly disruptions to service for innocent companies and individuals if their websites , internet access and e-mail get cut off .
Paul Durrant of the Internet Service Providers ’ Association of Ireland says blocking brings cost burdens for service providers and is not particularly effective .
He also says it often means many legitimate websites are barred .
Often , website operators are not informed that their site is on a blacklist and may be unaware that millions are denied access to it .
ISPs also object to taking on the role of policing illegal filesharing .
Internationally , ISPs claim they are under increasing pressure from copyright holders and law enforcement agencies to bring in blocking software to do this .
“ It gets very difficult to judge what is illegal and this kind of blocking would be problematic to implement , ” says Durrant .
“ The Government really needs to put clear laws in place if it wants to do this . ”
Durrant adds that blocking “ stifles a free and open internet ” – a concern for national and international “ smart - economy ” businesses – and could affect inward investment and the ability of Irish businesses to operate effectively .
Existing evidence indicates that blocking is a clumsy approach and amounts to censorship , says TJ McIntyre , a barrister , UCD law lecturer and chairman of Digital Rights Ireland .
He is concerned about the indications from his FOI request that blocking could be brought in on a national level .
McIntyre has written a paper arguing that increasing pressure on network providers and ISPs to act as third - party “ gatekeepers ” , often in a “ voluntary ” fashion , allows for unaccountable control of internet users and usage .
“ Blocking involves censorship taken on no legal basis .
There is no judge , no jury and no right to be heard if you are blocked , ” says McIntyre .
“ The chances are it also will be used in unaccountable ways by unaccountable organisations . ”
He adds : “ If you want to stop people accessing certain material , the thing to do is to legislate for that . ”

While trying to defend Arizona ’s new immigration law , Rush Limbaugh claimed that the Arizona bill is not as big a usurpation of power as Barack Obama ’s plans to take away salt .
Of course , Obama is n’t really trying to take away anyone ’s salt , but this did n’t stop Limbaugh from comparing a policy of discrimination to FDA warnings about the amount of salt in processed food .
Media Matters :
Limbaugh said , “ But notice here all this outrage over Arizona ’s abuse of power , right , now , notice how the Democrats , the regime , the media , the Left are calling Arizona ’s new immigration bill an outrageous usurpation of power .
Meanwhile , that same regime is moving to take away our salt , our light bulbs , reaching down into every nook and cranny of our lives and they do n’t bat an eye , and yet they have the audacity to accuse Arizona ’s immigration bill of being an outrageous usurpation of power . ”

Much like every single one of Limbaugh ’s crazy claims , the salt story does n’t hold up .
Obama is not trying to take away salt .
What the FDA is considering is issuing a warning about the high amounts of sodium in processed and restaurant food .
According to the FDA , 77 % of the sodium intake for all Americans comes from restaurant and processed food .
However , in the hands of the serial propagandists known as the right wing media , an FDA warning became , Obama is going to take away your salt .
Rush ’s minimal grasp on sanity allowed him to connect an immigration policy which discriminates against legal residents of a state to a right wing conspiracy talking point that has no truth to it .
Limbaugh does not seem to understand that an FDA warning about too much salt is not in the same ball park as legalized discrimination .
His evidence that Obama is running a totalitarian regime is limited to warnings about salt , and the promotion of energy efficient light bulbs .
This is in comparison to the Bush administration , which secretly spied on American citizens , bribed members of the free press to push their propaganda , ran secret prisons , tortured , and destroyed the Department of Justice .
Add to all of this a racist Republican pushed Arizona immigration policy , and it is easy to see who the real totalitarians are here .
The people who do n’t respect the Constitution are n’t Barack Obama and the Democratic Party .
They are Rush Limbaugh and those like him for whom the Constitution is meaningless .
In December , a state court in Montana found that it was not illegal for physicians to prescribe lethal medication to terminally ill patients in certain situations .
But the ruling did not provide the state - regulatory mechanisms put into place in Washington and Oregon , and Montana officials said it was unclear whether physicians there had been prescribing lethal medications .
The issue is also prominent in some other states .
Physicians in Connecticut have filed a lawsuit seeking to have the courts clarify whether the law there allows them to prescribe lethal drugs to terminal patients .
And lawmakers in Massachusetts are considering a measure supporting physician - assisted suicide , but its sensitivity has also made for strong opposition , particularly among religious groups .
Most patients who died under the law in Washington last year had cancer .
Prescribing doctors , who must submit forms to the State Department of Health about patients who received the medication , said all who died cited “ loss of autonomy ” as a reason for seeking it .
Most also said they could no longer enjoy life and feared losing “ dignity . ”
Ten patients said they were concerned about being a burden on their family and friends , 11 cited pain and one said finances were an issue .
Critics of the law have said it could prompt disproportionate use by lower - income people .
Almost all of those who died in Washington said they had private insurance , Medicare , Medicaid or some combination .
None said they had no insurance at all , though coverage was listed as unknown for five people .
Most died within 90 minutes of taking the medicine , though at least one person lived for 28 hours .
Two woke up after taking the medicine , then died later .
Great Source of Learning
Many organizations have been using mobile games as an educational tool for it can easily capture attention .
These are applicable for the children who are inevitably disturbed due to their surroundings and natural behavior .
Simple yet entertaining video games that are incorporated with academic learnings and moral lessons would definitely catch their attention and they will surely focused on the entire game .
As they will be engaged in the overall process of the game , learning would be so more convenient and time efficient .

In part with the challenges included in the games , rules and restrictions are made to create scope and limits .
This would not only help in emphasizing and narrowing the objective of the game , but it ’ll also encourage the player to follow , memorize and maintain their memory while being on the game .
The instructions will leave you no choice but to focus on the problem and remember your limits and abilities .
Visual , audial as well as physical senses are also being tested throughout the game .
Such games discipline the mind , which may in turn help teach core values and adherence to instructions and rules
Two 1.9 million - year - old skeletons found in a South African cave have added a new and intriguing member to the primate family .
Dubbed Australopithecus sediba , it has many features — including long legs and a protruding nose — common to Homo , the genus that eventually spawned humans .
Other features , such as extra-long forearms and flexible feet , date from deep in our primate past .
Paleontologists disagree over whether A. sediba is a direct human ancestor , or just looks like one .
But whatever their lineage , the fossils provide rare insight into a period shrouded in paleontological mystery .
" We feel that A. sediba might be a Rosetta Stone for defining for the first time what the genus Homo is , " said paleontologist Lee Berger of the University of Witwatersrand .
" They 're going to be a remarkable window , a time machine . "
The skeletons , described April 8 in Science , were found — with a bit of help from Google Earth — two years ago in a South African cave , where they fell two million years ago .
On one side of that date in the fossil timeline are the various species of Australopithecus , the first great apes to walk on two feet .
On the timeline 's other side is the genus Homo , the first creatures one would recognize — with all due respect to Lucy 's famous A. afarensis — as close to human .
In between is uncertainty .
The fossil record is mostly bare .
Some of the Australopithecus lineage split , with one branch becoming Homo .
But the identity of that lineage , and the characteristics of early Homo , are unknown .
According to Berger 's team , A. sediba 's combination of old and new features make it a likely descendant of A. africanus — one of Lucy 's direct descendants — and either a direct ancestor of early Homo and ultimately us , or what Berger calls " a very close side branch . "
" It sits at a very critical moment in time , " said Berger .
It " fills a critical gap in the line . "
Other paleontologists say Berger 's fossils are a marvelous find .
But as expected in a field where entire fossil records spanning millions of years could fit on a coffee table , and where the mostly missing A. sediba skeletons are considered remarkably complete , the new hominid 's taxonomical position is being interpreted in many different ways .
While the Australopithecus designation is correct , " the proposed link between A. sediba and early Homo is forced and tenuous at best , " said William Jungers , a Stony Brook University paleoanthropologist .
He does n't consider a juvenile specimen — the most complete of the two skeletons comes from the human equivalent of a teenager — a reliable indicator of adult features .
To this criticism , Berger said the teen 's brain had " clearly reached about 95 to 98 percent of adult capacity . "
Few changes would be expected in its cranial size and shape , which are critical in characterizing a primate species .
Jungers also noted that the first Homo fossils predate A. sediba by 500,000 years , while Homo ergaster had reached western Asia just 200,000 years after A. sediba 's known date .
Both these figures suggest that Homo was established well before A. sediba came along , said Rick Potts , curator of anthropology at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History .
" The connection with the origin of Homo does n't seem to hold much water , " said Potts , and the confluence of some A. sediba traits with Homo is just coincidence .
" Evolution produces a universe of features that are combined and recombined , " he said .
According to Berger , however , A. sediba may have older roots than they think .
" The site we found is simply a point in time .
It does n't represent the first appearance of this species , " he said .
Meanwhile , Arizona State University paleoanthropologist William Kimbel argued that A. sediba should have been classified as Homo , though it may not have been a direct human ancestor .
" In my way of thinking , it belongs in Homo because of the brow ridge , the face , the pelvis , " he said .
" It 's true that it has the small brain and long upper limbs indicative of Australopithecus , but those are signs of its ancestry , not its future . "
These arguments may be settled as more A. sediba skeletons emerge .
Berger is currently assembling at least two .
However , taxonomic debates may ultimately prove less important than the questions A. sediba provokes .
Already the fossils suggest that Australopithecus did n't morph suddenly into Homo , but adapted in gradual , piecemeal fashion .
What pressures led to these adaptations – and their relationship to tool use , cognitive developments , dietary shifts and climate changes – have yet to be determined .
" The significance is in the patterns and insights it provides , " said Kimbel .
" These specimens fall at the young end of a very puzzling million - year period in hominin evolution . "
Whether or not A. sediba is our ancestor , " it could help us understand the dynamics that led to the split producing the lineage culminating ultimately in us , " said Kimbel .

Colleagues of ten American Baptist missionaries arrested for child trafficking in Haiti say it ’s all a big misunderstanding , but the Haitian government is n’t mincing words on the issue .
“ For me , it ’s not Americans that were arrested , it was kidnappers , ” said Haitian Prime Minister Jean - Max Bellerive .
Ten Americans , five men and five women , were arrested Friday as they attempted to leave Haiti and enter the Dominican Republic with 33 children they say are orphans who need help in the wake of the January 12 earthquake .
But ABC
News reports that some of the children say they ’re not orphans at all , and have provided the names and addresses of their parents .

The children range in age from two months to 12 years old .
Yves Christallin , Haiti ’s social affairs and labor minister , said the Americans are suspected of being part of an illegal adoption scheme .
Five of the missionaries belong to the Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian , Idaho .
On its
Web site , the church states that the missionaries were “ falsely arrested ” as they attempted to take orphans from a number of orphanages that were damaged in the quake .
Speaking on ABC ’s Good Morning America , the church ’s pastor , Rev. Clint Henry , said he knew nothing of the allegations that some of the children were n’t orphans .
“ The last that I knew is that we were working with a pastor who was dealing with an orphanage there .
…
The stories I ’m hearing from the [ children ] themselves are just as much a surprise to me as anyone else , ” Henry said .

The question of whether the University of California at Berkeley should divest funds from companies that do business in Israel has gone viral and international .
The latest celebrity to weigh in on the controversial issue is former Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa .
He wrote a letter urging the ASUC Senate to overturn its president ’s veto of a bill that called for the divestment of companies that allegedly help repress Palestinians .
The Senate is scheduled to take a vote on that bill on Wednesday .
“ It was with great joy that I learned of your recent 16 - 4 vote in support of divesting your university ’s money from companies that enable and profit from the injustice of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and violation of Palestinian human rights ”
Tutu wrote in a letter that was published in the Oregon Salem News .
“ Principled stands like this , supported by a fast growing number of US civil society organizations and people of conscience , including prominent Jewish groups , are essential for a better world in the making , and it is always an inspiration when young people lead the way and speak truth to power . ”
Naomi Klein , the author of the international bestseller , The Shock Doctrine , also wrote an open letter in The Nation magazine supporting the divestment .
There have also been numerous people speaking out against the bill , but none with the star power of Tutu , who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his fight to end South Africa ’s apartheid system .
Pro-Israel supporters have send thousands of e-mails to the office of Chancellor Robert Birgeneau as well as to various ASUC senators .
“ Resolutions like this are not designed to promote peace between a Jewish state and its Arab neighbors , ” Dr. Michael Harris , one of the founders of StandWithUs / S.F.
Voice for Israel , told the J , the Jewish weekly newspaper of Northern California .
“ They are designed to promote the elimination of a Jewish state .
That is the real heart of the issue . ”
A representative of AIPAC , the American - Israel Public Affairs Committee , called for its supporters to speak out against the bill and then vowed to get pro-Israel students elected as ASUC senators .
Some people have characterized that as a call by AIPAC to ‘ take over ” the student government , creating an even more heated environment for the discussion .
The Senate will meet at 7 pm Wednesday in its chambers in Eshelman Hall .
Hundreds of people , both for and against the measure , are expected to attend .

Applications Successful launch for ESA ’s CryoSat - 2 ice satellite
08/04/2010 1782 views 0 likes
ESA PR 07-2010 .
Europe 's first mission dedicated to studying the Earth ’s ice was launched today from Kazakhstan .
From its polar orbit , CryoSat - 2 will send back data leading to new insights into how ice is responding to climate change and the role it plays in our ' Earth system ' .
The CryoSat - 2 satellite was launched at 15:57 CEST ( 13:57 UTC ) on a Dnepr rocket provided by the International Space Company Kosmotras from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan .
The signal confirming that it had separated from the launcher came 17 minutes later from the Malindi ground station in Kenya .
CryoSat - 2 replaces the original CryoSat satellite that was lost in 2005 owing to a launch failure .
The mission objectives , however , remain the same : to measure changes in the thickness of the vast ice sheets that overlie Antarctica and Greenland , as well as variations in the thickness of the relatively thin ice floating in the polar oceans .
Successful launch for ESA ’s CryoSat - 2 ice mission " We know from our radar satellites that sea ice extent is diminishing , but there is still an urgent need to understand how the volume of ice is changing , " said Volker Liebig , ESA ’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes .
" To make these calculations , scientists also need information on ice thickness , which is exactly what our new CryoSat satellite will provide .
We are now very much looking forward to receiving the first data from the mission . "
The launch of CryoSat - 2 marks a significant achievement for ESA 's Earth observation programme and brings to three the number of its Earth Explorer satellites placed in orbit , all having been launched within a little over 12 months .
CryoSat - 2 follows on from the Gravity field and steady - state Ocean Circulation Explorer ( GOCE ) mission , launched in March 2009 , and the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity ( SMOS ) mission , launched last November .
Earth Explorers are launched in direct response to issues identified by the scientific community and aim to improve our understanding of how the Earth system works and the effect that human activity is having on natural processes .
CryoSat measuring sea ice
In response to this need , CryoSat - 2 is carrying the first radar altimeter of its kind to overcome the difficulties of measuring icy surfaces .
Its primary payload , the sophisticated SAR / Interferometric Radar Altimeter ( SIRAL ) , was developed by Thales Alenia Space to measure the thickness of ice floating in the oceans and monitor changes in the ice sheets on land , particularly around the edges where icebergs are calved .
The CryoSat - 2 satellite was built by a consortium led by EADS Astrium .
The satellite is in a polar orbit , reaching latitudes of 88° .
This is closer to the poles than earlier Earth observation satellites , resulting in an additional area of about 4.6 million sq km being covered .
This extra coverage amounts to an area larger than all 27 European Union member states put together .
The combination of the technology onboard and a polar orbit will provide evidence to further our understanding of the relationship between ice and climate .
Now that CryoSat - 2 is safely in orbit , the Mission Control Team at ESA 's European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt , Germany is busy with the critical ' Launch and Early Operations Phase ' .
The Q&As keep rolling in .

Attendance at the festival has grown year after year ( Photos : Haris Kuttipuram )
By John Mary
Trivandrum , Kerala
India 's southern state of Kerala may have hosted the largest gathering of women ever seen on the planet .
Clad in traditional Kerala saris and bearing offerings of food , more than two million women - perhaps more - thronged the state capital Trivandrum on Sunday .
The women braved searing heat to offer a special meal at the Attukal temple to Hindu goddess Bhagavathy - one incarnation of the potent goddesses Kali and Saraswati .
Women howled shrilly , as is the custom at the culmination of this 10 - day annual event , and they joined the chief priest in offering their earthenware pots overflowing with rice and jaggery - an unrefined sugar - to the presiding goddess .
They were seeking her blessing for the health and prosperity of their families - and the special meal , known as the pongala , was later distributed among family and friends back at home .
Aerial count Women howl shrilly as they make their offering
This is a unique festival the size of which is unmatched - the congregation at Attukal temple has grown exponentially over the years .
Such festivities used to be modest affairs and the annual gathering was confined to the temple premises until about 25 years ago .
But once families associated with the temple formed a trust , the festival became more organised , there was more publicity and it attracted women from across the state and even foreign countries .
Guinness Worlds Records certified the crowd strength was 1.5 million when it was assessed for the first time in 1997 .
Last year turnout was 2.5 million and this year , according to festival organisers , it was estimated to be 3 million .
Attukal Bhagavathy Temple Trust secretary KP Ramachandran
Nair says that from next year an agency associated with the National Geographic channel will conduct aerial surveys for a more scientific headcount .
It is an elaborate logistical feat : almost 3,000 police , 600 of them women , were on duty around the clock .
Two hundred priests positioned themselves at different points to sprinkle holy water on the pongala .
Fifty portable toilets were also provided .
Tearful devotees
At Sunday 's mass offering , the ceremonial cooking began at 1015 local time ( 0445 GMT ) .
The chief priest lit up the main hearth in front of the temple .
There is nothing like this anywhere else in the world .
It is amazing the way a whole city makes arrangements for women to make this offering
Diane Jennet , devotee Smoke billowed from hundreds of thousands of temporary hearths and hung above the city .
Tearful women swayed to the chanting of mantras , invoking the blessing of the goddess until next year 's festival .
Popular Malayalam television actress Chippi was also present : " I 've lost count of the number of times I 've participated in the pongala festival .
" And why I do it is because I am sure Attukalamma [ the mother goddess ] will take care of me and family till I come back next year . "
Not everyone manages to make their offering close to the temple : many had to set up hearth wherever they could .
People who live near the temple host dozens of women to cook the pongala .
One retired professor of English , MS Hema , hosted more than 100 friends and relatives at her home .
The size of the women 's festival is unmatched Among her guests was Dianne Jennet , who has been coming every year since 1997 from San Francisco .
The collective spirituality she observed in female devotees at Attukal became the subject of of her PhD dissertation back in the United States .
" It 's difficult to explain .
I just develop this desire to make the journey every year .
Pongala is all about community , devotion and equality .
" There is nothing like this anywhere else in the world .
It is amazing the way a whole city makes arrangements for women to make this offering .
Nobody could imagine shutting down San Francisco for a day , blocking the vehicles for a women 's gathering , " she said .
The legend goes that Bhagavathy once visited the spot where the temple stands today on the banks of the Killiyar river .
The goddess , in the guise of a girl , sought the help of the head of a local family to cross the river .
He helped her - but she vanished soon after .
In the ancient religious texts , Bhagavathy is said to annihilate evil and protects the good in this world - she grants every wish of her devotees .
This is also the fervent hope of the women who come year on year .
At the end of the ceremony a small plane hovered above the masses showering flowers .
It was the end to a tiring but spiritually nourishing session .
Devotees picked up their belongings and boarded buses and trains to head home .

Make patents , not software
Summary :
The latest developments which involve Apple ’s and Microsoft ’s agenda , with patents that help marginalise Free software
Apple ’s anti-Android / Linux lawsuit [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] is supported by Microsoft [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , which keeps suggesting that that there might be more lawsuits on their way .
The proprietary software giants use software patents against the common idealogical enemy , GNU / Linux .
The Register says that battle lines are drawn in Apple - Google warfare and Microsoft ’s booster Brier Dudley says that Microsoft is getting closer to Apple .
This is Dudley ’s second article on this subject this month .
“ Road map for you , ” writes Pamela Jones in relation to the latter among his articles , “ proprietary closed v. open source , aka old v. new . ”
Yes , Apple is the old .
It insists on primitive devices , as we last showed yesterday .
It makes technology that disables rather than enables .
Yesterday we wrote about Apple ’s " mobile social networking " patent ( same post as above ) and now we find this :
Google , Apple and Microsoft Target Social Media [...]
Apple , Google and Microsoft are desperate to find a place in this market and are trying to enhance their social networking position in various ways .
Social networking is important to them also because of AstroTurfing , which both companies ( Apple and Microsoft at least ) refer to as “ evangelism ” .
They are paying outside agencies to have people leave comments in social networks .
Apple uses fake hype and fake " leaks " and Microsoft follows these footsteps .
We have covered many examples of fake Microsoft “ leaks ” in recent months .
“ Microsoft wanted to become a patent licensing company rather than a software company because the landscape had changed and Microsoft could not quite compete based on cost anymore .
” Apple and Microsoft are both pursuing a strategy whereby patents — not software — are sold as a product .
Microsoft 's patent troll Nathan Myhrvold ( who receives investments also from Apple ) said that “ intellectual property is the next software . ”
That ’s just their vision of the software industry .
By “ intellectual property ” he means software patents , not copyrights .
As we showed last week , he continues to extort businesses secretly and Microsoft sells access to its patent portfolio as though “ protection money ” is merchandise now .
We repeatedly warned about this in 2007 .
Microsoft wanted to become a patent licensing company rather than a software company because the landscape had changed and Microsoft could not quite compete based on cost anymore .
“ Google , Microsoft , [ and ] Yahoo [ Are ] Granted Similar Patents , ” argues this article .
There is just too much room for overlap in software patents , which makes it a nightmare to write programs ( either Free or proprietary ) .
Three patents granted Tuesday to Google , Microsoft and Yahoo describe how each search engine might take a close look at page addresses , or URLs on dynamic Web sites , which can often include large amounts of information , Bill Slawski tells us .
This whole game is just a matter of throwing money at filing of papers and paying lawyers to claim credit for unclaimed algorithms ( never mind prior art , as Microsoft has an internal policy of never looking at patents when implementing something , either ) .
“ Patents are strategy of filing , not inventing .
” Seattle ’s Microsoft boosters are raving about meaningless numbers of patents [ 1 , 2 ] and use these to glorify their beloved monopolist that uses racketeering [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] to compete against superior software such as GNU / Linux .
Microsoft ’s booster Preston Gralla [ 1 , 2 ] deliberately misleads by equating patents to “ invention ” .
There is similar praise from patent lawyers / maximalists at IAM , who are repeating the same tired old myths
Microsoft ’s entire history is one of taking other people 's ideas , shamelessly copying them without admission .
Patents are strategy of filing , not inventing .
Here is a biased new poll from Microsoft Nick and the Microsoft fans who read his blog that he runs at the moment ( it passes from hand to hand ) .
He asks : “ Does Microsoft respect others ’ intellectual property ? ”
Given the obvious bias of this population of readers over there ( Microsoft blog in Seattle ) , the answers will be meaningless and cannot be extrapolated .
If one looks for an example that the Seattle ‘ press ’ reports PR and spin , this new example is it [ 1 , 2 ] .
Microsoft is increasingly resorting to patents as a business strategy and this is actually a sign of weakness , meaning the products are not strong enough to stand on their own .
Someone should tell David Kappos that his patent system is being used to suppress software development rather than promote any .
Here is the next chance to speak to him ( New York Law School ) .
“ What do they [ Microsoft ] care if you can view the code , so long as you have to pay them for the patents ? ”
– Pamela Jones , Groklaw Despite Microsoft ’s patent war against Free software , IDG ’s Microsoft - boosting corner keeps spinning it as though Microsoft is playing “ nice ” with F / OSS .
What utter nonsense .
Referring to this article which quotes Microsoft ’s McKee as saying that he feels “ strongly that Microsoft ’s success has been based on the fact that we can run a lot of diverse technologies on the Microsoft platform including open source , ” Pamela Jones writes in Groklaw : “ See ? Just like Ballmer said .
They want Open Source apps to run on Windows instead of on Linux .
It ’s just a teensy bit evil , in Microsoft usual style .
They ’ll play nice , until they feel they can destroy Linux with patents .
What do they care if you can view the code , so long as you have to pay them for the patents ? ”
The other day we wrote about Microsoft 's very active lobby for software patents in Europe .
One knowledgeable source tells that “ it is interesting that the Irish commissioner continues the pro-patent “ saga ” of her precedent McCreevy .
Luckily from a much powerless DG than Internal Market .
“ It seems that the Ireland Gov. continues working for Microsoft as in previous legislature usually . ”
In relation to Microsoft ’s announcement about hardware - accelerated HTML5 , Jones wrote : “ I gather they want to be on the iPhone and iPad .
And their definition of “ interoperability ” is you can use their stuff easier , which matches the goal Steve Ballmer set for “ Open Source ” , that it all run on Windows instead of the Linux kernel . ” █
“ I would love to see all open source innovation happen on top of Windows . ”
– Steve Ballmer , Microsoft CEO
“ It puts the Linux phenomenon and the Unix phenomenon at the top of the list . ”
– Steve Ballmer

In findings sure to gladden the heart of anyone who 's ever wondered whether tiny acts of kindness have larger consequences , researchers have shown that generosity is contagious .
Goodness spurs goodness , they found : A single act can influence dozens more .
In a game where selfishness made more sense than cooperation , acts of giving were " tripled over the course of the experiment by other subjects who are directly or indirectly influenced to contribute more , " wrote political scientist James Fowler of the University of California , San Diego , and medical sociologist Nicholas Christakis of Harvard University .
Their findings , published March 8 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , are the latest in a series of studies the pair have conducted on the spread of behaviors through social networks .
In other papers , they 've described the spread of obesity , loneliness , happiness and smoking .
But there was no way to know whether those apparent behavioral contagions were actually just correlations .
People who are overweight , for example , might simply tend to befriend other overweight people , or live in an area where high - fat , low - nutrient diets are the norm .
The latest research was designed to identify cause - and - effect links .
In it , Fowler and Christakis analyze the results of a so - called public - goods game , in which people were divided into groups of four , given 20 credits each , and asked to secretly decide what to keep for themselves and what to contribute to a common fund .
That fund would be multiplied by two - fifths , then divided equally among the group .
The best payoff would come if everyone gave all their money — but without knowing what others were doing , it always made sense to keep one 's money and skim from the generosity of others .
Only at the end of each game did players find out what the rest of their group had done .
The game was run again and again , each time mixing group members and keeping their identities anonymous , so that decisions were never personal .
When one person gave , others in their group tended to be generous during the next two rounds of play .
Recipients of their largess became more generous in turn , and so on down the chain .
When a punishment round was added — players could spend their own money to reduce the rewards of selfish players — generosity lasted even longer .
" It is often supposed that individuals in experiments like the one described here selfishly seek to maximize their own payoffs , " wrote Fowler and Christakis .
" The equilibrium prediction is to contribute nothing and to pay nothing to punish noncontributors , but the subjects did not follow this pattern . "
According to the the researchers , the explanation lies not in calculations of odds and rewards , but in simple behavioral mimicry : Monkey see , monkey do , human style .
When people are irrationally generous , others follow suit .
The network described by Fowler and Christakis does n't necessarily replicate natural group dynamics , but suggests a general model for how behaviors spread .
They suggest that researchers of altruism and cultural evolution study how different group configurations promote or limit the spread of behaviors .
However , the findings are n't just a feel - good story .
Selfish behavior spreads easily , too .

Introduction
Earlier this week I was drawn into an enlightening discussion with my colleague Ben Frey about the complicated textual tradition that lies behind George Lucas ’s “ Star Wars , ” which few outside the scholarly community realize is a modern rendition of an old Germanic legend of a fatal conflict between a father and his treacherous son .
Below I present some remarks on the Old Icelandic version of the legend , with some spare comparative notes on the cognate traditions in other old Germanic languages .
The story as presented in George Lucas ’s films represents only one manuscript tradition , and a rather late and corrupt one at that – the Middle High German epic called Himelgengærelied ( Song of the Skywalkers ) .
There is also an Old High German palimpsest known to scholars , later overwritten by a Latin choral and only partly legible to us today , which contains fragments of a version wherein “ Veitare ” survives to old age after slaying “ Lûc ” out of loyalty to the emperor , but is naturally still conflicted about the deed when the son of his daughter Leia avenges the killing on him .
This is also the ending that we infer for the Icelandic Tattúínárdǿla saga ( the Saga of the People of the Tattúín River Valley ) , though unfortunately the ending of that saga is lost and has to be reconstructed from the scant remains of the Old High German poem and from references in other sagas ( it should be noted that the later chivalric Lúks saga Anakinssonar is derived from another tradition and may well be a translation of a continental epic , probably one closely related to the extant Middle High German Himelgengærelied , from which Lucas ’s narrative is drawn ) .
The author of the Old English poem Déor also knows an “ Anacan , haten heofongangende ” ( “ Anacen , named the sky - walker ” ) , who later in the poem is referred to by an alternative byname , “ sunubana ” ( “ son - killer ” ) , suggesting that the more tragic version of the tale was current among the Anglo - Saxons too .
Hammershaimb seems to know a Faroese ballad on the two “ Himingangarar , ” but there is no trace of the text of this ballad in any known collection , and it was not known to the last exponents of the Faroese oral tradition in the early twentieth century .
Tattúínárdǿla saga tells of the youth of Anakinn himingangari , beginning with his childhood as a slave in Tattúínárdalr , notably lacking the prolonged racing scene of the MHG version , and referring to the character of “ Jarjari inn heimski ” only as a local fool slain by Anakinn in a childhood berserker rage ( whereas in the MHG version , “ Jarjare ” is one of “ Anacen ’s ” marshals and his constant companion ; Cochrane 2010 suggests that this may be because the MHG text is Frankish in origin , and “ Jarjare ” was identified with a Frankish culture hero with a similar name ) .
After this killing , for which Anakinn ’s owner ( and implied father ) refuses to pay compensation , Anakinn ’s mother , an enslaved Irish princess , foresees a great future for Anakinn as a “ jeði ” ( the exact provenance of this word is unknown but perhaps represents an intentionally humorous Irish mispronunciation of “ goði ” ) .
This compels Anakinn to recite his first verse :
Þat mælti mín móðir ,
at mér skyldi kaupa
fley ok fagrar árar
fara á brott með jeðum ,
standa upp í stafni ,
stýra dýrum xwingi ,
halda svá til hafnar ,
hǫggva mann ok annan .
( “ My mother said / That they should buy me / A warship and fair oars , / That I should go abroad with Jedis , / Stand up in the ship ’s stern , / Steer a magnificent X - Wing , / Hold my course till the harbor , / Kill one man after another . ” )
The etymology of “ xwingi ” ( nom. * xwingr ? ) is unknown ; numerous editors have proposed emendations , but none is considered particularly plausible .
It is likely to be another humorous Irish mispronunciation of a Norse word .
As a teenager , Anakinn purchases his freedom from his owner , and arranges for passage to Kóruskantborg with the notorious Viking Víga - Óbívan , with whom he is sworn into the service of the King of Kóruskantborg after a series of adventures that prove his mettle and initiative in battle .
Over the next several years , we follow the career of Anakinn as he falls in love with Irish princess Paðéma after killing her father at the Battle of Confey , and his mentor Víga - Óbívan continues to encourage him to betray Falfaðinn , the King of Kóruskantborg .
Eventually Falfaðinn learns of Víga - Óbívan ’s duplicity and exiles him .
Víga - Óbívan returns to Tattúínárdalr , and Anakinn is conflicted when he learns that Paðéma has been in league with Víga - Óbívan and sails to Tattúínárdalr with him .
However , Anakinn is loyal to his oaths to King Falfaðinn and remains with him in Kóruskantborg , where he rises to great honor in the service of the king and is the recipient of many good gifts .
He also begins the planning of the construction of the great ship Dauðastjarna , which when completed will be the crown jewel of Falfaðinn ’s fleet , and will hold a crew large enough to sack a city single - handedly .
Because of his great skill in hunting , Anakinn is now known to most as Veiðari - Anakinn , “ hunter - Anakinn , ” or often simply Veiðari .
Back in Tattúínárdalr , Paðéma gives birth to twins , Lúkr and Leia , before dying from her grief at having betrayed her husband .
One of the most memorable lines in the saga is given to her on her deathbed :
Þá mælti Paðéma : “ Þeim var ek verst er ek unna mest . ”
( Then Padmé said : “ I was worst to the man that I loved most . ” )
Víga -Óbívan commends
Leia to the care of a local goði and Lúkr to a man whom he believes to be Anakinn ’s brother , but who is probably a disguised Óðinn .
Déor speaks of the son of “ Anacan ” as having been raised by “ Owen , ” which may suggest that this interpretation is correct , but if this is in fact the name of the god , it is unclear why the form should lack the initial glide of Anglo - Saxon ( unless this part of the story originated in the Danelaw ; for full discussion of this and other problems of the text in Deor see Nashat 2010 ) .
Víga -Óbívan waits for Lúkr to attain manhood , and by now is himself an old man .
When young Lúkr follows some lost sheep onto Víga - Óbívan ’s property and is attacked by his retainers , Víga - Óbívan defends him and later tells Lúkr ( who in a dream has been given his father ’s byname , “ himingangari , ” by a dís , but is unaware that his father also bore it ) , that Lúkr ’s father Anakinn was slain by Veiðari , the great captain of King Falfaðinn of Kóruskantborg .
Lúkr swears vengeance , accepts the gift of his father ’s sword Ljósamækir from Víga - Óbívan , and with the help of the mercenary Hani ( if scholars are correct in emending his name in this way ; the manuscript reads “ Hann ” ) and his ship the Þúsundár Fálkinn , sails to find the great ship Dauðastjarna , which Veiðari steers as captain of Falfaðinn ’s fleet .
After a long series of close battles , Lúkr and a team of Hebridean Vikings ( who , we learn in a long prelude to this encounter , have long quarreled with Falfaðinn over a taxation matter ) finally sink the Dauðastjarna , though not before Víga - Óbívan is slain in a holmgang with Veiðari , and the Hebrideans ’ base on the island now known as Mainland has been looted by Veiðari ’s Vikings .
The saga spends several chapters describing the escalation of tensions between Veiðari and Lúkr over the next years .
Hani returns to Tattúínárdalr and is there betrothed to Leia ( whom Lúkr still does not know to be his sister ) ; he becomes a great goði .
Meanwhile Lúkr shipwrecks on an island in the Faroes called Dagóba ( the name is of unknown origin but probably Celtic ) where he meets and is trained by the great warrior Jóði , who was a companion of Víga - Óbívan in his youth ; Jóði continues to incite Lúkr to kill Veiðari , but his remarks are confusing in the text as preserved and are probably much damaged by later redactors – the word order is considerably jumbled and many of his comments reflect anachronistic Christian sentiments .
Finally Lúkr sees the ghost of Víga - Óbívan outside the latter ’s howe , and Víga - Óbívan intones a scornful skaldic stanza at Lúkr , informing Lúkr that Hani and Leia ( whom he now strongly hints is Lúkr ’s sister ) have been abducted by Veiðari ’s men , and upbraiding him for being in the Faroes “ sporting with Jóði ” when this occurred .
Lúkr returns to Jóði ( who in a bizarre aside is revealed to live inside a giant tree trunk in the middle of a marsh ) , and tells him of the apparition .
Jóði foresees that if Lúkr leaves , he will face his death , but in typical saga - heroic fashion Lúkr refuses the older man ’s counsel and sets out to rescue his sworn brother .
Their exchange is well - known to students of Old Icelandic literature as a classic example of the forecasting of which the saga authors were so fond :
“ Þú munt vera maðr feigr , ” segir Jóði , “ Ok ver þú varr um þik . ”
“ Ekki mun mér þat stoða , ” segir Lúkr , “ Ef mér er þat ætlat . ”
( “ You must be a doomed man , ” said Yoda , “ Be watchful of yourself . ”
“ That will not avail me , ” said Luke , “ If this be my fate . ” )
Having infiltrated Veiðari ’s court , Lúkr discovers that his sworn brother Hani has been turned to ice by Veiðari ’s sorcery , and engages in a memorable holmgang with Veiðari , in which Veiðari reveals to Lúkr that he is his father :
Veiðari mælti : “ Víga - Óbívan segði aldrigi þér þat , er orðit er af feðr þínum . ”
“ Hann sagði mér ǿrit , ” segir Lúkr , “ Hann sagði mér , at þú hann dræpir . ”
“ Ekki er þat satt , ” kvað Veiðari , “ Ok em ek þinn faðir . ”
( Vader said : “ Obi -Wan would never tell you , what happened to your father . ”
“ He told me enough , ” said Luke , “ He told me that you killed him . ”
“ That is not true , ” said Vader , “ I am your father . ” )
In the German version made famous by Lucas ’s films , “ Lûc ” proceeds to deny “ Veiter ’s ” statement , repeatedly shouting “ no ” and imploring the heavens to see to it that it should not be so .
However , in the Icelandic version , Lúkr coolly accepts Veiðari ’s statement and continues to fight :
“ Eigi vil ek þat trúa , ” segir Lúkr , “ En ef þú ert víst minn faðir , svá fær þú skilit þat , at ek held þínu sverði Ljósamæki . ”
“ Já vist , ” segir Veiðari , “ Eða hvat segir þú til ? ”
( “ I will not believe that , ” said Luke .
“ But if you are truly my father , then you can see , that I hold your sword Lightsaber . ”
“ Yes I can , ” said Vader , “ What more do you have to say about it ? ” )
The conclusion of their heroic dialogue has stirred the imaginations of generations of Old Norse enthusiasts :
“ Þat mun ekki gera , ” segir Lúkr , “ Þú munt þó drepa vilja Hana , mág minn , ok er þat skǫmm , ef ek sit hjá . ”
Ok lagði til Veiðara tveim hǫndum sverðinu .
“ Karlmannliga er at farit , ” segir Veiðari .
Veiðari høggr á hǫndina Lúki , svá at af tók , en niðr fell Ljósamækir ok með honum Lúkr .
( “ It does n’t matter , ” said Luke , “ You will still want to kill Han , my brother - in - law , and it would be shameful for me to sit idly by . ”
And he swung the sword at Vader with two hands .
“ That is manfully done , ” said Vader .
He cut Luke ’s hand , so that it was cut off , and Lightsaber fell down and with it Luke . )
Lúkr is saved from drowning by the intercession of Leia and Hani ’s men in the Þúsundár Fálkinn .
Following this memorable climax , there is an extended lacuna in the manuscript , and the action picks up again with an episode wherein Lúkr rescues Hani and Leia from the corrupt ( and grossly obese ) Danish merchant Jabbi , a rather comical figure on the whole , and this entire incident is probably to be reckoned an interpolation from a later chivalric saga .
Unfortunately the saga shows its repetitive nature at this point , and we once again learn that Veiðari is building , under the auspices of Falfaðinn , a great ship to be named Dauðastjarna in meiri .
At a great feast , Lúkr and Hani swear that they will kill Veiðari and Falfaðinn , burn Dauðastjarna , and conquer Kóruskantborg .
Their boasts are considered binding and the sworn brothers lead several warships loaded with men to the position of the Dauðastjarna .
There Hani is assisted by what the saga describes as “ birnir ” ( literally “ bears , ” but in context probably to be understood as “ Shetlanders ” – the German version confusingly seems to understand these as actual bears ) in his great assault on Falfaðinn ’s fleet , but Lúkr is captured by Veiðari and brought to an audience with Falfaðinn .
Here the text of Tattúínardǿla saga is regrettably lost , but is almost surely to be reconstructed as discussed above ( with the aid of hints from the Old High German text ) : with a climactic final holmgang in which a conflicted Veiðari chooses loyalty to his lord over loyalty to his bloodline , killing his son Lúkr and in the process bereaving himself of his own heir , and a later conclusion in which the prosperous , but troubled and aged , hersir Veiðari is himself slain in vengeance for Lúkr by the son of Hani and Leia .

Note :
When the above introduction was written in 2010 , I had not yet intended to write out the saga chapter - by - chapter , as I did over the following couple of years .
The story as presented in the saga below does occasionally contradict the introduction , not least in including the ending of the story .
If you want to skip the prequels , the original trilogy starts between chapters 16 and 17 .
Note that the way the saga is written in English is a deliberate pastiche on the old - fashioned English of so many translators .

Chapter 1 : Concerning Jarl Jothi Gormoarson
JOTHI WAS THE NAME OF A MAN , son of Gormo .
Jothi was a little man , but so strong that none was his equal .
When he was young , he went a-viking and raided .
With him in friendship was that man who was named Vindu , a noble man and the most valiant in strength and daring .
He was a berserker .
He and Jothi were in good agreement about everything , and there was the greatest friendship between them .
Jothi had one son .
He was named Duku .
Duku was a black - haired man and ugly , like his father both in appearance and in manners .
He became a very active man .
He was skilled in wood and iron , and became the greatest smith .
Now when Duku was in his twenties , he began to go raiding .
Jothi got him a longship .
With him on his expeditions went the sons of Vindu – they had a good following and another longship – and they went a-viking during the summer and took much property and gained good loot .
During the summers they would go out a-viking , but in the winters they would stay home with their fathers .
Duku would bring home many treasures and give them to his father .
This was good both for his wealth and for his station among men .
At this time Jothi was at an advanced age , but his son was in the prime of his life .
Falfathinn was the name of a war - king , who was called Falfathinn lightning - bolt .
He became king of Koruskantborg in Norway , and swore that he would become sole king over Norway .
King Falfathinn lay with his army in the region of the Jedi Fjords .
He sent his men out around the land there to meet those men who had not joined him , but whom he thought it would be profitable to have with him .
The king ’s messengers came to Jothi and received a good welcome .
They announced their errand , and said that the king wanted Jothi to come meet him .
“ He has , ” they said , “ Learned that you are a noble man and of a great family .
You will receive great honor from him .
The king is very eager to have with him those men whom he learns are valiant in power and physical courage . ”
Jothi answered and said that he was an old man , so that we has not physically capable of going out in warships .
“ I would rather sit at home now , and leave off serving kings . ”
The messengers went away , and when they came to the king , they told him everything that Jothi had said to them .
The king was angry about this and said so in as many words , and declared that Jothi ’s family was one of proud men , and wondered what kind of offer they would be content with .
Maul the Red was near , and bade the king to leave aside his anger .
“ I will go to meet Jothi , and he will want to join you immediately when he learns that it means so much to you . ”
Then Maul the Red went to meet Jothi , and said to him that the king was angry and that it would not avail , unless one of them , he or his son , went to the king , and said that they would receive great honor from the king if they would bow to him .
He told him , as was surely the truth , that the king was good to his men , and gave them honor and riches .
Jothi said that it was his plan “ that my son and I not kowtow to this king , and I will not go to meet him .
But if Duku comes home this summer , he will be easily persuaded to this and will want to become the king ’s man .
Say to the king , that I will gladly be his friend and the friend of all men , who respect my words , and I will hold to my friendship with him .
I also want the same authority and charge given to me by him as by earlier kings , if the king will that it be so , and if he agrees to this we ’ll see about whether I ’ll serve him . ”
Then Maul went back to the king and told him that Jothi would send him his son , and said that it was better that he was not then home .
The king let the matter rest for a time .
Duku Jothason and Meis Vindusson came home that autumn from raiding .
Duku went to his father .
The father and son took to talking .
Duku asked what had been the errand of those men whom Falfathinn had sent .
Jothi said that the king had sent word , that either Jothi or his son should become the king ’s man .
“ How did you answer ? ” Asked Duku .
“ I said what was on my mind , which was that I would never sell myself into the hand of King Falfathinn , and you would n’t either , if you took my advice .
I think that in the end this king will cause our death . ”
“ You think of this quite differently from me , ” said Duku , “ For I think that I will receive from him the greatest glory , and so I am firmly resolved that I will go to meet the king and will become his man , and I have learned for the truth , that his following is made up of only the most valiant men .
It seems to me a great opportunity to join that following , if they want to have me .
Those men are treated better than anyone else in this land .
I hear that the king is incredibly generous with his money and gives all of it to his men and does n’t hesitate to give them advancement and land when he thinks that they ’ve earned these things .
But I hear that all those who turn him down and do n’t want to accept his friendship , become unimportant men , and some leave the country , or become migrant workers .
It seems strange to me , father , that you , such a wise man as you are , and so eager for glory , would not want to accept gratefully the honor that the king has offered you .
But if you think that you have a vision that we will suffer at the hands of this king and that he will become our enemy , why did n’t you fight against him in the army of the king that you used to serve ?
It seems unreasonable to me , to be neither Falfathinn ’s enemy nor his friend . ”
“ It went as I expected , ” said Jothi , “ For those who went to fight Falfathinn lightning - bolt up north in Møre .
And it will be the same now as it was then , that Falfathinn will be a great harm to my kinsmen .
But you , Duku , you must follow your own wishes .
I do n’t doubt , though you enter into Falfathinn ’s army , that you will become a man considered better than a match for any other , and equal to the best in any kind of combat .
But beware that you do not think too much of yourself , and that you do not fight with men greater than you .
But I do not need to counsel you to be any less yielding than you are . ”
Then Duku pledged himself to the king and entered his following .
Duku had one son .
He was named Kvaeggan .
Kvaeggan was then eighteen years old , a promising young man and brave .
He was a good - spirited man , generous and energetic , and the best fighter .
He was popular with everyone .
When Jothi learned of the treachery of his son Duku , he became angry at the news , so that he stayed in his bed out of sorrow and old age .
Kvaeggan came to him often and spoke to him , bade him take cheer , and said that anything would be better than to lie in bed miserably .
“ Rather do I think that it is a good idea , that we should take land in Iceland and set up residence there .
Men can take land there for free , and choose where to build a home . ”
Jothi agreed soon to this idea , and they resolved to move their home and leave the country .
Early in the spring they prepared their ships .
They had good ships and big ones ; they had in their possession two large ocean - going ships , and on each one thirty able - bodied men , in addition to women and children .
They had with them all their cattle that they could bring , but no man wished to buy their land for fear of the king .
And when they were ready , they sailed away .
They sailed to those islands , which are called the Faroes .
And on one island , which is called Dagoba , Jothi disembarked and walked away , and never came back to his ship .
Kvaeggan went to look for him , but he had left no trace .
Then Kvaeggan ordered everyone to search for him , but they never found him .
Chapter 2 : Concerning Chieftain Kvæggan Dúkússon
Kvaeggan Dukusson arrived with his ship on Iceland at Nobu Valley .
On the ship with him was his son , Obivan .
Kvaeggan set up a homestead .
In the spring he moved the homestead north over the heath and set up his home in the place called Nobu .
And one night he dreamed that his grandfather Jothi came to him and said : “ There you lie , Kvaeggan , and rather unwarily .
Move your home away from here and west over the Nobu River .
There your luck will be good . ”
After that he woke up and moved over the Tattuin River into Tattuin Valley , in a place later called Kvaeggan ’s Place .
Vatto was the name of a man who lived on the estate called Mosaesli .
That is in Tattuin Valley .
He had a slave woman who was named Smy .
She was a widow and had a bastard son , and he was named Anakinn the Sky - Walker .
She said that he was the son of a certain Fossi , a kinsman of Jothi Gormoarson , but Kvaeggan did not know this .
He was called Anakinn the Sky - Walker because he could leap higher than his own height , and he leapt so high that he seemed to walk in the sky .
Vatto enjoyed games and tests of strength , and he was always going on about such things .
Anakinn was a combative boy and irritable , and he was a good wrestler .
One year , at the beginning of winter , long after Kvaeggan had come to Iceland , a wrestling match was held in Mosaesli , and it was well - attended .
Men from all over the region came , and many of Kvaeggan ’s men went there too .
Most prominent among them was Obivan Kvaeggansson .
He was twenty years old .
He had grown big and strong early in his life , and was manly in temperament , a bit dark and with an ugly nose but otherwise handsome , with long , reddish hair .
He was called Viga - Obivan ( Killer - Obivan ) .
Anakinn was nine years old .
He had to fight a boy who was named Jarjari , son of Georg from Gunga ’s Place .
Jarjari was eleven winters old , perhaps ten , and strong for his age .
And when they wrestled , Anakinn got the worst of it .
Jarjari did not restrain himself against the weaker boy .
Jarjari grabbed him and drove him down into a big fall and hurt him , and said that he would injure Anakinn badly if Anakinn did n’t respect him .
And when Anakinn came to his feet , he left the wrestling ring , and the boys all jeered at him .
Anakinn became severely angry .
He went to Viga - Obivan Kvaeggansson and told him what had happened .
Viga - Obivan gave Anakinn his sword , and this sword was called Lightsaber .
Such weapons were common in those days .
Anakinn ran at Jarjari and drove the sword into the other boy ’s head so deep that it stood in his brain .
The men of Gungaville leapt to their weapons , and so did the men of Tattuin Valley .
Seven men died in the ensuing fight , and Georg was mortally injured .
And when Anakinn came home , Vatto was angry about what had happened , and from then on there was hostility between him and Viga - Obivan .
Smy said that Anakinn had the character of one of the men from the Jedi Fjords and prophecied that when he was old enough he would get a ship called “ X - Wing . ”
Anakinn then recited this poem :
My mother said that
they should buy me
a warship and fair oars ,
that I should go abroad
with the men from the Jedi Fjords ,
stand up in the stern ,
steer the magnificent X - Wing ,
hold a course to the harbor ,
cut down one man after another .
In that time there came a great famine in Tattuin Valley , so that Kvaeggan had very little hay or food .
Then Kvaeggan asked Viga - Obivan to come on a trip with him .
They went to Mosaesli and called Vatto out .
He greeted them , and Kvaeggan took his greeting gracefully .
“ This is my errand , ” said Kvaeggan .
“ I have come to buy hay and food from you , if you have them . ”
“ I have both , ” said Vatto , “ But I wo n’t sell you either .
Viga - Obivan said : “ We should just take the things we need , and leave him payment in their place . ”
“ I ’m no robber , ” said Kvaeggan .
“ Would you buy a slave from me ? ” asked Vatto .
“ I could use one of those , ” said Kvaeggan .
Then he bought Anakinn the Sky - walker from Vatto , and went home with this done .
Chapter 3 : Concerning Maul Zabraksson the Red and the Killing of Kvaeggan
Maul the Red was the name of a man , a follower of Falfathinn .
He was the son of Zabrak Iridoniusson .
He was a warrior of great achievements .
When Falfathinn learned that Jothi and his family had moved out of Norway , he grew angry , and called for Maul the Red , whom he then sent to Iceland .
“ Go to Iceland , ” said Falfathinn , “ And kill Jothi Gormoarson . ”
But when Maul the Red came to Iceland , it was many years before he found Kvaeggan ’s home in Tattuin Valley .
Kvaeggan was not home , but the slave Anakinn was outside haying .
“ Tell me where your master is , ” said Maul .
“ He is not home , ” said Anakinn , “ But his son is in the side - room . ”
Maul went to the side - room , but did not find Viga - Obivan .
Anakinn ran to the barn where Kvaeggan and Viga - Obivan were .
Kvaeggan saw Anakinn and asked , “ Why are n’t you at work ? ”
“ I ’m not at work , but a follower of Falfathinn ’s is , ” said Anakinn .
Maul the Red came to the barn now , and saw Kvaeggan .
He drew two swords , and in one movement attacked both Kvaeggan and Viga - Obivan .
Viga - Obivan was armed .
Maul ’s sword came at him on the left side and hit his shield below the rim , and broke it in half ; it then went into Viga - Obiívan ’s leg above the knee and stopped there .
Maul ’s other sword hit Kvaeggan on the shoulder and cut off his arm , and that wound would end the life of Kvaeggan .
But Viga - Obivan swung his sword Lightsaber at Maul the Red , and cut him in half in the middle .
“ Father , ” said Viga - Obivan to Kvaeggan .
“ It is too late , ” said Kvaeggan .
“ It is not , ” said Viga - Obivan .
Kvæggan said : “ Obivan , promise me that you will free the boy , for he has been very truthful and trustworthy .
And promise , both of you , that you will avenge me . ”
Viga - Obivan agreed to this .
Kvaeggan said : “ He is chosen for this … it is as fate decrees … he will change the balance … avenge me ! ”
Kvaeggan died .
He was the handsomest of men , with long reddish - brown hair , and in all ways he was the noblest man .
Viga - Obivan did not weep .
He declared Anakinn free , and they both promised that they would go to Norway and there avenge Kvaeggan .
Chapter 4 : Concerning the Lightsabers
Now this must be told .
When Duku Jothason was young , he was a good smith , and before he went out a-viking one summer , he made a sword .
And when he took it from the forge , it seemed to his assistants that green flames burned from the edges .
He now bade his father Jothi to hold the sword , and said that he did not know how to make a sword , if this one should fail .
Jothi swung at the anvil and cut it down to the base , and the sword neither broke nor chipped .
He praised the sword very much and went to the river with a tuft of wool .
And when he cast the wool into the river , and put the blade downstream from it , the sword cut it in half .
Jothi went home happily .
But Duku followed his father home and said , “ Father , why did you take the sword from me ?
I am going out a-viking , and I have need of a good sword . ”
Jothi said : “ Your father likes this sword , which I name Lightsaber the Green , and you can make another sword as good as this one , if you are indeed such a good smith as men say . ”
Duku was angered , but he made another sword .
This sword was sharper than Lightsaber the Green , and from it shone a red flame ; it was named Lightsaber the Red .
And he hid this sword from his father .
Chapter 5 : Concerning Queen Pathema the Fair
Now this must be told .
Viga - Obivan and Anakinn rode east to Horn Fjord , and with them most of Viga - Obivan ’s men .
They brought with them all their wares and luggage and movable things that they needed to have .
Then they prepared their ship .
Viga - Obivan was with the ship while it was being prepared .
And when they got a fair wind , they set sail into the sea .
They were at sea a long time and had bad weather ; soon they became lost .
At last waves had overrun the ship three times , and Viga - Obivan said that they were near land and that these must be the shoals .
There was a great fog , and the weather got worse , so that they endured a great storm .
They could not find their way , till they ran aground at night .
Their lives were spared , but the ship was shattered into small pieces , and they could not save the cattle .
They sought to warm themselves as best they could .
And the day after that , they went up on a hill .
The weather was good .
Viga - Obivan asked whether any of the men knew this land , who had been there before .
There were two men who knew the land , and who said that they had come to Ireland in the realm of Thithborg .
“ We could have landed in a worse place , ” said Viga - Obivan , “ For Pathema the Fair rules here .
There is little love between Pathema and Falfathinn .
We should put ourselves at the mercy of the queen .
We can hardly do otherwise , for the queen has our lives in her hands , if she so wishes . ”
They all went away from that place .
Viga - Obivan said that they should say no word to any man about the news or about their journey , till he could talk to the queen .
They walked till they found some men , who showed them to the queen .
They went before the queen , and Viga - Obivan and Anakinn and all the men with them greeted her .
Pathema was the most beautiful of women who lived in this world , both in her fair appearance and in her wits .
It had become proverbial , how beautiful she was , and thus she was called Pathema the Fair .
She was a woman of such nobility that in her time other women , for all their finery , seemed childish next to her .
She was the most learned of women , and the most eloquent of speech ; she was a generous queen .
The queen asked what manner of men these were .
Viga - Obivan gave his name and told her what region of Iceland he had come from .
The queen had learned earlier that Falfathinn had sent Maul the Red to kill Kvaeggan Dukusson and Jothi Gormoarson , and so she recognized these men immediately .
She asked Viga - Obivan , “ What can you tell of Maul Zabraksson the Red , Falfathinn ’s man ? ”
“ I can say this , ” said Viga - Obivan , “ That I cut him in half . ”
“ Bless your hands ! ” Said Pathema .
Viga - Obivan and Anakinn entered the service of Queen Pathema , and soon there arose great friendship between Anakinn and the queen .
Chapter 6 : Concerning Jothi’s Prophecy
It was in the days of Queen Pathema of Thithborg that King Falfathinn desired to increase his realm , and to become king over Thithborg .
For this reason he had the harbor of Thithborg blockaded by his navy .
And when Queen Pathema would not turn over her rule to Falfathinn , Viga - Obivan told her , that they should go to meet Falfathinn in Koruskantborg and seek a settlement with him .
Pathema agreed to this .
But when Pathema ’s ship was ready , Anakinn asked Viga - Obivan , whether he might come along with him and Pathema .
“ That is not my intent , ” said Viga - Obivan , “ For you are too young . ”
“ But Kvaeggan bade me promise him , that I as well as you should avenge him , ” said Anakinn .
Then Viga - Obivan agreed that Anakinn should come with them .
With them on this ship was a man named Artveir - Ditveir .
He was a little man and silent , for he did not speak Norse , but he was a great wizard , and could cause any ship that he sang upon to move so swiftly , that no other could overtake it .
And his magic availed , and Falfathinn ’s navy did not catch them .
But before they came to Norway , they landed in the Faroes , on that island which is called Dagoba .
And when Viga - Obivan and Anakinn went to get water from a waterfall , they saw a very old man , and they asked him who he was .
“ Jothi my name is , son of Gormo , father of Duku Kvaeggan ’s father , ” the man said .
“ Then you are the grandfather of my father , for I am Obivan , son of Kvaeggan , and he was slain in Iceland , ” said Viga - Obivan .
“ That I know , for seen it I have , ” said Jothi .
“ Then you must be a man with second sight , ” said Viga - Obivan , “ And if it is true , then you will also have seen that I have come with a certain freeman , who is called Anakinn the Sky - walker , and he has sworn that he and I both shall avenge my father .
My father told me , that you had prophesied when he was young , that a freeman should come among our kin , and that it was destined that he should change the balance .
I do not know whether I believe in this . ”
“ You know that you believe it , and that your father believed it .
That he shall avenge your father , you believe ?
That he should become one of the men of the Jedi Fjords , you ask ?
Tried shall he be . ”
And Jothi turned to Anakinn , and asked , “ Afraid are you ? ”
“ I am not afraid , ” said Anakinn .
“ See through you , I can , ” said Jothi , “ Afraid to lose your mother , are you . ”
“ Is that important ? ” Said Anakinn .
“ That is of the greatest importance , ” said Jothi , “ For fear sows anger , anger sows hate , hate sows suffering . ”
Then Anakinn became angry , and he said , “ I am not afraid . ”
“ Then continue , shall we , ” said Jothi .
Chapter 7 : Concerning the Journey of Anakinn and Pathema to Norway
Viga - Obivan and Anakinn dwelled there on Dagoba many years with Jothi ; he was a very old man , but as strong as he was in his youth .
He taught Anakinn to fight in the way of the men from the Jedi fjords , and Anakinn became the best of fighters .
In the summers Viga - Obivan would go out raiding .
But Jothi would never again leave the island Dagoba .
Anakinn grew up there on Dagoba in the Faeroes .
He was the handsomest of men who had been born in Iceland ; he had strong features and a good face , with the best of eyes and light - colored hair ; he had long hair as fair as silk , and it fell in locks .
He was a big man and strong , much like Kvaeggan had been .
Anakinn comported himself better than any man , so that all wondered when they saw him ; he was also a better fighter than most other men .
He was craftier than most men and the best of swimmers ; he could outperform other men in any sport .
And when they had been on Dagoba ten years , Queen Pathema was twenty - four years old , and Anakinn the Sky - walker was eighteen .
Pathema became very angry that they had not yet gone to Norway .
Viga - Obivan thought that Anakinn was full - grown and quite ready to avenge Kvaeggan , but Jothi thought that Anakinn was very young and angry , and said , “ And you , Obivan , much like your grandfather are you , and will not heed good advice , and need you this temperament not . ”
Nevertheless Viga - Obivan went to Norway , and with him Pathema and Anakinn .
The weather was good , and they reached Norway in the north at the Jedi Fjords .
Viga - Obivan said , “ Anakinn , go with Pathema to Koruskantborg .
And I will find Meis Vindusson , the friend of my father , in the Jedi fjords .
I cannot go to Koruskantborg , for the king knows my family , and he would slay me immediately .
But remain with Pathema , and guard her from the king ’s men , till I come back with men from the Jedi Fjords . ”
Anakinn and Pathema came to Koruskantborg on their ship .
In that time were there many Icelandic men in Norway , who were of the highest station ; at the pier there were three ships already , and Icelanders owned them all .
But when they stepped off the ship , a man ran at Pathema , and made to kill her with his sword .
At that instant Anakinn cut off the man ’s leg above his knee , and this wound was enough to kill him .
Anakinn said , “ This will mean that Falfathinn wants you killed . ”
Pathema said , “ Nevertheless I want to go to him , and exchange words with him . ”
Pathema went immediately to meet King Falfathinn and Anakinn was with her ; they received a good welcome .
The king asked , whether it was true that a man had tried to kill her on the pier earlier that day .
Pathema answered that this was true .
The king said , “ We do not like this news , and We wish to advise You that Ye keep with you a good man who can guard You from robbers . ”
Then the king asked , who that stately man was , who was in her following , and she answered , “ This is my retainer and he is called Anakinn the Sky - walker . ”
“ Certainly he is a bold - looking fellow , ” said the king .
Chapter 8 : Concerning Smy , the Mother of Anakinn
Now Anakinn became Pathema ’s retainer , and he followed her wherever she needed to go .
They exchanged many words in private , and men laughed about this and joked that the slave ’s son Anakinn Sky - walker would ask for the hand of the fair queen .
It is said that once Anakinn told Pathema of a dream : “ I dreamed , ” he said , “ That I seemed to see my mother , and I saw her so clearly that I seemed to see her just as I see you .
She suffered torments , and men that I did n’t know killed her .
I know that I swore to protect you , but I can not allow my mother to suffer so .
There is no other choice than for me to help my mother . ”
Pathema said , “ But if you must protect me , so also must I be with you . ”
“ Yes , ” said Anakinn , “ But you can not come with me to Iceland .
It is a dangerous land . ”
“ I am a queen , ” said Pathema , “ And I can do as I please . ”
Then they prepared for their journey , and they arrived in Iceland at Nobudalr , and they slept there on the beach that night .
“ When I was a child , I enjoyed the beach , lying on the sand and drying off under the sun .
And I entertained myself by guessing the names of the birds that sang , ” said Pathema .
“ I do n’t like sand , ” said Anakinn .
In the morning they went to Mosaesli , and there they found Vatto .
Anakinn asked , whether he had seen his mother Smy .
“ I do n’t own her any longer , ” said Vatto .
Anakinn asked , “ Do you know where she is ? ”
“ I sold her to a farmer who is named Klegg Larsson , who lives at the Farm of Waters in Tattuin Valley . ”
Anakinn now went to the Farm of Waters and Pathema with him .
They found there a house and a man outside who was cutting wood .
Anakinn asked him what his name was , and he called himself Oin. Oin asked Anakinn for his name , which he also provided .
Oin recognized this name .
Then he led Anakinn and Pathema into the house ; it was small but well - built .
He told his wife that some people had come .
She was named Bera .
She saw Anakinn and said , “ Most men will be badly rewarded by this one , but you ’ll have your way , I guess . ”
Oin ’s father was Klegg .
He sat inside the house and did not come out ; one of his legs had been cut off .
Anakinn asked , “ Where is my mother , Smy , whom Vatty in Mosaesli sold to you ? ”
Klegg said , “ The great robbers , the sons of Tuskinn , took her . ”
Anakinn asked , whether these ill deeds were unavenged .
“ I went to the Tuskinssons , and made to take her back , ” said Klegg , “ But I came home with one foot fewer . ”
Anakin was silent , then stood and walked out .
Oin asked , “ Where are you going ? ”
“ To find my mother , ” said Anakinn .
“ She is dead , son - in - law , ” said Klegg .
“ That is not true , ” said Anakinn , “ For I can see her in my dreeams .
I know that she lives still , and I must find her . ”
Oin said , “ I will give you my horse , which is the best in the region . ”
Anakinn said , “ Certainly I will come back shortly . ”
In the morning before the sunrise Anakinn came to the house of the Tuskinssons .
He saw a woman on the ground , bleeding profusely , and he recognized his mother .
“ Mother , ” said Anakinn .
She asked , “ Do I hear the voice of Anakinn , my son ? ”
“ I am here , mother .
I shall avenge you , and we two shall ride home together , ” said Anakinn .
“ Anakinn , ” she said , “ You are certainly a brave man , and my life is complete , now that I see that you have become a good man . ”
Then Smy died while Anakinn cradled her in his lap .
Anakinn ran up into the house and killed very many men .
Then he returned to the Farm of Waters with the body of his mother , and there burned her body .
Anakinn honored his mother with a funeral feast , as was the old custom .
Chapter 9 : Concerning the Secret Counsel of Duku Jothason
Now it must be told , that Viga - Obivan Kvaeggansson came to the Jedi Fjords .
He found the house of his grandfather , but no one was home .
He hid himself in a bed , and slept .
But when he wakened , he heard the voices of many men , and one was there who spoke with a brave voice .
“ It will still seem , ” said this man , “ That I am greedy , but so it always will .
And it will be difficult to see to it , that you will not seem to be the worst kind of liar or a traitor , when you do as you intend .
But I am told … ”
“ It is certain , ” said another man , “ That men will call us the worst kind of liars . ”
The man with the brave voice said , “ Many stand against us , more with us .
The men of the Jedi Fjords are dead , or else gone to Iceland , never to come back .
Who has seen my father Jothi in thirty years ?
Or my son Kvaeggan , or his son Obivan ?
With them gone , no farmer in the Jedi Fjords will draw a sword when our army comes to his land .
We will have the grandest army in Norway , and King Falfathinn will repay us this gift with gifts in turn .
He will do us honor , and make us rich lords . ”
A third man answered : “ Truly is it said , that you hate the bonds of kinship , and rejoice while your father is outlawed .
But men say that this is itself a trait of your kin . ”
But Duku was silent .
*
When night fell , men found Viga - Obivan in the bed , and bound him in fetters .
Duku heard men talk about this prisoner , and went to talk with him .
Viga - Obivan said : “ Traitor to your kin . ”
“ No , no , my kinsman , ” said Duku , “ This is misdone , frightfully misdone .
They have gone too far , this is madness . ”
“ I thought you were the leader here , Duku , ” said Viga - Obivan .
Dúkú said : “ I had nothing to do with this , I assure you .
I will ask them immediately to free you . ”
“ Certainly you will , ” said Viga - Obivan , “ And I expect that it will not take too long .
That work is great , which I have before me . ”
Duku said : “ It is much to be regretted , that we two have never met before , Viga - Obivan .
Kvaeggan praised you much .
I wish that he were still alive .
He would help me now . ”
“ Kvaeggan would never have joined you , ” said Víga - Óbívan .
“ You know not whether you speak truly when you say this .
You forget that he was my son , as you were his .
He knew that my father Jothi was corrupt with vice when he stood against King Falfathinn , and he would never have gone with Jothi , if he had learned the true story , as I have . ”
“ The true story ? ” said Viga - Obian .
“ The true story , ” said Duku .
“ What would you tell me , if I told you that the old Jedi Fjord men were the thralls of a Seith Lord ? ”
“ No , that is n’t possible , ” said Viga - Obivan .
“ Jóði , and Kvæggan , and others would know , if that were true . ”
“ Their eyes are blind , ” said Duku , “ In the dark waters of Urth ’s well , my kinsman .
A hundred lords in this very land are the thralls of Seith Lord Sithius . ”
“ I do not believe your words , ” said Viga - Obivan .
“ A jarl from Halogaland was in league with Seith Lord Sithius .
But ten years ago Sithius betrayed him .
He came to me , and sought help from me , and told me all that had happened , ” said Duku .
“ You must join me , Viga - Obivan – together we can destroy the Seith . ”
“ I shall never stand with you , Duku , ” said Viga - Obivan , “ As you did not stand with our ancestor Jothi . ”
Duku walked out , and he said that he expected to encounter much difficulty in getting Viga - Obivan released .
Chapter 10 : Concerning the Battle in the Jedi Fjords
Viga - Obivan sat for many weeks in his fetters , and men gave him little food and no drink except for cold water .
One day men came to him and bore him to a small coastal island , where they bound him to a tree .
“ If I am bound , I can not draw a sword in a duel , ” said Viga - Obivan .
“ It is not a duel to which you have been challenged , ” said a man .
“ You are dragon fodder . ”
Then Viga - Obivan saw that Anakinn the Sky - walker and Queen Pathema went bound just as he was , and men tied them to other trees .
Anakinn was the nearest to Viga - Obivan .
Viga - Obivan asked , “ Why are you two in the Jedi Fjords ? ”
Anakinn said , “ We were in Iceland and came back to Norway , but we went first to the Faroes and were guests at the house of Jothi , your forefather .
He dreamed one night that you were in the Jedi Fjords and that malicious men bound you .
We have come to save you , as you saved me when I was but a boy in the Tattuin River Valley . ”
Then Viga - Obivan said that Anakinn and Pathema had failed to do this .
There were many men on the shore near the island , who watched them .
Duku Jothason was with them , and another man of chieftain rank , who did not speak Norse .
This man said something to those men who stood near some large doors in a building .
These men opened the doors , and out came three beasts .
There was a dragon there who breathed fire ; he was green , and with six legs .
There was also a huge bull ; he was red , and looked a monstrous fierce animal with three horns .
There was also a lion .
The dragon came first to Viga - Obivan , and breathed fire against him .
But Viga - Obivan held his fetters before himself , so that the fire burnt them , and Viga - Obivan escaped unburnt , though his hands were still bound together .
The dragon went after him and tried to capture him in his claws , or to break a tree and hit him with the trunk .
And he breathed fire , and burnt many trees , and Viga - Obivan could neither hide nor defend himself .
The men who were watching took it badly that Viga - Obivan still lived , for they had believed that the dragon would eat him , and they feared that the dragon would eat them , if it could n’t get Viga - Obivan .
One of them cast a spear at Viga - Obivan , which Viga - Obivan caught in the air and threw at the dragon .
The dragon was hardly injured by the spear , and even took it in his mouth , and bit it .
But while Viga - Obivan fought the dragon , the great bull attacked Anakinn .
And it is said by men , that Anakinn is called the Sky - walker because he could jump more than his own height in the air .
And now he jumped on the back of the bull , and all who saw wondered at this .
Anakinn wound his fetters around the horns of the bull , and the bull was so strong , that the fetters burst apart immediately .
Now Anakinn rode the bull .
At the same time the lion intended to eat Queen Pathema .
But she had in her hand an Irish knife , which was enchanted in this way , that no one could see it except Paðéma .
She cut her fetters , and climbed the tree which she had been bound to .
But the lion climbed the tree after her , and cut her with its claws .
But she still had her fetters in her hands , and she whipped the lion , so that it could not come nearer .
Anakinn the Sky - walker saw that the lion threatened Pathema , and he rode the bull till he reached the lion , and the bull gored the lion with its horns .
Pathema leapt out of the tree onto the bull , and they rode to Viga - Obivan , who was still trying to escape the dragon .
Duku Jothason was angry when he saw that Anakinn and Pathema killed the lion .
His men went onto the islet , and intended to kill them .
But then a man set a sword on Duku ’s neck .
“ Meis Vindusson , ” said Duku , “ I am glad that you have come here . ”
But Meis said , “ This ‘ duel ’ can not continue , mother - betrayer . ”
Then Duku saw , that there were many men from the Jedi Fjords who had come with Meis , and all of them had swords drawn in their hands .
“ You are brave , ” said Duku , “ But full of foolishness , friend of my father .
There are many more men here who stand with me , than stand with you . ”
“ I believe that I have the greater number , ” said Meis .
“ We ’ll see , ” said Duku , and he ran away , while his men shot arrows at Meis Vindusson .
But there was no man who could shoot an arrow more swiftly than Meis Vindusson could parry it .
No man could swing a sword more swiftly than Meis , and he slew many a bowman with his sword .
Meis Vindusson slew also the great bull , and the Jedi Fjord men who were with Meis gave Anakinn two swords .
Anakinn cut the bonds on Viga - Obivan ’s hands , and gave him a sword .
Now they stood with the men of the Jedi Fjords , and they killed many of Duku ’s men .
Queen Pathema took a bow from a man who had been killed by Meis , and she slew many men with arrows .
But more men came after all who had fallen , and the men of the Jedi Fjords grew weary .
But then men heard Queen Pathema say , “ Look ! ”
And they saw that in the harbor there had come a ship , and Jothi Gormoarson stepped forward , and with him from these ships came Faroese fighters , who stood with the men from the Jedi Fjords .
These Faroese men killed many of Duku ’s men with sword and with arrow and with spear .
But the dragon was still alive , and he slew – with fire , or else with his claws , or with his already bloody teeth – all those men whom he could strike : whether they were from the Jedi Fjords , from the Faroes , or from Duku ;s army .
And no man could harm the dragon , for his skin was as hard as stone .
Viga - Obivan ran to his forefather Jothi and bade him lend him the good sword Lightsaber the Green , which Duku had once made .
Jothi gave it into Viga - Obivan ’s hands , and Viga - Obivan went to the dragon bearing this sword .
The dragon spat fire at Viga - Obivan , but Lightsaber the Green was the hardest of all swords , and ate all the fire which the dragon breathed .
Then Viga - Obivan cut at the dragon , and struck him above the knee , and took off a foot .
He cut again , and again , and cut off a second and a third foot .
The dragon then fell , and Viga - Obivan wound up the sword hard and cut at the dragon ’s neck , so that the head fell onto the sand .
But the dragon ’s head said :
“ Fellow !
And what a fellow !
Of what fellow were you born ?
Of what kin are you the son ?
You , who fiercely reddened
Your green sword :
The sword stands in my heart ! ”
And Viga - Obivan said :
“ My ancestry
I say to you , to whom it is unknown ,
And I reveal myself with the same :
I am named Killer - Obivan ,
And Kvaeggan was my father ,
It is I who killed you with the weapons ! ”
Then Viga - Obivan went to the dragon , and he cut the heart out of it with Lightsaber the Green .
Jothi was not there , while Viga - Obivan fought the dragon , but he came now , while Viga - Obivan wiped the blood from Lightsaber the Green .
Viga - Obivan gave that good sword back to his forefather .
But then Viga - Obivan saw that Duku went on to one of Jothi ’s ships , and he began to weigh anchor .
He called to the Faroese men , and told them to shoot him , but they said that they had no more arrows .
Anakinn the Sky - walker ran to the shore , and swam to the ship before Duku could weigh anchor .
Anakinn had a sword in each hand .
Duku Jothason drew Lightsaber the Red .
“ This is manfully done , boy , ” he said .
Duku cut at Anakinn , but Anakinn parried with his swords , though Duku followed each cut with another , so that Anakinn could not make any cuts in return .
Finally Duku cut off one of Anakinn ’s hands , and Anakinn defended himself with the other for a while , before he fell unconscious to the ground .
But while Anakinn and Duku fought , Jothi had come on to the ship .
“ Father , ” said Duku , son of Jothi .
“ Son , ” said Jothi , son of Gormo .
Son drew sword against father , and father drew sword against son .
Long they fought , sword on sword , till Jothi said : “ Well have you fought , my son . ”
But Duku answered with a scornful smile , before he leapt out of the ship into another boat below , and disappeared .
Chapter 11 : Concerning the Fall of Duku Jothason
The ship which Duku had stolen from his father Jothi was a very swift ship , and Jothi did not have another which could catch up with it .
And there were still many men who stood against the Jedi Fjord men , and the battle continued for a long time .
But when Duku ’s men were slain or had fled , Viga - Obivan remembered that Anakinn was on one of Jothi ’s ships .
He rowed out to this ship , and did not expect that he would find Anakinn alive , because Jothi had told him about the great wound which Duku had inflicted upon him .
But Viga - Obivan found Anakinn alive , though not conscious .
Viga - Obivan took Anakinn back to the shore , and showed him to Jothi and to Meis Vindusson .
Meis asked whether Viga - Obivan wished for this slave ’s son to live .
“ Certainly I do , ” said Viga - Obivan , “ Is it not true , that my ancestor Jothi prophesied , that a man would come to the folk of the Jedi Fjords , a slave - born man , and he would settle our quarrel with Falfathinn ? ”
“ So I prophesied , ” said Jothi , “ But it is possible , that understand this prophecy we do not . ”
“ He will not betray us , ” said Viga - Obivan , “ For I have taken him as my brother . ”
“ You have great faith in prophecy , as did your father Kvaeggan , ” said Meis , “ But because Anakinn has saved you , I will heal him .
But I do not trust this slave ’s son , and my heart tells me that we will regret that I have saved him . ”
Jothi Gormoarson had powers of prophecy , but Meis Vindusson was a man of magical skill .
He made a new hand for Anakinn , and this hand was made of silver .
Then he set this hand on Anakinn ’s arm , and cast a spell over him :
“ Bone to bone , blood to blood ,
Limb to limb , so be they linked . ”
Then Anakinn wakened , and his silver hand was as his other hand , and he could move it like the other , even though it was made of silver , and shone like moonlight .
Now Anakinn the Sky - walker and Víga - Obiívan took another of Jothi ’s ships .
Jothi gave Viga - Obivan Lightsaber the Green , and bade him merit the gift well .
It was a long journey from the Jedi Fjords to Koruskantborg .
And when Viga - Obivan and Anakinn sailed into the harbor there , they saw that ship which Duku had stolen .
And when they boarded this ship , there were many men who attacked them .
But these were young men , untried boys , and they could not harm Viga - Obivan or Anakinn , but Viga - Obivan and Anakinn killed many of them , and many others fled , for they feared the green fire which burned from Lightsaber the Green , and also the fierce man who bore that good sword .
Finally there were no men who stood against Viga - Obivan and Anakinn , and they saw now that Duku Jothason stood alone , and he had King Falfathinn set in fetters .
Duku laughed .
“ I give you a choice , ” he said , “ If you want to fight with me , I will kill the king , as I killed his guards .
And then whom will you avenge your father on , Víga - Obivan , if King Falfathinn is dead ?
But if you settle with me , I will take you , Viga - Obivan , as my grandson , innocent of wrongdoing .
I say to you still : Join me , grandson .
Together we two can destroy the Seith - lord , and we shall be kings in Norway . ”
Viga - Obivan did not answer , but he said to Anakinn : “ Because I will not have another man kill my father ’s slayer , and Duku is himself my father ’s father , I will not fight with him . ”
But Anakinn became angry , for Duku had cut off his hand , and he cut at Duku with the sword that he held in his silver hand .
Viga - Obivan did not want to see his sworn brother Anakinn killed , and he cut at Duku with Lightsaber the Green .
But Duku was a great Seith - man , and he spoke a spell on Viga - Obivan , so that Viga - Obivan fell to the ground asleep .
Duku and Anakinn fought long , and Duku said : “ I see that there is great fear in you , great hate , great rage .
But these do not avail you . ”
Now Anakinn became surpassingly angry , and he took Lightsaber the Green from Viga - Obivan ’s hand , and he made a great swing with this sword , and cut from Duku both his hands .
Duku fell on his knees , and King Falfathinn laughed .
“ You have done well , ” said King Falfathinn , “ Kill him . ”
But Anakinn would not kill Duku , saying “ He is the grandfather of Viga - Obivan Kvaeggansson , who is my sworn brother .
If I kill his kinsman , it will be a great shame , and his family will avenge this on me . ”
“ If you kill him , ” said the king , “ I will make you the foremost of all my retainers , and I will grant you jewels , gold , and honor . ”
Now Anakinn took the sword Lightsaber the Red , which had fallen to his feet , in his left hand , and he held Lightsaber the Green still in his right .
And with both swords he cut off Duku ’s head .
Now Anakinn released King Falfathinn from his fetters , and the king said that they had to swim to the shore as swiftly as they could , because the ship was burning .
“ I shall not save my own life , ” said Anakinn the Sky - walker , “ Unless I can save the life of Viga - Obivan Kvaeggansson also .
He has taken me as his brother , and I would not be faithless to him . ”
But King Falfathinn said , “ You killed his grandfather , and that he will avenge upon you . ”
“ Viga - Obivan and I will never fight one another , ” said Anakinn , “ Even if Jothi Gormoarson his ancestor commands him to kill me . ”
And Anakinn jumped out of the ship into the sea , and he held Viga - Obivan ’s cape in one hand , and so dragged him to the beach .
Many men were waiting on the beach .
They stared in amazement , when they saw that the king lived , and that Anakinn the Sky - walker had saved him .
And the king said to this crowd which had assembled there : “ Anakinn the Sky - walker shall be my bodyguard forever , and I will hear no words spoken against him , which I will not avenge . ”
And all these men praised Anakinn much .
But Viga - Obivan wakened and heard the words of King Falfathinn , and he liked them very little .
“ You have become too near to the king , and the Jedi Fjord men do not trust him .
Do not forget that Maul Zabraksson the Red , his retainer , killed Kvaeggan Dukusson , my father , and the man who freed you . ”
“ I have not forgotten this , ” said Anakinn , “ Nor have I forgotten that we two swore an oath to Kvaeggan as he died , that we would avenge him .
But I am now bound to serve the king .
I am his retainer , and I will not draw my swords against him . ”
And Viga - Obivan observed that Anakinn held two swords , Lightsaber the Red , the sword of his grandfather Duku , and Lightsaber the Green , his own sword .
And he said : “ Where is my grandfather Duku ?
You hold his sword , as if it were a war - prize . ”
“ Your grandfather Duku died on the ship , which burned , ” said Anakinn the Sky - walker .
But Viga - Obivan looked upon Anakinn with doubt .
Anakinn said , “ I took the sword which took my hand .
Is that not rightly done ? ”
But Viga - Obivan said : “ You also took my sword . ”
“ This sword I took from you , ” said Anakinn , “ When you would not help your brother , and I helped myself with it .
Now , brother , I will give you back Lightsaber the Green , but I make this condition :
That you will give it to my son , if a son is born to me . ”
“ I shall do so , ” said Viga - Obivan , “ For you have truly become my brother .
But what shall you do with Lightsaber the Red ? ”
“ This sword I take as my own , ” said Anakinn , “ And as recompense for my hand . ”
Anakinn went now to the king ’s hall , but Viga - Obivan bought a boat , and sailed back to the Jedi Fjords .
Chapter 12 : Concerning the Secret Counsel of King Falfathinn
Anakinn dreamed many nights that Queen Pathema seemed to have a child , but died in childbirth .
For this reason he went to the hall of King Falfathinn one evening , while King Falfathinn ate with his retainers and listened to his skalds .
But before Anakinn could tell King Falfathinn of these tidings , Falfathinn said : “ Anakinn , you must know that the Jedi Fjord men want to kill me . ”
“ My lord , ” said Anakinn , “ The Jedi Fjord men are good friends to me ; I would not willingly call them underhanded men .
If they attack You , my lord , they will stand manfully and openly . ”
“ Anakinn , ” said the king , “ Search deeper .
You know that Viga - Obivan hates me , because I had his father killed , but he did not attack me when he knew he had the chance to ambush me on the beach .
Does this seem to you manfully done ?
Yes , search deeper .
It is a great shame which the Jedi Fjord men are planning with their magic . ”
“ My lord , ” said Anakinn , “ The Jedi Fjord men cast their magic openly .
They are not such men as cut runes in the roots in the twilight , but rather they use their magic for prophecy and for healing .
But the Seith - men cast dark spells and dissemble ; and if they give men help , it is only because they expect that they will then help them . ”
But King Falfathinn said , “ Is it not true that the Jedi Fjord men do so ?
Why did Meis Vindusson heal you , if it was not so that you would avail the Jedi Fjord men when they attack me ? ”
Anakinn was silent .
“ You see , my young apprentice , ” said the king , “ And it has been hidden from you that the Seith - men are also healers .
Are you familiar with the story of the powerful Seith - man who was named Plagueis ? ”
“ No , my lord , ” said Anakinn the Sky - walker .
“ That I thought was most likely , ” said the king , “ For no one from the Jedi Fjords would tell you this story .
It is a Seith - story .
Plagueis was a Seith - men , powerful and wise .
So strong was he in the Seith , that he could use his magic to prevent those he loved from dying . ”
Anakinn said : “ Do you speak truly , that he could use magic to save people from death ? ”
King Falfathinn answered : “ Seith is the pathway to magical ability which some consider unnatural .
Plagueis became so mighty , that the only thing he feared was losing his power .
And of course he eventually lost that power .
He had taught his apprentice all his seiðr , but the apprentice killed him in his sleep .
He had learned to save others from death , but not himself . ”
Anakinn said : “ Is it possible for a man to learn this magic ? ”
“ Not from a Jedi Fjord man , ” said King Falfathinn .
“ It is my guess , ” said Anakinn the Sky - walker , “ That you are yourself a Seith - man . ”
“ A king who wants to become wise and wide - ruling , drinks whatever he may from the well of Urth , ” said King Falfathinn , “ But the Jedi Fjord men wish not to drink from the dark waters there .
I know where Odin hid his pledge .
It was not in the clear waters of the well .
And who are kings ?
I am , and Odin , and no man of the Jedi Fjords .
Drink from the dark waters , Anakinn Sky - walker .
Drink thence , and you will become stronger than any Jedi Fjord man is .
It may come to pass , that I will teach you the spell which could save Queen Pathema ’s life . ”
“ What do you know about Queen Pathema ? ” asked Anakinn .
“ Certainly she will die without Seith - healing , ” said the king , “ I have foreseen it .
And the Jedi Fjord men will not help her in this way .
If you want to save the queen – and the child which she bears to you , slave - born as you are , it is I alone who will help you .
In Ireland or in Iceland or even in the Jedi Fjords you would be a laughingstock and an outlaw – the slave who despoiled a queen .
But here I will make you a rich landholder – yes , even a jarl – if you give me that last piece of my kingdom Norway .
And that is the Jedi Fjords . ”
A man in a black cloak stood up now among the retainers , and it was Meis Vindusson .
“ I have heard that you King Falfathinn want to enslave the Jedi Fjords as you have all other regions .
But we will not serve you willingly ” – and he drew his sword thereupon .
King Falfathinn forbade his bodyguards to defend him , though he was an old man , and himself drew a sword .
But finally Meis was stronger , and he disarmed Falfathinn .
Anakinn said : “ It is murder , if you kill an unarmed man . ”
Still Meis Vindusson cut at King Falfathinn .
But the king worked a dark spell , and lightning came from his fingers , so that the sword could not touch him , but Meis Vindusson burned .
King Falfathinn burned also , and his face was melting and becoming disfigured .
“ Anakinn Slave ’s - son , ” said Meis Vindusson , “ We give you a choice .
You can save me or King Falfathinn .
But I alone knew the spell to make you a new silver hand .
And you are an oath - breaker and the worst kind too , if you slay a sworn brother ’s kinsman . ”
“ It is your choice , Lord Anakinn , ” said King Falfathinn , “ Whether you will save me or Meis .
But I alone know the spell to save Queen Pathema ’s life , and you are an oath - breaker and the worst kind too , if you slay your own lord . ”
Anakinn the Sky - walker drew Lightsaber the Red in his silver hand , and killed Meis Vindusson .
Anakinn now fell to his knees , and King Falfathinn laughed .
“ I am an oath - breaker , ” said Anakinn , “ And an outlaw .
I am not worthy of the honor which you give me . ”
“ You are my retainer and my apprentice , and soon you will learn the magic which will save Queen Pathema ’s life , and you yourself will become a lord in Norway . ”
“ I will do only that which you bid of me , my lord , ” said Anakinn the Sky - walker .
“ Good , ” said King Falfathinn .
“ While you were here with me in Koruskantborg , I guess that the intention of the Jedi Fjord men was to send this man here secretly to kill or intimidate me .
They are unmanly , even your sworn brother Viga - Obivan son of Kvaeggan .
Go now to the Jeði Fjords , kill them all , every living thing in those fjords , Lord Anakinn .
Thither will you go a slave ’s son , and thence will you return a lord , and you will learn Seith , and we shall save the life of your queen – and of your royal child . ”
Chapter 13 : Concerning the Great War -March of Anakinn the Sky - walker
Now the saga must turn to Viga - Obivan Kvaeggansson , who came back to the Jedi Fjords , and weary from his journey came into the house of Jothi , his ancestor .
Queen Pathema was there , and with her her retainers , and it was clear to be seen that she was pregnant .
She asked , “ Where is Anakinn ? ”
“ He remained in Koruskantborg , ” said Viga - Obivan .
“ Why did n’t he come back to the Jedi Fjords , where he has allies ?
Is he not obligated to us both ? ” said Queen Pathema .
But Viga - Obivan said , “ I do n’t know why you say , ‘ to us both . ’
But he has sworn oaths of faithfulness to King Falfathinn .
He has become a retainer of the king , and he has taken the good sword of my grandfather Duku as his own . ”
“ You speak wrongly , ” said Queen Pathema , “ Why do you believe that you are permitted to say such lies ? ”
“ Queen Pathema , ” said Viga - Obivan Kvaeggansson , “ I heard him swear these oaths to King Falfathinn .
I doubt that he would refuse the commands of the king , even if the king should order him to kill Jedi Fjord men . ”
And Queen Pathema said , “ What happened then to Meis Vindusson , who went to Koruskantborg when you and Anakinn did not come back ?
He believed that you two had been slain by King Falfathinn , and he went there with his army and would avenge you . ”
“ I did not know that he made this journey , ” said Viga - Obivan , “ And I am returned late because I fought along the way with the berserk named Grivus .
I slew that great berserk , but he wielded four swords at a time , and I could not bite him with my sword .
With a bow I slew him at last , but I do not boast of this battle ; he was the better man .
And he broke my boat , and I was constrained to walk the rest of the way . ”
When he had said these words , a messenger came to the doors of the house .
Jothi Gormoarsson asked what he would say .
The messenger said that many warriors were coming , and that they slew all that lived , even livestock and children .
Viga - Obivan asked who led this army .
The messenger said that it was a tall man , “ And he was in a black cape and a black helm , and one of his hands was made of silver . ”
Viga - Obivan said , “ Queen Pathema , let us now leave Norway .
Why do you delay ?
I see that your ship is in the fjord .
Did you never intend to go back to your kingdom in Ireland , where your child will grow up befittingly ?
Why do you delay now , when you have already delayed here too long ? ”
But Queen Pathema was silent .
“ You have never gone back to your kingdom , ” Viga - Obivan pressed on , “ After many years in the Faroes and then in Norway , and these did not profit you .
Why do you sit here and not go back ?
Come with us and live in your kingdom with your living child .
If you stay here , you will die , and the infant inside you as well .
Why will you not say , yea or nay ?
Anakinn comes and with him death .
He is the king ’s man .
He will kill you and the child ! ”
Queen Pathema wept , but did not speak .
Viga - Obivan looked upon her with doubt , and said , “ Anakinn is the father .
Or is he not ? ”
Queen Pathema remained silent .
Now Viga - Obivan spoke to her retainers , saying , “ Make her ship ready for a journey to Iceland ; the queen will soon be in labor , and I do n’t expect that we can get to Ireland soon . ”
But the ship was already prepared ; Queen Pathema had intended to go to Ireland when Anakinn came back .
Now Jothi and Viga - Obian went aboard a ship of Jothi’s ; that ship was prepared , but not so long as for a trip to Iceland .
“ But we must land the ship , as I had earlier intended , on Dagoba in the Faroes , ” said Jothi , “ And you take provisions and water there , but I will remain on Dagoba .
I do not desire to go to Ireland with the queen .
Anakinn will eventually go there , and this old man does not wish to see his son ’s killer again . ”
And Viga - Obivan weighed anchor , and behind him the retainers of Pathema .
Pathema ’s ship was already on the point of launching when she finally came aboard , and she wept still .
And on his ship , Jothi went soon under deck , and did not see when Anakinn the sky - walker rode along the fjord road , and he called to Queen Pathema .
“ I see your ship , ” said Anakinn the sky - walker , “ But why do you go , or where ? ”
“ Viga - Obivan gave me an account of your terrible misdeeds , ” said Queen Pathema .
“ What deeds were these ? ” asked Anakinn .
Queen Pathema said , “ He told me that you had become a Seith - man , that you serve King Falfathinn who oppresses my country , and that he bade you kill all people and living things in the Jedi Fjords , even children .
And I Queen Pathema bear your child , Anakinn Sky - walker ! ”
And men wondered when they heard this , for it was well - known that Anakinn the sky - walker was a freedman .
Anakinn said , “ Viga - Obivan wants to turn you against me , because I killed his grandfather . ”
Queen Pathema said , “ He loves you as a brother , and he has treated me well , and he wants to help us both . ”
But Anakinn laughed .
“ What gain is there in him ?
Seith - magic alone will save you , Pathema .
I have sworn my oaths of faithfulness to King Falfathinn for your sake and for the child ’s – so that you both can live , and live royally , which befits you .
The king has foreseen that you will die in Iceland if you go with Viga - Obivan .
Do not betray me , Pathema .
I was born a slave , but I have become a jarl – and at last I can , as a jarl , ask formally for your hand . ”
“ No , Anakinn , ” said Queen Pathema , “ Come with me , and help me raise our child in Ireland .
Escape now !
It will be too late for you afterwards . ”
“ Do you not understand ? ” said Anakinn the sky - walker , “ Why do you flee from Norway , when I have become powerful in Norway , and Norway itself has become peaceful through me ?
And after this rebellion against the king is extinguished , and Seith - magic has saved you , why should I dabble in dark magic longer ?
We shall set it aside , and we shall rule Norway , yes and Ireland too ! ”
But what Queen Pathema said in reply , Anakinn the sky - walker could not hear , for her ship had sailed too far .
Anakinn was filled with anger at Queen Pathema , for it seemed to him that she was faithless , and followed Viga - Obivan out of malice or stupidity .
And because he had become a great Seith - sorceror , he stretched out his silver hand , and made as if he were choking her .
And on her ship , she fell to the deck in a swoon , as if strangled , and all men wondered seeing this sorcery , for no one was touching her .
Chapter 14 : Concerning the Children of Queen Pathema , and Her Death
Queen Pathema and the others reached Iceland early one morning .
The queen had become sick and weak since Anakinn the Sky - walker had used Seith - magic to choke her .
And when Iceland became visible from the ship , there was a great hailstorm on the land , and a volcanic eruption to the north ; there was a great fall of ash as well .
Then a fierce southwester kicked up , and a tidal flux against it , and the weather became hard in the fjord , as it often can be ; it concluded with Pathema ’s ship sinking under her .
Viga - Obivan Kvaeggansson had landed earlier , and he saw from the beach that Queen Pathema was in a shipwreck , and he swam to her and with difficulty brought her back to the shore along with some few of her retainers .
And screaming there on the sand she gave birth to twins , a son and a daughter .
The children were sprinkled with water and given names , and the girl was called Leia , but the boy Lukr .
Viga - Obian asked , whether she wanted Anakinn the Sky - walker to know that he was the father of these two children , for “ I suspect that he would not continue to serve King Falfathinn , nor harry in Ireland , if he knew that he was the father of these Irish nobles .
But it is likely that King Falfathinn would have these children killed as soon as possible , if he thought that it could be done and knew where they were to be found .
Unlucky young children !
Your father obeys the man who would be your murderer .
But if Anakinn slew Meis Vindusson , the man who helped him most , what would he do if Falfathinn the king bade him slay these children ?
Never did such regal children have such an ill father . ”
But Queen Pathema gave no heed to Viga - Obivan .
She kissed the children , and then she said : “ I was worst to him that I most loved . ”
And she died in the sand .
Near the beach they raised a mound over Queen Pathema .
But now men did not know what should be done with the children .
Viga - Obivan wanted Oinn Kleggsson to raise the children , a man who was related to them , for he was the son of the same mother as Anakinn the Sky - walker .
But the Irish retainers wanted to bring the children up in Thithborg in the Aldiran districts in Ireland , among their regal family .
“ But first we must find other women who are in milk , ” said Viga - Obivan Kvaeggansson , “ Or the children will soon die .
And the road is long to the Tattuin River Valley , or other districts which I know well . ”
“ But we have with us one woman who is currently in milk , and she is one of Queen Pathema ’s ladies in waiting , ” said Beilorgana , a retainer of Pathema ’s , “ We will take one of the children with her back to Ireland . ”
“ You do n’t have a ship , ” said Viga - Obivan Kvaeggansson .
“ We will take your ship , ” said Beilorgana , “ And Anakinn the Sky - walker will hear the news , that your ship has left Iceland , and he will never seek you and the child on Iceland .
But one of the children will remain in Ireland in the Aldiran districts , and many good warriors are there . ”
“ I have heard tell of the Aldiran districts , ” said Viga - Obivan , “ And men say that it is a peaceful land , and one without weapons .
And I myself was often near there on viking expeditions with my father Kvaeggan when he still lived ; I do n’t remember any good warriors .
But I will agree with this plan for the sake of the boy , and he shall dwell here on Iceland with his Norse family . ”
“ It is very important , ” said Beilorgana , “ That the child not know that he is the son of Anakinn the Sky - walker .
And that no one in the land know , unless it be his foster father . ”
“ Of course , ” said Viga - Obivan , “ No one will accuse me of unwatchfulness .
Do as you like with the girl – I hold the prophesied avenger of my family .
But let this boy have a big drink of milk first , because I have a long way to walk to get to the Tattuin River Valley . ”
After the boy had drunk much , Viga - Obivan Kvaeggansson took him in his arms .
Long did he walk west , till he came at last to the Tattuin River Valley , and he saw the volcanic eruption to his north .
At Moisture Farm he lay the boy on the threshold one night , and Oinn Kleggsson came outside .
He asked what boy this was .
“ He is the son of your brother Anakinn , ” said Viga - Obivan , “ And he is named Lukr .
He will need milk .
And I suggest that you not tell him about his father , and it would probably be best if he thought his father dead . ”
“ And where are you going in the storm and the ash ? ” asked Oinn .
“ I am going northward toward the volcano , ” said Viga - Obian , “ And I foresee that his father shall come meet me there . ”
And Viga - Obivan Kvaeggansson disappeared into the shadows .
Chapter 15 : Concerning the Battle at the Volcano
Now it must be told , when Anakinn the Sky - walker wanted to search for Pathema and Viga - Obivan , he left for Iceland , and nothing is told of his journey before he reached Iceland .
When he came to the shore , he saw where a ship was weighing anchor , and he recognized this ship .
“ There sails Viga - Obivan Kvaeggansson , ” he said , “ On his ship , and doubtless he wants to lead me away from my pregnant wife . ”
And he sent men to the ship , and egged them on to an attack .
“ And I want , ” said Anakinn , “ For you to kill all the men , but let the women and children live .
And I shall go on land and there look for my wife . ”
Anakinn the Sky - walker did so , and saw a burial mound raised near the sand there .
He became angry , and ridiculed very much this great thrall - work , saying that no man but one truly slave - born would choose to be buried in the sand .
He trampled upon the mound and kicked it , and spat in the sand there .
“ I do n’t like sand , ” he said .
And he disappeared into the shadows .
*
Anakinn the Sky - walker went on to the Tattuin River Valley , and saw there that Moisture Farm was empty , and that the people had only recently fled , for there was a great lava flow burning nearby .
He turned now out of the house , and saw there Viga - Obivan Kvaeggansson .
“ You liar ! ” said Anakinn the Sky - walker .
“ You betrayer and trickster !
That was your ship that I saw , but you led my wife on to it , and awaited me here where I would seek for her .
You turned her against me ! ”
“ You yourself turned her against yourself , ” said Viga - Obivan , “ You have let King Falfathinn deceive you , till you have become the slave of the man whom you swore to kill . ”
“ Do not mock me ; I have not forgotten my oaths , ” said Anakinn , “ But I have sworn new oaths , so that I can save my wife , and secure my new kingdom . ”
“ Your new kingdom ? ” asked Viga - Obivan .
“ I will kill you , Viga - Obivan , ” said Anakinn , “ If you mock me further .
But I do not want to forget our brotherhood , and I will let you live if you swear oaths of fealty to King Falfathinn . ”
But Viga - Obivan said , “ Anakinn , I have sworn oaths to my family –to the old way . ”
“ If you are not with me , ” said Anakinn , “ You are my enemy . ”
“ Only Seith - men make enemies out of their brothers , ” said Viga - Obivan , “ But I will defend myself , even against my brother . ”
“ You will try , ” said Anakinn .
He drew Lightsaber the Red , and Viga - Obivan drew Lightsaber the Green .
Long did they fight , and the lava burned around them all the while , and the ash fell upon them and choked them , and neither got an advantage on the other , and each fought with utmost ferocity .
Their battle was both hard and long , but it ended when Viga - Obivan cut Anakinn on the right thigh , so that almost all the muscle was hewn out , and Anakinn fell nearly into the lava and was unable to fight further .
Anakinn the Sky - walker attempted to pull himself away from the lava , but his clothes began to burn , and soon he began to burn too .
He said to Viga - Obivan , “ I hate you ! ”
“ You were my brother , Anakinn ! ” said Viga - Obivan Kvaeggansson .
“ I loved you ! ”
But he turned away from Anakinn and walked off , and Anakinn the Sky - walker burned in silence .
Chapter 16 : Concerning the Greatest Evil Deed of King Falfathinn
In the winter King Falfathinn learned that Anakinn the Sky - walker had died on Iceland , and he went there with his army and found Anakinn alive under a great heap of ash .
Anakinn the Sky - walker had lost his feet and arms , and his face was burnt and bloody .
He could not talk , for his tongue was burnt , and yet he had his teeth still and had used them to hunt mice and birds .
With his Seith - magic he had survived , but he did not know the Seith - spell that would allow him to grow new limbs .
Still King Falfathinn praised Anakinn ’s Seith - magic and his courage , for he had been bitten by sword and by fire and yet had lived many months .
“ Fittingly have I named you Anakinn the Seith - jarl , ” said King Falfaðinn , “ For you have lived by virtue of the Seith - magic that you learned from me , even though you have no limbs . ”
But many of the soldiers of Falfathinn mocked Anakinn , calling him Veithr - Anakinn ( Hunt - Anakinn ) , because they thought it laughable that he had hunted mice with his teeth .
But though Anakinn could not talk , he cast a Seith - spell and choked one of Falfaðinn ’s soldiers from afar .
The soldiers feared this man who could strangle a man whom he did not touch , but King Falfathinn praised him the more , and called him the greatest of Seith - men .
King Falfathinn had a stone of healing , and he brought forth the stone before Anakinn ; then he healed Anakinn , and new limbs grew upon his body , shaped by the magic of Falfathinn from the cold black lava .
But his face was badly scarred and burnt , and his lungs and eyes had been destroyed by smoke .
King Falfathinn did not know the Seith - spell that would grow a new tongue or lungs or eyes , and thus he crafted a great helm , which is called the Awe - helm , and that helm was like a raven - black skull , and with it there was a raven - black cape .
And with that helm upon his head , Anakinn might breathe and speak and see , but his voice was strangely changed , no longer fair but dark and thunderous , and each breath that he took was as audible and resounding as a great breaker upon a longship .
Anakinn the Sky - walker lay still upon the earth with his new limbs .
But when Anakinn could move , King Falfathinn gave him in earnest that name which the soldiers had given him in mockery , and he said : “ Rise , Veithr . ”
Veithr rose and took a breath , and when the soldiers heard his voice , it seemed to them as if the thunder rolled , and they all quailed .
“ Jarl Veithr , ” said King Falfaðinn , “ Can you hear me ? ”
“ Yes , master , ” said Veithr , and then he asked : “ Where is Pathema ? ”
“ This should not be concealed from you , my friend , ” said King Falfathinn , “ You dealt her death blow to her when , in your anger , you strangled her upon her ship with Seith - magic ; your good fortune has departed from you . ”
But Veithr was silent .

As I ’ve alluded to before , the manuscript upon which the sequentially later chapters of Tattúínárdǿla saga are preserved is actually older than the manuscript which preserves the first sixteen chapters by about two decades , while the action in these chapters picks up about two decades later than that of the earlier chapters .
And while the manuscript with the earlier chapters appears to have been written by a single scribe who had an imperfect knowledge of the story underlying the saga , the later chapters can be confidently assigned , on paleographic evidence , to three separate scribes , each with a quite different , though detailed , command of the tradition behind the saga .
It is not always , however , clear that these three scribes worked together closely , as for instance Scribe A ( responsible for the first third of this manuscript ) seems hardly to have been aware that Leia was Lúkr ’s sister , and even shows ignorance – or at best imperfect foreshadowing – of Veidi - Anakinn ’s identity as Lúkr ’s father .
The manuscript as preserved does have chapter headings , and even the first leaf of the best manuscript is headed “ XVII .
Kapítuli ” – “ Chapter 17 . ”
This suggests that these earlier scribes were aware that sixteen earlier chapters of the saga had once existed , but they were apparently unaware of the contents of those chapters , a hypothesis which is supported by the fact that numerous important characters and events in the earlier chapters are never mentioned again .
Chapter 17 , despite its explicit numbering as seventeenth , opens like the very first chapter of a new saga , and the following chapters essentially assume no prior knowledge of the earlier sixteen chapters , indeed relying on the reader ’s ignorance of the content of those chapters in setting up Veidi - Anakinn as the archenemy of his own son , Lúkr .
With that being said , Chapter 17 is commonly held by critics to mark a watershed moment in the saga as a literary construction , and it is chiefly the contents of these later chapters that are quoted and alluded to in later Icelandic literature .
Whoever the three scribes were who recorded it for us around the year 1200 , they have left us with an imperfect , but enduring and timeless saga of mythic proportions .

Chapter 17 : Concerning Hani the Duelist
It is the beginning of this saga , that King Jabbi the Stout ruled over Denmark , and King Falfadinn Lightning - Bolt over Norway , and there was great enmity between them .
Hani was the name of a man from a Norwegian family ; he was the son of Jarl Sóló .
He was a good man and a great viking ; most called him Hólmgöngu - Hani ( Hani the Duelist ) .
It is fitting to say something about the appearance of Hani .
He was a man of few words , rather reserved , but the handsomest of men , tall and rather sun-browned , with brownish hair .
Because Hani the Duelist did not like the reign of King Falfadinn , he went to Denmark and was with King Jabbi for a while ; in the summer he went out on viking raids , and he often did great damage to the lands and ships of King Falfadinn ; he raided widely here and there , wherever he came to land in Norway .
And in the winter he gave to King Jabbi the wares that he got in Norway .
King Jabbi liked this tribute very well , and he gave Hani a great axe , and this axe was jagged - pointed and gilded , with a shaft done in silver , and it was the greatest of treasures .
Hani had another great treasure , and that was his ship , which he had gotten when he won a swimming race against Landó Kalrissiansson at Kessel Island .
This ship was called the Thousand Year Falcon ; it was the fastest of ships .
A Frisian man accompanied Hólmgöngu - Hani ; he was named Tsiubakka .
He was the hairiest of men and very big , he had blackish - brown hair and was rather chubby - faced and broad across the brows .
Tsiubakka did not know how to speak Norse , but he understood what men said , and Hani spoke Frisian .
One time it so happened that Hani had raided in Norway , and when he was ready to put out to sea , some Norwegian chieftains rode up in that place .
They asked who these men were and where they came from .
“ I am named Hani Sólósson , ” said Hani , “ Some call me Hani the Duelist .
And this follower of mine is a Frisian man named Tsiubakka .
We have come here from Denmark and we are merchants . ”
“ If you really are merchants , ” said a chieftain , “ Then you will have wares on your ship which you will want to sell , and we will want to buy , and let us see your cargo . ”
These men went up on the ship , and they found many treasures which Hani and Tsiubakka had stolen from them .
They took these , and they wanted to kill Hólmgöngu - Hani .
“ Do not kill him , ” said the first chieftain , “ For I knew him from the beginning , and I knew his father .
He is no friend of King Falfadinn , and neither are we .
But we shall take all these wares which he has stolen , and we shall not pay him . ”
But since it was getting toward autumn , and Hani had no loot to give to King Jabbi , he hastened as swiftly as possible to Iceland and there thought to avoid the wrath of King Jabbi , till he could acquire some kind of tribute which he could deliver to the king .
A man was named Vattó , an old man and short , but a good farmer and a relative of Hani ’s on his mother ’s side .
He lived on Iceland , at the farm called Mósæsli ; Hólmgöngu - Hani stayed there that winter .
There were also many other robbers and outlaws who were staying as guests at Mósæsli , for Vattó was himself an exile and had no love for kings .
Some have even said that his farm was the most wretched hive of scum and villainy .
*
A man was named Grídó , a retainer of King Jabbi ; he did not like Hani and he coveted his ship .
And when he learned that Hani had had his plunder stolen from him and had gone to Iceland , he asked the king : “ Do you like the plunder which Hólmgöngu - Hani brings you , king ? ”
“ I like it well , ” said King Jabbi .
“ Then you would really like it , ” said Grídó , “ If you had all of that which you own , but as it stands you have far from it .
It is the much greater part , which Hani keeps to himself .
He sends you as a gift three bearskins , but I know for certain that he keeps thirty of them to himself , which you own , and I think that the same must be true of other things .
But now I have learned that he has gone to Iceland with a great deal of property which he intends to sell there , and you own all of that .
Truly , king , if you gave me his good ship , I would bring you more plunder . ”
And everything that Grídó said about Hani , his companions bore witness to .
It came to the point that King Jabbi was at his angriest .
“ Bring me , ” said King Jabbi , “ the ship , and everything that is on it , and kill Hólmgöngu - Hani Sólósson and Tsiubakka the Frisian , if they refuse to come before me . ”
Chapter 18 : Concerning Leia and the Sons of Dítú
A woman was named Leia ; she was the daughter of Beilorgana , king of the Aldiran Regions in Ireland .
Relations were cool between Beilorgana and Falfadinn , for Falfadinn , King of Norway , claimed to be King of Ireland as well , and he raided widely in the Aldiran Regions .
There were many chieftains in many lands who greatly disliked King Falfadinn , but did not like Jabbi , King of the Danes , either .
Many went to new lands , to the Faroes or to Iceland or to the Hebrides or to the Orkneys or to the Shetlands .
But the army of Falfadinn was great , and he had many large warships , and he raided the lands of those who would not acknowledge his absolute authority .
He had many good men killed , and others he enslaved .
He was a very unpopular king .
And because King Falfadinn wanted to intimidate all who stood against him , he ordered the greatest ship which men had ever seen upon the sea to be built , and that ship held such a store of men and weapons that they could pillage an entire large city .
And a name was given to that ship , and it was called Daudastjarna ( Death - Star ) .
A man was named Thrípíó Dítússon ; he was an Irish man and a priest .
And because Ireland was a Christian land , and Thrípíó knew many languages , he went to Norway , in Koruskantborg , and wished to teach men the true faith .
There he met his brother , Artú Dítússon , who had been a slave to Víga - Óbívan Kvæggansson of the Jedi Fjord family in Iceland .
And because he had long been among heathen men , Artú himself had become heathen .
Artú Dítússon disliked his enslavement , but he liked King Falfadinn the less because he had ordered Kvæggan Dúkússon killed , and Kvæggan had promised that he would free Artú from his enslavement .
But the son of Kvæggan , Víga - Óbívan , who survived , did not wish to free Artú , and Artú had become a free man only after Víga - Óbívan hastened back to Iceland one time and left Artú in Norway .
Artú Dítússon was a skilled carpenter and smith , and because of this talent the rumor of this skilled freedman soon reached King Falfadinn , who bade Artú counsel him in shipbuilding ; the king did not know that Artú hated him intensely .
And it was Artú ’s advice that the king should have a great dragon - head built on the Death - Star , hollow inside , and that it should be filled with ale , and Artú said that this would be a sacrifice to Rán ( Norse sea goddess ) .
And King Falfadinn said that Artú was a wise man , for he wanted to protect the great ship from the wrath of this goddess .
And when he had given this advice , Artú went back to Ireland with his brother , and told all this to King Beilorgana .
King Beilorgana suspected that King Falfadinn would want to attack the Aldiran Regions with this ship , and King Beilorgana wanted to ask the Shetlanders to help him .
But “ Because King Falfadinn rules the sea with his great navy , I will send my daughter , and some monks with her , and King Falfadinn will not suspect that I am sending them in order to incite the Shetlanders against him . ”
A man was named Veidi-Anakinn or Veidr .
He was a retainer of Falfadinn and captain of his army ; he was a very overbearing man , but comported himself well , and he was a great sorcerer .
None saw his face , for he always had a great raven - black helmet upon his head , and with it a raven - black mask upon his face and a raven - black cape .
Veidi-Anakinn was not a talkative man , but when he spoke , his voice was awesome and dim , and every one of his breaths was as audible and as resounding as the greatest storm .
Most men called him Veidr , but all feared him , and he could cast a spell that made men fall to the earth in anguish , even though Veidr did not touch them .
Veidr learned that Artú Dítússon had advised the ship - building in Koruskantborg , and he thought that this was ill news , for he remembered that Artú had been the slave of the Jedi Fjord men , his enemies .
And when he learned that Artú was on the ship of King Beilorgana and made for Shetland , he suspected that Artú must have given King Falfadinn some kind of bad advice .
Veidr sailed his ship Stjörnufreki ( Star - Destroyer ) and sought this ship , and found it off of Iceland .
His men went up on that ship , and there was a hard battle .
Princess Leia saw that the Irish were losing the battle , and she bade Artú and Thrípíó swim to the shore and there seek Víga - Óbívan Kvæggansson , if he still lived .
She gave Artú a message that he should give to Víga - Óbívan ; it was written in runes .
There were small boats on that ship , which hung from the stern ; Princess Leia cut one of these loose , and the sons of Dítú swam under it .
One of Veidr ’s warriors saw this boat , and said , “ There sails another boat . ”
“ Do n’t shoot it , ” said another soldier , “ There are no living things aboard .
It must have been a stray axe blow that cut it loose . ”
Chapter 19 : Concerning the Sons of Dítú and Lúkr Anakinsson
Thrípíó and Artú Dítússon came ashore on Iceland near the Tattúín River Valley ; there was a great deal of lava , for a volcano had erupted twenty years before , and there was much sand also , for the high tide was extreme in the Tattúín Fjord .
Thrípíó became angry .
“ What kind of deserted place is this ? ” he asked , “ And probably no Christian men either , I guess . ”
“ There are Christian men on Iceland , ” said Artú , “ But they are mostly slaves .
Follow me and let us find Víga - Óbívan Kvæggansson as soon as possible ; his farm was nearby here .
Still it is most likely that he is dead . ”
“ I do n’t want to follow you , ” said Thrípíó .
Artú asked where he would rather go .
“ Where you are n’t going , ” said Thrípíó , “ For it is your fault that I am on this dangerous journey , and I would rather find some merchants who are going to Ireland or Norway .
The devil take you and your heathen friend Víga - Óbívan . ”
“ I do n’t believe that you have spoken in a Christian fashion , ” said Artú , “ But it is your decision .
Still I shall seek Víga - Óbívan , though relations are cool between us .
But I think that it ’s most likely that the devil will take you , if you go the other way all on your own ; there are many Icelanders who would want to enslave or kill an Irish man and Christian . ”
“ But it will still be your fault , ” said Thrípíó , “ If I am slain . ”
“ He is not to blame , who warns another , ” said Artú .
*
Thrípíó walked a long time and saw neither man nor cattle .
Finally he saw some men riding ; he greeted them , but they did not greet him .
They bound him and led him to their tents ; there Thrípíó saw Artú Dítússon , his brother , and the brothers were glad to meet .
Many thralls , men and women , were in these tents – they had captured by the sons of Javi , malicious robbers ; the oldest of them was named Útíni .
A man was named Óinn ; he was the son of Kléggr .
Óinn was tall , with wolf - gray hair and thick , but he had begun to bald early .
With him was his brother ’s young son , who was named Lúkr Anakinsson ; Óinn said that his brother Anakinn was dead .
Lúkr was a big man , with light - brown hair and a broad reddish face , the noblest of men .
Lúkr wanted to go on viking expeditions and raids , but Óinn forbade him that .
Óinn and Lúkr were looking at the thralls .
Óinn saw the brown clothes of Thrípíó and said , “ You must be a priest . ”
“ You are correct , good sir , ” said Thrípíó , “ And I speak many languages .
I can speak Irish , Norse , English , Latin , French , German , Welsh -”
“ Shut up , ” said Óinn , “ What I need is a thrall who speaks Scottish . ”
“ Scottish ? ” asked Thrípíó , “ Good sir , I am an Irishman , and the Irish tongue is much like the Scottish .
Scottish is like my mother - tongue , even though all languages are like my mother - tongue , because I rejoice in languages -”
“ Shut up , ” said Óinn .
He told the robbers that he wanted to buy this man – “ And do you have any good and skillful workmen ? ”
Útíni Javason said that the red - haired man was a very skillful workman ; Óinn bought this man also .
Óinn said to Lúkr , “ Take these men home and prepare them for work as soon as possible . ”
Lúkr said then , “ But I wanted to go to Taki Farm , where there are going to be horse - fights tonight . ”
“ You can play at the horse fights with the other boys some other day , ” said Óinn , “ Take these men home to Vatnabǿr ( Water - Farm ) . ”
But the red - haired man walked slowly , and finally fell to the ground .
Lúkr saw that he was covered with sores .
“ Uncle Óinn , ” he said , “ This red - haired man is sick . ”
Óinn was extremely angry ; he drew his sword and wanted to cut at Útíni Javason .
But Thrípíó said to Lúkr , “ Good sir , the short man there is very skillful with wood and iron ; we have been enslaved together before .
And he would be cheaper than before , if Útíni Javason fears the wrath of your uncle . ”
This short man was Artú Dítússon , his brother .
“ Uncle Óinn , ” said Lúkr , “ Buy this short man . ”
Óinn did so , and the sons of Dítú followed Lúkr Anakinsson home .
“ Do n’t forget this , ” said Thrípíó to his brother , “ And why did I save you ?
You ’re as heathen as they are . ”
Chapter 20 : Concerning the Message of Princess Leia
At Water - Farm Thrípío took a bath , and was very glad for it ; he praised God and the holy Bishop Patrick .
But Lúkr Anakinsson complained about his Uncle Óinn .
“ He is unfair , ” said Lúkr , “ My friend Biggs spoke truly : I will never get out of Iceland . ”
Thrípíó heard his words and asked , “ Can I help you , good sir ? ”
“ Definitely , ” said Lúkr , “ If your Christ has given you the power to speed up time or to grant me wings so that I can fly off of this rock . ”
“ No , good sir , ” said Thrípíó , “ I am a priest and no wizard .
And I must admit that I do n’t know where I am in Iceland . ”
Lúkr said , “ If there is a valley in Iceland where one might see a fair hillside , shining fields , and a freshly - mown yard – you ’re in the valley that it ’s furthest from . ”
“ I see , good sir , ” said Thrípíó .
But Lúkr said , “ I am named Lúkr Anakinsson . ”
“ I am named Thrípíó Dítússon , and this man is my brother Artú , ” said Thrípíó .
“ Your clothes are very bloody , ” observed Lúkr , “ Were you in a fight ? ”
Thrípíó said , “ We were on a ship when a battle broke out .
But we ourselves are no warriors . ”
But Lúkr took
Artú ’s bloody cape and there found the message written by Princess Leia .
He began to read it .
“ I am no runemaster , ” he said , “ But these words say , ‘ Help me , Víga - Óbívan Kvæggansson ; you alone would dare to avenge me . ’
I do n’t know how to read any more words , because they are written poorly and hastily .
What is this ? ”
Artú pretended not to speak Norse , and asked in Irish , “ What is what ? ”
“ What is what ? ” responded Thrípíó , “ That was a question .
What was written on that message which Princess Leia gave you ? ”
“ That ’s nothing , ” said Artú , “ An old message .
I think that Princess Leia is long dead . ”
Thrípíó translated his words into Norse .
“ Who is Princess
